0,"CHANDLER, Ariz. — Hannah O’Sullivan dipped her toe in professional golf, and the next thing she knew she was being carried by a swift current away from college and toward the L.P.G.A. The same white-knuckle course had deposited others like Cristie Kerr, Morgan Pressel, Paula Creamer, Lexi Thompson and Lydia Ko into the shallow pool of major winners. But as O’Sullivan hurtled toward a pro career, she did something considered radical in today’s carpe-diem sports culture. She abruptly changed courses, withdrawing from L.P.G.A. qualifying school last fall and renewing her commitment to attend college. Like a swimmer caught in a riptide, O’Sullivan relaxed and floated back to shore. In the midst of a gap year before entering Duke, O’Sullivan, 18, will compete in the women’s first major tournament of the season, the ANA Inspiration, which begins Thursday in Rancho Mirage, Calif. At last year’s event, she tied for 65th to share low amateur honors with Albane Valenzuela of Stanford. In a climate where the women’s top player, Ko, first reached No. 1 at age 17 and the average age of the players in the top 10 is 24, O’Sullivan’s refusal to put a full-time golf career ahead of a college experience sets her apart. It is as distinctive as her historic Symetra Tour victory a few months before her 17th birthday and her United States Women’s Amateur championship a few months later. “There’s so many people out on tour right now who are obviously doing super well at 17 or 18 years old,” said O’Sullivan, whose first name is pronounced HAH-nah. “But I realized for me a college experience is really important, and I didn’t really see the reason to push past that.” O’Sullivan was speaking during a break in an afternoon hitting session at Whirlwind Golf Club, near her home in the Phoenix suburbs. It was three days after she missed the cut in her first competition in several months, the L.P.G.A. Founders Cup in Phoenix, and the temperature had climbed into the mid-90s. At the start of her practice, O’Sullivan was the only person at the back of the spacious range.

1,"HONG KONG — As China looks to spread its economic influence around the world, it is taking a bigger interest in financial companies, a move that could raise scrutiny in the era of President Trump. In the latest deal, CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, agreed on Wednesday to buy a stake in a century-old New York boutique investment bank, the Cowen Group. For Cowen, the deal brings an injection of cash and debt financing and the promise of better access to the Chinese market. CEFC gets a ready-made springboard into high finance in the United States. It is the latest example of surging amounts of Chinese investment targeting overseas companies, especially American ones. Chinese firms made 173 deals targeting American businesses in 2016, according to data compiled by the research firm Dealogic, for a total value of $67.8 billion, more than the total for the six previous years. But the strategy is not a sure bet. Previous attempts by Chinese companies to penetrate American financial services have come under regulatory scrutiny or struggled to generate hoped-for financial returns, though Cowen’s chairman, Peter Cohen, said he viewed his deal as “pretty benign” from a regulatory standpoint. A decade ago, the China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, bought a stake in Morgan Stanley, a deal that signaled a shift in the investment strategy of organizations with links to the Chinese government away from domestic acquisitions to overseas purchases.

2,"NEWARK — Two former allies of Gov. Chris Christie were sentenced to prison on Wednesday for their role in closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political payback against a New Jersey mayor, a key chapter in the plot that derailed Mr. Christie’s presidential aspirations and then dimmed his chances to become President Trump’s pick for vice president. Bridget Anne Kelly, 44, who was a top aide to Mr. Christie, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, while Bill Baroni, 45, who served as deputy executive director at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was sentenced to two years in prison. The scandal, which became known as Bridgegate, was as brazen as it was bizarre. In an effort to punish Mayor Mark J. Sokolich of Fort Lee, a Democrat, for not supporting Mr. Christie’s re-election bid and his desire to cultivate bipartisan support ahead of a presidential run, members of the governor’s administration schemed with Port Authority officials to trigger a massive traffic jam in Fort Lee. Over five days in September 2013, the gridlock ensnared emergency vehicles, school buses and commuters, even as Mr. Baroni ignored Mr. Sokolich’s messages seeking an explanation. The plan was put into motion by Ms. Kelly’s now infamous email to David Wildstein, Mr. Baroni’s top deputy at the Port Authority, who pleaded guilty for his role in the scandal in 2015: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” The seven-week trial last fall of Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly revealed Mr. Christie’s aggressive political operation, which seemed as focused on carving a path to the White House as it was on the needs of New Jersey. While Mr. Christie was never charged in the scandal, Judge Susan D. Wigenton alluded to the political culture his administration created on Wednesday as she handed down her sentences against Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly at the federal courthouse in Newark, calling it a toxic “with us or against us” mentality detrimental to New Jersey residents.

3,"Shortly after hundreds of students at Texas A&M University protested an appearance in December by Richard Spencer, a leading white supremacist, administrators there revisited its policy for hosting speakers on its campus. The task was not easy. The university expressed support for free speech, while emphasizing that Mr. Spencer’s remarks — at one point he said that America “belongs to white men” — did not reflect its values, said Amy B. Smith, a university spokeswoman. It also had to consider the extra burden of security costs. Eventually, Texas A&M settled on a new policy: All speakers must now be sponsored by a student, faculty member or organization affiliated with the university. The rule would have affected Mr. Spencer’s appearance, which was arranged by a private citizen who had paid about $3,000 to rent space at a student center. “We certainly don’t want to be affiliated with this guy,” Ms. Smith said in a telephone interview in which she declined to mention Mr. Spencer by name. “You are either for free speech or you are not, but with this person it was jarring because everything he stands for is against our core values, and we don’t want that reflected on our university in any way.” The new policy, posted on the university’s website in February and reported by CNN last week, is intended to give students or other groups affiliated with the university priority when assigning facilities. If the university is going to incur security and overtime costs associated with controversial speakers, Ms. Smith said, at least it will be for its own students. “We are not an American Legion hall,” she said. The university, a state institution with about 66,000 students located in College Station in east-central Texas, is not alone. In interviews, officials at a half dozen higher education institutions say they are taking steps to address the consequences of allowing provocative speakers amid heightened awareness of racial, ethnic, religious and diversity issues after the election of Donald J. Trump. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/texas-aandm-speaking-policy-richard-spencer.html?searchResultPosition=84
4,"A Chinese company with ownership ties to some of the Communist Party’s leading families has ended talks to invest billions of dollars in a Manhattan office tower owned by the family of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a senior White House aide. The Chinese financial conglomerate, Anbang Insurance Group, and the Kushner Companies “mutually agreed to end talks regarding the property,” a Kushner Companies spokesman said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. The development came days after Democratic lawmakers wrote letters to the Office of White House Counsel and Treasury Secretary, expressing concern that the possible deal could breach federal ethics rules, and as Mr. Trump is preparing to meet Xi Jinping, China’s president, for their first summit at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The possible $4-billion deal between the two companies, first reported by The New York Times in January, would have paired a company led by a man who married the granddaughter of China’s late paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, with the family company of Mr. Kushner, a principal White House adviser on foreign affairs, including China policy. Any deal faced headwinds on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. In the United States, it was subject to increasing scrutiny by lawmakers, who also called on the government committee that reviews overseas investment to scrutinize the agreement for possible national security issues. In China, government regulators are trying to stanch the loss of foreign exchange reserves, and are wary of signing off on multibillion dollar deals in industries, such as commercial real estate, not deemed to have strategic value. Plans for the redevelopment, which envisioned gutting the aging office tower and erecting a soaring glass-sheathed tower with luxury residences, a hotel and retail spaces designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid, will now require a new investor. “Kushner Companies remains in active, advanced negotiations around 666 5th Avenue with a number of potential investors,” the company spokesman said in a statement. A spokesman for Anbang declined to comment. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/nyregion/talks-end-between-kushners-and-chinese-company.html?searchResultPosition=85
5,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — The party once ruled China, helping to vanquish Japan in World War II. Defeated by Mao Zedong’s Communists, it fled to Taiwan, where it imposed martial law for decades before grudgingly yielding to popular demands for democracy. But now the days of power and wealth are gone for the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, as it struggles to stay relevant in Taiwan politics — a situation that has implications for Beijing and Washington. After a disastrous performance in last year’s general election, the Kuomintang, also known as the K.M.T., lost control of the presidency for the second time since Taiwan’s presidential elections began in 1996. For the first time, it is a minority party in the island’s legislature. “The K.M.T. is looking for its footing in a new environment,” said Nathan Batto, assistant research fellow at Academia Sinica and an expert on Taiwan’s elections. How it will adapt to challenges on several fronts is still an open question. The Kuomintang’s base is made up of those who think of themselves “as Chinese in some way,” Mr. Batto said. That base, however, is now only 20 to 40 percent of voters. Corporations seeking access to the Chinese market are an additional pillar of support — especially financial. The Kuomintang is under investigation regarding public and private assets it seized after arriving in Taiwan seven decades ago. In the 1990s, Kuomintang assets totaled $2.9 billion, according to party data. Its assets now frozen, it has recently cut staff from 800 to under 400 because of insufficient funds.

Mr. Hannity is often very upset, at things like the past friendships of President Barack Obama; the suspected political leanings of his former colleague Megyn Kelly; the resignation of Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser; and the tweets of media reporters from rival news organizations. But the primary target of his anger in recent days has been Ted Koppel, a veteran news anchor and contributor to “CBS Sunday Morning,” which last weekend broadcast a clip from an interview with Mr. Hannity that the Fox star did not like at all. The interview was conducted by Mr. Koppel roughly three weeks ago, Mr. Hannity said on his show Monday night, and had been presented to him as an opportunity to discuss the political polarization in American life. But only a minute or so of the full interview was used. And it looks as though it may have been the part that Mr. Hannity found the most insulting. The night before the segment aired, CBS News posted online a part of the interview in which Mr. Hannity described his upbringing, which he said shaped his views. But in the televised footage, he was shown complaining about socialism, liberalism and “angry snowflakes,” right-wing slang for liberals that conservatives see as easily upset. Then he led with his chin: Mr. Hannity asked if Mr. Koppel, an elder statesman of broadcast news who hosted the ABC show “Nightline” for 25 years, thought he and his show were “bad for America.” Mr. Koppel responded, “Yeah.” “Really?” Mr. Hannity responded, his voice rising an octave or two. “That’s sad, Ted.

7,"“You’ve got lovely beds. Good beds,” the actress Patti LuPone said. She was referring not to furniture, but fingernails: the unvarnished ones on the hands of her current co-star, Christine Ebersole. They contrasted markedly with Ms. LuPone’s nails, which she herself had lacquered in shiny maroon, after years observing professional manicurists. “I watch how they depress the fluid,” Ms. LuPone said, pantomiming bottle and brush. “The problem is, when I put nail polish on it really weakens my nails,” Ms. Ebersole said in a sisterly way. “They just flake off.” The talons were out, in other words, but this was not a catfight. More a chat ’n’ chew between Tony Award-winning actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in “War Paint,” one of a half-dozen new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends. Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves, the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue, where the flagship of Elizabeth Arden’s signature spa, the Red Door, moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north. They had refused treatments and were instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups. In “War Paint,” which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6, Ms. Ebersole, 64, plays Miss Arden, née Florence Nightingale Graham: the entrepreneur who made cosmetics, long associated with prostitutes, acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s. Ms. LuPone, 67, plays Arden’s less-remembered but equally esteemed competitor, Helena Rubinstein, who imparted both artistic and clinical prestige to the pursuit of beauty, and who is credited with the phrase “there are no ugly women, only lazy ones.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/theater/patti-lupone-christine-ebersole-war-paint-broadway.html?searchResultPosition=88

She was talking to a friend in Spanish when a man approached her and began calling her racist names. Afterwards, her husband asked her to buy mace so she could protect herself. The second time Ms. Russ experienced racist harassment after the election of President Trump, it came in the form of a note left on her car while it was parked outside her home in Phoenix. The note included a swastika, a racial slur and the phrases “Trump won” and “go back to Mexco.” “The thing that stuck out was they couldn’t even spell ‘Mexico’ properly,” Ms. Russ said. The third time was at the grocery store, in January. Ms. Russ was talking on her phone in Spanish when a woman walked by and said, “I can’t wait for them to deport you.” This time, Ms. Russ said, “I was just fed up.” She confronted the woman, who claimed she had been talking to someone on the phone.

9,"President Trump has repeatedly slammed pharmaceutical companies for “getting away with murder” on soaring drug prices, but he and his nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration have pledged to ease industry regulations and speed approvals for medicines and other consumer products. The nominee, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, has spent the bulk of his career working in the drug and health care industry, which experts say raises the potential for myriad conflicts of interest. If confirmed to head the F.D.A., he would wield considerable power over companies and investment firms that have paid him millions of dollars over the years. From 2013 to 2015, for example, Dr. Gottlieb received more than $150,000 to advise Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a company whose two approved drugs are seen as breakthrough treatments for cystic fibrosis but carry list prices of more than $250,000 a year. He’s the acting chief executive of Cell Biotherapy, an early-stage cancer biotech firm that he helped found. He has served for years as a consultant to pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol-Myers Squibb and is paid by other companies for his expertise. Dr. Gottlieb plans to recuse himself for one year from any agency decisions involving about 20 health care companies he worked with, according to an ethics agreement made public Wednesday. But that is unlikely to mollify critics who argue that someone with such close industry relationships should not be in charge of an agency whose mission is to protect consumers and uphold safety standards for products from lipstick to lifesaving cancer therapies. “If you have a commissioner who is that conflicted, recusal is a tricky business,” said Susan F. Wood, who resigned as the director of the F.D.A.’s Office of Women’s Health in 2005 in protest over the agency’s decision to delay over-the-counter approval of the morning-after pill. Dr. Gottlieb’s nomination comes at a momentous time for the agency, which Mr. Trump has promised to significantly remake. The next commissioner will be charged with putting into practice a far-reaching law, passed in December, aimed at bringing drugs to market more quickly. Congress also must reauthorize a set of bills this year that determine how much the drug and medical device industry will pay in user fees, which fund more than half of the agency’s budget to review new drugs.

10,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief. Asif Mahmood was born in a small village in rural Pakistan. He came to the United States 26 years ago to study medicine, and is today a pulmonologist in Pasadena. At age 56, he has decided to run for lieutenant governor of California. “The divisive and hateful agenda of Donald Trump compels me to run,” Dr. Mahmood said Tuesday in an interview. “I am a proud Muslim. I am a Muslim immigrant. I am from the state of California. I am a triple threat to Donald Trump.” Dr. Mahmood will officially announce his first bid for public office Wednesday morning.

That said, there are already a number of Muslims in public office across the country, including two Muslims in Congress, according to Mohammed Nadeem, the executive director of the Muslim Observer, which tracks these kinds of elections. (And in Michigan, a Muslim man is running for governor.) Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the incumbent, is barred by term limits from seeking a third term; he is running for governor.

11,"SEOUL, South Korea — As President Trump struggles to devise a North Korea strategy, one country’s voice has been largely missing from public debate: South Korea’s. Yet South Koreans would bear the brunt of the retaliation should Mr. Trump opt for a “pre-emptive” strike against the North Korean regime. Long-term peace on the Korean Peninsula is impossible without Seoul’s input. South Korea’s lack of influence with the Trump administration was evident during Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s recent visit to Asia. He held considerably shorter meetings with the South Koreans than with officials in Tokyo, and he did not even dine with his counterparts in Seoul. The South Korean side claimed Mr. Tillerson was tired (giving rise to “stamina” jokes on Twitter). The secretary fired back that his South Korean hosts had never sent a dinner invitation. South Koreans are partly to blame for being marginalized. The country has been preoccupied since last year by a political scandal that embroiled President Park Geun-hye and ultimately led to her removal from office on March 10. The place-holder government of Park appointees maintains her hard-line posture toward North Korea but without legitimacy in the eyes of the public. South Korea’s political vacuum will come to an end when the country votes on May 9 for a new leader, who will take office immediately. The election will have far-reaching implications for the Korean Peninsula — and for Mr. Trump’s North Korea policy. The liberal opposition is widely expected to win, with the Democratic Party standard-bearer, Moon Jae-in, maintaining a comfortable lead in the polls. The conservatives are in disarray, having split into pro-Park and anti-Park parties; they have yet to find a presidential candidate who polls over 10 percent. South Korean elections are notoriously unpredictable, but public disgust with the impeached president is casting a pall over the conservative camp. North Korea policy is one of the sharpest points of divergence between liberals and conservatives in the South. The hard-line conservative approach of all sticks and no carrots was unpopular by the time Ms. Park took office in 2013. Early on, she appeared to be looking for middle ground: She advocated building trust with Pyongyang and did not make denuclearization a precondition for inter-Korean dialogue. But as time passed, it became clear that Ms. Park’s interest in improving relations was all talk. After North Korea’s fourth nuclear test in January 2016, she abruptly shifted back to harsh rhetoric and hard-line policies, most notably by shutting down the joint North-South industrial park at Kaesong.

12,"WASHINGTON — This year, America’s war in Afghanistan will pass a grim milestone as it surpasses the Civil War in duration, as measured against the final withdrawal of Union forces from the South. Only the conflict in Vietnam lasted longer. United States troops have been in Afghanistan since October 2001 as part of a force that peaked at nearly 140,000 troops (of which about 100,000 were American) and is estimated to have cost the taxpayers at least $783 billion. Despite this heavy expenditure, the United States commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., recently called for a modest troop increase to prevent a deteriorating stalemate. The fall of Sangin in Helmand Province to the Taliban this month is a tactical loss that may be reversed, but it certainly suggests the situation is getting worse. With the Trump administration’s plan to increase the military budget while slashing the diplomatic one, there is a risk that American policy toward Afghanistan will be defined in purely military terms. Absent from the current debate is a clear statement of our objectives — and a way to end the Afghan war while preserving the investment and the gains we have made, at the cost of some 2,350 American lives. It has always been clear to senior military officers like Gen. David H. Petraeus, who was the American commander in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011, as well as to diplomats like me, that the war could end only through a political settlement, a process through which the Afghan government and the Taliban would reconcile their differences in an agreement also acceptable to the international community. The challenges of bringing about such a reconciliation are formidable, but the basic outline of a deal is tantalizingly obvious. Despite more than 15 years of warfare, the United States has never had a fundamental quarrel with the Taliban per se; it was the group’s hosting of Al Qaeda that drove our intervention after the Sept. 11 attacks. For its part, the Taliban has never expressed any desire to impose its medieval ideology outside of Afghanistan, and certainly not in the United States. The core Afghan government requirements for a settlement are that the Taliban ceases violence, breaks with international terrorism and accepts the Afghan Constitution. The Taliban, for its part, insists that all foreign forces withdraw. No doubt, both sides have additional desiderata, but the basic positions do not seem unbridgeable. This is particularly the case now that the Islamic State has emerged in Afghanistan, in conflict with both the government and the Taliban.

13,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The college dropout phenomenon exacts a terrible price on American society. More than 25 percent of people in their 30s who have attended college at some point have no degree — neither a community-college degree nor a bachelor’s degree. They fare vastly worse in the job market than their counterparts who do graduate (despite all the overwrought commentary claiming that education is overrated). A typical college graduate working full-time earns 54 percent more than a full-time worker who attended some college but has no degree. And that statistic understates the gap, because college graduates are also much more likely to have full-time jobs. So how can the United States help more college students finish what they started? That question is the subject of a two-part Fixes column, by Tina Rosenberg, that she has just finished. Her first installment looked at the importance of small infusions of cash to lower-income students. Her latest piece examines the upside of inflexibility: “Colleges use different parts of the strategy and give it different names, although it often goes by ‘guided pathways,’” Rosenberg writes. “The underlying idea is to give students firm guidance in choosing the right courses, along with structured, clear course sequences that lead to graduation. Colleges also monitor students’ progress closely and intervene when they go off track.” One of her shining examples is at the City University of New York, which I’ve previously praised as an engine of economic mobility. Rosenberg’s two pieces address a topic of real importance. Elsewhere, Jonathan Chait of New York magazine explains that Trump’s climate policy will do a lot of damage to the planet but won’t stop the green-energy revolution. Sarah Jones of the New Republic makes a full-throated case for single-payer health care in the wake of Trumpcare’s implosion. As for the newfound claims by House Republicans that now they’re really going to repeal Obamacare: Color me skeptical. The same problems that kept them from passing a bill remain. Carl Hulse, The Times’s chief Washington correspondent, had a cleareyed column earlier this week on the larger issue.

He talked about the so-called mansion tax in at least five separate events in one month in 2015, attempting to create momentum in Albany that never materialized. He has pushed it at a dozen events since rekindling the idea during a January budget address, and with increasing tenacity in recent weeks, including while chomping pickles at a diner with three older constituents on Facebook Live and during a mass conference call on Monday. “If we speak loudly, Albany will listen,” he said during his State of the City address. It has not worked out that way. The State Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Republican, has called the idea a “non-starter.” Likewise, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has seemed uninterested in helping out Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. “That proposal was made in January,” the governor said on Monday. “It never went anywhere in January and it hasn’t gone anywhere since.” Nevertheless, Mr. de Blasio has persevered, eagerly playing the snowball to Albany’s hell. He has dismissed those who say it cannot get through the state capital, and compared it to universal prekindergarten, one of his signature initiatives as mayor, which initially met resistance in Albany. But whereas that effort ultimately succeeded, the main sticking point was in fact a new tax on high-income earners that Mr. de Blasio wanted to levy, to pay for it. The tax component quickly fell by the wayside, but not before the mayor’s stubborn insistence, still near the outset of his term, set him permanently on the wrong foot with Mr. Cuomo and Republicans in the State Senate.

15,"Another day and, for many, another worrisome news alert out of Washington — or two, or three. Travel bans. Policy reversals. Wire taps. In October, during the buildup to Election Day, we heard from therapists about how their patients were feeling fearful, angry and distrustful in reaction to the contentious presidential race. Now, these same therapists report that many of their patients are even more upset as they struggle to make sense of the direction in which the country is heading. And many can’t tear themselves away from the news. “So much is coming at us,” said Sue Elias, a psychotherapist in New York City. “There’s a chronic sense of anxiety among my patients that I have never seen before.” Indeed, Americans are reporting even higher levels of stress than they did before the election, according to a report from the American Psychological Association released in February. And like so many issues these days, the stress appears to be partisan. The report, called Stress in America: Coping with Change, was based on a Harris Poll of more than 3,500 American adults in August, with a follow-up of more than 1,000 men and women in January. While 26 percent of Republicans polled after the election said the political climate was a source of stress, 72 percent of Democrats said they felt that way. The report also found that 86 percent of adults constantly or often check their email, texts and social media accounts, and that those who are constant checkers are more likely to experience stress. The cycle of vigilance can be insidious. “The election results caused feelings of uncertainty,” which leads many people to check the news and search for information to help them cope, said Dr. Eric Hollander, a professor of psychiatry and the director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum program at Einstein — Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. If people see a tweet about wiretapping or deportations, for example, and try to look up news articles about it, what they find often “only heightens the worry and perpetuates the cycle,” he said.

17,"Updated, 10:13 a.m. Good morning on this brisk-to-brilliant Wednesday. Fineline Tattoo is one of the oldest continuously running tattoo shops in the city, but it used to be an underground operation. As recently as 1997, tattooing was illegal in most of New York City. In 1961, the Health Department said the art form was responsible for a hepatitis outbreak and banned it for nearly 40 years. But in the 1970s, Fineline Tattoo began operating out of the Lower East Side home of Mike Bakaty, a sculptor-turned-professional tattoo artist. His secret business at 295 Bowery, the building known as McGurk’s Suicide Hall, was one of the few tattoo parlors in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens or the Bronx. In 1997, just before the ban was lifted, the Bakaty family moved Fineline Tattoo to a storefront at First Avenue and First Street in the East Village — where it remains today. The walls inside the shop are covered in designs ranging from Mickey Mouse and Betty Boop to dragons, swords and snakes. The counters are neatly organized with spray bottles and tubes of colored ink. On one desk is a photograph of Mr. Bakaty’s son, Mehai, now 44, with James Gandolfini. Mehai Bekaty said the actor came in for a tattoo just months before “The Sopranos” star died. Mehai Bakaty, whose childhood home doubled as the shop, says he remembers doing chores in the studio to earn part of his allowance, and falling asleep to the sound of his father’s tattooing machine.

On Tuesday afternoon, President Trump went to the headquarters of the E.P.A. to sign an executive order on environmental regulations. That executive order directs the agency to begin the legal process of repealing and replacing the clean power plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s policies to fight global warming. On today’s episode: • President Obama’s policies on the environment spelled the end for the coal industry. Now President Trump is promising to restore thousands of coal jobs and do away with Obama’s legacy on climate change. We speak with Coral Davenport, who covers energy and the environment for the Times. • This afternoon Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, delivers a letter to the president of the European Council notifying him that after 44 years of membership, her country is leaving the E.U.

The president’s policy will help their industry, but market forces that favor rivals like natural gas and renewable energy may limit its effect.

Well, that was stupid. I apologize.” The original comment came during a segment on the network’s morning show, in which Mr. O’Reilly was shown observing a speech by Ms. Waters, a frequent critic of President Trump. When asked for his thoughts, Mr. O’Reilly said, “I didn’t hear a word she said. I was looking at the James Brown wig.” The comment was met with laughter off camera.

Tom Price left the House seat to become Mr. Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services, and we won’t know who will replace him until April 18 at the earliest. The district hasn’t voted for a Democrat in decades, but that could soon change. Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old Democrat and first-time candidate, has fared well in recent polls and has raised an astonishing $3 million in only a few months. Mr. Trump struggled to victory in this district, a well-educated suburban area north of Atlanta. He won by just 1.5 percentage points, down from Mitt Romney’s 23-point win in 2012. It would be a mistake to read too much into the result of this one election. Special elections tend to stand on their own, and there are reasons to think that Democrats have a better chance than the district’s voting in congressional races suggests. But at this point, it wouldn’t be shocking if Mr. Ossoff got the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff in June. The idea of a competitive race here would have come as a surprise to many just a few months ago. Mr. Price won re-election with a healthy 62 percent of the vote, which observers have held up as a stronger indicator of the district’s partisanship than Mr. Trump’s performance.

23,"Ivanka Trump, the elder daughter of President Trump, is becoming an official government employee, joining her husband, Jared Kushner, in serving as an unpaid adviser to her father in the White House. The announcement on Wednesday amounts to the formal recognition of the value Mr. Trump places on the judgment and loyalty of both his daughter and his son-in-law. While relying on family members for advice is hardly unusual for a president, giving them a formal role has few precedents. Ms. Trump, 35, will be an assistant to the president; Mr. Kushner, 36, has the title of senior adviser. When questions were raised about whether Mr. Kushner’s appointment violated federal anti-nepotism laws, the Justice Department wrote a memo in January concluding that the rules did not apply to the White House. Ms. Trump said last week that she planned on serving as an informal adviser to her father, and she already has an office in the West Wing — upstairs from her husband’s. She was also in the process of receiving government-issued security clearance and communications devices. But that plan had prompted criticism from ethics experts, who had said it would allow her to avoid financial disclosure rules. “This arrangement appears designed to allow Ms. Trump to avoid the ethics, conflict-of-interest and other rules that apply to White House employees,” Norman L. Eisen and Richard W. Painter, White House ethics lawyers for Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, respectively, wrote in a letter to Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel.

24,"HONOLULU — A federal judge in Hawaii decided Wednesday to extend his order blocking President Trump’s travel ban. The judge, Derrick Watson of Federal District Court, issued the longer-lasting hold on the ban just hours after hearing arguments. Hawaii says the policy discriminates against Muslims and hurts the state’s tourist-dependent economy. The implied message in the revised ban is like a “neon sign flashing ‘Muslim ban, Muslim ban,’” that the government didn’t bother to turn off, the state’s attorney general, Douglas Chin, told the judge. Extending the temporary order until the state’s lawsuit is resolved will ensure the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens across the U.S. are vindicated after “repeated stops and starts of the last two months,” the state has said. The government says the ban falls within the president’s power to protect national security. Hawaii has made only generalized concerns about its effect on students and tourism, a Department of Justice lawyer, Chad Readler, told the judge via telephone. The Trump administration had asked Judge Watson to narrow his ruling to cover only the part of Mr. Trump’s executive order that suspends new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries. Mr. Readler said a freeze on the United States refugee program had no effect on Hawaii. Judge Watson rejected that argument, preventing the administration from halting the flow of refugees. Judge Watson said in court that the government only argued for that narrower interpretation after a federal judge in Maryland blocked the six-nation travel ban but said it was not clear that the refugee suspension was similarly motivated by religious bias. The judge noted that the government said 20 refugees were resettled in Hawaii since 2010. “Is this a mathematical exercise that 20 isn’t enough? ... What do I make of that?” the judge asked Mr. Readler. The government lawyer replied that 20 is simply a small number of refugees. “In whose judgment?” Judge Watson asked. Hawaii was the first state to sue over Mr. Trump’s revised ban. The imam of a Honolulu mosque joined the challenge, arguing that the ban would prevent his Syrian mother-in-law from visiting family in Hawaii. In his arguments, Mr. Chin quoted Mr. Trump’s comments that the revised travel ban is a “watered down” version of the original. “We cannot fault the president for being politically incorrect, but we do fault him for being constitutionally incorrect,” Mr. Chin said. Earlier this month, Judge Watson prevented the federal government from suspending new visas for people from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen and freezing the nation’s refugee program. His ruling came just hours before the federal government planned to start enforcing Mr. Trump’s executive order. Mr. Trump called Judge Watson’s previous ruling an example of “unprecedented judicial overreach.” Hawaii’s ruling would not be directly affected by a decision siding with the federal government in the Maryland case, legal experts said. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit set a hearing for May 8 to consider the administration’s appeal.

25,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, moved late on Wednesday to reject the scientific conclusion of the agency’s own chemical safety experts who under the Obama administration recommended that one of the nation’s most widely used insecticides be permanently banned at farms nationwide because of the harm it potentially causes children and farm workers. The ruling by Mr. Pruitt, in one of his first formal actions as the nation’s top environmental official, rejected a petition filed a decade ago by two environmental groups that had asked that the agency ban all uses of chlorpyrifos. The chemical was banned in 2000 for use in most household settings, but still today is used at about 40,000 farms on about 50 different types of crops, ranging from almonds to apples. Late last year, and based in part on research conducted at Columbia University, E.P.A. scientists concluded that exposure to the chemical that has been in use since 1965 was potentially causing significant health consequences. They included learning and memory declines, particularly among farm workers and young children who may be exposed through drinking water and other sources. But Dow Chemical, which sells the product under the trade name Lorsban, along with farm groups that use it, had argued that the science demonstrating that chlorpyrifos caused such harm is inconclusive — especially when properly used to kill crop-spoiling insects. An E.P.A. scientific review panel made up of academic experts last July also had raised questions about some of the conclusions the chemical safety staff had reached. That led the staff to revise the way it had justified its findings of harm, although the agency employees as of late last year still concluded that the chemical should be banned. Mr. Pruitt, in an announcement issued Wednesday night, said the agency needed to study the science more.

26,"In Decatur, Ill., far from the coal mines of Appalachia, Caterpillar engineers are working on the future of mining: mammoth haul trucks that drive themselves. The trucks have no drivers, not even remote operators. Instead, the 850,000-pound vehicles rely on self-driving technology, the latest in an increasingly autonomous line of trucks and drills that are removing some of the human element from digging for coal. When President Trump moved on Tuesday to dismantle the Obama administration’s climate change efforts, he promised it would bring coal-mining jobs back to America. But the jobs he alluded to — hardy miners in mazelike tunnels with picks and shovels — have steadily become vestiges of the past. Pressured by cheap and abundant natural gas, coal is in a precipitous decline, now making up just a third of electricity generation in the United States. Renewables are fast becoming competitive with coal on price. Electricity sales are trending downward, and coal exports are falling. All the while, the coal industry has been replacing workers with machines and explosives. Energy and labor specialists say that no one — including Mr. Trump — can bring them all back. “People think of coal mining as some 1890s, colorful, populous frontier activity, but it’s much better to think of it as a high-tech industry with far fewer miners and more engineers and coders,” said Mark Muro, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program.

27,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The United States launched more airstrikes in Yemen this month than during all of last year. In Syria, it has airlifted local forces to front-line positions and has been accused of killing civilians in airstrikes. In Iraq, American troops and aircraft are central in supporting an urban offensive in Mosul, where airstrikes killed scores of people on March 17. Two months after the inauguration of President Trump, indications are mounting that the United States military is deepening its involvement in a string of complex wars in the Middle East that lack clear endgames. Rather than representing any formal new Trump doctrine on military action, however, American officials say that what is happening is a shift in military decision-making that began under President Barack Obama. On display are some of the first indications of how complicated military operations are continuing under a president who has vowed to make the military “fight to win.” In an interview on Wednesday, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of United States Central Command, said the new procedures made it easier for commanders in the field to call in airstrikes without waiting for permission from more senior officers. “We recognized the nature of the fight was going to change and that we had to ensure that authorities were down to the right level and that we empowered the on-scene commander,” General Votel said. He was speaking specifically about discussions that he said began in November about how the fights in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State were reaching critical phases in Mosul and Raqqa. Concerns about the recent accusations of civilian casualties are bringing some of these details to light. But some of the shifts have also involved small increases in the deployment and use of American forces or, in Yemen, resuming aid to allies that had previously been suspended.

28,"ANKARA, Turkey — He has already met the Mexican and Chinese presidents and hosted a conclave of 68 nations fighting the Islamic State, but no meeting in Rex W. Tillerson’s brief tenure as secretary of state will be as delicate as the one in Ankara on Thursday with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan is the leader of an important NATO ally and is crucial in the fight against the Islamic State, but he is also a prickly strongman whose campaign to change Turkey’s Constitution in a referendum has many worried that the country is on the precipice of authoritarianism. The referendum has resulted in the worst divide between Europe and Turkey in decades, with Mr. Erdogan accusing European leaders of Nazi-like tendencies after they refused to allow officials of his government to address pro-referendum rallies. Mr. Erdogan also has serious reservations about the American plan to attack the Syrian city of Raqqa, the declared capital of the Islamic State, and has demanded that the United States extradite a Pennsylvania cleric who the government says was the mastermind behind a failed coup attempt last July. Navigating these difficulties would test the most seasoned of diplomats. Mr. Tillerson, though, has had a rocky start. On a recent trip to Asia, he stumbled repeatedly — disputing a South Korean explanation for his dinner plans and allowing China to crow over his use of language that American diplomats had long eschewed. Mr. Tillerson’s aides insist that he is still finding his footing in a complicated job. But experts in the region say there is no room for mistakes in his discussions Thursday evening with Mr. Erdogan. “It’s hard to think of a more important or more challenging relationship,” said Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state who visited Turkey three times last year to keep the relationship from foundering.

But on Wednesday, the first lady stepped out of the shadows, speaking out on behalf of women who battle gender discrimination and violence around the world. “Wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them,” Mrs. Trump said at a ceremony at the State Department that honored 13 women who have faced rapists, acid-wielding attackers and the prejudiced courts that often protect them. Speaking softly but firmly, from a teleprompter, Mrs. Trump challenged the members of her audience to put themselves in the shoes of these women — victims of domestic abuse, gender bias, or violence — who fought laws and social norms that sought to perpetuate the injustice. “Ask yourself if you would have the fortitude of spirit, the courage of your convictions, and the enormous inner strength required to stand up and fight against such overwhelming odds,” Mrs. Trump said, gesturing to the women, from Yemen to Sri Lanka, arrayed behind her. “Together,” she said, “we must declare that the era of allowing the brutality against women and children is over, while affirming that the time for empowering women around the world is now.” It was a pointed message for Mrs. Trump to deliver given the tumultuous last weeks of the 2016 campaign, when Donald J.

31,"One of America’s greatest contributions to international peace resulted from a historic investment in foreign aid. After defeating Fascism in World War II, Washington channeled billions of dollars into the war-torn nations of Europe and Japan, helping transform them into economic success stories and vital democratic allies. That’s a lesson worth remembering as President Trump tries to slash the State Department and its foreign aid programs by about 30 percent in the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, while raising Pentagon spending by 10 percent. The cruelest cuts may be a reported $1 billion reduction for the United Nations’ peacekeeping operations and programs that care for needy children. Mr. Trump seems to assume that national greatness comes from the barrel of a gun — he wants to expand the fleet of Navy ships and the nuclear arsenal — rather than from a combination of military might and “soft power” tools. One such tool is the example America sets by adhering to constitutional principles, the rule of law and human rights. Others involve pursuing smart diplomatic engagement and initiatives, including nuclear agreements and disaster assistance for some of the poorest countries. The State Department and foreign aid have long been targets for budget cutters because many Americans don’t understand what these programs do. Polls show that Americans overestimate how much federal spending goes to these programs. The actual number for foreign aid is about 1 percent of the budget, or $36.6 billion in 2017. And some of that money is spent in the United States. Diplomacy doesn’t always prevent war, Syria being one example, but war becomes far more likely if there are not enough diplomats to work with other countries to resolve disagreements. Compelling examples of diplomacy working include the 2015 deal that is preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; the 1995 Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnia War; and the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty. Other examples include several treaties that committed America and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals significantly. American diplomats have strengthened alliances, built new partnerships with countries like Cuba and Myanmar, promoted democracy so that countries are less likely to go to war with one another and created jobs by helping to open overseas markets to American business.

32,"LONDON — A law put forward by the Hungarian government would force a university founded by the Hungarian-American financier and philanthropist George Soros to shut its doors, the school’s top official said on Wednesday. The move, according to observers, was the latest development in a crackdown on free expression and liberal values under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has embraced President Trump and vociferously denounced Mr. Soros, a billionaire who is a frequent target of attacks by the right-wing news media in both the United States and Europe. The school, the Central European University, opened in Mr. Soros’s native Budapest in 1991, not long after the fall of communism and the start of Hungary’s uneven transition to democracy. The school is known as a center for research in the social sciences, with programs led by internationally prominent educators. The university has also given a platform to dissident voices, particularly in the period since Mr. Orban, who helped popularize the term “illiberal democracy,” came to power in 2010. Proponents of illiberal democracy place majority rule over civil liberties and minority rights, and they say that financiers like Mr. Soros are part of an elite capitalist class that puts cosmopolitan values over national interests. The university’s president and rector, Michael Ignatieff, is a human rights scholar and a former leader of the Liberal Party in Canada.

Speaking at the Brookings Institution, which released a ranking of choice options in the country’s 100 largest school districts, Ms. DeVos made her case for choice policies that she said focused on the “individual child.” And she called for the rejection of an “us versus them mentality” when it comes to investing in programs, like charter schools and school vouchers, to which President Trump has proposed giving part of a $1.4 billion funding increase in the fiscal year that begins in October. “Our nation’s commitment is to provide a quality education to every child to serve the greater public, common good,” Ms. DeVos said in her address. “Accordingly, we must shift the paradigm to think about education funding as investments made in individual children, not in institutions or buildings.” While Ms. DeVos offered no new details about the Education Department’s budget — which in the president’s budget blueprint takes a $9 billion, or 13.5 percent, cut — she rejected the notion that money was a panacea for the challenges facing public schools. She resurrected a report released by the Education Department in the final days of President Barack Obama’s administration, which showed that a program that funneled $7 billion into the nation’s worst-performing schools had little to no effect on academic results. The report, which was issued in January and examined the impact of School Improvement Grants, found “no significant impacts” on “math or reading test scores, high school graduation or college enrollment of students.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-school-choice-voucher.html?searchResultPosition=68

Tillerson has decided to lift all human rights conditions on a major sale of F-16 fighter jets and other arms to Bahrain in an effort to end a rift between the United States and a critical Middle East ally, according to administration and congressional officials involved in the debate. Mr. Tillerson’s decision comes as the Trump administration looks to bolster Sunni Arab states in the Middle East and find new ways to confront Iran in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain is a key player in that effort, and home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which patrols the strategic waterway. But the decision to drop the human rights assurances as a condition of the sale is bound to be read by Saudi Arabia and other states in the region as a sign that the new administration plans to ease its demands to protect and respect political dissidents and protesters. The conditions on the sale of 19 new American fighter jets, worth $2.8 billion, had been imposed by the Obama administration amid continuing concerns about the tiny Sunni monarchy’s crackdown against majority Shiites. The State Department declined to comment on queries about Mr. Tillerson’s decision, which has been discussed at length with some members of Congress but not yet publicly announced. The State Department on Wednesday notified Congress of its intent to proceed with the sale without the conditions, according to Micah Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Congress now has two review periods to examine the sale and raise any objections.

The Life
By John A. Farrell
Illustrated. 737 pages. Doubleday. $35. While writing “Richard Nixon: The Life,” John A. Farrell could not possibly have known who would be president on the day his fine book was published. That it happens to be Donald J. Trump is, for him, an extraordinary stroke of luck. To read this biography with an eye only toward the parallels between the two presidents would be lazy and unfair, a disservice to Farrell’s nuanced scholarship. But the context here is unignorable. The similarities between Nixon and Trump leap off the page like crickets. There is, first and most superficially, their nonpresidential looks — Trump with his roosterly combover, Nixon with jowls so low they formed an A-frame with his nose. More substantively, there’s the matter of their Old Testament fury at the news media. (“The press is the enemy,” Nixon told his aides. “Write that on the blackboard 100 times and never forget it.”) What else? Their thin skin. Their skyscraping paranoia. Their cavernous memory for slights. It’s hard to think of two modern presidents with a more dire case of political hemophilia. Once wounded, these men never stop bleeding. Like Trump, Nixon was a monomaniac on the stump, obsessed with the enemies lurking within.

The only problem: The boom is apparent everywhere except in the economic data. It’s not that the economy is stalling — far from it. But with the first quarter ending Friday, growth in the first three months of the Trump administration is looking much the way it did under President Barack Obama. In fact, experts see the gross domestic product in the quarter coming in at only about 1 percent, on an annualized basis — less than half the pace in the second half of 2016, and a far cry from President Trump’s own 4 percent target. “There is a temporal disconnect,” said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “There has been an incredible rise in sentiment, but the proof is in the pudding later.” Ms. Zentner expects growth of 1 percent this quarter, and considers recent data “solid,” but added that the big gap between expectations and reality “creates discomfort for economists and monetary policy makers.” “The divergence is stunning,” she added, drawing a distinction between “soft data” like consumer confidence and “hard data” like retail sales.

But their display of collegiality seemed intended primarily as a contrast to the explosive and often bewildering statements in recent days from the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, whose perceived closeness with the Trump White House has raised doubts about his ability to conduct an impartial investigation. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M.

41,"WASHINGTON — At an unusual Supreme Court argument on Wednesday, the justices tried to sort out who was responsible for a notorious 1984 murder in Washington. The legal question in the case was whether the convictions of seven defendants should be set aside because prosecutors had withheld evidence about another suspect. But the argument barely touched on legal principles. It was instead dominated by an intense effort to reconstruct what happened more than three decades ago. Prosecutors had presented no physical evidence, relying on eyewitness testimony. It was enough to convict eight defendants, including one who has since died, of brutally assaulting and killing Catherine Fuller. Twenty-five years after the trial, in 2010, lawyers for the defendants sought to reopen the case, saying their convictions had been tainted by violations of Brady v. Maryland, a 1963 Supreme Court decision that required prosecutors to turn over favorable evidence to the defense. They said prosecutors had withheld several kinds of evidence, most notably about another suspect, James McMillan. Mr. McMillan had been seen near the scene of the crime. After Ms. Fuller’s murder but before the trial, Mr. McMillan was arrested and later convicted on charges of robbing and assaulting two other middle-age women in the neighborhood. (Later, Mr. McMillan was convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering a woman in 1992, a few blocks from the alley where Ms. Fuller was killed.) Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, told the justices that “the evidence of the third-party perpetrator that petitioners have now put before this court is weak and speculative.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/us/politics/justices-dig-through-1984-murder-weighing-withheld-evidence.html?searchResultPosition=76

A room full of men is seen as commanding to some, so, as usual, Mr. Trump is telling those who love him what they want to hear, and in this case, showing them what they want to see. To his supporters, the homogeneous room is probably a comforting change from the more mixed Obama administration, and an affirmation that the powerful, take-charge persona they voted for is, in fact, in office right now.

TAKOMA PARK, MD. To the Editor: Jill Filipovic makes the point that the lack of diversity is a deliberate appeal to those who want to go back to a white male-dominated America. I submit that the strategy goes even deeper. I see this as an attempt to divide the Democratic Party by positioning the present political crisis as a war between women and men. My support for Bernie Sanders was criticized by female friends and allies, including my sisters, as anti-feminist. I have supported female candidates and women’s issues at every turn. Wars, a quasi-police state, global warming, and the attack on immigrant, minority and women’s rights affect men and women equally. Right-thinking women and men must remain united to stop this coup.

43,"Calling the recent surge in opioid-related overdoses one of “the biggest public health and law-enforcement crises of our time,” prosecutors in Brooklyn announced the indictment on Wednesday of 34 people charged with running a sprawling drug ring that sold a potent new designer narcotic never before seen in New York City — furanyl fentanyl. Furanyl fentanyl — or White China, as it is sometimes known — is a chemical analogue of fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that can be as much 50 times as powerful as heroin and has been blamed in some areas of the country for killing more people than heroin itself. Prosecutors said that the furanyl fentanyl seized in Wednesday’s case was produced in China, shipped to the United States by private mail and sold for as little as $7 to $10 per dose by a network of distributors in all five boroughs of New York. “These synthetics are lethal, they are cheap and they continue to flood into our streets,” Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, said at a news conference detailing the charges. Mr. Gonzalez added that the monthslong investigation of the drug ring, nicknamed Operation Hardball, turned up evidence that the traffickers were earning as much as $1 million a year. Though furanyl fentanyl was made illegal by the federal government in November, it is a new enough phenomenon that it has not yet been classified as a controlled substance under New York State law. As with K2, a synthetic form of marijuana that wreaked havoc across the city this summer, producers of fentanyl and its analogues can sometimes avoid prosecution by tweaking the chemical recipe of the drug to work around specific provisions of the law. In the 357-count indictment, the prosecutors in Brooklyn charged some of the defendants with the attempted sale of heroin, saying that many of the distributors and street-level dealers thought that they were selling heroin, not a knockoff. The indictment also accused members of the ring, including a supplier based in Phoenix, with selling heroin and cocaine as well. The charges came just two weeks after Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that the city would spend as much as $38 million year on a comprehensive plan to stem the tide of opiate addiction, which police officials have said resulted last year in between 1,200 and 1,300 deaths — or nearly four times the number of murders in New York. Under the mayor’s plan, the city intends to pursue a broad array of initiatives, including expanding treatment for addicts, focusing on opioid addiction at city hospitals, aggressively prosecuting distributors of the drugs and handing out medication that can stop opiate overdoses to all 23,000 city patrol officers.

Mr. Trump wants to cut funding for Meals on Wheels and other social services, while pouring billions of new dollars into the military.

45,"LONDON — On a day that blended dull ritual with undeniable historical import, Britain formally began its departure from the European Union with the delivery of a letter to Brussels, followed by lofty words from Prime Minister Theresa May in Parliament. Two years of grinding divorce negotiations now begin, with the outcome unclear, except that the talks are certain to be contentious and spiteful — and that the only sure winners will be lawyers and trade negotiators. For the first time, the European bloc is losing a member, not to mention its second-largest economy. The multilateral architecture that has shaped the Western world since the aftermath of World War II has taken a severe blow, and as the letter was delivered on Wednesday, questions abounded about whether this pivot toward nationalism and self-interest represented the beginning of a more volatile global era. When Britons voted last June to leave the European Union, the champions of “Brexit” argued that the country, with its exit, was at the front edge of a larger populist wave. Months later, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States only deepened the feeling that an anti-establishment political contagion was sweeping across Western democracies, upending the established order. Britain, the argument went, would be a winner in this new era. Few people predicted the British exit, and fewer still predicted Mr. Trump’s victory. But few predicted where things stand now, either: The European Union, if still ailing and dysfunctional, is far from dead. Populist parties are sinking in the polls in Germany and underperformed in the Dutch elections this month.

46,"WASHINGTON — It began with evidence of a breach of the Democratic National Committee’s computers and has now evolved into a sprawling counterintelligence investigation to determine whether there was any coordination between members of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign staff and the Russian government, perhaps even influencing the 2016 election. When James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, went before Congress on March 20 and confirmed the existence of the Trump-Russia investigation, it echoed of the Cold War investigations in which the bureau and the C.I.A. searched for agents hidden in the government who had spied for Moscow. A look back at those Cold War cases may reveal lessons for today’s investigators. Above all, those past cases show it could take years before the new investigation uncovers any answers. Spy hunts usually begin with an unexplained incident. In the Trump-Russia case, there was the hacking of the D.N.C.’s computers. In 1985, there was an arrest on the streets of Moscow. In June 1985, Burton Gerber, the chief of the Soviet-East European division of the Central Intelligence Agency, was about to sit down to dinner at his home in Washington when he received devastating news. Paul Stombaugh, a C.I.A. case officer, had just been arrested by the K.G.B. in Moscow. Mr. Stombaugh had been caught while he was on a clandestine mission to meet the C.I.A.’s most important Russian spy, Adolf Tolkachev, a scientist at a secret military design facility who had been providing the Americans with top-secret information about Soviet weapons systems. Mr. Gerber knew that Mr. Stombaugh’s arrest meant that Mr. Tolkachev, an agent the C.I.A. had code-named GTVANQUISH, had certainly been arrested as well.

47,"On Tuesday afternoon, while most people were focused on the latest news from the House Intelligence Committee, the House quietly voted to undo rules that keep internet service providers — the companies like Comcast, Verizon and Charter that you pay for online access — from selling your personal information. The Senate already approved the bill, on a party-line vote, last week, which means that in the coming days President Trump will be able to sign legislation that will strike a significant blow against online privacy protection. The bill not only gives cable companies and wireless providers free rein to do what they like with your browsing history, shopping habits, your location and other information gleaned from your online activity, but it would also prevent the Federal Communications Commission from ever again establishing similar consumer privacy protections. The bill is an effort by the F.C.C.’s new Republican majority and congressional Republicans to overturn a simple but vitally important concept — namely that the information that goes over a network belongs to you as the consumer, not to the network hired to carry it. It’s an old idea: For decades, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, federal rules have protected the privacy of the information in a telephone call. In 2016, the F.C.C., which I led as chairman under President Barack Obama, extended those same protections to the internet. To my Democratic colleagues and me, the digital tracks that a consumer leaves when using a network are the property of that consumer. They contain private information about personal preferences, health problems and financial matters. Our Republican colleagues on the commission argued the data should be available for the network to sell. The commission vote was 3-2 in favor of consumers.

48,"Republicans just made clear how little they care about protecting the privacy of Americans by letting companies like Verizon and Comcast sell advertisers the internet browsing histories and other personal data of their customers without getting permission. The move could bolster the profits of the telecommunications industry by billions of dollars. Following a party-line vote in the Senate last week, the House approved a resolution on Tuesday that would overturn a broadband privacy regulation the Federal Communications Commission adopted in October. That rule requires cable and phone companies to obtain consent before using information like which websites people visited to show them customized ads and to build detailed profiles on them. The White House said on Tuesday that President Trump would sign the legislation, which would also prohibit the F.C.C. from adopting a similar policy in the future. Most Americans spend much of their lives online. They should be able to do so without fear that their internet service providers are logging their activities and selling the data. There is a long tradition of the government protecting such information. For example, the F.C.C. has long restricted what phone companies can do with call records. And in 1988 Congress prohibited video stores from disclosing the movies people rented. Republican lawmakers, like Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, and the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, say that the commission’s privacy rule is unfair because it applies only to broadband companies and not to internet businesses like Google and Facebook. This is highly disingenuous. Congress has only given the commission authority over telecommunications companies, so the F.C.C. couldn’t have come up with rules that applied to other businesses even if it wanted to. Telecom companies know a lot about what people do online because they are the gatekeepers through which people connect to the internet. And as people link household devices like thermostats, light bulbs and security cameras to the internet, these companies will have even more intimate knowledge about their customers. By comparison, people can more easily evade tracking by businesses like Google and Facebook by not using those services or by deleting the cookies those websites leave on their computers and phones. In the absence of strong privacy rules, people will have to rely on encryption to prevent service providers from tracking them. But broadband companies would still know what websites people visit. And the companies would be able to see all of the communications between users and websites that do not use encryption. Sophisticated users might increasingly rely on virtual private networks, which are used by corporations to let their employees log into secure systems remotely, and other tools to mask their activities, but most Americans are unlikely to be conversant with such tricks of the trade. Mr. Trump promised voters during the campaign that he would protect the working class. But now he and his party are moving quickly to do the bidding of a very different interest group: Big Telecom.

49,"CHICAGO — Donald J. Trump’s feelings about Chicago couldn’t have been clearer. He loved the place. It was 2004, and Mr. Trump, then a developer and reality show star, was waging a charm campaign here. He raved about Chicago’s “stunning” skyline and admired its architectural ingenuity as he proposed adding his own building to the mix. It was a “great city,” he said, right up there with his hometown, New York. Had Twitter existed at the time, Mr. Trump’s hashtag might have read #mykindoftown. Oh, how his views have changed. In recent months, Mr. Trump has repeatedly — obsessively, in the view of some — commented on Chicago’s street violence in interviews, debates and off-hour social media outbursts. “Chicago needs help!” he wrote on Twitter recently, after lamenting the city’s “carnage” in an earlier missive and vowing to “send in the feds” to save the day. On Tuesday, after meeting with police union leaders at the White House, Mr. Trump once again took note of this city’s violence, saying “I always ask, ‘What’s going on in Chicago?’” Politics could be partly to blame for Mr. Trump’s apparent change of heart. Chicago is Democratic to its core. It is where Barack Obama got his political start. And it is an easy foil when describing, as Mr. Trump does quite a bit, how dire urban America has become. But personal pique may also be an important factor when it comes to Mr. Trump’s relationship with the city. “It’s clear that he has a bone to pick with Chicago,” said Jesus G. Garcia, a Democratic Cook County commissioner. During Mr. Trump’s campaign, Chicago’s tight-knit, high-dollar Republican establishment showed tepid support, and he wound up canceling a rally here before he even arrived on stage, citing the raucous protesters who had gathered at the scene. But it may be the rejection he faced when he brought in his grand dream of putting up the world’s tallest skyscraper that stings most of all.

Just look at the facts. Trump took office promising to fix our trade imbalance with China, and what’s the first thing he did? He threw away a U.S.-designed free-trade deal with 11 other Pacific nations — a pact whose members make up 40 percent of global G.D.P. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was based largely on U.S. economic interests, benefiting our fastest-growing technologies and agribusinesses, and had more labor, environmental and human rights standards than any trade agreement ever. And it excluded China. It was our baby, shaping the future of trade in Asia. Imagine if Trump were negotiating with China now as not only the U.S. president but also as head of a 12-nation trading bloc based on our values and interests. That’s called l-e-v-e-r-a-g-e, and Trump just threw it away … because he promised to in the campaign — without, I’d bet, ever reading TPP. What a chump! I can still hear the clinking of champagne glasses in Beijing. Now more Asian nations are falling in line with China’s regional trading association — the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership — which has no serious environmental, intellectual property, human trafficking or labor standards like TPP.

This week, soon after social media went into a meltdown about United Airlines’ dress code for its “pass travelers” (employees and their dependents traveling free on a standby basis) and the fact that said dress code did not include leggings (a rule that does not, let us remember, apply to the ticket-buying public), Puma rode to the rescue of all leggings lovers by posting a special offer on Twitter: Present any United Airlines ticket and get 20 percent off all leggings at its stores in the United States. Quick! Run out and show your solidarity by shopping! And thus was the leggings movement commercialized. Can you blame them? Rebellion has long been made into merchandise. “I saw the story Monday morning, and didn’t think much of it,” said Adam Petrick, Puma’s global director of brand and marketing. “But then everyone was talking about it, and it seemed like we could have fun with it, and it was easy to get behind. We’re a sports brand, and come down clearly on the side that leggings are pants, and women of any age should be able to wear leggings any time they desire.” Except, of course, none of this is really about leggings. Leggings are the excuse — or the symbol. But to focus on them, which so much of the discussion has done since the news of the United ban broke, is to miss the point. The question at the heart of the issue is not whether leggings are appropriate for planes. The question is, as in all discussions of dress code: Who gets to decide? The individual or the group? The individual or the business? Do we all have the inalienable right to express ourselves with apparel? Because what United was saying with its dress code was: When you fly on our dime you are representing our brand, and our brand takes flying with a certain amount of formality, the way it used to be taken. And what everyone else was saying is: When I fly (or do anything else for that matter, presumably) I am representing me, and I get to wear what I want, when I want. That tension has always existed, but in the past, the employer has generally won — at least when an individual was acting under the aegis of a brand, or on its behalf. Last year, however, when another dress code brouhaha broke out — this one about a temporary worker in Britain who was sent home for refusing to wear high heels — Susan Scafidi, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York and the founder of the Fashion Law Institute, told me that the pendulum had begun to swing the other way.

57,"Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas vetoed a bill on Thursday that would have expanded Medicaid in his state, setting up a potential showdown next week with a Legislature that, while heavily Republican, has come to favor extending the largely free health coverage to as many as 180,000 additional poor adults. Although the bill was easily approved in both chambers of the Legislature, supporters would need to muster three additional votes in the House and two in the Senate to override the veto by Mr. Brownback, a conservative Republican. After the House briefly debated an override on Thursday, the measure was put aside, probably until at least next week. Supporters were hoping to mobilize hundreds of residents who would benefit from Medicaid expansion, as well as hospital executives, clergy members and others who back the measure, to lobby specific lawmakers over the weekend. “Our plan is to make sure their phones are ringing off the hook,” said David Jordan, executive director of Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, an advocacy group. Republican lawmakers in Kansas were initially solidly opposed to expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. But many softened their positions over the last year or so, particularly influenced by the financial struggles of the state’s small rural hospitals. Momentum grew after several Democrats and moderate Republicans picked up legislative seats in the elections last fall, although the leaders of both legislative chambers remain opposed to any expansion. In his veto message, Mr. Brownback said the cost of expanding Medicaid would be “irresponsible and unsustainable,” citing other states where Medicaid enrollment grew far more than expected after they expanded the program. The expansion effort comes in the midst of a budget crisis that has roiled Kansas for years.

58,"SAN FRANCISCO — Palmer Luckey, a founder of the virtual-reality technology company Oculus, has left Facebook three years after the social network acquired his company for close to $3 billion. Mr. Luckey’s departure was announced two months after a trial in federal court over allegations that he and several colleagues had stolen trade secrets from a video-game publisher, ZeniMax Media, to create the Oculus technology. A jury found Facebook liable for $500 million in damages, in part for Mr. Luckey’s violation of a confidentiality agreement. “Palmer will be dearly missed,” Tera Randall, an Oculus spokeswoman, said in a statement. “His inventive spirit helped kick-start the modern VR revolution and helped build an industry.” Ms. Randall declined to disclose the terms of Mr. Luckey’s departure. The move adds another twist to Facebook’s bumpy foray into virtual-reality technology. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has bet big on virtual reality as part of the social network’s future, saying he envisioned social interactions between people will someday exist inside virtual worlds. Oculus, he has said, could be a catalyst for that. But from the start, Oculus has run into problems. Adoption of the Oculus technology and headsets has been slower than Facebook had anticipated. The selection of content made for VR headsets is still small, though growing. “These things end up being more complex than you think upfront,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in January while appearing in court for the ZeniMax trial. “If anything, we may have to invest even more money to get to the goals we had than we had thought upfront.” Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to spending more than $3 billion over the next decade to get virtual reality off the ground and into the mainstream. Mr. Luckey has had other stumbles. In 2016, it became public that he had donated $10,000 to Nimble America, a pro-Trump political organization that promoted far-right memes and slogans on social media sites like Reddit, Twitter and Facebook. He has since apologized for the impact his actions had on Oculus and its partners. Mr. Luckey did not immediately respond to a Facebook message requesting comment. In January, Facebook appointed a new leader, Hugo Barra, to head up the company’s virtual-reality efforts, including Oculus.

In this article, Didi Kirsten Tatlow, a Beijing-based Times correspondent, compares notes and guilt trips with Times reporters around the world who have moved with their families to smog-laden news hubs. Air matters. So when the conversation over a recent lunch in The Times’s Beijing bureau turned to the air pollution that regularly suffuses this city with chemicals and despondency, Ian Johnson, a China correspondent, took out his phone to check Air Matters, an app that measures air quality based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality Index, which scores the air from 0 to 500. Over 300 and the air is “hazardous.” It was at 169, “unhealthy” by American standards and several times the World Health Organization’s recommended daily level. Air quality has long been a serious problem here in Beijing — for citizens and The Times’s foreign correspondents alike. Now efforts to dial back air pollution worldwide are likely to take a hit: On Tuesday, less than a week after rolling back fuel-economy standards for the auto industry, President Trump announced an executive order reversing the rest of the Obama administration’s climate plan. If carried through, the order — which lifts American limits on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, the largest contributor of particulate pollution — flies in the face of the United States’ pledge under the Paris climate accord to cut its emissions.

61,"So what if President Trump wants to deport Big Bird? We’re struggling with terrorism, refugees, addiction, and grizzlies besieging schools. Isn’t it snobbish to fuss over Trump’s plans to eliminate all funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting? Let me argue the reverse: Perhaps Trump’s election is actually a reminder that we need the humanities more than ever to counter nationalism and demagoguery. Civilization is built not just on microchips, but also on arts, ideas and the humanities. And the arts are a bargain: The N.E.A. budget is $148 million a year, or less than 0.004 percent of the federal budget. The per-capita cost for Americans is roughly the cost of a postage stamp. The humanities may seem squishy and irrelevant. We have a new president who doesn’t read books and who celebrates raw power. It would be easy to interpret Trump as proof of the irrelevance of the humanities. Yet the humanities are far more powerful than most people believe. The world has been transformed over the last 250 years by what might be called a revolution of empathy driven by the humanities. Previously, almost everyone (except Quakers) accepted slavery and even genocide. Thomas Jefferson justified the “extermination” of Native Americans; whippings continued in American prisons in the 20th century; and at least 15,000 people turned up to watch the last public hanging in the United States, in 1936. What tamed us was, in part, books. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” famously contributed to the abolitionist movement, and “Black Beauty” helped change the way we treat animals. Steven Pinker of Harvard argues that a surge of literacy and an explosion of reading — novels in particular — “contributed to the humanitarian revolution,” by helping people see other viewpoints. There is also modern experimental evidence that reading literary fiction promotes empathy. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/president-trump-vs-big-bird.html?searchResultPosition=55
62,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has discovered that trying to work with Republicans, like trying to work on health care policy, is complicated. So with all his big campaign pledges in limbo following last week’s Obamacare fiasco, he reportedly is contemplating overtures to a party that actually wants to govern: the Democrats. This new tack comes, mind you, after Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for refusing to help him and House Speaker Paul Ryan eviscerate Obamacare. With zero support from Democrats, the pair had no margin for error as Republicans started to defect and were forced to pull their bill. Perhaps it’s beginning to dawn on the president that today’s Republican Party is designed for maximal obstruction and minimal constructive policy making. The rigidly doctrinaire Freedom Caucus essentially has veto power over White House initiatives, while moderates will jump ship if Mr. Trump concedes too much to right-wing purists. What’s more, Republicans are all over the map on the next big items on Mr. Trump’s agenda — tax reform and infrastructure. So even though Republicans control Congress and the White House, Washington’s new political math suggests that Mr. Trump may have no choice but to reach out to Democrats. If he could peel off several dozen moderate Democrats in the House and a handful in the Senate, he could neutralize the far right’s naysaying and give moderate Republicans a chance to vote for measures with broad, bipartisan support.

63,"WASHINGTON — A United States military spokesman said Thursday that Islamic State fighters had been herding local Iraqi residents into buildings in western Mosul, calculating that rising civilian casualties would restrain the United States from using airstrikes to help retake that half of the city. “What you see now is not the use of civilians as human shields,” said Col. Joseph E. Scrocca, a spokesman for the American-led task force that is battling the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “ISIS is smuggling civilians into buildings so we won’t see them and trying to bait the coalition to attack.” An episode this week in which Islamic State fighters forced civilians inside a building, killing one who resisted, was observed by American surveillance aircraft. Islamic State fighters then positioned themselves inside the same structure to fire on Iraqi forces, according to an account provided in a briefing for Pentagon reporters by Colonel Scrocca. No video of the episode was released on Thursday, but he said the video would soon be made public. The furor over the March 17 American airstrike that led to the collapse of a building in western Mosul, killing scores if not hundreds of Iraqi civilians, as well as Defense Department allegations that Islamic State fighters deliberately placed the civilians in harm’s way, have caused a change in American tactics. “It has caused some adjustments to our procedures,” Colonel Scrocca said, though he declined to say what specific changes had been made. What has not changed is the generals’ decision to give greater authority to American officers on the battlefield to call in airstrikes. That decision was taken after Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of the task force that is battling the Islamic State, was told by subordinates that it was taking too long to conduct airstrikes when Syrian fighters were battling to take the town of Manbij in the northern part of the country and Iraqi fighters were first starting to take Mosul. The new procedures also will apply to the efforts to retake Raqqa, Syria, the Islamic State’s capital. “This is a discussion that started in a November time-frame, and we started to pursue this. We recognized what we were stepping into,” Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of the United States Central Command, said in an interview Wednesday. “It was actually implemented for eastern Mosul, the whole urban environment, and frankly, as we kind of get ready for Raqqa.

After a little more than two months in office, President Trump has raised doubts about his ability to deal with what the former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously described as the “known unknowns” and the “unknown unknowns.” “President Trump seems to have no awareness whatsoever of what he does and does not know,” Steven Nadler, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, wrote me. “He is ignorant of his own ignorance.” During his first 63 days in office, Trump made 317 “false or misleading claims,” according to The Washington Post. The FBI, the Treasury Department and two congressional committees are probing whether Trump’s campaign aides and advisers — including Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn — were complicit in alleged Russian interference. Without an obvious mandate (as the world knows, he lost the popular vote by 2.87 million), Trump has proposed a profound retrenchment of domestic policy. His 2018 budget, the potential impact of which he does not seem to grasp, calls for cutting $54 billion from programs that pay for education, housing and child care assistance for low- and moderate-income families, protection against infectious diseases, enforcement of environmental, worker and consumer protection regulation, national parks and a host of other social programs. See the accompanying chart, which illustrates the depth of these changes.

Scores of departures by scientists and Silicon Valley technology experts who advised President Trump’s predecessor have all but wiped out the larger White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Mr. Trump has not yet named his top advisers on technology or science, and so far, has made just one hire: Michael Kratsios, the former chief of staff for Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley investor and one of the president’s wealthiest supporters, as the deputy chief technology officer. Neither Mr. Kratsios, who has a bachelor’s degree in political science from Princeton, nor anyone else still working in the science and technology office regularly participates in Mr. Trump’s daily briefings, as they did for President Barack Obama. “The impression this leaves is that Trump isn’t interested in science and that scientific matters are a low priority at the White House,” said Vinton G.

The dwindling of the White House science and technology staff for scientific research could have long-term consequences, Mr. Cerf said.

68,"LOS ANGELES — When “Zoot Suit” made its debut in New York in 1979, it was the first time a Chicano show had made it to Broadway. But the musical, by Luis Valdez, was a distinctly Los Angeles production: It was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving zoot-suit-wearing Mexican-American youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-Americans in summer 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group’s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the stage here for the first time since 1978. Tickets went on sale late last year and sold out quickly. The production has since been extended three times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and the enthusiasm demonstrate that the play touches a deep nerve in this city, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to find out what the play means to them. These interviews have been condensed and edited. Photographs by Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times When I first saw the movie in high school I felt really inspired. The pachucos loved the United States, but they did not want to give up their own culture. They created this subculture that was mixing all these backgrounds and creating this culture of resistance and their own identity. They were some of the first people who stood up for the Chicano community. When I wear a zoot suit I feel empowered, kind of like it’s a suit of armor. It’s not only honoring those in the past, but it makes you look sharp even though it doesn’t follow the norm of what a suit is supposed to look like.

73,"The Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearing for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch was just plain embarrassing, and not only for the nominee. But let’s begin with him, skipping over his Republican enablers, who had nothing to do but lob softball questions and praise his answers. If Judge Gorsuch wasn’t the least forthcoming Supreme Court nominee ever to appear at a confirmation hearing, it’s hard to imagine one who could be less forthcoming while still breathing. More interesting and less predictable answers could have come from Siri on an iPhone. The previous contender for the title of least forthcoming was Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016 and whom Judge Gorsuch would replace. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and confirmed unanimously, then-Judge Scalia wouldn’t even tell the Judiciary Committee whether he supported Marbury v. Madison, the landmark 1803 decision in which the court under Chief Justice John Marshall established the principle that federal courts can invalidate unconstitutional statutes. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then a Republican and later a Democrat, was so irritated by the nominee’s performance that four years later, when President George H. W. Bush nominated David H. Souter to the court, Senator Specter announced in advance that he expected an answer to the Marbury question. “That was one of 2,000 questions that Justice Scalia refused to answer,” the senator explained, his annoyance still simmering, as he ushered Judge Souter into his inner office for a private meeting. The Marbury v. Madison answer must have been satisfactory, because the two emerged shortly thereafter with Senator Specter praising the nominee’s “first-rate legal mind.” I’ve described this episode, which I witnessed, at some length because I’m tired of hearing that the refusal to answer the Judiciary Committee’s substantive questions began with Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s hearing in 1993. In fact, then-Judge Ginsburg was forthright in her support of the right to abortion, calling it “essential to woman’s equality,” and she praised the 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey as having strengthened the right in some respects. So it remains a mystery to me why Justice Ginsburg is singled out as the model of a say-nothing stance toward a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. (Just as it was a mystery to me why liberals during the past several years persisted in calling on her, and not the male justices who are her near age-mates, to retire and open a spot for President Barack Obama to fill. Nothing to do with her sex, I’m sure.) In any event, all Judge Gorsuch had to say about the right to abortion — as well as about the 51-year-old constitutional right to use birth control — was that it was supported by precedent. In answer to a question from Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committee’s chairman, about what he had to say about Roe v. Wade, the nominee answered: “I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, was a precedent of the United States Supreme Court.” Elaborating ever so slightly, he went on to observe that the decision had been reaffirmed and that people relied on it. “So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the United States Supreme Court, worthy of treatment as precedent like any other.” Precedents, of course, receive all kinds of “treatment” at the hands of future courts, from a warm embrace to being whittled away to outright overruling. What kind of “treatment” Judge Gorsuch thinks the court’s abortion precedents deserve was left neatly unspecified.

Donald Trump must be absolutely exhausted. “… the White House has been hosting events all throughout March,” press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, launching into a list of activities that culminated Wednesday in a visit by the president to a special Women’s Empowerment Panel. The administration regarded this gathering as so important that it featured every single female cabinet member. Yes! All four! Actually, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao couldn’t come, so they substituted Seema Verma, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “My cabinet is full of really incredible women leaders,” the president said, looking at the quartet.

Besides Chao, the cabinet women include Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations, and Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration. While everybody wants to encourage small business and at least some of us want to encourage the U.N., neither of those would be regarded as exactly superpower positions.

Once in a while, I’ve tried to grab a feral kitten to bring it in for a short visit. Why I keep trying, I don’t know; no matter how much whitefish you leave on a napkin, nobody is fast enough to catch a feral cat. So you’ll understand why, a year and a half ago, I decided it would be a great idea to get her a robo cat. My college roommate had sent me a link about it, the Hasbro Joy for All Companion Pet. This is some cat. It opens its eyes when you pet it, it purrs, and if you pet it long enough, it will roll over on its back for a belly rub. The commercials alone could make you weep: Elderly men and women, often in wheelchairs, are presented with a Joy for All Companion cat. At the sound of its meows or the sight of it washing its face with its paw, their faces light up as if someone has thrown a switch. They scratch its little ears, they lock eyes with it and snuggle it to their chests, they beam. Cat available in orange, gray and creamy white, $99.99. I order that fluffy little sucker so fast my credit card smokes. I get it in orange because we had an excellent orange-yellow tomcat when I was growing up in the Catskills, a lascivious boulevardier named Peaches whose sorbet-colored progeny dotted the town. A week later, I trot into my mother’s room with the cat, eager to see her go moist-eyed and tender. It didn’t happen a lot when my brothers and I were growing up — or ever, actually — but after someone’s brain has been fried in a major stroke and they’re in a wheelchair, things change. “What the hell is that?” Ma says. Wait — this wasn’t how it went in the movie. “It’s a robot cat,” I say. “I got it to hang out with you.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/nyregion/loving-robo-cat-needs-home.html?searchResultPosition=41
76,"One recent morning, Nadia Lopez, a Brooklyn middle-school principal who became an internet celebrity two years ago — and as a result has been a guest of Ellen DeGeneres, Barack Obama and Drew Gilpin Faust, the president of Harvard, as well as an author — received a flood of text messages from family and friends who were outraged by an article in The Daily News titled “Brownsville Is Brooklyn’s Worst Neighborhood for Children.” For seven years, Ms. Lopez has run Mott Hall Bridges Academy in Brownsville to great acclaim, having gained national attention when the blog Humans of New York profiled a student who talked about what a profound influence she was. Part of the challenge of working in low-income urban communities is the fight against the perception that they are doomed and immiserating, an exercise that has required more energy in the age of President Trump, who has made use of the loaded term “inner city” to invoke the image of nightmare places where death always comes at gunpoint and schools are always synonymous with failure. The News’s article was pegged to a new report from the Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York, a nonprofit advocacy group whose purpose was to highlight both the deficits in Brownsville — its 40 percent poverty rate, nearly twice that of New York City on the whole, has remained unchanged during Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration — and its strengths, which are easy for outsiders to overlook. When I visited Ms. Lopez in her office to talk about what has changed in Brownsville and what hasn’t over the past several years, she spoke about how disheartening it was to see constant attacks in the news media, ones she believes were then internalized by children who would see themselves as hopeless and without value. Her mission involves a deft finesse between showing children the larger world of affluence — she takes students to stores and restaurants in Park Slope and Williamsburg so that they might know how the salumi half lives — and inculcating in them a sense of investment in their own neighborhood, so they might aspire to do well but ultimately return to the place they were brought up and improve it. “If kids have access and exposure they can change a trajectory,” she said, “but you can’t know what to ask for until you know what there is to want.” When Ms. Lopez takes the children through moneyed Brooklyn, they are consistently amazed that you can go to a store where the candy isn’t behind plexiglass and eat in restaurants where you sit down and the food is actually brought to you.

77,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles, and the photographer Melissa Lyttle. When “Zoot Suit” made its debut in New York in 1979, it was the first time a Chicano show had made it to Broadway. But the musical by Luis Valdez was a distinctly Los Angeles production: it was commissioned by the Mark Taper Forum and portrayed a 1940s murder trial involving Mexican-American zoot-suit-wearing youths known as pachucos. The trial is set against the backdrop of the infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against Mexican-Americans in the summer of 1943. To help mark the Los Angeles Center Theater Group’s 50th anniversary, the show returned recently to the downtown stage for the first time since 1978. When tickets went on sale late last year, the production sold out quickly and has since been extended three separate times, a rare occurrence at the theater. The acclaim and enthusiasm demonstrates how the play touches a deep nerve in Los Angeles, particularly at another moment of political upheaval. Some of the shows most devoted fans are showing up to the performances dressed in their own zoot suits and vintage attire. We spoke to some of them to hear what the play means to them.

78,"AMHERST, Mass. — President Trump’s “skinny budget” might be a misnomer, because in foreign policy, at least, it is actually giving us fat nationalism. The biggest winners are the military, the Homeland Security Department and, of course, the wall. The biggest loser is the State Department and thus diplomacy. Mr. Trump is all about intimidating more and negotiating less. This is the hallmark of xenophobic nationalism. Mr. Trump is also blending xenophobic nationalism with protectionism. The jury is still out on how protectionist the Trump administration wants to be. But in relation to Latin America, even before revealing his budget, Mr. Trump already showed a clear preference for protectionism. He walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was as much about United States trade with Latin America’s rising Pacific economies as it was about trade with Asia. He has trashed Nafta, a trade agreement that is more important as a symbol of the reconciliation between the United States and Mexico than it is as a change in the economic fortune of the United States. His administration has expressed reservations about trade normalization with Cuba and the peace accord in Colombia, a nation with which the United States has a major trade agreement and a history of close cooperation. One problem with nationalist protectionism is that as an ideology, it is prone to double blindness: It is blind both to its exaggerations and to its consequences. Xenophobic nationalists exaggerate the extent to which the outside world takes advantage of the nation. The Chinese are manipulating their currency, Mexicans are taking jobs away, military allies are free-riding, and the rest of the world is misbehaving because it doesn’t fear you enough. And all of this happens “while we sit here like a bunch of dummies,” as Mr. Trump has tweeted. Nationalists thus exaggerate both the relative gains that others make at their expense, and the relative costs their own nations incur. They are blind to the concept of mutual gain; they see only abuse. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/opinion/the-blind-spots-in-trumps-foreign-policy.html?searchResultPosition=38
79,"Updated, 8:11 a.m. Good morning on this sort-of-sunny Thursday. What happens when you bring together 10 teenagers from poor communities and 10 police officers to try to get them to talk? Empathy ensues. “When the cops hear the kinds of things that these kids have gone through — a kid saying, ‘I hate cops because when I was 7 you barged into my house and you took my dad away and I never saw him again,’ cops have said to kids, ‘I don’t know how you live through this,’ ” said Lenora B. Fulani, a developmental psychologist who founded and runs Operation Conversation: Cops & Kids. Through theater and improvisation, the program aims to improve the often-contentious relationship between the police and youths from ages 15 to 21 in black and Latino communities. The empathy goes both ways, Dr. Fulani told us. “When I ask the cops what the hardest thing is about being a cop, the kids are really disturbed that the cops are not home for Christmas and that they’ve missed 10 holidays.” And just like that, Dr. Fulani said, snapping her fingers in the air, “the humanity surfaces on both sides. It’s very beautiful.” The program started after the deadly police shooting of Sean Bell in Queens in 2006. Today, 7,500 New York police officers have either participated in a private workshop or watched a public performance at venues including the Police Academy in Queens, the Apollo in Harlem and the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn.

80,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has relaxed some of the rules for preventing civilian casualties when the American military carries out counterterrorism strikes in Somalia, laying the groundwork for an escalating campaign against Islamist militants in the Horn of Africa. The decision, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations, gives commanders at the United States Africa Command greater latitude to carry out offensive airstrikes and raids by ground troops against militants with the Qaeda-linked Islamist group Shabab. That sets the stage for an intensified pace of combat there, while increasing the risk that American forces could kill civilians. Mr. Trump signed a directive on Wednesday declaring parts of Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” where war-zone targeting rules will apply for at least 180 days, the officials said. The New York Times reported the Pentagon’s request for the expanded targeting authority on March 12, and Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, the top officer at Africa Command, publicly acknowledged that he was seeking it at a news conference last Friday. “It’s very important and very helpful for us to have little more flexibility, a little bit more timeliness, in terms of decision-making process,” General Waldhauser said. “It allows us to prosecute targets in a more rapid fashion.” In a statement issued several hours after The New York Times first published news of the directive, Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged that Mr. Trump had approved the Pentagon’s proposal to expand its targeting authority “to defeat Al Shabab in Somalia” in partnership with African Union and Somali forces.

In an early morning Twitter attack, Mr. Trump singled out members of the House Freedom Caucus, which scuttled his health care overhaul last week. “The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast,” he wrote. “We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!” He continued on Twitter throughout the day, naming individual members of the caucus, likening them to Democrats and urging other Republicans to “fight them” in the 2018 midterm elections if they do not back his agenda. But the Republican upstarts hardly cowered in the face of Mr. Trump’s criticism. They struck back, some of them ridiculing the president, using his own taunting and confrontational social media style. “Stockholm Syndrome?” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia asked on Twitter, suggesting that the president had become captive to the Republican establishment he attacked during the campaign. “It’s a swamp not a hot tub. We both came here to drain it. #SwampCare polls 17%.

82,"When I decided to undergo a lumpectomy earlier this month after a diagnosis of D.C.I.S., I learned a new word that makes me grateful for my privileges but also worried about the privations of others. The word is lagniappe, a bonus, like the 13th doughnut in the purchased dozen. As I went through yet another operation, my way was eased by the kindness of friends and relatives. The greatest extravagance came from my daughters who gave me their precious time. The younger flew in from New York City, the older from Boston. They were my lagniappes, in a sense: a bonus beyond the gift of having a potential health crisis averted. At my age, 72, and with my history, eight years of ongoing treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, I knew that their presence would bolster me. At the hospital, I went straight to radiology in order to undergo what is called the Savi Scout procedure. A mammogram machine was used to locate the calcifications that were causing the concern and then a tiny reflective device was shot into that spot. The radiologist used a black marker to ink an X above the spot on my skin. Later, during the operation, a wand placed on the X would activate radarlike waves: Beeping would send my surgeon to the reflector’s location. It would be removed, the technician explained, along with the abnormal cells. Then I was taken to a preoperative cubicle where I met with the surgeon and the anesthesiologist. I remember being wheeled toward the operating room, positioning myself on a narrow table, and being informed that I was being given something for sedation. I awoke with the comforting awareness of many gifts: my daughters’ company and also the extraordinary expertise of radiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses; the astonishing technologies upon which they relied; my excellent insurance that would compensate them; and my ability to afford the extra services I needed to make the outpatient procedure as easy as possible, including a hired car and driver to take us home. During that ride, still logy from drugs, I received an email from a reader concerned that the Trump administration’s proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act would seriously limit the cancer screenings that Planned Parenthood provides. Federal money is already prohibited from being used to pay for abortions, but the proposal would have cut off more than $400 million in federal funding to Planned Parenthood for other services including birth control, cancer screenings and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.

83,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, who has called the North American Free Trade Agreement “the worst trade deal” ever signed by the United States, appears to have backed off his threat to abandon the deal and is instead proposing keeping major planks in place when he begins renegotiating it later this year. But Mr. Trump, eager to showcase his tough stance against unfair trade practices, plans to sign two executive orders on Friday that will lay the groundwork for new policies and stricter enforcement of trade laws. The president will order a 90-day study of abusive trade practices that contribute to the United States’ trade deficit. The Commerce Department and the United States trade representative will do a country-by-country, product-by-product accounting of the reasons for the imbalance. A second directive is aimed at increasing the collection of duties from countries whose companies American officials believe are selling products in the United States below their cost of production. Neither measure will have an immediate impact on trade policy or enforcement, but each could eventually lead to aggressive new measures. Both are aimed at showcasing Mr. Trump’s intent to fulfill his promises on trade. “These actions are designed to let the world know that this is another step in the president fulfilling his campaign promise,” said Wilbur L. Ross, the secretary of commerce. He said the findings would “form the basis for decision-making by the administration” on how to approach trade deficits in the future, including in a renegotiation of Nafta. “For the first time, we’re looking comprehensively at the source of what has been a large and persistent trade deficit that has contributed to job losses, the loss of our manufacturing base and other things,” said Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump’s National Trade Council.

84,"ATLANTA — For a year, it prompted boycotts, demonstrations and economic fallout that helped dethrone a sitting governor. In the end, in a strange and profoundly American collision of polarized politics, big-time sports, commerce and the culture wars, North Carolina’s notorious House Bill 2 was finally laid to rest on Thursday — though many were left wondering if some of its negative effects might linger. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed legislation repealing the law after it was approved by the Republican-controlled legislature. House Bill 2 had restricted the ability of municipalities to enact anti-discrimination policies and required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. In addition to repealing House Bill 2, the new law gives the General Assembly the sole power to regulate access to “multiple occupancy restrooms, showers or changing facilities.” It also creates a moratorium on local nondiscrimination ordinances through 2020. The compromise agreement came amid a looming threat that the N.C.A.A., which had already relocated a year’s worth of championship tournament games from the state, was planning to eliminate more, including future men’s Division I basketball tournaments. It was met with bitter criticism from gay rights groups, which said it was barely a repeal at all, and from conservatives, who said it backtracked on protecting public safety and traditional values. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Cooper said that the agreement would begin undoing the economic damage and that both sports events and economic development would begin coming back to the state. This week, The Associated Press calculated that North Carolina stood to lose more than $3.7 billion over the next dozen years if House Bill 2 were not repealed. “This is not a perfect deal and it is not my preferred solution; it stops short of many things we need to do as a state,” Mr. Cooper said. “In a perfect world, with a good General Assembly, we would have repealed HB2 fully today, and added full statewide protections for L.G.B.T.

Putin responded publicly on Thursday to the nationwide anticorruption demonstrations with a familiar message: après moi, le déluge. Speaking in the northern port of Arkhangelsk at an international forum on Arctic issues, Mr. Putin defended his record on fighting corruption and warned that such outbursts, if uncontained, could lead to chaos akin to that spawned by the Arab Spring uprisings. Mr. Putin did not mention Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader who called for the demonstrations and who would like to oppose the president in the March 2018 election. But Mr. Putin left little doubt to what, or to whom, he was referring when he called the marches part of a presidential campaign. After accusing unidentified “political forces” of using public concern about corruption to promote their own “selfish interests,” Mr. Putin said this would only end in chaos if allowed to continue. “We well know, and I want to direct your attention to the fact, that this instrument was used in the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring. We know very well what this led to, to what bloody events it led to in this region,” he said. “We likewise know very well that this was one of the inciting motives and pretexts for the coup d’état in Ukraine. We also know well into what chaos these events sunk our neighbor, Ukraine.” Presiding over what some critics portray as a Mafia-like government that has conferred vast riches on a select few friends and associates of the president, Mr. Putin presented himself as a stalwart corruption fighter.

The revelation on Thursday that White House officials disclosed the reports, which Mr. Nunes then discussed with Mr. Trump, is likely to fuel criticism that the intelligence chairman has been too eager to do the bidding of the Trump administration while his committee is supposed to be conducting an independent investigation of Russia’s meddling in the presidential election. It is the latest twist of a bizarre Washington drama that began after dark on March 21, when Mr. Nunes got a call from a person he has described only as a source. The call came as he was riding across town in an Uber car, and he quickly diverted to the White House.

The chain of events — and who helped provide the intelligence to Mr. Nunes — was detailed to The New York Times by four American officials. Since disclosing the existence of the intelligence reports, Mr. Nunes has refused to identify his sources, saying he needed to protect them so others would feel safe going to the committee with sensitive information. In his public comments, he has described his sources as whistle-blowers trying to expose wrongdoing at great risk to themselves.

87,"JERUSALEM — Israel’s government on Thursday approved the establishment of a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time in more than two decades, and also laid the groundwork for further expansion despite a request from President Trump to hold off on settlement activity. It was not immediately clear whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had received a green light from the White House for Thursday’s announcement. Mr. Trump’s public request to hold off on settlements came during a meeting between the two leaders at the White House last month, after a series of moves by the Israeli leader to approve thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank. In a carefully calibrated statement issued two weeks before the meeting, the White House said, “While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.” Previous administrations viewed the settlements as an obstacle to peace, and the Palestinians and much of the world consider them a violation of international law. But it was not immediately clear whether the approval of the new settlement was meant to be a provocative move to scuttle the prospect of a revival of peace talks. Mr. Netanyahu said he was following through on a pledge he made a few weeks ago to 40 settler families who were evacuated from the illegal Amona outpost in the West Bank. That outpost was removed by court order because it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. “I promised at the outset that we would build a new community,” Mr. Netanyahu said earlier Thursday. “I believe that I first gave that promise back in December, and we will uphold it today.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/middleeast/israeli-settlements-netanyahu.html?searchResultPosition=30

The only real question is how the Senate Democrats will express their opposition to the violation of longstanding norms and traditions by Republicans that led to his nomination. The most common options being discussed are a simple “no” vote by the full Democratic bloc or an effort to delay the vote by filibuster, which is expected to lead to a further degradation of Senate rules by the Republican majority. Perhaps a third option should be considered: a boycott of the vote by Senate Democrats. They should refuse to legitimize the confirmation process by taking part. The end result might be the same — a confirmation of Judge Gorsuch by the Republican majority — but the symbolism would be clear.

At the time of the Democratic Senate majority’s 2013 elimination of the filibuster for lower federal court judges and executive branch appointments, The Times, in an editorial titled “Democracy Returns to the Senate,” called the filibuster the Senate’s “most infuriating rule,” and lauded Democrats for the change: “That means a return to the democratic process of giving nominees an up-or-down vote, allowing them to be either confirmed or rejected by a simple majority.” An “infuriating rule” should not be deemed less so, and an undemocratic procedure should not be deemed less so, simply because Republicans now hold a majority in the Senate. The Times ended its 2017 editorial endorsing the filibuster of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination with “What goes around comes around.” Perhaps the 2013 editorial should have ended that way as well.

89,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, aided by Vice President Mike Pence and an ailing Georgia colleague who gingerly made his way to the Capitol with the aid of a wheelchair and a walker, voted Thursday to undo an Obama administration rule preventing states from blocking funding for family planning clinics that also provide abortions. The vote was one of a string of showdowns to reverse Obama-era regulations, but this one unfolded with all the drama of numerous past conflicts over abortion funding — with Mr. Pence casting the tiebreaking vote in his role as president of the Senate. “Today, Congress is sending a resolution to President Trump ensuring that states are not forced to fund America’s abortion giant, Planned Parenthood, with Title X tax dollars,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a prominent anti-abortion group. Taking money away from Planned Parenthood, the bill’s target, has been a longstanding goal of congressional Republicans, but earlier efforts were blocked by Democrats and President Barack Obama. Even with Republicans in full control of Washington, however, the process was not easy. The measure fell under a somewhat obscure and, until recently, rarely used Congressional Review Act that allows a new Congress to undo late actions of a previous presidential administration during the first few months of the year. It returns to the states the power to exclude health care centers that perform abortions from receiving Title X money set aside for family planning and related preventive health services for women. Title X grants cover contraception, as well as cancer and other disease screenings and treatments, but they cannot, under current federal law, be used to pay for abortion services.

In an early morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump lamented what a “shame” it is that “someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost.” Mr. Trump and some of his aides immediately pushed back against the book, “Fear: Trump in the White House,” written by the famed Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, when excerpts were released on Tuesday, a week before it officially goes on sale. The president, who regularly rails against news reports that are not flattering to him and calls them “fake news,” has raised the issue of changing libel laws in the past. In March 2017, the president made a similar appeal when he was unhappy with reporting in The New York Times. “Change libel laws?” he asked.

Tillerson showered praise on Turkey’s government on Thursday, despite what some international critics see as a slide toward authoritarianism, and in response he got an earful of grievances from Turkish officials. Mr. Tillerson’s visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital, was intended to reassure a NATO ally in the fight against the Islamic State and a regional bulwark against a resurgent Iran. Turkish officials have repeatedly protested United States support for and reliance on Kurdish forces in the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria at the same time the Turks are waging a campaign against Kurdish militants inside Turkey. Mr. Tillerson was vague on Thursday when discussing American support for the Kurds, saying only that there were “difficult choices that have to be made.” Standing beside Mr. Tillerson on Thursday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that Turkey expected the United States to cut off aid to Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State, and that American law enforcement should arrest a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania whom the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a coup attempt last July. “We are expecting better cooperation,” Mr. Cavusoglu said.

96,"Ivanka Trump will now have an official job at the White House. It’s an unpaid role as an adviser to her father, the president, but it comes with an office, a title and, presumably, an even higher perch from which to fashion herself as a crusader for working women. “Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties — they should be the norm,” she said at the Republican National Convention last summer. She has written a book, to be published in May, called “Women Who Work.” In her very own West Wing office she will shepherd policy related to “women in the workplace,” according to her lawyer. In April she’s headed to a summit meeting in Berlin on women in the work force. While Ms. Trump may want to be the new face of working motherhood, the reality of the policies she has devised for her father diverge starkly from her rhetoric. They offer very little to most parents, especially the ones who really need the support. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump unveiled his daughter’s plan for six weeks of paid leave for women who give birth. When pressed, Ms. Trump made it clear that her policy was tailored specifically for coping with childbirth and was not meant for new fathers or parents who adopt. It’s a plan that is likely to hurt all working women more than help them. Employers are already more hesitant to hire mothers than other candidates, male or female. Part of what they fear, fair or not, is investing in an employee who will then leave to care for her children for some unknown period, taking all her training and knowledge with her and requiring the company to spend resources hiring a replacement. Their anxiety will be amplified if women are afforded time off from work for a new child and men aren’t. If only mothers get a paid leave benefit when their family welcomes a new child, the stigma falls squarely on one gender.

97,"The Trump administration served notice on Thursday that its next move to deregulate broadband internet service companies would be to jettison the Obama administration’s net neutrality rules, which were intended to safeguard free expression online. The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else. Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet. Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation. In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had “reclassified them as common carriers.” Mr. Spicer said President Trump had “pledged to reverse this overreach.” The Obama-era rules, Mr. Spicer said, were an example of “bureaucrats in Washington” placing restrictions on one kind of company — internet service suppliers — and “picking winners and losers.” Telecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules. They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers.

98,"WASHINGTON — When Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, fresh off helping torpedo his party’s bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, showed up at the Berkeley County Republican meeting on Saturday, he was met with applause and praise in one of the most conservative corners of his district. So less than a week later, after President Trump on Thursday warned the Freedom Caucus that he would “fight them” when they face re-election next year, Mr. Sanford was hardly cowering in fear. Instead, he and other members of the Freedom Caucus returned fire. “Intimidation may work with some in the short term, but it never really works in the long run,” Mr. Sanford said, adding that Mr. Trump should interpret the recalcitrance of conservative lawmakers as an indication of a flawed bill: “What you can’t do is shoot messengers.” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia, another Freedom Caucus member, was even more blunt. “Stockholm Syndrome?” he asked on Twitter above a copy of Mr. Trump’s taunting post, suggesting the president had become captive to the Republican establishment he gleefully flayed during the campaign. Mr. Trump’s attack on fellow Republicans was only the latest and most high profile in the increasingly open warfare within the party that controls Washington but has struggled to gets its legislative agenda off the ground. When Mr. Trump and some Senate Republican suggested that the law should be repaired with the help of Democrats, it was the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who spoke out and discouraged the idea. That, in turn, led Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, to blast Mr. Ryan. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/donald-trump-freedom-caucus.html?searchResultPosition=19
99,"The scale of Syria’s refugee crisis is dizzying. As the war there stretches into a seventh year, more than five million citizens, nearly a quarter of Syria’s prewar population, have fled their country, seeking shelter mainly in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday. Five million people is roughly equal to the population of Norway. If nearly a quarter of the United States’ population left the country, it would be as if the combined populations of California, New York and Florida had disappeared. In addition, 6.3 million Syrians have been internally displaced by the war. Altogether, about half of all Syrians have been forced from their homes because of violence. With no end to the war in sight, Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, predicted that 480,000 more Syrians would become refugees in need of resettlement this year. That is as if the entire population of Sacramento abandoned the city — and the country — over the course of the next nine months. Since the conflict began in 2011, an estimated 400,000 people have been killed. The five million Syrians who escaped war, starvation and deprivation now live mostly in one of five countries, often in squalid camps teeming with people. The majority of those refugees, nearly three million, have sought shelter in Turkey. Turkey, a country of 75 million, has absorbed a contingent of refugees equal to 4 percent of its population. The country’s location on the doorstep of Europe has increased its leverage in negotiations with the West about the fate of refugee resettlement, but the sheer number of people has taxed the country’s resources. Since February alone, 47,000 Syrians have sought refuge in Turkey. Two million other refugees are scattered through Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Last year, the United Nations sought pledges to resettle 500,000 Syrians around the world. Since then, only half that many have been given homes. “We still have a long road to travel in expanding resettlement and the number and range of complementary pathways available for refugees,” Mr. Grandi said. “To meet this challenge, we not only need additional places, but also need to accelerate the implementation of existing pledges.” The United States previously pledged to make 64,000 places available for Syrians. But President Trump has sought to decrease the number of refugees entering the United States. In January, he signed an executive order barring all Syrian refugees from entering the country, but he was forced to replace it when federal courts blocked it. His second order is also tied up, working its way through the courts.

Mr. Cuomo said he and lawmakers had come to agreement on a wide array of subjects, including a plan for tuition-free college at state schools; expanded ride sharing to upstate; changes in workers’ compensation; opioid treatment; water infrastructure; and an extension of the so-called millionaire’s tax, something the governor has said is critical to funding his 2017 agenda.

102,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said he was considering “accelerating” the introduction of his $1 trillion infrastructure bill — but he pointedly refused to say whether he planned to include two major New York City transportation projects that his budget for next year would defund. Mr. Trump, speaking in a wide-ranging interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, described the infrastructure package as a high-value legislative sweetener that he could attach to a revived Affordable Care Act repeal bill or tax code overhaul to attract bipartisan support that thus far he had neither sought nor received. “Infrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill,” said Mr. Trump, who is in need of a legislative win after the humbling defeat of his health care bill last month. “Infrastructure is so popular with the Democrats and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too.” The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on middle- and upper-income real estate development, has proposed eliminating an Obama-era infrastructure program that would have funded long-delayed proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem. State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattan’s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012. As Mr. Trump discussed his plan, hundreds of thousands of commuters endured a third day of upheaval prompted by a minor derailment at Pennsylvania Station, another reminder of the decrepit, tenuous state of much of the region’s infrastructure and transit systems.

This fame and name recognition helped pave his way to the presidency.” “Rookie Biographies: President Donald Trump” (Scholastic Inc.) “In 1993, Trump married Marla Maples.

104,"On Nov. 10, Beth Sutinis sat at her desk in Brooklyn with a big task looming. As the executive editor for the children’s division of Time Inc. Books, she and her colleagues had worked through the fall to update their book “Presidents of the United States.” They added a spread about Barack Obama, another about the 2016 election and a third about Hillary Clinton, who polls had indicated would be elected the 45th president. In the days after the election, Ms. Sutinis scrambled to produce a profile of the person who was elected instead. “It was one of the harder things I have had to do in a long career of writing and editing nonfiction for kids,” she said. Presidential biographies are a staple of children’s book publishing, and of classrooms across the country. Nonfiction for children is a surging category, particularly in light of a Common Core mandate that schools put greater emphasis on it in their curriculum. Publishers like Penguin Young Readers, Scholastic and Time for Kids chronicle stories like the rise of Mr. Obama from Illinois state senator to president, or the political legacy of the Bush family, interspersing those accounts with facts about presidential history. The books hit bookshelves every four years, usually long before historians and writers of nonfiction for adults weigh in. But the story of Donald J. Trump posed a unique set of challenges. After an election cycle whose divisive effect on voters is still being felt, publishing books for classroom use has been unusually perilous. For Ms. Sutinis, the difficulty went beyond the time crunch to finding concise quotations from Mr. Trump’s campaign appearances that didn’t include contentious remarks. Ms. Sutinis’s updated edition outlines Mr. Trump’s business and television career and his campaign. “He made controversial remarks about several groups of people, including Latinos, Muslims, African-Americans and women,” the book reads. “This led many, including some Republican officials, to back away from him.” It goes on: “But Trump continued to receive wide support and thousands of people attended his rallies.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/donald-trump-childrens-books.html?searchResultPosition=69

A year and a half ago, he huddled with two friends in a Quebec maple sugar shack, discussing how to stop the spread of what they call “invasive political Islam” in Canada. They formed a group called La Meute, or Wolfpack, created a Facebook page and invited like-minded people to join. Within a month, they had 15,000 followers. Today, the number has surpassed 50,000, and the group is still attracting people. Now, Mr. Beaudry and his colleagues say they are shaping those followers into dues-paying members who will give the group financial muscle and, they hope, political clout. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has publicly opened Canada’s doors to refugees and presented a face of tolerance and inclusion in a world increasingly hostile to migration.

Nowhere has it galvanized such large numbers as in Quebec, where many people still refer to themselves as pure laine, or pure wool, direct descendants of the 17th-century settlers of New France. The most emotional response has focused on conservative Muslim immigrants, who perhaps present the greatest contrast to traditional European-based culture and the secularism that Quebec struggled hard to win from the Roman Catholic Church. The concerns are outsize by any measure. Muslims represent just 3 percent of Canada’s population, and while Islam is one of the fastest-growing religions in the country, Muslims will still account for less than 6 percent of the population in 2050, according to the Pew Research Center.

106,"WASHINGTON — The new bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act is dead, killed off by House Republicans who never actually read the legislation — because in fact, it never actually existed. Conservative groups moved quickly on Wednesday to shift the blame for the failure of a seven-year promise to repeal the law onto some not-as-conservative Republicans, after a small but powerful group of hard-line House conservatives failed again to come to a meeting of the minds with the Trump administration over how best to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature achievement. “The left wing among House Republicans doesn’t want to compromise or keep their pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare,” David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative free-market advocacy group, said in a statement. “They’ve rejected deals that would give Americans more choices for cheaper health insurance, and now they won’t even allow states the chance to scale back Obamacare’s costliest regulations.” The accusation — echoed by other conservatives — represents a remarkable turnaround in the blame game. The group and its supporters have opposed much of the major legislation considered by Congress in recent years. Last month, a House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed to get enough support to bring it to a vote. About 30 of the most conservative members of the House rejected the bill as preserving too much of the existing law, but as they pressed to dismantle ever more provisions, they pushed away more moderate House Republicans who were leery of leaving 24 million more Americans without health insurance. The effort was left for dead, until Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump administration officials raced up to the Capitol this week to cobble together a new agreement with the most conservative Republicans, the House Freedom Caucus. The revived measure, stirring in its grave, was known informally on Capitol Hill as Zombie Trumpcare.

107,"The Trump administration’s decision to remove its chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, from the National Security Council’s principals committee, along with the deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland’s likely exile to Singapore, as the United States ambassador, seems to indicate that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, is finally getting a little hard-earned bureaucratic traction. Not so fast: Other signals suggest that President Trump’s national security team remains as weak and dysfunctional as ever. And while some people are crediting General McMaster with a big win, the reality is much different. Reportedly from the moment he hired General McMaster, President Trump gave him broad staffing freedom. Yet Ms. McFarland, whom General McMaster wanted out, remained in place for well over a month. More egregiously, in mid-March, General McMaster tried to fire Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council. Mr. Cohen-Watnick, a holdover from Michael Flynn’s aborted stint as national security adviser, complained to Mr. Bannon and Jared Kushner, who prevailed on Mr. Trump to have him reinstated. The idea that the 30-year-old Mr. Cohen-Watnick should be senior director for intelligence programs — a position held by senior career C.I.A. officers in the Obama administration and others — is dubious. Furthermore, General McMaster’s decision to get rid of Mr. Cohen-Watnick was well within his pay grade. And Mr. Trump’s countermanding an understandable and routine staffing decision not only reneged on his deal with General McMaster, it also segued to an episode of clear White House obstructionism. A few days after his reinstatement, Mr. Cohen-Watnick was one of three White House staffers who facilitated a briefing to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on the “incidental surveillance” of Trump campaign staff members, which Mr. Nunes used to distract news media and public attention from the committee’s investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the outcome of the presidential election. A little unpacking revealed how artlessly pretextual this distraction was: Mr. Nunes professed the need to learn new information about surveillance to warn the president, yet that very information was in the possession of the White House and accessible to Mr. Trump without Mr. Nunes’s intervention.

108,"BALTIMORE — A federal judge refused on Wednesday to delay a hearing on a proposed agreement to overhaul the Baltimore Police Department, calling the Trump administration’s request a “burden and inconvenience.” The Justice Department had asked for a delay earlier this week, saying it needed time to review the plan and determine whether the proposal, called a consent decree, would hinder efforts to fight violent crime in the city. Federal District Judge James K. Bredar said the hearing would go on as scheduled on Thursday. With hundreds of people expected to testify, the judge said that pushing back the hearing would be a “burden and inconvenience to the court, other parties and, most importantly, the public.” Judge Bredar noted that it was “highly unusual” that both the city and the Justice Department had requested the hearing to allow Baltimore residents to comment on the proposed consent decree. “The primary purpose of this hearing is to hear from the public,” he wrote. “It would be especially inappropriate to grant this late request for a delay when it would be the public who were most adversely affected by a postponement.” A Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, declined to comment. The Obama Justice Department opened an investigation into accusations of misconduct in the Baltimore Police Department in 2015, after the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who sustained a neck injury while in police custody, plunged the city into unrest. The department published a scathing report outlining widespread abuses, including excessive force, unlawful stops and discriminatory practices. Last month, dozens of organizations and about 50 people submitted 195 pages of written comments on the proposed agreement, which the city reached with the Justice Department during the last days of the Obama administration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo this week announcing his intention to review all existing consent agreements. The Justice Department’s request to postpone the hearing was met with fierce opposition from city officials, including Mayor Catherine E. Pugh and the police commissioner, Kevin Davis, both of whom vowed to press on with an overhaul of the Police Department regardless of what happens with the consent decree. But Commissioner Davis and Ms. Pugh emphasized that a court-enforced agreement would enable the department to put those changes in place.

Two days after a New Jersey Transit train derailed at Pennsylvania Station in New York on Monday, eight of the 21 tracks at the station, North America’s busiest, remained closed on Wednesday, prompting a third day of travel chaos across the region. Officials at Amtrak, which owns Penn Station, said they were working to repair damage caused by the derailment but warned that service might not be fully restored until Friday. Minor train derailments are not uncommon, but this one occurred at one of the worst possible spots: a switch point where multiple tracks connect and space for workers making repairs is tight. So far, the investigation into the derailment has focused on the condition of the tracks, rather than on human error or mechanical problems with the train, according to an official in New Jersey who was briefed on the inquiry but who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The infrastructure damage caused by the derailment was extensive, totaling more than $1 million, the official said.

The head of the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, last week denied the petition to outlaw chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often used on apples, oranges and other crops, even though the agency’s own safety experts concluded that the chemical should be outlawed. Mr. Pruitt did not present any new evidence that it is safe, and said the agency could not be forced to complete a review of chlorpyrifos until 2022, when there is a deadline for re-evaluating it. The E.P.A. had been under a court order to respond by the end of March to a 10-year-old petition to ban the chemical, originally filed in 2007 by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pesticide Action Network. The most recent E.P.A. analysis concluded that children were being exposed to up to 140 times the safe levels of the pesticide through food alone. An earlier report said drinking water can also be contaminated. “The science is clear that this chemical is dangerous,” said Erik Olson, senior attorney and director of the health program at N.R.D.C. “We are asking the court to step in to keep our children safe.” An E.P.A. report issued last November concluded the risks justified a complete ban on chlorpyrifos, citing studies on pregnant women and children done at Columbia University that found evidence of neurodevelopmental effects in children whose mothers were exposed to chlorpyrifos in pregnancy. Dow Chemical, which makes the product, has argued that the science is inconclusive. A review panel of scientists also raised questions about the methodology the agency had used, leading to revisions but not altering the recommendation for a ban.

112,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently ordered a review of federal agreements with a number of local law enforcement agencies aimed at reforming troubled departments. As a first step, the Justice Department on Monday asked a judge to delay a consent decree that would overhaul Baltimore’s police force. On its face, Mr. Sessions’s  order simply asks whether the consent decrees promote public safety, support officers, respect local control and are warranted. But underlying the order is the Trump administration’s belief that efforts to align police practices with the Constitution have compromised public safety and thrown police officers under the bus. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. Countless police chiefs and mayors are vocal about wanting federal reform or have emerged from the consent decree process remarking that their departments were the better for it. Mr. Sessions claims to want to revert to local control, but he should listen to local officials like Baltimore’s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, who called the Justice Department’s request to delay the reform agreement “a punch in the gut” and noted that “a consent decree will make the Baltimore police department better both with the crime fight and our community relationships.” No matter what review Mr. Sessions conducts, he cannot unilaterally undo these reform agreements. That’s because the district courts that oversee them will ultimately decide their fate. In addition, the reforms are negotiated with local elected officials and law enforcement leaders, with extensive input from grass-roots organizations, police unions, officers and civilians. Mr. Sessions can try to undermine them, but many of the reforms are durable. That’s good, because communities around the country need this work to continue. In cities like Ferguson, Mo., Chicago and Baltimore, federal reform addresses unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests, and excessive and retaliatory force. These problems erode trust between police departments and the communities they serve, trust that is essential to effective policing as well as officer and public safety.

114,"WASHINGTON — John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, said Wednesday that it was doubtful that a wall along the full border with Mexico would ever be built, despite an oft-repeated campaign promise by President Trump. “It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,” Mr. Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee. Instead, Mr. Kelly said, the department will look to build physical barriers — including fencing and concrete walls — in places that make sense. He said that the department was still studying the best places to construct such barriers, and that he could not give an estimate of the cost. The first bids for prototypes of the border wall were due Tuesday. According to people briefed on the agency’s plan, the first new section of the wall will be built on a short strip of federally owned land in San Diego, where there is already fencing. Congress has not yet acted on the funding request for the wall, and it faces considerable opposition from Democrats and even some Republicans. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Congress probably would not grant the Trump administration’s request for additional money for the border wall this year, adding that it would most likely be included in the next fiscal year’s appropriation.

One by one, President Trump’s campaign promises seem to be less likely — or at least won’t happen on the timetable he anticipated. So, why are so many chief executives and investors still seemingly bullish about a Trumpian economy? The answer they consistently provide: regulations. Or the promise to get rid of them. But it is actually something else, something that seems vastly underappreciated, that is staring us right in the face: The people whom Mr. Trump has appointed to positions of power can wield significant influence over how business is conducted in America. And in many cases, they can do so unilaterally, without the approval of Congress. The presidency of Donald J. Trump — the wealthiest businessman to occupy the White House in recent memory — has ushered in a new paradigm, one in which business and government are married in a way never seen before. And the people whom Mr. Trump has appointed come from the most senior ranks of business, bringing with them a frame of reference that is almost strictly about profit and economic growth. It isn’t often said aloud, but the aristocracy that Mr. Trump has put in place may be more important than any rule written on paper. And while there are significant questions about whether their experience in business will translate in Washington — and to the Regular Joe who supported Mr. Trump — their focus on issues that relate to the economy and their reverence for increasing G.D.P. have lifted the spirits in corner offices across America. Whether the topic is trade, infrastructure or taxes, to the C.E.O. set, Mr. Trump speaks their language. “We are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads,” Mr. Trump declared on Tuesday in Washington to a group of chief executives representing companies like Citigroup, MasterCard and JetBlue.

117,"WASHINGTON — When North Korea launched a medium-range missile on Tuesday evening, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson issued a statement so cryptic that it left much of Washington confused. “North Korea launched yet another intermediate-range ballistic missile,” it began. “The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.” In fact, the Trump administration has said very little about North Korea, apart from some Twitter posts and Mr. Tillerson’s own statements in Seoul, South Korea, two weeks ago — when he said the United States would negotiate with North Korea only after it gave up its nuclear weapons and missiles. And that is unlikely to happen. A comprehensive policy review, ahead of the visit of China’s president, Xi Jinping, to the United States this week, came to an unsurprising conclusion: The administration would greatly intensify economic and military pressure on the North for the foreseeable future, and assure the Chinese that, once that pressure was in place, it would consider “engaging” the North Koreans. That is, the United States would negotiate with them, presumably before they have given up their nuclear weapons and missiles, despite Mr. Tillerson’s earlier statements. Mr. Tillerson has made clear he will be a secretary of few words, preferring to do his deals behind closed doors and open himself to as little probing of the strategy as possible. But in the absence of much public comment, American allies seem confused about the administration’s strategy of coercive diplomacy. It is unclear whether the goal is to force the North Koreans to surrender their arsenal, as Mr. Tillerson suggested, or just freeze missile and nuclear tests and open a negotiation. And many of those allies wonder how increasing pressure is likely to succeed when directed against a country that has survived financial cutoffs, trade sanctions and the presence of surrounding military forces for more than six decades.

118,"This article has been updated to reflect news developments. The word “filibuster” sounds silly, like the name of a pompous but ultimately well-meaning character in a Dickens novel. The phrase “nuclear option,” on the other hand, sounds terrifying. So now that the Republicans have used the nuclear option to kill the poor filibuster to clear the way for the elevation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, we can lose perspective. In truth, eliminating the filibuster is a minor change compared with the problem that such a move takes a step toward solving: the recent rise of a system based on supermajority rule rather than majority rule. Of course, the modern filibuster, which remains in effect for legislation, doesn’t require senators to give speeches through the night. It’s all very abstract; in the case of nonspending bills, the minority party simply let it be known that it has enough votes to block the legislation. In effect, the minority party now gets to decide when a bill should require 60 votes instead of 51. The switch to supermajority rule happened without a constitutional amendment, without a national debate, without its even becoming a major issue in a presidential campaign. Because it happened gradually, we didn’t fully appreciate: The 788 filibusters since 2007 — those were the “nuclear” moments. It’s also confusing that the Republicans are saying: Don’t worry. Although we’re ending the filibuster against Supreme Court nominees, we’ll still allow the procedure to block legislation. If anything, there’s more of a case for eliminating the filibuster for congressional bills than for the court. If a horrible justice gets on the court, he or she is there for life; if a destructive piece of legislation gets through, it can be repealed. I remember vividly when I first became aware that the “Schoolhouse Rock” version of how a bill becomes a law had quietly disappeared. I was covering Congress for Newsweek during the Clinton administration. The Democrats were pushing legislation to create a national service program, which had broad support.

119,"Think things are dire? So does Joshua Tillman, the songwriter who is releasing “Pure Comedy,” his third album as Father John Misty. The title of “Pure Comedy” is one of the album’s very few jokes, a bit of blunt irony for an all-too-persuasive set of songs envisioning global catastrophe as the inevitable result of human nature. Singing with earnest clarity, Father John Misty indicts selfishness, ignorance, distraction, vanity, politics, self-delusion, dogmatism, technocracy, God and, by no means least, himself. Midway through the album, like a roadblock, is “Leaving L.A.,” a plaintive 13-minute dirge with lyrics that accurately describe it as “some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe.” It’s morose, but also plush; Mr. Tillman croons those 10 verses atop soothing string-section arrangements. And the song grows into an acutely self-conscious, autobiographical portrait of where Mr. Tillman finds himself now, questioning his own role as a songwriter, careerist and maybe artist, or, as he sarcastically puts it, “Another white guy in 2017/Who takes himself so goddamn seriously.” The album is a self-questioning singer-songwriter’s reaction to the beginning of the Trump years, interrogating himself and his listeners about what culture can possibly accomplish. At a Father John Misty performance on July 23, the day after Mr. Trump’s dystopian convention speech accepting the Republican nomination, Mr. Tillman cut his set short and gave a harangue, complaining about entertainment “numbing” its consumers and ranting about how “stupidity just [expletive] runs the world.” On the album, he extrapolates further in “Total Entertainment Forever,” envisioning a world where the pleasures of virtual reality have entirely supplanted real life: Mr. Tillman has recorded extensively since 2003 as J. Tillman and has been in and out of bands, including a stint as the drummer in Fleet Foxes. He uses the Father John Misty name as both a mouthpiece and a persona, as a questionable character navigating an overripe, compromised world. The song that opened Father John Misty’s 2012 debut, “Fear Fun,” was “Funtimes in Babylon,” a sardonic embrace of Hollywood excess. Mr. Tillman had a strict religious upbringing that he broke away from, but he is still making moral arguments. Father John Misty is also a musical throwback. His bleak contemporary tidings arrive in rich, retro settings. The sound harks back to the late 1960s and early 1970s era of singer-songwriters, particularly those who were clustered around Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles and living a hippie dream of self-expression and self-indulgence, amid vintage guitars and well-equipped studio hideaways.

120,"An inappropriate touch. An insulting dismissal. A sexual ultimatum. A suggestion that a job is not fit for a woman. Droves of women have shared their own experiences with workplace sexual harassment on social media this week, spurred by claims against Bill O’Reilly, the Fox News host. The revelation that five women received settlements totaling $13 million after accusing him of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior has prompted more than 20 companies to pull advertising from his show, while others have called for his dismissal. The outpouring came six months after thousands of women posted accounts of being groped or assaulted in the wake of Donald J. Trump’s boasts on tape that he had forced himself on women. In each case, social media offered an outlet for women who said they had either been too afraid or too ashamed to describe their experiences publicly, or to report them in their workplaces for fear of retaliation. As reports circulated about the O’Reilly case, a hashtag, #droporeilly, was born, and it soon morphed into a meeting place for women to describe the professional mistreatment they said they had endured. One of those women, Kerri McKeand, 40, a paralegal from Chicago, offered her experience of working as an assistant to a project manager on the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago, about 10 years ago. When she was required to visit a construction site, she and a female colleague were asked to appear less feminine by taping down their breasts, not wearing makeup and hiding their hair with bandannas, she said in an interview on Wednesday. Ms. McKeand refused to comply with the restrictions, she said. During that visit, while on an elevator with men, she was sexually harassed, and a pornographic magazine was tossed at her feet, she said. She reported it to her boss who, according to Ms. McKeand, said, “I told you this would happen.” It was clear that “nothing would be done about it,” she added. “It was just kind of this accepted culture in this industry.” She said that those experiences had led her away from the construction field. Becoming a project manager seemed like the highest position a woman could attain, she said. Many other women shared similar experiences. Ms. McKeand said she was heartened by women’s willingness to share their stories on social media. “Silence is pervasive, and I think the more silent we are about it, the more it will continue,” she said. “It’s especially important for younger women to know that these things exist and to know what they can do when they are faced with these situations.” “I had no idea when I was younger of what sexual harassment was, what my rights were,” she added, citing an incident when she was 17, when her boss made her sit on his lap. “So hopefully this dialogue puts that in the forefront, so women can go into the work force having an idea of what’s acceptable and what’s not.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-women.html?searchResultPosition=85
121,"To the Editor: Re “Chemical Attack on Syrians Ignites World’s Outrage” (front page, April 5): The Obama administration responded to the 2013 use of chemical weapons weakly at first, only later ramping up its support of human rights even after the famous “red line” had been crossed. President Barack Obama learned that empty threats are ineffective, and that it is better to speak softly but carry a big stick, as reflected in the final years of his administration. President Trump should learn from Mr. Obama and act on the blatant violation of human rights and international law immediately. If not, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria will continue to see signs of weakness and respond only by continued, if not increased, use of chemical weapons. Furthermore, inaction would signal to President Vladimir Putin that the United States is unwilling to stand up for human rights or even the validity of international law, as he probably already suspects. This will inevitably lead to greater Russian influence and mischief in Syria and the Middle East. Appeasement is not the answer. The United States must maintain its global influence and cannot turn a blind eye to the immorality of chemical weapon use. Our response must demonstrate commitment to moral authority, universal human rights and a vigorous defense of liberal democratic values. PATRICK BRANDER NEWCOMBE

Mr. Xi is known to be an avid soccer fan, bent on transforming China into a great power in that egalitarian team sport, but the Chinese Communist Party maintains an ideological contempt for golf as a rich person’s game. That view, among others, places him at odds with President Trump, who owns more than a dozen golf courses and whose so-called Winter White House, the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., charges more than $200,000 for membership. However he spends his time at Mar-a-Lago, “it’s safe to say there’s not going to be any golf,” the White House said in a statement. Mr. Trump, who played 18 holes with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan during his visit in February, will have to find another way to build a warm rapport with his Chinese counterpart. Although as many as a million people in China, not necessarily part of the wealthy elite, play golf, the game has become a symbol of capitalist excesses and corruption in the eyes of the Communist Party. That view goes back to 1949, when Mao Zedong declared golf the “sport for millionaires.” Mr. Xi has led a crackdown on corruption, and golf has been depicted as a temptation that has led party officials astray. Dozens of courses across China have been shut in recent years, ostensibly to preserve water and arable lands. What might Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi do instead of playing golf in between discussions about trade or what to do about North Korea’s nuclear provocations? “It’s possible that they’ll walk around a bit, as the mood strikes,” the White House statement said, “but nothing formal or nothing involving golf clubs.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/world/asia/xi-jinping-golf-trump-mar-a-lago.html?searchResultPosition=97
126,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve expects to start reducing its huge investment holdings later this year, unwinding a giant program undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis to revive the economy. The holdings — which amount to more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage securities — are a legacy of the Fed’s campaign to help the economy recover from the depths of a recession. The Fed, increasingly confident that the American economy is “at or near maximum employment,” is beginning to loosen its grip on the economy, according to an official account that the Fed published Wednesday. Officials voted at the meeting in March to raise the Fed’s benchmark interest rate — the third time since the financial crisis — to a range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Since the meeting, Fed officials have said that it is on course to increase rates by at least an additional half a percentage point this year. Both the low rates and the investments were intended to support growth by encouraging risk-taking and borrowing by consumers and businesses. Now the Fed is gradually reducing that support. No decision was made about the timing or the details of any move to reduce the Fed’s holdings. The markets took the news with relative calm, suggesting that investors share the central bank’s assessment that the economy is getting closer to walking without crutches. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has traded in a narrow range since December, even as the Fed has raised rates twice. Indeed, some analysts said the Fed might need to take stronger steps to end its stimulus campaign. “Financial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways,” said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock’s U.S. multi-sector fixed income team.

Here’s what the available evidence, including a declassified four-page American intelligence report, tells us about the reliability of the Russian account. Russian officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, have publicly doubted whether a toxic attack even happened, and said that any chemical weapons in Syria belonged to insurgents fighting President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, not the government. The White House has asserted that the Assad government carried out the attack, and that the Russians tried to cover it up by spreading “false narratives.” There is no evidence that online video and photographs of the attack were fabricated, as Russia’s deputy envoy to the United Nations suggested last week. The images showed that scores of people, including children, died on April 4 in Khan Sheikhun, in northern Syria, suffering symptoms consistent with having breathed in some sort of nerve agent. On Tuesday, the Turkish health minister, Recep Akdag, confirmed a preliminary report that sarin had been used after an examination of the blood and urine of four victims who were evacuated from Syria to Turkey after the attack. Russian officials, citing their own monitoring systems, say a Syrian airstrike around noon on April 4 hit weapons-storage facilities on the eastern outskirts of Khan Sheikhun under the control of insurgents, including a “terrorist warehouse” where they were making “projectiles stuffed with chemical agents” to send to fighters in Iraq.

Ferguson was one of many predominantly black communities across the country that were under white control, and they strategized about ways to change that. But those hopes for sweeping increases in black political leadership have not come to fruition, a point driven home in the mayoral election this week. Although much of the activism today stems from the killing of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, voters here — at least the few who turned out — re-elected James Knowles III, a white Republican who has been the object of much scorn among those who believe the city has discriminated against black people. About 67 percent of the city’s 21,000 residents are black, and 29 percent are white, according to the 2010 census. Some activists are now assessing what is happening politically for black people and whether there needs to be a complete rethinking of how they engage with mainstream politics. “With all that’s happened within the past two years nationally, I think I am concerned,” said Allen Frimpong, an activist based in New York. “I would expect that folks would, at the very least, move to the polls, and that’s not happening.

His two days of talks at Mar-a-Lago with President Xi Jinping will test whether the two men — Mr. Trump an unpredictable novice, Mr. Xi a tightly scripted, experienced leader — can begin to effectively manage the world’s most significant bilateral relationship. By undoing American support for an international agreement on climate change, repudiating an Asia-oriented trade deal and calling for funding cuts for the United Nations, Mr. Trump has already ceded leadership in key areas to Mr. Xi, who is eager to expand Beijing’s role as an international power and has increasingly positioned his country as a competitor of the United States. It will be disastrous for America and the world if Mr. Trump continues on this disengagement path. Mr. Trump does seem to appreciate the threat from North Korea’s rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs, putting that matter at the top of his agenda. He could hardly avoid it, given the fact that the North conducted another missile test on Tuesday as Mr. Xi was en route to the United States. Mr. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he expects China, the North’s main supplier of food and fuel, to increase pressure beyond what it has been willing to do so far to force an end to the weapons programs. In an interview in The Financial Times on Monday, he was even more demanding, warning that the United States would take unilateral action to eliminate the nuclear threat if Beijing fails to act, presumably by curbing trade and assistance. Analysts say China may be willing to increase pressure somewhat on North Korea, but well short of causing the regime in Pyongyang to collapse. Most experts believe that the North will not abandon its nuclear program unless the leadership at the top changes. China opposes this because it fears a surge of refugees into its territory and wants to keep North Korea as a buffer against a potentially unified Korean Peninsula dominated by the American military.

In fact, the governor was far from where the chaos was unfolding, choosing to go to Atlantic City to celebrate the opening of a casino while travelers vented their frustration on social media, on radio call-in shows and on packed platforms. The derailment on Monday of a New Jersey Transit train did not just cripple New Jersey Transit; it also disrupted service on Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road, the two other rail systems that share Penn Station. But it has been riders of New Jersey Transit, the nation’s third-busiest railroad, who have endured the worst travel experiences. Along with anger, many riders said someone had to be responsible for the missed hours of work, the lost wages, the extra costs from extended day care, the wasted — and increasingly expensive — gas. And many of them set their sights on Mr. Christie. “He’s nowhere to be found, while literally hundreds of thousands of his constituents are struggling and businesses are losing money,” said Dave Geller, 44, who had to work from his home in Maplewood on Wednesday. “At some point the buck has to stop where?

They also know that in 2010, Mr. Christie scuttled plans for a new tunnel that had been scheduled to open next year. Mr. Christie’s commitment to public transit has been a recurring issue. Under his administration, the state subsidy to New Jersey Transit plummeted 90 percent. And for years, he had steadfastly refused to support an increase in the state’s gas tax to help finance the depleted transportation fund used to finance transit projects, relenting only late last year. However, he did sign a bill last month authorizing $400 million in spending on New Jersey transportation.

133,"WASHINGTON — One by one, the senators shuffled to the lectern on Wednesday, explaining themselves grimly, reflecting on the specter of mutually assured destruction and wondering aloud how the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch had delivered the institution to this moment. It was the eve of two seminal votes for the Capitol’s upper chamber: an expected Democratic filibuster of Judge Gorsuch on Thursday and a likely rule change pushed by Republicans — the so-called nuclear option — to bypass the filibuster and confirm President Trump’s selection with a simple majority vote. On a few points, at least, bipartisan consensus seemed to have congealed: This is terrible for the Senate. This is terrible for the country. And this is happening. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, spoke of the “further and perhaps irreparable damage it will do to the United States Senate.” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, suggested it was a trying time to be a lawmaker who prides herself “as one who believes in the traditions of the Senate.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court.html?searchResultPosition=77

The visit to Excel Academy, an all-girls charter school, by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Queen Rania of Jordan and Melania Trump, the first lady, was meant to emphasize the Trump administration’s stance on school choice. But it was also part of a day of photo ops intended to cast a softer lens on a presidential administration grappling with several international crises, and provide another glimpse of a first lady whose sporadic appearances in Washington have revealed relatively little about her own leadership style. Earlier in the day, Mrs. Trump and Queen Rania stood behind President Trump and King Abdullah II of Jordan at the White House. It was just one item on Wednesday’s agenda, which was also packed with a news conference to condemn a chemical attack in Syria and meetings to discuss brokering a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

135,"FRANKFURT — When Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, met with President Trump in Washington, she brought three executives with her, all heads of German manufacturing or engineering giants. Their message? Germany is not a threat to the United States. For decades, the United States has been a kind of second home to German carmakers, a place not only to sell vehicles but also to build them. German manufacturers employ thousands at plants across the United States, and produce finished products like cars, as well as parts and machinery, within the country for sale domestically or export abroad. But that the point — made during a session that included the chief executives of BMW, the carmaker; Siemens, the electronics and engineering company; and Schaeffler, a major supplier of parts for automotive engines, transmissions and chassis — needed to be made at all underlines growing concern in Berlin over hostility directed at German industry by the Trump administration. Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, has accused Germany of being a currency manipulator, even though German politicians and economists are among the staunchest critics of European Central Bank policies that have encouraged a weak euro. And the American president himself wondered aloud to a German newspaper in January why Americans buy lots of Mercedes cars while Germans hardly buy any Chevrolets. The anger from the Trump administration has been a rude shock, threatening the bedrock of Germany’s economy and leaving executives perplexed. Their quandary is one faced by business across Europe: Mr. Trump has questioned the assumptions that have underpinned trans-Atlantic commerce since the end of World War II, without making clear what could come instead. “I think there is a little bit lack of understanding,” Harald Krüger, the chief executive of BMW, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show in March, not long after Mr. Trump had attacked the company for building a plant in Mexico. “Maybe there hasn’t been enough data supplied before.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/dealbook/germany-us-trade-trump.html?searchResultPosition=110
136,"WASHINGTON — When Congress voted to overturn internet privacy rules last month, the swift action by Republican lawmakers sent a clear message: They were just getting started. The next target is net neutrality, which is the guarantee that all internet content is equally accessible. That could be followed by cuts in broadband subsidies for low-income households and a relaxation in rules preventing media consolidation in local markets. Republican regulators and lawmakers have been waiting for this moment. Coordinating across the government, they are putting several telecommunications and technology policies created during the Obama administration on the chopping block. Already, Ajit Pai, the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who was appointed to the agency by President Barack Obama and named to lead it by President Trump, has begun chipping away at the low-income broadband subsidy and net neutrality rules created by his Democratic predecessor. “There was a good bit of overreach by the past F.C.C. that caused a lot of confusion,” said Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who was vice chairwoman for President Trump’s transition. “We are going to have technology and telecommunications policy that is light touch.” In a major philosophical shift from the Obama administration, Republican leaders have said they will look for proof of harm before creating new regulations for telecom firms. They believe antitrust and consumer protection laws suffice for government oversight of the sector. “The F.C.C. needs a more evidence-based approach,” said Roslyn Layton, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who was on Mr. Trump’s F.C.C. transition team. “No one is writing in and asking for Title 2 reclassification of broadband.

The president declined to offer any details about potential action. But he said his horror at the images of “innocent children, innocent babies” choked by poison gas in a rebel-held area of Syria had caused him to reassess his approach. Only days after the White House declared it would be “silly” to persist in trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Mr. Trump said, “My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.” “It crossed a lot of lines for me,” the president declared at a news conference in the Rose Garden, referring to the “red line” that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had drawn before a 2013 poison-gas attack by Mr. Assad’s forces. Mr. Obama’s failure to strike Syria after that, Mr. Trump claimed, sowed the conditions for this new assault. The estimated death toll was reported to have exceeded 100. Syria was one of several places, along with North Korea and Iran, where Mr. Trump on Wednesday threatened a forceful American response. But in all these cases, he declined to disclose options, arguing that there was a need for surprise but stoking worries that his fledgling administration is not ready to deal with multiple threats across the Middle East and Asia. At the United Nations, Mr. Trump’s ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, warned that the United States might take unilateral action if the Security Council failed to respond to this latest atrocity in Syria. A shift in policy could include airstrikes, which were considered and ultimately rejected by Mr. Obama.

139,"Bull markets aren’t what they used to be, at least when it comes to New York’s economy. Although the stock market is surging and profits on Wall Street last year hit their highest level since 2012, the good times are not translating into jobs the way they did a decade ago, before the financial crisis and the Great Recession hit. Employment in the securities industry in New York City has risen for three straight years. But, at 177,000, there are still 10,000 fewer jobs in the sector than in 2008. And even if the stock market keeps rising and shares of behemoths like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to hit postcrisis highs, don’t expect a surge in hiring on the Street. “The securities industry is still a pretty important source of very highly paid, very highly skilled jobs, but it’s not really contributing to growth in the number of jobs,” said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. To be sure, financial services and banking remain a key part of the overall economy in the tristate area. The financial services and securities industry is the largest private-sector contributor to tax revenue in New York State. What economists call the ‘‘multiplier effect’’ is especially high for finance jobs, since annual bonuses for bankers end up in the pockets of people like contractors, gardeners, jewelers, car dealers and real estate brokers. What is more, Wall Street remains crucial for the region’s tax base, especially for New York State. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of Albany’s tax revenues last year, and about 7 percent of the city’s tax haul.

A leaked list of the Trump administration’s priority projects seemed to speak to the scope of the president’s ambitions: a high-speed rail line linking Houston and Dallas; a desalination plant in Orange County, Calif.; and improvements to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana, the longest continuous bridge over water in the world. Then came Mr. Trump’s budget proposal, which would slash the Department of Transportation’s spending by 13 percent, end subsidies for Amtrak’s long-distance trains and eliminate the Obama administration’s “Tiger” grant program, which has helped fund mass transit systems across the country. Among the potential victims of the president’s proposed cutbacks: Maryland’s long-awaited Purple Line, a planned 16-mile light rail system through the capital’s suburbs. Maryland had been just four days away from clinching some $900 million in federal aid in August when a federal judge ruled to temporarily invalidate environmental approvals for the project. But under President Trump’s plan, projects that don’t yet have complete federal funding agreements would be financed “by the localities that use and benefit from these localized projects.” Supporters of the project are devastated. “It was on the one-yard line,” said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association, a Washington-based advocacy group.

Sadly, drug resistance is causing us to lose our ability to treat these infections. We urgently need to develop next-generation diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics.

The former Massachusetts congressman says that President Trump is vowing to roll back financial regulations that even some of the biggest players in the banking industry have quietly come to tolerate. Many Americans — outside the financial industry — are not clamoring to scrap Dodd-Frank either, or even know what the law really does, said Mr. Frank, a Democrat who helped write it. So why is Mr. Trump adding Dodd-Frank to the long list of regulations he’s seeking to undo? “He has to denigrate everything the Democrats did,” says Mr. Frank, who retired from the House in 2013. “I think he has to say he inherited a mess. Well, he has to find a mess.” DealBook caught up with Mr. Frank last month as he was arriving in New York for a meeting at Signature Bank, a small lender, where he now serves on the board. Our conversation spanned a variety of issues that were addressed in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Regulation of derivatives was a major focus, owing to market-disrupting blowups like a trading scandal at JPMorgan Chase that came to be known as the “London Whale” episode, and the near-collapse of the insurance giant American International Group, or A.I.G., because of derivatives. We also talked about the political tug-of-war over a new consumer protection agency the law created called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, known as the C.F.P.B.  When President Trump signed an order in February to revisit financial regulation, including parts of Dodd-Frank, he said that the law had prevented a lot of his friends “that have nice businesses” from borrowing money.

143,"If your tax rate were lowered tomorrow, how would it affect your work habits? Maybe you would work harder — put in longer hours, take on special projects, do everything you can to get that next promotion. After all, lower taxes would mean you get to keep more of each dollar you earn. Or maybe you would work less. After all, if you are happy with your current standard of living, lower taxes would mean that you could maintain it while putting in fewer hours at the office. Who needs that promotion when you’re able to keep more of the money you already make? Or possibly you would work exactly the same amount, because life is too short to sit around making every decision based on what is in the tax code. That little mental exercise — and the fact that reasonable people may choose any of the options — helps explain why the Trump administration’s plans to induce stronger economic growth by cutting taxes won’t necessarily work. At the core of decades of Republican economic policy is a simple idea: Cutting taxes will unleash investments and lead to higher incomes, more jobs and more rapid growth. And there are historical episodes that would seem to support that idea, most notably when Ronald Reagan cut taxes in the early 1980s, and the economy boomed in the years that followed. But there’s considerably less evidence that this cause-and-effect applies at all times and at all places. George W. Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were followed by years of disappointing growth. Bill Clinton’s tax increases in 1993 were followed by a boom that surpassed the Reagan-era expansion.

Mr. Bharara, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was among 46 United States attorneys who were asked on March 10 to submit their resignations.

In truth, it may not make that much of a difference at all. In an unexpected way, it may well herald the beginning of a better era for the Senate. The Senate Republicans’ successful effort on Thursday to end the 60-vote threshold to proceed with confirmation of Supreme Court nominees was really only the final step in a process set in motion by Democrats in 2013, when they removed that threshold for other nominees. That set off a far bigger firestorm, and Republicans have now simply extended that precedent. Republicans are quick to point out — and many Democrats privately agree — that had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the White House last year and Democrats taken the Senate, a similar confrontation would have been likely in the other direction, and that Democrats might have needed to take the same step Republicans took to confirm any Supreme Court nominee Mrs. Clinton had chosen. Congress has already been dwelling in the rubble for a while.

152,"It’s going to take a lot of tape and scissors to piece together a leveraged buyout of Staples Inc. that works. Staples, the office-supplies chain, is reportedly in talks with private equity shops about a possible deal. According to Reuters Breakingviews calculations, however, the investment proposition looks shaky. Since a plan to merge with Office Depot was shot down by United States regulators last year, Staples has replaced its chief executive and renewed efforts to slash costs. Sales at its 1,500-plus stores in the United States and Canada fell 7 percent last year and now account for less than 40 percent of some $18 billion in revenue. The rest comes from online and business customers. The company’s clean balance sheet and about $900 million a year of operating cash flow make it a buyout candidate, on paper. A 30 percent premium to its undisturbed market value, before news reports about a possible sale, would make the price tag about $7.4 billion. Buyouts often rely on increasing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, but in this case merely stopping the decline would be an achievement. Most leveraged buyouts these days involve an equity check for about 40 percent of the value. Though it would amplify the risk, at just 30 percent, Staples’s debt would come in under four times its $1.3 billion of expected Ebitda. That’s practicable. Then assume the buyer could sell Staples again in five years at the same multiple of Ebitda as it paid, just shy of six times. The company’s dividends run around $300 million a year. Suppose generously that the new owner could squeeze out the same amount even after paying interest on $5 billion of debt. Tally it all up, and the internal rate of return would reach 14 percent. It’s decent, but falls short of the usual buyout target and would require exemplary execution in a tough business at a company that’s currently shrinking. Combining with Office Depot would transform the calculus. Staples once envisioned $1 billion a year of annual synergies, which would improve returns sharply. There’s a notion among deal makers that the Trump administration will ease up on competition reviews. The new president also wants to preserve American jobs, though. That makes a merger far-fetched — and may leave any Staples buyout plan strictly on the back of an envelope.

Since the election of President Trump, members of the artistic community have come together frequently for charity and protest concerts in New York City. “Dear America” is another fund-raising effort for organizations like Planned Parenthood and the Southern Poverty Law Center — but it might be one of the most diverse lineups for a benefit show staged in the still-young Trump administration. “Dear America” will feature appearances by the performance artist Amanda Palmer, the singer-songwriters Regina Spektor and Elvis Perkins, the opera singer Julia Bullock, and writers and thinkers like A. M. Homes and Anand Giridharadas.
212-353-1600, websterhall.com KAREN ELSON at Rough Trade NYC (April 7, 9 p.m.). To produce her 2010 debut album, “The Ghost Who Walks,” the British singer-songwriter and model Karen Elson teamed up with the rock star Jack White, who was her husband at the time. Accordingly, the album was adorned with hallmarks of Mr. White’s style; many of Ms. Elson’s tunes sounded like long-lost rockabilly songs played on a dusty Victrola. After divorcing Mr. White in 2013, Ms. Elson has continued to make music: The results, as heard on her second record, “Double Roses,” are strikingly bright, breezy and beautiful. She’s celebrating the arrival of the new material, out on Friday, with this intimate show.

The steep cost for admission might be worth it: Since James Murphy and his crew of disco-funk wizards reunited in 2016, after a five-year hiatus, they have proved themselves to be one of the best live bands in the country right now. This run of concerts is also a celebration of the opening of the new concert venue Brooklyn Steel.
bowerypresents.com NEW ORDER at Radio City Music Hall (April 13, 8 p.m.). After Ian Curtis, the frontman of the seminal British postpunk band Joy Division, died in 1980, his bandmates soldiered on with the new wave group New Order, which had a string of hits in the 1980s with songs like “Bizarre Love Triangle” and “Blue Monday.” The group underwent another reinvention of sorts two years ago, when it released its 10th studio album, “Music Complete,” without the help of New Order’s founding bassist, Peter Hook. Now, the band is returning to the United States for a limited run of shows, including top-billed slots at the Coachella music festival in Indio, Calif., this month. For this Radio City Music Hall concert, expect a set list that celebrates the group’s significant musical career, mixing Joy Division classics like “Love Will Tear Us Apart” with newer, club-ready bangers from its terrific latest record.

Since 1999, this Austin-based group has made wonderfully uplifting and tuneful instrumental music with an array of quirky instruments like vintage synthesizers and lo-fi drum machines. It’s the kind of material that would lend itself well to movie soundtracks, and in fact, the group has scored movies like the 2012 drama “Kid-Thing” and the coming comedy “Damsel,” a western starring Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. For this show, however, the Octopus Project will be showcasing songs from its new album, “Memory Mirror,” which deftly veers from dazzling Afro-pop guitar hooks to bizarre, psychedelic workouts.

154,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday night that the United States had carried out a missile strike in Syria in response to the Syrian government’s chemical weapons attack this week, which killed more than 80 civilians. “Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the air base in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched,” Mr. Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.” Mr. Trump — who was accompanied by senior advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist; Reince Priebus, his chief of staff; his daughter Ivanka Trump; and others — said his decision had been prompted in part by what he called the failures by the world community to respond effectively to the Syrian civil war. “Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically,” the president said, referring to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. “As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen, and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.” The Pentagon announced that 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired at Al Shayrat airfield in Syria. The missiles were aimed at Syrian fighter jets, hardened aircraft shelters, radar equipment, ammunition bunkers, sites for storing fuel and air defense systems.

155,"The sign on the subway door says it plainly: “Riding or moving between cars is prohibited.” Generally, the sign is obeyed. But during an untamed time, not long ago, New Yorkers routinely slid open the doors at the ends of train cars and stood in the open space as the train hurtled through the tunnel. New Yorkers like the future president of the United States. “I understand the subway very well,” President Trump told The New York Times on Wednesday when quizzed about his knowledge of the city’s infrastructure. “I used to ride between the cars.” That was in his days at Kew-Forest School in Queens, Mr. Trump said, which were in the late 1950s. As the city and the subway system deteriorated in subsequent decades, riding between cars became part of the chaotic subterranean landscape: Trains were covered with graffiti and broke down often, passengers smoked cigarettes or worse, and doors between cars banged open and shut of their own accord, practically inviting trespass. “The people who ride our system now consider the ability to cross between cars their personal right,” a subway official wrote in 1983 to a federal safety board that was pressing the Transit Authority to outlaw crossing between cars when the trains were stopped. A seldom-enforced law against traveling between the cars of a moving train was already on the books. On an N train on Thursday, Ronald Dupree, a bouncer and car salesman who grew up in Brownsville, Brooklyn, recalled his childhood pastime fondly. “It was something to do — you’d feel the breeze,” Mr. Dupree, 46, said.

156,"Stephen K. Bannon, the architect of Donald Trump’s campaign and presidency, is a man with a lot of ideas. He believes that Western civilization is locked in an existential battle with the barbarians at the gates, that nationalists must wrest control from the aloof and corrupt globalist elite, and that America is a once great nation shackled by welfare for both the poor and the wealthy. It was a version of this narrative, market-tested on Breitbart News, that carried Mr. Trump to the presidency. One way to understand Trumpism is as applied Bannonism. The first few months of President Trump’s term have been an attempt to put all of that theory into practice, and by any reasonable standard, that attempt has failed. As it turns out, there’s a difference between spinning yarns and the careful needlework of piecing together policy and political coalitions. The travel ban was Mr. Bannon’s first high-profile defeat. The hastily written and sloppily executed executive order, intended to halt immigration and travel from seven Middle Eastern countries, was immediately met by widespread protests. Mr. Bannon attempted to spin this as a feature, not a bug, an attempt to provoke opposition from the right set of enemies, but even nominal allies recoiled from the ban’s capriciousness. Worse, the executive order was quickly halted by the courts, and even a revised version has not yet been able to pass muster with the judiciary. Mr. Bannon’s most recent defeat is his removal from the National Security Council. As with the travel ban, he and his allies attempted to cast this as part of the plan. In his telling, he had taken a place on the council only to undo the work of Susan Rice, President Obama’s national security adviser; his allies said he was there to monitor Michael Flynn, the first national security adviser under President Trump. With those tasks accomplished, his work on the council was done. These explanations were quickly countered by leaks that portrayed Mr. Bannon as the loser of an internal power struggle, a depiction implicitly confirmed by leaks from his own camp. The media has cultivated the reputation of Steve Bannon as chessmaster and puppeteer, both Rasputin and Svengali, a consigliere with a well-worn library card. “Saturday Night Live” even imagined him as the Grim Reaper. Mr. Bannon has cheerfully played along with this portrayal, likening himself to avatars of dark power like Darth Vader and Dick Cheney. But there was never much reason to believe Mr. Bannon has the political genius necessary to actually bring his ideas to life. It’s true that much of the ideological underpinning of Mr. Trump’s agenda comes from Mr. Bannon, and it’s also true that he has outsize influence with the president. But as accomplishments go, fomenting xenophobia and manipulating a famously mercurial political neophyte are thin evidence of genius.

157,"America stood still that day — Feb. 20, 1962 — as John Glenn, a Marine pilot, climbed into the Mercury capsule, named the Friendship 7, sitting on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral in Florida. In a flight that took about five hours, Mr. Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. In that short time, he became a hero to his generation and those that followed. After the flight, Mr. Glenn was honored by the White House, on Broadway and around country. He became a symbol of can-do spirit, lifting morale and restoring self-confidence at a time when many felt that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union. Mr. Glenn died Dec. 8 at age 95, and he was laid to rest Thursday at Arlington National Cemetery. His flag-draped coffin covered in plastic to protect it from the pouring rain, was carried to the grave site on a horse-drawn caisson. Mr. Glenn’s family scheduled the service on the date that would have been his 74th wedding anniversary. His widow, Annie Glenn, 97, attended the ceremony wearing a red dress; she held a single red rose as she sat in tent next to the couple’s two children, John David and Carolyn. She spoke with visible warmth to the Marine who presented her with the flag, and their faces nearly touched before she gave him a kiss. Six Marine pallbearers in dress uniforms carried Mr. Glenn’s coffin. A military trumpeter played taps, Marines fired three ceremonial rounds from their rifles and mourners recited the 23rd Psalm. No family member made remarks during the portion of the service that was streamed live online. Mr. Glenn returned to space in 1998 aboard the space shuttle Discovery, a mission that made him, at age 77, the oldest man in space. He had many accomplishments outside his career as an astronaut. He flew 149 missions as a Marine fighter pilot in World War II and Korea, broke the transcontinental air speed record, served for 24 years in the United States Senate, and founded the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at Ohio State University. In his honor, President Trump issued a proclamation and ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half-staff Thursday. Tributes came from fellow astronauts. Robert Lightfoot, the acting administrator of NASA, said in a statement: Lawmakers, including Senator Rob Portman, of Mr. Glenn’s home state, Ohio, offered testimonials. The historic send-off from Scott Carpenter, that Mr. Glenn received more than 50 years ago as he left the launchpad at Cape Canaveral seems fitting: “Godspeed, John Glenn.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/john-glenn-arlington-national-cemetery.html?searchResultPosition=20

I woke up one day and was confronted by a mystery. In my closet. Suddenly, after almost five decades of short skirts — and a firm belief that long skirts were a relic of female oppression (all that material inhibiting movement) — I opened my closet door and discovered that over the last 12 months I had acquired not one but three long skirts and dresses. To wear during the day. How had this happened? Well, O.K., I know how it literally happened — I opened my wallet and paid — but how had it happened internally? What switch had been flipped in my head to alter the thinking of 48 years? Had I, after decades of fighting them, become a sucker for a trend? After all, as someone who spends a large part of her professional life immersed in the world of fashion fads, I generally try to avoid them for myself. Wearing blue when there is blue all over the runways, or florals, or what have you makes me feel like I’ve drunk too much of the Kool-Aid handed out during my twice-yearly perambulations to the shows. I tend to think it’s good to keep a respectable distance between what I wear and what I write. Yet clearly something was going on. And not just with me. Suddenly, everywhere I looked there were women wearing longer hemlines, longer sleeves and higher necklines: on the red carpet, in the White House, from the Upper East Side to Williamsburg to the SoHos in both London and New York. I went back through slide shows from the Oscars and street-style pictures. When two public figures as seemingly diametrically opposed as Rihanna and Melania Trump ended up on the same continuum (one that began with them in full pinup mode and ended with both in full cover), my critical hackles went up and the little hairs on the back of my neck started tingling.

159,"WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president, a finding that did not emerge publicly until after Mr. Trump’s victory months later, former government officials say. The briefings indicate that intelligence officials had evidence of Russia’s intentions to help Mr. Trump much earlier in the presidential campaign than previously thought. The briefings also reveal a critical split last summer between the C.I.A. and counterparts at the F.B.I., where a number of senior officials continued to believe through last fall that Russia’s cyberattacks were aimed primarily at disrupting America’s political system, and not at getting Mr. Trump elected, according to interviews. The former officials said that in late August — 10 weeks before the election — John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director, was so concerned about increasing evidence of Russia’s election meddling that he began a series of urgent, individual briefings for eight top members of Congress, some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break. It is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings. But with concerns growing both internally and publicly at the time about a significant Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee, the C.I.A. began seeing signs of possible connections to the Trump campaign, the officials said. By the campaign’s final weeks, Congress and the intelligence agencies were racing to understand the scope of the Russia threat. In an Aug. 25 briefing for Harry Reid, then the top Democrat in the Senate, Mr. Brennan indicated that Russia’s hackings appeared aimed at helping Mr. Trump win the November election, according to two former officials with knowledge of the briefing. The officials said Mr. Brennan also indicated that unnamed advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. The F.B.I. and two congressional committees are now investigating that claim, focusing on possible communications and financial dealings between Russian affiliates and a handful of former advisers to Mr. Trump. So far, no proof of collusion has emerged publicly. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/trump-russia-cia-john-brennan.html?searchResultPosition=18

Families sorted through plans for what to do in case one among them was swept up. Waves of panic have become familiar since Donald J. Trump, who has promised wide-scale deportations of illegal immigrants, became president. Federal agents have made scores of publicized arrests around the nation. As communities wrestle with the administration’s new policy, they face another challenge, too: distinguishing between verifiable reports of arrests and empty rumors driven by fear. In New York, there was talk of raids on trains headed to the Bronx and in Queens, and of checkpoints on Long Island — all later deemed false.

162,"SAN FRANCISCO — Twitter sued the federal government on Thursday to block the unmasking of an anonymous account that has posted messages critical of the Trump administration and has claimed to have ties to a government agency. The suit sets up a potential confrontation between the Trump administration and Twitter over digital privacy, a thorny issue that has driven a wedge between the technology industry and government in the past. Twitter disclosed in a federal court filing on Thursday that it had received a summons directing it to reveal the identity or identities of those behind @ALT_USCIS, one of several so-called alt-accounts run by people purporting to be current or former federal employees. The @ALT_USCIS account, which quickly gained tens of thousands of followers, has frequently criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies and enforcement actions. Twitter said in its filing that it could not be compelled to disclose the identity or identities of whoever is behind the account. The company argued that the government’s directive and reasoning were unlawful, and that complying would have “a grave chilling effect” on the speech of alt-accounts that voice resistance to government policies. “A time-honored tradition of pseudonymous free speech on matters of public moment runs deep in the political life of America,” Twitter said in its filing. “These First Amendment interests are at their zenith when, as here, the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life.” Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Department, which, with Customs and Border Protection had issued the summons, declined to comment.

This debut novel imagines the events that lead up to and follow the Second American Civil War at the turn of the 22nd century. Our critic Michiko Kakutani, with high praise rarely bestowed on a debut, calls it “a surprisingly powerful novel — one that creates as haunting a postapocalyptic universe as Cormac McCarthy did in ‘The Road’ (2006), and as devastating a look at the fallout that national events have on an American family as Philip Roth did in ‘The Plot Against America’ (2004).” SUNSHINE STATE: Essays, by Sarah Gerard.

Davis’s sweeping history of the Gulf of Mexico takes into account colorful nature, idiosyncratic human characters, economic development, and the ways in which artists and writers have seen the body of water. In his review, Dwight Garner calls it “a sensitive and sturdy work of environmental history.” RICHARD NIXON: The Life, by John A. Farrell. (Doubleday. $35.)

164,"WASHINGTON — Under intense pressure from President Trump, House Republicans took a small step Thursday to revive legislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, adding a $15 billion fund to help insurers pay claims for their sickest customers. Speaker Paul D. Ryan orchestrated a broad show of Republican support for the proposal, conceived as an amendment to the repeal bill that collapsed on the House floor two weeks ago. But Republicans said they still did not have enough votes to pass the bill, and with the House now on a two-week spring break, time is running out for their planned quick-strike repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Even so, Republicans said the amendment could help heal divisions in their conference and show progress to an impatient president, still smarting from a loss in his first showdown with Congress. By a party-line vote of 9 to 2, the House Rules Committee on Thursday gave its blessing to the proposal, devised by Representatives Gary Palmer of Alabama and David Schweikert of Arizona, both members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Mr. Palmer said the “risk-sharing program” would lower premiums by sparing insurers some costs. With lower prices, he said, more people would buy insurance. He estimated that it would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 1.2 million to 2.2 million. However, those gains would be dwarfed by other parts of the repeal bill, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says would result in 24 million more uninsured people compared with projections under current law.

165,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — The diplomatic situation had been looking bright for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. With the help of Russia, he had consolidated his power, the rebels were on their heels and the United States had just declared that ousting him was not a priority. So why would Mr. Assad risk it all, outraging the world by attacking civilians with what Turkey now says was the nerve agent sarin, killing scores of people, many of them children? Why would he inflict the deadliest chemical strike since the 2013 attacks outside Damascus? Those attacks came close to bringing American military retaliation then. And in a stunningly swift reversal, Tuesday’s attack drew a response from President Trump: dozens of cruise missiles launched at a Syrian air base. One of the main defenses offered by Mr. Assad’s allies and supporters, in disputing that his forces carried out the strike on Tuesday, is that such an attack would be “a crazy move,” as one Iranian analyst, Mosib Na’imi, told the Russian state-run news site Sputnik. Yet, rather than an inexplicable act, analysts say, it is part of a carefully calculated strategy of escalating attacks against civilians. For years, at least since it began shelling neighborhoods with artillery in 2012, then bombing them from helicopters and later from jets, the Syrian government has adopted a policy of seeking total victory by making life as miserable as possible for anyone living in areas outside its control. Government forces have been herding defeated opponents from across the country into Idlib Province, where the chemical attack occurred. Starved and bombed out of their enclaves, they are bused under lopsided surrender deals to the province, where Qaeda-linked groups maintain a presence the Syrian military uses as an excuse to bomb without regard for the safety of civilians. Dr. Monzer Khalil, Idlib Province’s health director, said such extreme tactics aimed to demonstrate the government’s impunity and to demoralize its foes.

168,"Pepsi on Wednesday pulled a disastrous advertisement after it was met with widespread ridicule. Titled “Jump In,” the two-and-a-half minute spot was full of clumsy, glib references to police brutality and Black Lives Matter protests. Nearly every tone-deaf frame has become a mocking meme. And the commercial (Pepsi calls it a “short film”) drew the most intense disgust from the very people whose experiences it tried to reflect. But “Jump In” — which bizarrely ends with the model Kendall Jenner handing a police officer a Pepsi, inspiring smiles all around in a happy end to a demonstration that looked more like a street party the whole time — is not just a one-off misfire or an offensive aberration. Rather, it highlights deep structural problems and contradictions in the advertising industry, problems that run much deeper than this particular failure. I’m a white man who has worked in advertising for seven years, and while I’d like to say I’ve never been complicit in similar mistakes, I know I probably have. But my experience gives me some insight. In advertising, any attempts to tackle “big issues” (racism, sexism, domestic violence, climate change) must remain linked to a corporation’s need to push product. Branded content like “Jump In” seeks to provoke while still speaking to the broadest possible audience. Its goal is the sort of edginess that doesn’t alienate anyone. With that in mind — and without any specific knowledge about how “Jump In” came to be — I can imagine that it was born from some combination of good intentions, corporate hedging and a huge failure to grasp the limitations of advertising on the part of the people working for Pepsi’s in-house content agency. But the failings that made “Jump In” a disaster on nearly every level are hardly one-dimensional or confined to this brand or this particular campaign. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, there has been a rash of advertisements seeking to remind consumers of what really makes America great, or to push saccharine messages about the idea that by working together, we can fight evil and make the world a better place. “Jump In” stands out even in this group with its attempt to channel, if not appropriate, the highly specific contemporary notion of “wokeness” — which, loosely defined, refers to understanding of and commitment to addressing injustice.

169,"As Tesla shares surged past $300 this week and the company’s market value surpassed Ford’s, even its founder, Elon Musk, acknowledged on Twitter that the company was “absurdly overvalued if based on the past.” By “the past,” he presumably means old-fashioned valuation measures like price-to-earnings or price-to-sales ratios, the traditional benchmarks for evaluating stock prices. By those measures, Tesla — a company that lost $773 million last year — is indeed off the charts. Tesla’s market value of nearly $49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford, which earned nearly $11 billion in profit last year, but is within easy striking distance of General Motors, which earned $9.4 billion. In contrast to Tesla, Ford and G.M. shares have dropped recently on fears that auto sales have hit a cyclical peak. Ford and G.M. executives wouldn’t comment on Tesla’s stock surge, but it’s easy to imagine they’d be tearing their hair out in frustration. “It’s nuts,” Bruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing, said of Tesla’s stock price. “Investors believe it’s going to dominate a market that no company has ever dominated before.” But Tesla is not a stock, or a company, that is measured by the past, as Mr. Musk is well aware. He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent “risk-adjusted future cash flows” — and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful, self-driving electric vehicles powered by solar-fed batteries that are easy on the environment.

170,"MEXICO CITY — The United States invasion of Mexico in 1846 inflicted a painful wound that, in the 170 years that followed, turned into a scar. Donald Trump has torn it open again. Among the many lies that he has constructed, none is more ridiculous than his attempt to contradict history by presenting the United States as a victim of Mexico, a country that supposedly steals jobs, imposes onerous treaties and sends its “bad hombres” across the border. To confront this fake history, some Mexicans are proposing to remind Mr. Trump exactly what country was the first victim of American imperialism. They are calling for a lawsuit that would aim to nullify the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (signed on Feb. 2, 1848), in which Mexico — invaded by American soldiers, its capital occupied, its ports and customs stations seized — was forced to accept the American annexation of Texas and concede more than half the rest of Mexican territory, now including most of the states of Arizona, New Mexico and California. This effort is being led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, the elder statesman of the Mexican left. Mr. Cárdenas is convinced that the Mexican government — especially given the need to confront Mr. Trump’s aggression — has a solid legal case. In his opinion, the 1848 treaty violates essential international legal norms and a case can be brought before the International Court of Justice, proposing reparations and indemnification. And even if one admits the legal validity of much of the treaty, there are a number of crucial articles — such as those dealing with citizenship, property and the security of 100,000 Mexicans who remained on what became American territory — that have been ignored from the beginning. Such an effort faces formidable obstacles, though. A former Mexican secretary of foreign relations, Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor, the leading Mexican expert in international law, believes — “much to his regret,” he said — that Mr. Cárdenas’s initiative is not feasible. “In previous times, wars of conquest did not find the same moral and legal condemnation that is nowadays part and parcel of our system of law,” he told me. The treaty would have to be challenged under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, “for which it must be shown that the state did not expressly agree that the treaty is a valid instrument or that, by reasons of its own conduct, that state must be considered as not having acquiesced to the validity of the treaty.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/will-mexico-get-half-of-its-territory-back.html?searchResultPosition=53
171,"Two recent train derailments at Pennsylvania Station in New York that created major travel disruptions were caused by track defects, Amtrak officials said on Thursday, increasing concerns about the aging infrastructure at North America’s busiest train station. Officials also acknowledged that they had been aware of a defect on the tracks at the site of a derailment on Monday before it occurred, but did not recognize the urgency of the problem. The derailment of a New Jersey Transit train on Monday resulted in four days of extraordinary upheaval for hundreds of thousands of commuters across the region. Regular train service was scheduled to return to Penn Station on Friday morning, Amtrak officials said. The accident closed eight of Penn Station’s 21 tracks, causing a cascade of delays across the three railroads that share the station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road. The damage from the derailment required major repairs to the tracks, a complex labyrinth near the Hudson River tunnel. On Thursday, Amtrak took responsibility for the accident this week and for the derailment of one of its Acela trains on March 24. “Based on our recent investigations, we can confirm that problems with our tracks in Penn Station were a cause of both recent derailments,” said Charles W. Moorman, Amtrak’s chief executive. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/nyregion/penn-station-train-service.html?searchResultPosition=35

The miniskirts and Crayola colors of the 1960s, the power shoulders of the ’80s, the minimalism of the ’90s — all reached critical mass well into the midpoint of those eras, when whatever had been bubbling up in wardrobes and on sidewalks found its reflection in the wider world. Well, we have finally reached that stage in the 2010s. The tectonic plates of fashion have shifted. Look around. What do you see?

Young women who used to come in and buy Balmain’s nonexistent dresses are leaving with knee-length skirts with a sweater or blouse by Emilia Wickstead.” And speaking of Balmain — even that label offered long knits, long sleeves and long crocodile skins among the short-’n’-fringed styles in its last collection.

176,"In 1937, ascending leaders of the Third Reich hosted two art exhibitions in Munich. One, the “Great German Art Exhibition,” featured art Adolf Hitler deemed acceptable and reflective of an ideal Aryan society: representational, featuring blond people in heroic poses and pastoral landscapes of the German countryside. The other featured what Hitler and his followers referred to as “degenerate art”: work that was modern or abstract, and art produced by people disavowed by Nazis — Jewish people, Communists, or those suspected of being one or the other. The “degenerate art” was presented in chaos and disarray, accompanied by derogatory labels, graffiti and catalog entries describing “the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or pencil.” Hitler and those close to him strictly controlled how artists lived and worked in Nazi Germany, because they understood that art could play a key role in the rise or fall of their dictatorship and the realization of their vision for Germany’s future. Last month, the Trump administration proposed a national budget that includes the elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts. The NEA operates with a budget of about $150 million a year. As critics have observed, this amount is about 0.004 percent of the federal budget, making the move a fairly inefficient approach to trimming government spending. Many Americans have been protesting the cuts by pointing out the many ways that art enriches our lives — as they should. The arts bring us joy and entertainment; they can offer a reprieve from the trials of life or a way to understand them. But as Hitler understood, artists play a distinctive role in challenging authoritarianism. Art creates pathways for subversion, for political understanding and solidarity among coalition builders. Art teaches us that lives other than our own have value. Like the proverbial court jester who can openly mock the king in his own court, artists who occupy marginalized social positions can use their art to challenge structures of power in ways that would otherwise be dangerous or impossible. Authoritarian leaders throughout history have intuited this fact and have acted accordingly. The Stalinist government of the 1930s required art to meet strict criteria of style and content to ensure that it exclusively served the purposes of state leadership. In his memoir, the composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich writes that the Stalinist government systematically executed all of the Soviet Union’s Ukrainian folk poets. When Augusto Pinochet took power in Chile in 1973, muralists were arrested, tortured and exiled. Soon after the coup, the singer and theater artist Víctor Jara was killed, his body riddled with bullets and displayed publicly as a warning to others. In her book “Brazilian Art Under Dictatorship,” Claudia Calirman writes that the museum director Niomar Moniz Sodré Bittencourt had to hide works of art and advise artists to leave Brazil after authorities entered her museum, blocked the exhibition and demanded the work be dismantled because it contained dangerous images like a photograph of a member of the military falling off a motorcycle, which was seen as embarrassing to the police. Such extreme intervention may seem far removed from the United States today, until we consider episodes like the president’s public castigation of the “Hamilton” cast after it issued a fairly tame commentary directed at Mike Pence.

179,"One hundred years ago today, Congress voted to enter what was then the largest and bloodiest war in history. Four days earlier, President Woodrow Wilson had sought to unite a sharply divided populace with a stirring claim that the nation “is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.” The war lasted only another year and a half, but in that time, an astounding 117,000 American soldiers were killed and 202,000 wounded. Still, most Americans know little about why the United States fought in World War I, or why it mattered. The “Great War” that tore apart Europe and the Middle East and took the lives of over 17 million people worldwide lacks the high drama and moral gravity of the Civil War and World War II, in which the very survival of the nation seemed at stake. World War I is less easy to explain. America intervened nearly three years after it began, and the “doughboys,” as our troops were called, engaged in serious combat for only a few months. More Americans in uniform died away from the battlefield — thousands from the Spanish flu — than with weapons in hand. After victory was achieved, Wilson’s audacious hope of making a peace that would advance democracy and national self-determination blew up in his face when the Senate refused to ratify the treaty he had signed at the Palace of Versailles. But attention should be paid. America’s decision to join the Allies was a turning point in world history. It altered the fortunes of the war and the course of the 20th century — and not necessarily for the better. Its entry most likely foreclosed the possibility of a negotiated peace among belligerent powers that were exhausted from years mired in trench warfare. Although the American Expeditionary Force did not engage in combat for long, the looming threat of several million fresh troops led German generals to launch a last, desperate series of offensives. When that campaign collapsed, Germany’s defeat was inevitable. How would the war have ended if America had not intervened? The carnage might have continued for another year or two until citizens in the warring nations, who were already protesting the endless sacrifices required, forced their leaders to reach a settlement. If the Allies, led by France and Britain, had not won a total victory, there would have been no punitive peace treaty like that completed at Versailles, no stab-in-the-back allegations by resentful Germans, and thus no rise, much less triumph, of Hitler and the Nazis. The next world war, with its 50 million deaths, would probably not have occurred. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/should-america-have-entered-world-war-i.html?searchResultPosition=57
180,"As America’s population ages, opportunities for a secure retirement should increase. But the opposite is happening. And things are likely to get worse in the Trump years. A measure passed recently by congressional Republicans and awaiting President Trump’s all-but-certain signature will reverse a rule, passed in the last year of the Obama administration, allowing cities and counties to organize savings plans for private-sector workers who have no employer-provided retirement coverage. Another measure, blocking states from sponsoring similar retirement savings plans, was passed by the House in February. The Senate and Mr. Trump would be wise to let that measure die. If it is enacted, 13 million people — a sizable portion of the 55 million Americans who don’t have company retirement plans — would be denied access to payroll-deduction individual retirement accounts. People who already have retirement plans also have cause for worry. On Wednesday, the Labor Department carried out Mr. Trump’s directive to delay the April 10 effective date of a federal rule that requires financial advisers to put a client’s interest before their own when giving advice or selling investments related to 401(k) rollovers and other retirement transactions. The rule, known as the “best interest” or ""fiduciary” standard, would protect 401(k) savers from being steered into overly expensive strategies and products when they retire. All of these rules were carefully researched and written. All are much needed. And all are being tampered with for one reason only: The financial industry does not want them because it makes tens of billions of dollars a year under a status quo in which its products and practices are the only game in town for retirement savers. This means that what congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are doing is looking for ways to line Wall Street’s pockets with the retirement savings of working people. The result will be continuing hardship for retirees. The roughly one-half of private-sector workers who do not have retirement plans at work will rely on Social Security for between half to all of their income in retirement. But even those with retirement savings will be hard pressed. A recent paper by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College showed that pension wealth — from traditional pensions and 401(k)’s — remained basically flat for workers ages 51 to 56 from 1992 to 2010. (The figures may show improvement in the 2016 data, due out next year, but they are unlikely to buck a nearly 20-year trend.) The study also found that even as overall pension wealth held steady, the shift from traditional pensions to 401(k)’s left people worse off in retirement. Traditional pensions guarantee constant monthly payments for life; 401(k)’s can and do run out. In addition, the income generated by 401(k)’s varies with interest rates, which have been very low for very long.

185,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Thursday engineered a dramatic change in how the chamber confirms Supreme Court nominations, bypassing a Democratic blockade of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch in a move that will most likely reshape both the Senate and the court. After Democrats held together Thursday morning and filibustered President Trump’s nominee, Republicans voted to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority. In deploying this so-called nuclear option, lawmakers are fundamentally altering the way the Senate handles one of its most significant duties, further limiting the minority’s power in a chamber that was designed to be a slower and more deliberative body than the House. The move, once unthinkable among senators, is a testament to the creeping partisan rancor in recent years, after decades of at least relative bipartisanship on Supreme Court matters. Both parties have warned of sweeping effects on the court itself, predicting the elevation of more ideologically extreme judges now that only a majority is required for confirmation. Senate Democrats in 2013 first changed the rules of the Senate to block Republican filibusters of presidential nominees to lower courts and to government positions. But they left the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees untouched, an acknowledgment of the court’s exalted status. On Thursday, that last pillar was swept away on a party-line vote, with all 52 Republicans choosing to overrule Senate precedent and all 48 Democrats and liberal-leaning independents pushing to keep it.

The founding fathers believed in majority rule, with only a few exceptions. In his 1801 guide to Senate practices, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “The voice of the majority decides.” The exceptions, as spelled out in the Constitution, included removing someone from office, overriding a veto, ratifying a treaty and amending the Constitution itself. Passing a regular law wasn’t one of the exceptions. Nor was confirming a Supreme Court justice. Over time, however, the Senate changed its rules to give the minority party the power to block action so long as it had 34 votes. (The Senate changed the threshold to the current 41 votes in 1974.) So when you hear people — on both the left and right — decry the likely weakening of the filibuster this week, keep in mind that it has not been a permanent part of American democracy. For much of our history, majority rule was the norm, and supermajority rule was a rare exception. “The switch to supermajority rule,” Steven Waldman writes in an Op-Ed today, “happened without a constitutional amendment, without a national debate, without its even becoming a major issue in a presidential campaign.” It happened through a series of changes in Senate rules and norms, as Waldman explains.

The statement from Turkey, where many of the stricken Syrians were taken after the assault on Tuesday, was the most specific about the cause. “According to the results of preliminary tests,” the statement said, “patients were exposed to chemical material (Sarin).” Western countries have accused the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad of carrying out the chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province, which left scores dead and hundreds sickened in one of the worst atrocities so far in the six-year-old Syria war. The Syrian government has denied responsibility. Russia, its main ally, has accused Mr. Assad’s enemies of rushing to judgment and has threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council measure condemning the assault. The Turkish statement said the sarin conclusion had been based on autopsies on three victims performed at Turkey’s Adana Forensic Medicine Institution with the participation of representatives from the World Health Organization and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, a group based in The Hague that monitors compliance with the global treaty that bans such munitions.

Senate Republicans changed longstanding rules to bypass Democrats’ filibuster of President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch. The move clears the way for his confirmation by a simple majority vote on Friday — and fundamentally alters the way the Senate operates to fill seats on the high court. We tracked each senator’s vote. • Nunes to step aside from Russia inquiry. Representative Devin Nunes announced today that he would step aside from leading the House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russia’s efforts to disrupt the presidential election. • Trump suggests a larger U.S. role in Syria. President Trump warned on Wednesday that he would not tolerate the “heinous” chemical weapons attack in Syria, opening the door to a greater American role in a war that he has long said the U.S. should avoid.

191,"Good morning on this stormy Thursday. The derailment of a New Jersey Transit train continues to affect commutes in and out of the city. New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road are running on modified schedules, so allow extra travel time. (Full service on New Jersey Transit is expected to resume on Friday. In the meantime, tickets are still being honored across New Jersey Transit buses, light rail, PATH trains and the New York Waterway.) One hundred years ago today, the United States declared war against Germany, fighting alongside the Allies in World War I. At the time, New York was a city divided. “New Yorkers provided the strongest voices both for the rush to war, and the opposition,” said Thai Jones, a history professor and curator for American history at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University. Some of our cultural institutions promoted the war effort. The songwriters and music publishers of Tin Pan Alley cranked out tunes to show support, including the military ballad “Over There” by George M. Cohan. And New York illustrators created some of the most iconic propaganda posters, such as James Montgomery Flagg’s “I Want You for U.S. Army” recruiting poster. Courses geared toward helping the war effort sprung up at Columbia, and N.Y.U. students were allowed to graduate quickly so they could enlist. The United States Navy even built a full-size fake battleship in Union Square, and used it for three years as a recruitment tool.

192,"The Federal Reserve is loosening its grip on the American economy. The central bank is expected to pare the more than $4 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage securities it bought after the 2008 financial crisis to keep interest rates low and to help revive the economy. It has already started to slowly raise its benchmark interest rate. Fed officials think the economy is strong enough for it to gradually ease back on its support. Markets appear to agree. News that the central bank would reduce its investments was met with relative calm. Some analysts think the Fed needs to step back even further. “Financial conditions remain very accommodative, and in our view the central bank has more work to do to minimize the risks of financial imbalances building up in worrisome ways,” said Bob Miller, the head of BlackRock’s U.S. multi-sector fixed income team. Corporate chiefs in the United States have bemoaned for years the taxes that they would face if they brought home more than $2 trillion in cash kept overseas. They may soon stop complaining. President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are widely believed to be open to lowering taxes on funds that companies bring back. For lawmakers, the idea of a tide of funds coming home creates visions of infrastructure investment and job creation. But on Wall Street, it has set off hopes for another spending priority: mergers and acquisitions. And deals often lead to job losses.

193,"VENICE — Damien Hirst is staring into the eyes of a jade Buddha, its face seemingly abraded by the vestiges of time. “I think he looks damn good, considering he’s 2,000 years old,” he said, straining to keep a straight face. Nearby, the sculpture of a pharaoh fashioned from blue granite and displaying a gold nipple ring bears an uncanny resemblance to Pharrell Williams. Is the face really that of the singer? “You could say that,” Mr. Hirst responded. “It’s all about what you want to believe.” After years of uncharacteristic silence, this artist known for his love-it-or-hate-it artworks is orchestrating his own comeback. On a recent morning, dressed all in black, Mr. Hirst could be found in the soaring entrance of the Palazzo Grassi watching his crew put the finishing touches on an extravaganza worthy of Cecil B. DeMille — his first major show of new work in 10 years. Opening to the public on Sunday, April 9, and called “Treasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable,” it is an underwater fantasy, with sculptures like the Buddha and hundreds of other objects fashioned to look as though they were antiquities dredged up from the bottom of the sea. The works will fill the Palazzo Grassi and the Punta della Dogana, two museums run by François Pinault, the Parisian collector who is also the owner of Christie’s auction house. The show is widely seen as Mr. Hirst’s attempt, at 51, to kick-start his career, which has suffered since 2008, when the financial and art markets crashed. Tapping into the age-old romance of shipwrecks, he and his patron are embarking on a giant artistic and financial gamble. “Treasures” cost Mr. Hirst millions of dollars to produce and Mr. Pinault millions to present (exact figures were not disclosed by either man). Collectors who have been offered the works report that prices start around $500,000 apiece rising to upward of $5 million. With Damien Hirst’s market untested on such a grand scale, the question the art world is asking is, will he sink or swim in Venice? Francesco Bonami, a curator who organized a major exhibition of Mr. Hirst’s work in Doha, Qatar, four years ago, said the latest Hirst production “goes beyond good or bad,” adding: “In his bombastic, exaggerated way, Damien has created a narrative the likes of which the public has never seen. Many will call it bad taste or kitsch, but it’s more than all of that. It’s Hollywood.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/arts/design/damien-hirst-francois-pinault-palazzo-grassi.html?searchResultPosition=43
194,"WASHINGTON — Eleven weeks into the Trump presidency, the Secret Service is grappling with how to constrain the rising costs and unexpected strain that have come with protecting a new first family as large, mobile and high-profile as any in modern American history. To keep up, dozens of agents from New York and field offices across the country are being temporarily pulled off criminal investigations to serve two-week stints protecting members of the Trump family, including the first lady and the youngest son in Manhattan’s Trump Tower. Others, already assigned to the highly selective presidential protective division, had hoped for relief after a grueling election year. That hope has evaporated as they work more overtime hours and spend long stretches away from home because of the Trump family’s far-flung travel. And in Washington, agency leaders are already negotiating for tens of millions of dollars in supplemental funding to help offset the sky-high costs of securing Trump Tower and other high-profile family assets like Mar-a-Lago in Florida. It is a figure that will only continue to rise. “They are flat-out worn out,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The committee’s top-ranking Democratic member, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, gave an analogy: “It’s like being on a bike that you never get off of.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/secret-service-trump-first-family-protection.html?searchResultPosition=49
195,"From Amsterdam to New York, London to Havana, Dutch men across the world held hands this week to show solidarity with a gay couple who say they were brutally beaten in Arnhem, the Netherlands. The outpouring of support came after the married couple, Jasper Vernes-Sewratan and Ronnie Sewratan-Vernes, said they were attacked by a gang of youths while holding hands on their way home from a party early Sunday. According to a statement the Arnhem police posted on Facebook, the two said they had been attacked by men wielding bolt cutters; one had some of his teeth smashed out. Prosecutors said five teenage suspects would be charged on Thursday with serious bodily harm. The authorities are still investigating the motivation for the attack, which the victims have characterized as a hate crime. The beating caused particular outrage in the Netherlands, which has long prided itself on its tolerance. Amsterdam, the capital, has been a haven for sexual minorities for centuries, and it has marketed itself as the “gay capital of Europe.” Homosexuality was removed from the Dutch criminal code in 1811, and the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize gay marriage, with the first ceremonies in 2001.

196,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Let’s turn it over to Brooks Barnes, our Hollywood reporter based in Los Angeles, for today’s introduction. LOS ANGELES — For the first time in a decade, Hollywood is facing the threat of a major strike. Writers, who power almost everything the movie and television factories make, want better pay and the shoring up of a faltering health care plan. Studios, while open to some raises, have so far proposed health care changes that many writers consider rollbacks. Should a walkout happen — with its contract expiring on May 1, the Writers Guild of America last week asked members to give it the authority to call a strike — Howard A. Rodman will be among those leading the charge. While not prone to public grandstanding, Mr. Rodman, president of the Writers Guild, West, is a behind-the-scenes firebrand. He was elected in 2015 after vowing to get tough with studios. Labor conflict is in his blood; his father, also a writer, was a combative guild figure. Speaking by phone, Mr. Rodman insisted that writers, despite a Netflix-fueled boom in television, were being left behind by the industry. TV seasons are shorter. Networks are showing fewer reruns, limiting residuals. Studios are also making fewer movies and cutting back on paying to polish scripts.

197,"BERLIN — In a way, Elke Büdenbender is the exact opposite of Melania Trump. Being married to Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the new German head of state, she has given up her job as a judge at the Berlin Administrative Court to fully devote her time to the job of first lady. Mrs. Trump, on the contrary, refuses to be first lady, in order to, well, to continue to do pretty much nothing. Still, however different the two women may be, Germany is having the same discussion as the United States: Are we still in for a first lady in the 21st century? Is a first housewife still an appropriate representative of the nation we are? And does she represent the nation we’d like to be? As for the nation we’d like to be, the German answer is quite simple: No, she does not. Most Germans like to think of women’s equality as a mission accomplished and would probably agree that the role model that lives on at the Schloss Bellevue, the president’s residence, has outlived its time. Germany has never had a female president, which may be why it has never modernized the roles of its first couple. At the Schloss Bellevue, the 1950s have survived, turning it into a museum of social history, a “Mad Men” caricature of the domestic, patriarchal past, just plusher and less cool, exuding the stale smell of a Sunday roast gone cold waiting for Daddy to return to the familial home. The German first lady, not unlike her American counterpart, is the woman “at his side,” as many media outlets like to put it. She is active, but in a way that postwar Germany would have approved of, too. Traditionally, she’s the patron of the Müttergenesungswerk, a charitable organization founded by Elly Heuss-Knapp, Germany’s first first lady, which is dedicated to the health of mothers. Horst Köhler, the president from 2004 to 2010, and his wife, Eva Luise, for example, started a foundation for rare diseases. The first lady is in charge of organizing the president’s New Year’s reception and other tasks that comply with traditional female role requirements such as caretaking, tending and accommodating. All of this is based on mere convention. The first lady has no constitutional role. The fact that she is acting as a state official equipped with an office, assistant and staffer could actually raise some difficult legal questions, as Sophie Schönberger, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Konstanz, recently noted in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, picking up on the question raised in the United States over whether Mrs. Trump should be paid. Or, as Norbert Lammert, president of the German Parliament, put it during Mr. Steinmeier’s inauguration, addressing Ms. Büdenbender: “Yours is an office which, according to our Constitution, doesn’t exist.” It’s as though he was trying to squeeze women’s history into one sentence: Women have always managed without holding an office, acted without recognition, worked without pay, existed outside the written.

199,"WASHINGTON — The continuing fallout from President Trump’s unsubstantiated wiretapping allegation cost him another ally on Thursday, as the embattled Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced he would step aside from his panel’s investigation into Russia’s efforts to disrupt last year’s election. The announcement from the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, came shortly before the House Committee on Ethics said he was under investigation because of public reports that he “may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information.” Mr. Nunes’s recusal from the Russia inquiry was a blow to Mr. Trump, who in less than three months in office has seen the imbroglio over Russia’s disruption campaign exact political damage on some of his closest advisers and most vigorous supporters. The furor over the contacts that some of the president’s aides had with Russian officials has already led to the firing of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, and the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from overseeing the F.B.I.’s inquiry into the Russian efforts. Now it has led to the recusal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation, and Mr. Trump faces the potential revival of that inquiry. The investigation had descended into a partisan sideshow in the two weeks since Mr. Nunes told reporters that Trump associates had been swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies during the transition, citing intelligence reports that were classified. He then rushed to the White House to brief Mr. Trump, prompting Democrats to argue that Mr. Nunes had proved himself far too close to the president to run an independent investigation. The criticism intensified last week when The New York Times revealed that the classified information about incidental surveillance cited by Mr. Nunes came from White House officials. White House officials had been seeking evidence to bolster a claim that Mr. Trump made March 4 on Twitter that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. Numerous current and former American officials — including James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director — have debunked the claim.
