0,"Spain was hit by its worst terrorist attack in more than a decade on Thursday, when a van driver plowed into dozens of people enjoying a sunny afternoon on one of Barcelona’s most famous thoroughfares, killing at least 13 people and leaving 80 bloodied on the pavement. Hours later, the Catalan police said they foiled a second vehicular attack, in the seaside town of Cambrils, 70 miles to the south, fatally shooting four people. A fifth died later of wounds, the police said. The suspects appeared to be wearing explosive belts, though these devices were later found to be fake, police said. Six civilians and one police officer were injured during the episode, the Catalan emergency services said. The Barcelona attack was at least the sixth time in the past few years that assailants using vehicles as deadly weapons have struck a European city. The police cordoned off the Plaza de Cataluña and Las Ramblas in the heart of Barcelona, both tourist destinations, and began a chaotic pursuit for the attackers. Three people were arrested, including a Moroccan man whose identification documents had been used to rent the van. The Barcelona police said none were believed to be the driver, who escaped on foot and remained at large. "
1,"WASHINGTON — Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s Supreme Court appointee, is scheduled to address a conservative group at the Trump International Hotel in Washington next month, less than two weeks before the court is set to hear arguments on Mr. Trump’s travel ban. Stephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University, questioned the justice’s decision to speak at the hotel, which is at issue in lower-court cases challenging the constitutionality of payments to Mr. Trump’s companies. “At this highly divisive political moment, especially as many Trump decisions are likely soon to reach the court’s docket, one just days later, a healthy respect for public confidence in the court should have led Justice Gorsuch to demur,” he said. Justice Gorsuch declined to comment, said Kathleen L. Arberg, the Supreme Court’s public information officer. Experts in legal ethics were divided about whether Justice Gorsuch’s appearance at the hotel was appropriate. Steven Lubet, a law professor at Northwestern University, said that Mr. Trump’s ownership interest in the hotel was problematic but that Justice Gorsuch’s appearance there was not. "
2,"When Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey goes on trial on federal corruption charges in less than three weeks, far more than his own fate hinges on the outcome. If Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, is convicted and then expelled from the United States Senate by early January, his replacement would be picked by Gov. Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey and an ally of President Trump. That scenario — where Mr. Menendez’s interim replacement would more than likely be a Republican — would have immediate and far-reaching implications: The Republicans would be gifted a crucial extra vote just as the party remains a single vote shy in the Senate of advancing its bill to dismantle President Obama’s signature health care law. Those potential consequences only heighten the drama around the first federal bribery charges leveled against a sitting senator in a generation. “This one vote, this one vote — if he’s convicted or does a plea deal — could change the course of history on Obamacare. It’s remarkable,” said Steve Lonegan, a New Jersey Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Senate three years ago. He added, “That’s a big ‘if.’” It’s enough to have Democrats anxious. “Many of us have a personal concern about Bob Menendez,” said Robert G. Torricelli, a former Democratic senator of New Jersey. “But there’s also an overriding concern about the Republicans’ strengthening their control in the Senate and, in the near term, being able to repeal Obamacare and 16 million people losing their health care.” Mr. Menendez stands accused of using his position to advance the interests of Dr. Salomon Melgen, a friend and political patron, in exchange for luxury vacations and hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign support. "
3,"Carl Paladino, once a Republican candidate for governor of New York, was removed from the Buffalo school board on Thursday by the state education commissioner for revealing confidential information about collective bargaining negotiations with the city’s teachers union. In December, Mr. Paladino made national headlines for racist remarks about Barack and Michelle Obama that he sent a local publication called Artvoice. Asked in a survey what he’d like to see “go away in 2017,” Mr. Paladino said, among other things, that he would like to see Mrs. Obama “return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.” Days after the article was published, the school board adopted a resolution demanding that Mr. Paladino resign within 24 hours. In a move that came as little surprise to observers, he did not. The board went on to ask the State Education Department to remove him — but not for his inflammatory remarks. The board said he should lose his post because in a separate article he wrote for Artvoice he revealed confidential information about contract negotiations that had been discussed and approved in the fall. Mr. Paladino responded with a lawsuit that said the attempt to remove him was retaliation for his comments about the Obamas, a violation of his First Amendment rights. A wealthy real estate developer, Mr. Paladino shocked the state’s Republican Party by securing its nomination for governor in 2010. He ran against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as a fighter with salty disdain for political correctness, and a man who would take a baseball bat to the political establishment in Albany. Mr. Cuomo trounced Mr. Paladino on Election Day. "
4,"Updated: Aug. 31, 2017 This summer has produced dramatic headlines around the globe, from the violence in Charlottesville, Va., to the battle for Mosul in Iraq to the economic and political crisis in Venezuela — as well as a steady stream of sensational news coming from the White House. Here are 51 questions to help you remember and learn more. Try to answer them all without looking at the word bank at the bottom of the post. We will continue to update this post with the top news stories from now until Sept. 1. Then, starting Sept. 12, our regular 10-question interactive Weekly News Quiz will resume and publish most Tuesday mornings throughout the school year. _________ Directions: Clicking each blank in this quiz will take you to the original Times source for that entry so you can check your answer. 1. President Trump announced on June 1 that the United States would withdraw from the _________, weakening efforts to combat global warming and embracing isolationist voices in his White House who argued that the agreement was a pernicious threat to the economy and American sovereignty. "
5,"The “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va., that exploded into chaos and violence that culminated in the death of a 32-year-old woman, ended in a matter of hours. The onslaught of media reports about Saturday’s demonstration by white nationalists and its fallout, however, has stretched on for days. And there are few signs it will stop anytime soon. Indeed, some of the coverage itself has become news — or at least commanded the internet’s fleeting attention. There was a horrifying still photograph of the violence, a chilling documentary video, and of course, a series of defiant tweets from President Trump that continued into Thursday. And then there was Tuesday’s news conference — a combative give-and-take between the news media and Mr. Trump, which Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, described as “a moment that’s going to have a legacy.” “Trump has already forced several moments of reckoning on journalists,” Mr. Pope said. “What happened this weekend is another one of these seminal moments, another step in this very odd progression.” Taken together, the frenetic, disjointed ways the most striking media moments from Charlottesville and its aftermath unfolded and went viral — across many mediums and at lightning speed — seems emblematic of the way we consume news today. "
6,"When Donald Trump first announced his presidential campaign, I, like most people, thought it would be a short-lived publicity stunt. A month later, though, I happened to catch one of his political rallies on C-Span. I was riveted. I supported the Republican in dozens of articles, radio and TV appearances, even as conservative friends and colleagues said I had to be kidding. As early as September 2015, I wrote that Mr. Trump was “the most serious candidate in the race.” Critics of the pro-Trump blog and then the nonprofit journal that I founded accused us of attempting to “understand Trump better than he understands himself.” I hoped that was the case. I saw the decline in this country — its weak economy and frayed social fabric — and I thought Mr. Trump’s willingness to move past partisan stalemates could begin a process of renewal. It is now clear that my optimism was unfounded. I can’t stand by this disgraceful administration any longer, and I would urge anyone who once supported him as I did to stop defending the 45th president. Far from making America great again, Mr. Trump has betrayed the foundations of our common citizenship. And his actions are jeopardizing any prospect of enacting an agenda that might restore the promise of American life. *** What, you may wonder, especially in the wake of Charlottesville, Va., did I possibly see in this candidate? Although crude and meandering for almost all of the primary campaign, Mr. Trump eschewed strict ideologies and directly addressed themes that the more conventional candidates of both parties preferred to ignore. Rather than recite paeans to American enterprise, he acknowledged that our “information economy” has delivered little wage or productivity growth. He was willing to criticize the bipartisan consensus on trade and pointed out the devastating effects of deindustrialization felt in many communities. He forthrightly addressed the foreign policy failures of both parties, such as the debacles in Iraq and Libya, and rejected the utopian rhetoric of “democracy promotion.” He talked about the issue of widening income inequality — almost unheard of for a Republican candidate — and didn’t pretend that simply cutting taxes or shrinking government would solve the problem. "
7,"Whether it’s the heat you hate or the humidity, an armchair trip might help cure your summer doldrums. We recommend Antarctica — Ashley Shelby’s novel, “South Pole Station,” follows a painter’s adventures in the land of the penguins — or upstate New York, where the family at the center of J. Robert Lennon’s “Broken River” gets caught up in their new home’s not-quite-ghost story. Also on our list this week: Kamila Shamsie’s “Home Fire,” a powerful novel inspired by “Antigone”; Tom Perrotta’s first novel since “The Leftovers”; and Joshua Green’s deeply reported account of Steve Bannon’s alliance with Donald Trump. And if you’d rather really get away from it all, have a look at Robert Wright’s “Why Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment.” Radhika Jones
Editorial Director, Books HOME FIRE, by Kamila Shamsie. (Riverhead Books, $26.) Shamsie’s novel, longlisted for this year’s Man Booker Prize, is a bold retelling of Sophocles’ “Antigone” that follows the lives of three British siblings of Pakistani descent. It plays freely with Sophocles’ drama but hews to its themes: civil disobedience, fidelity and the law, especially as regards burial rights. Our critic Dwight Garner called it an “ingenious and love-struck” book that “builds to one of the most memorable final scenes I’ve read in a novel this century.” REFUGE, by Dina Nayeri. (Riverhead Books, $27.) Niloo, the protagonist of Nayeri’s novel, left Iran at 8 years old, along with her mother and brother. It was the last time she shared a home with her father. She has seen him just four times over the course of the last 22 years. The strains and indignities that come with remaking a life give Niloo’s story poignancy and relevance. Our critic Jennifer Senior said the novel “has the kind of immediacy commonly associated with memoir, which lends it heft, intimacy, atmosphere.” MRS. FLETCHER, by Tom Perrotta. (Scribner, $26.) Perrotta’s seventh novel — his first since 2011’s “The Leftovers” — succeeds in ways that will be pleasingly familiar to his admirers. The story of a divorced mother and her college-age son, both navigating the pursuit and pitfalls of sexual pleasure, it is the sweetest and most charming novel about pornography addiction and the harrowing issues of sexual consent that you will ever read. BROKEN RIVER, by J. Robert Lennon. (Graywolf, paper, $16.) This crafty, seductive novel, Lennon’s eighth, is not quite a ghost story, but it does involve a mysterious entity called the Observer. A budding novelist’s research into the unsolved murder that took place in the house where her family has moved attracts the attention of the killers. As the plot thickens, Lennon’s novel becomes a playful, sophisticated meditation on storytelling itself. SOUTH POLE STATION, by Ashley Shelby. (Picador, $26.) A painter spends a year at the South Pole as part of a National Science Foundation program in Shelby’s ramblingly entertaining first novel. The back stories of the ensemble cast provide a vivid notion of what it’s like to live in the dark, frigid landscape — one that heats up with the arrival of a climate-change denier. "
8,"WASHINGTON — Kara Young, a model who dated Donald J. Trump for two years before he married another model named Melania Knauss, remembers clearly bringing up her race with the real estate tycoon early in their relationship. As with so many issues, he steered the conversation to celebrity. “I didn’t hide my race from Donald Trump. He knew,” Ms. Young said in a rare interview. “He would say, ‘You’re like Derek Jeter.’ And I would say, ‘Exactly.’” “I never heard him say a disparaging comment towards any race of people,” she added. The furor that Mr. Trump has created with his equivocation over the violence this weekend at a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., has refocused attention on the president’s relationship with matters of race. Long before he embarked on his improbable political career, he had courted racial controversy, calling for the death penalty for five black and Latino teens who were later shown to have been wrongly convicted of a rape in Central Park, settling a Justice Department suit that charged the family business with housing discrimination and falsely accusing the nation’s first black president of being born in Kenya. Beyond dating a biracial woman, he made outsize efforts to hang out publicly with African-American celebrities: the boxing promoter Don King, the hip-hop impresarios Kanye West, Russell Simmons and Sean Combs, and celebrities as big as Muhammad Ali, James Brown and Michael Jackson. But more than ever, the question is being asked: Is Mr. Trump personally racist? The few African-Americans in his inner circle respond with an emphatic no. Most privately describe him as a 71-year-old man with fixed views and a cloistered history, raised in a heavily white enclave in Queens, who came of age and built a tower in the Manhattan sky when New York City was roiling with racial strife. “Just because you’re a nationalist and you’re white doesn’t make you a white nationalist,” said Katrina Pierson, an African-American who was a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. “Putting Americans first makes you a nationalist and in that case, I’m a nationalist. I think we should take care of our families and our children first.” "
9,"To the Editor: Ross Douthat’s column “An Elusive Immigration Compromise” (Aug. 6) and your editorial “A Senseless Immigration Proposal” (Aug. 7) disagree about the merits of the immigration reform bill introduced by Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia and endorsed by President Trump, but each defends its position in terms of a cost-benefit analysis. Cases made in these terms are tantamount to saying that our society should admit immigrants primarily, if not exclusively, for our own benefit. By contrast, some of us are convinced, either for religious or humanitarian reasons, that every person in deep physical or psychological need is morally entitled to whatever help we can reasonably give. Refugees and asylum seekers have a prima facie moral entitlement to that help. Unquestionably, we as a society are unable to satisfy all such valid claims, but that does not diminish the claims’ validity. We have an obligation to seek ways to increase our ability to take in more of these people, even if it is economically or emotionally costly for us to do so. BERNARD P. DAUENHAUER
MONTGOMERY, OHIO To the Editor: The Senate immigration bill that your editorial denounces is similar to what Barbara Jordan proposed while running a commission on immigration reform under President Bill Clinton. Contrary to your editorial, the bill would benefit low-wage American workers. Calculations from numbers from last year’s National Academy of Sciences study on immigration show that current mass immigration results in a transfer of nearly half a trillion dollars annually from low-wage American workers to business owners. The oversupply of low-skilled labor enables business owners to greatly reduce wages. Thus, while you claim that immigration as usual would grow the economy, you don’t mention the issue of who benefits and who loses: business owners and workers, respectively. You also don’t mention the National Academy of Sciences’ finding that low-skilled immigrants are a net fiscal burden, wiping out most of the economy’s gains, as George Borjas, a Harvard professor, wrote in these pages in February. Ironically, if the recommendations of Ms. Jordan’s commission had been followed, Donald Trump, who campaigned chiefly on an immigration crackdown, would have probably never gained the White House. DAVID C. HOLZMAN
LEXINGTON, MASS. To the Editor: Your editorial opposing President Trump’s endorsement of a bill that would slash immigration limits is slightly off the mark. It asserts that this endorsement, like his opposition to transgender people serving in the military and his encouragement of overly aggressive police behavior, is primarily aimed at recapturing his base. This conjures an image of the president deliberately formulating political strategy, and it is far from obvious that our president is capable of such rational action. To the contrary, I believe that our president is the genuine article — a genuine nativist, a genuine bigot, a genuine bully. Although his positions may be pleasing to his base, they are primarily, as it is said, Trump being Trump. ALAN STEVENS, BELLPORT, N.Y. "
10,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • A van crashed into pedestrians in a popular tourist area in Barcelona, killing at least 13 people in an attack for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility. At least 80 others have been injured in the worst terrorist attack in Spain since 2004. Two people have been taken into custody. Early Friday, the police reported killing four people in Cambrils, a seaside town south of Barcelona, in what Spanish news media said may have been an attempted second attack. Here’s the latest news on this developing story. _____ • Conflicting messages by the Trump administration have deepened confusion over the United States’ strategy for North Korea. "
11,"This was supposed to be a big week for infrastructure at the White House, in case you had not heard, and the person in charge was a builder who had weathered one of the great disasters to hit his hometown. Turned out he had other things on his mind, both then and now. After Hurricane Sandy caused mass destruction in the Northeast, Donald J. Trump, citizen of New York, immediately took to Twitter to do his part, recognizing that circumstances required him to relax a deadline. On the table was Mr. Trump’s claim that he would donate $5 million if President Obama released his college transcript and passport — part of the stack of so-called birther provocations that rose from the bogus theories that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Trump peddled those lies for five years, barging into the national political conversation. (Mr. Trump, by the way, had not given $5 million to charity out of his own pocket in the previous 20 years combined, by the estimate of The Washington Post’s David A. Fahrenthold.) Even at an hour of grave calamity, Mr. Trump did not want to surrender the pedestal he had built on a racial lie. More than 100 people had died; thousands of homes, along with hospitals, police and fire stations, water treatment plants, communication hubs and power generators had been wrecked or damaged. Among the places associated with his name (though not actually owned by Mr. Trump), The Trump SoHo New York hotel had no power for four days. Casinos in Atlantic City with the Trump name out front were shut down. Many people in three buildings called, at the time, Trump Place, part of the Riverside South development that was built above a filled-in lagoon, could not go to their jobs downtown. "
12,"WASHINGTON — The two top officers aboard a destroyer during a deadly collision off the coast of Japan in June were relieved of their duties on Friday, the Navy’s Seventh Fleet said. A number of other sailors were punished for their roles in the crash. The announcement followed the release of a harrowing preliminary report on the collision between the destroyer Fitzgerald and a freighter that killed seven people aboard the American ship. It was one of the Navy’s deadliest accidents in years. The ship’s captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; his second-in-command; and the senior enlisted sailor were relieved of their duties by the head of the Seventh Fleet in Japan, Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin. A statement from the fleet said “inadequate leadership” had contributed to the collision. The statement said a number of other sailors would face disciplinary action. A senior Navy officer said Thursday that about a dozen sailors in total would be punished, including all those on watch the night of June 17. The preliminary report described in detail the terrible moments after the collision and the rescue efforts aboard the ship. "
13,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, killed at least 13 people and wounded more than 80 others when a van zigzagged through a crowd at a popular tourist spot. Two people were later arrested, including a Moroccan man whose identification documents had been used to rent the van. But the police said neither was believed to be the driver, who remained at large. The Islamic State claimed that the perpetrators were its “soldiers,” adding Spain to the list of European countries — including France and Britain — where vehicles have been used in attacks on civilians. Here’s the latest news on this developing story. _____ "
14,"“I know one wealthy person,” Robert Gangi, a longtime activist in criminal-justice reform, offered the other day. Mr. Gangi, a little-known Democratic contender in New York City’s mayoral contest, one whose result seems as assured as any in a race across a pond between Michael Phelps and a small, tired farm animal, has raised more than $80,000, though all but $14,000 of it has come from his own funds. According to the rules of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, a candidate seeking public matching funds must raise at least $250,000 from donors in New York to qualify for the money it distributes; Mr. Gangi, thus, has come up considerably short. Mayor Bill de Blasio, having raised $4.8 million, mostly through small donations, has not. Although almost no one imagines he will lose, he petitioned the board for public money regardless, successfully arguing that Mr. Gangi and another opponent, Sal Albanese, presented enough of a challenge that he should receive the near $2.6 million for which he was eligible. It is as if an heiress in the midst of a divorce demanded from the courts that her husband, a bartender, start paying her alimony. Before Mr. Gangi’s bid, one he is waging out of his rent-stabilized apartment on the Upper West Side, he served as executive director of the 173-year-old Corrections Association of New York and later as a founder of the Police Reform Organizing Project. Among other initiatives, PROP, as it is known, has sent volunteer monitors into criminal courts to examine and tally the impact of arrests for low-level offenses, most of which falls on black and Hispanic communities. Mr. Gangi has argued that as long as we keep policing quality-of-life crimes in accordance with the “broken windows” approach to law-enforcement, we are essentially criminalizing skin color. Although district attorneys around the city in recent weeks have dismissed hundreds of thousands of old warrants for low-level offenses, police officers maintain the discretion to continue to make those kinds of arrests. What does it mean for the mayor to denounce bigotry and hail the city’s progressive, embracing values, as he has done since the events in Charlottesville and repeatedly during the Trump era, without calling for a dismantling of “broken windows’’ altogether? Presumably, Mr. Gangi might have posed such a question to him in a debate, but a civic forum involving the two is one we are unlikely to witness. Created in the late 1980s as a response to the corruption scandals that had plagued the city, the Campaign Finance Board also sponsors debates and has required, since 1997, that anyone receiving its funds participates in them. The intent of the original stipulation was virtuous — that taxpayers should hear from the candidates who were receiving their money. But as it works now, someone who files paperwork for the matching-funds program but fails to raise enough money is not invited, which essentially silences anyone who is inadequately networked. Next week Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Albanese will debate each other, and Mr. Gangi will have to watch them on television. "
15,"Stocks plunged on Thursday as losses for Cisco Systems hurt technology companies and Walmart declined after its latest quarterly report. Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day. It was the second-worst day for stocks in a year of few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there were no specific signs of economic trouble on Thursday. The S.&P. 500 dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite index sank 123.20 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. William Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting last month signaled “a little bit of a change in tone,” and suggested that the central bank was becoming more cautious about raising interest rates. That helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, by preventing them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefit high-dividend stocks. Investors were also assessing the state of President Trump’s pro-business agenda as he continues to face criticism for his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday. Investors had hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would strengthen corporate profits. "
16,"LONDON — At London’s flagship modern art gallery, Tate Modern, one of this summer’s most lauded exhibitions features work by African-American artists made in the age of Martin Luther King Jr. Yet, while “Soul of a Nation” is nominally a historical display, gallery goers spilling out of the show this week found an obvious contemporary resonance to the art they had just seen. “There’s still a struggle, right?” said Chris Daley, a designer, in a reference to President Trump’s remarks this week on white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. “We’re still in a system where one part benefits from suppressing the other.” But though visitors to the exhibition were angered by Mr. Trump’s words, several did not see it as the turning point that it has perhaps been considered in some quarters of America. Mr. Daley, a 34-year-old Londoner, ran through a series of previous actions by Mr. Trump that he said had already highlighted the president’s position. There was the proposed wall on the Mexican border. The suggestion that some Mexican immigrants were rapists. “There’s a long list,” said Mr. Daley. “Nobody is really that surprised on this side of the pond because we’re on the outside looking in.” It is a sentiment that has been echoed in parts of the British and European commentariat. While there is plenty of outrage at Mr. Trump’s comments — Germany’s justice minister called the president’s reaction “unbearable” — many do not see this as the moment when a mask slipped. They feel it slipped some time ago. "
17,"North Korea is a true Orwellian society: The totalitarian government, currently led by Kim Jong-un, keeps its citizens disconnected from the internet and controls radio stations and newspapers, filling them with propaganda. The most minimal sign of dissent could land one in a concentration camp, as demonstrated by the case of Otto Warmbier, an American student held in North Korea for 17 months after he was charged with attempting to steal a propaganda poster. He returned to the United States this June in a coma, “unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands,” according to a statement from his parents; the 22-year-old died soon after. As tension between the two countries intensifies — President Trump has promised “fire and fury” should North Korea attempt an attack on the United States — below are two books that delve into the regime and life under Kim rule, while another makes policy suggestions for dealing with the nuclear threat. UNDER THE LOVING CARE OF THE FATHERLY LEADER
North Korea and the Kim Dynasty
by Bradley K. Martin
868 pp. Thomas Dunne/St. Martin’s. (2005) The Kim regime was established in 1948 by Kim Il-sung and inherited by his son Kim Jong-il, who ruled until his death in 2011, when his son Jong-un took over. This book, which took Martin 25 years to complete, draws on source material from China and Russia, as well as extensive interviews with defectors to paint a portrait of these two men. Kim Il-sung fought against the Japanese occupation in the 1930s, and came to power by creating a cult of personality that honored him as a deity. He was the country’s leading novelist, designer, philosopher and Ping-Pong trainer. North Koreans celebrated Kim’s birthday instead of Christmas, and he distributed gifts to children across the country like Santa Claus. Many genuinely revered him, but Martin argues that support has waned after his death in 1994. In his interviews, Martin learned that some North Koreans welcome the idea of a war; one defector says “people figure they will die of hunger or die in war. They’re prepared to die in a nuclear war.” THE AQUARIUMS OF PYONGYANG
Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag
By Kang Chol-hwan and Pierre Rigoulot

18,"WASHINGTON — The nationwide push to dismantle Confederate memorials divided Congress’s most senior Democrats on Thursday, as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, pressed for the removal of Confederate statues from the Capitol while her Senate counterpart tried to keep the focus on President Trump’s equivocation over white nationalists. “The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,” Ms. Pelosi said, putting pressure on the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, to act. “If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, took a very different tack, saying that Mr. Trump and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, were “trying to divert attention away from the president’s refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism and other forms of bigotry.” The division highlighted how delicate the political path forward might be for Democrats after the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., this past weekend. While large majorities of Americans say they disagree with the beliefs of white nationalists and the Ku Klux Klan, even Democratic voters are divided over the removal of Confederate memorials. The fate of those monuments has been the focus of attention around the country after the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, which protested the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a city park. "
19,"With a sweeping overhaul of the tax code on the horizon, two Senate Democrats believe this is the moment to broach the third rail of climate change policy: a carbon tax. The plan by the senators, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, to level a $49 per metric ton fee on greenhouse gas emissions is widely acknowledged as a long shot. But the lawmakers, along with climate activists and a cadre of conservative supporters, insist the tax reform is a way to create bipartisan support. The senators propose to use a portion of the estimated $2.1 trillion they anticipate in carbon tax revenue over the first 10 years to reduce the top marginal corporate tax income rate, something the White House has called for. They also hope to have an ally in President Trump’s economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who met in February with a prominent group of Republicans advocating a similar plan. No Republican lawmaker has signed on to the Senate measure. Mr. Trump, who routinely proclaims his affection for coal, during the presidential campaign flatly rejected via Twitter a suggestion that he might put a price on carbon pollution. The senators steering the effort admit they haven’t even broached a carbon tax directly with members of the administration, and the White House has distanced itself from the policy. Yet even the fiercest critics of a carbon tax say they can’t afford to dismiss the effort. “What is that Taylor Swift song? We are never, ever, ever getting back together? This is never, ever, ever going to happen,” said Grover Norquist, the anti-tax lobbyist and founder of Americans for Tax Reform. But, he added, the possibility of a carbon tax routinely re-emerges. “This time there is money for promoting that this idea might happen someday,” he said. Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, which promotes fossil fuels, agreed. “It’s so much revenue that it’s always going to be on the table and it’s always a threat,” he said. "

21,"President Trump is rattling the rest of the world, too. Having scared a lot of people last week with his bombast over North Korea, causing jitters about nuclear war, he threatened on Friday to use force to quell chaos in Venezuela. That threat poured fuel on the worsening conflict between President Nicolás Maduro and his opponents. It also unsettled people across Latin America, which has suffered a long history of American intervention. It’s still not clear why Mr. Trump raised the subject of Venezuela in a discussion with reporters about North Korea, or what precisely he meant when he said, “We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.” Still, it seemed like another instance of reckless militaristic swagger by a president whose “America First” campaign rejected foreign entanglements, yet who in seven months has carried out the country’s first missile strikes against Syrian forces and has expanded counterterrorism operations in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. He is also considering sending more troops to Afghanistan. Venezuela, with possibly the world’s largest oil reserves, had a chance to become one of South America’s leading democracies. Mr. Maduro turned the country into an economic basket case and himself into a dictator. He modeled himself on his left-wing predecessor, Hugo Chávez, with excessive public spending that, coupled with mismanagement and falling oil prices, was unsustainable. The inflation rate for 2017 is estimated at 720 percent, and it is believed that 80 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, some suffering from malnutrition and full-scale hunger. More than 120 people have died in several months of protests demanding Mr. Maduro’s removal. Some analysts fear outright civil war. In this environment, Mr. Trump’s threat of military action is a lifeline for Mr. Maduro. Like other Venezuelan leaders, Mr. Maduro has used the United States to rally his people, often with specious warnings of American plots to invade. On Monday, thousands of government supporters rallied in Caracas to support Mr. Maduro and denounce Mr. Trump’s “military option.” Regional leaders also responded to his threat. Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, said on Sunday, “The possibility of a military intervention shouldn’t even be considered.” The episode appears to have set back the progress made by President Barack Obama, who strengthened ties with South America by working cooperatively to resolve regional disputes. Vice President Mike Pence, on a trip to the region, attempted to calm the outrage, saying in Buenos Aires on Tuesday that he was confident about reaching a “peaceable” solution for Venezuela through economic and diplomatic pressure on Mr. Maduro. But Mr. Pence also told NBC News on Monday, “We’re simply not going to tolerate seeing Venezuela collapse into dictatorship.” The precipitous decline of Venezuela is not just a tragedy for its people, but a threat to regional stability. Mr. Trump should continue to toughen sanctions, but any lasting solution will be achieved only in concert with regional leaders. "
22,"Donald Trump is still president. Hard to know what to do with this, people. In less than a week he’s managed to put on one of the most divisive, un-helpful, un-healing presidential performances in American history. It’s been a great stretch for fans of Richard Nixon and James Buchanan. On Wednesday Trump had to dissolve his business advisory councils because the C.E.O.s were fleeing like panic-stricken geese from a jumbo jet. We now have a president who can’t get the head of Campbell Soup to the White House. Trump also announced plans to hold a rally next week in Arizona, where he’s said he’s “seriously considering” a pardon for former sheriff Joe Arpaio, the loathsome racial profiler who never met a constitutional amendment he didn’t ignore. Arpaio’s treatment of Latinos won him a criminal contempt conviction, but of course that’s nothing to our leader. We had no idea how bad this guy was going to be. Admit it — during the campaign you did not consider the possibility that if a terrible tragedy struck the country involving all of our worst political ghosts of the past plus neo-Nazism, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz would know the appropriate thing to say but Donald Trump would have no idea. George W. Bush would have been at the funeral for the slain civil rights demonstrator in a second. About the best Trump could do was to praise Heather Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, for writing “the nicest things” about him. Bro did indeed express appreciation for the president’s denunciation of “those who promote violence and hatred.” That was his written-by-someone-else statement, which preceded the despicable impromptu version. We’re only safe when he’s using prepared remarks. The extemporaneous Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville wasn’t just tone-deaf and heartless; you had to wonder about the overall mental balance of a man who managed to both defend the alt-right demonstrators in Virginia and brag about his real estate in the neighborhood. "
23,"I’ve been haunted by a story from Iran that appeared in The Times back in May. It described a campaign for the Tehran City Council by Payam Mohebi, a veterinarian who explained that he was running “for the animals.” The clerics in Iran regard dogs as impure, and it’s against the law to have one. Dog owners who defy the ban are subject to a fine, 60 lashes and the possible execution of their pet. Dr. Mohedi’s campaign poster showed him with a stray dog. That was gutsy (he lost the race), but what has stuck with me is what he had to say to Thomas Erdbrink, The Times’s Tehran bureau chief, about the city’s elected leadership: “We have one million pets in this city — what are they thinking? There is a massive gap between our politicians and us.” The image of a government as disconnected as that from the will of the people it purports to serve should leave us shaking our heads in sympathy and dismay. But look in the mirror: The image that reflects back is our own. Millions of Americans oppose repeal of the Affordable Care Act; in one poll in late June, only 12 percent supported the Senate Republican plan then pending. A separate poll that month found that overall support for the existing law had passed the 50 percent mark for the first time, probably because of increased public appreciation of its benefits and the consequences of doing away with the law. And yet the Congress of the United States spent months doing almost nothing else but trying different ways to strip people of their health coverage. What were they thinking? O.K., in fairness, the Senate has devoted time to confirming President Trump’s judicial nominees, some of dubious merit. Last month, on a party-line vote of 51 to 47, the Senate confirmed a Kentucky lawyer, John K. Bush, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Under the pseudonym G. Morris, Judge Bush was a regular blogger on a conservative site called Elephants in the Bluegrass, on which he shared his opinion that Roe v. Wade was one of “the two greatest tragedies in our country”; the other was the Dred Scott case, the decision that denied American citizenship to slaves. The Senate has been slower to approve another Trump nominee, Damien Schiff, a staff lawyer for the right-wing Pacific Legal Foundation nominated to the United States Court of Federal Claims, perhaps because on his own blog he called Justice Anthony M. Kennedy a “judicial prostitute.” "
24,"The American Civil Liberties Union has a long history of defending the First Amendment rights of groups on both the far left and the far right. This commitment led the organization to successfully sue the city of Charlottesville, Va., last week on behalf of a white supremacist rally organizer. The rally ended with a Nazi sympathizer plowing his car into a crowd, killing a counterprotester and injuring many. After the A.C.L.U. was excoriated for its stance, it responded that “preventing the government from controlling speech is absolutely necessary to the promotion of equality.” Of course that’s true. The hope is that by successfully defending hate groups, its legal victories will fortify free-speech rights across the board: A rising tide lifts all boats, as it goes. While admirable in theory, this approach implies that the country is on a level playing field, that at some point it overcame its history of racial discrimination to achieve a real democracy, the cornerstone of which is freedom of expression. I volunteered with the A.C.L.U. as a law student in 2011, and I respect much of its work. But it should rethink how it understands free speech. By insisting on a narrow reading of the First Amendment, the organization provides free legal support to hate-based causes. More troubling, the legal gains on which the A.C.L.U. rests its colorblind logic have never secured real freedom or even safety for all. For marginalized communities, the power of expression is impoverished for reasons that have little to do with the First Amendment. Numerous other factors in the public sphere chill their voices but amplify others. Most obviously, the power of speech remains proportional to wealth in this country, despite the growth of social media. When the Supreme Court did consider the impact of money on speech in Citizens United, it enabled corporations to translate wealth into direct political power. The A.C.L.U. wrongly supported this devastating ruling on First Amendment grounds. "
25,"The American Civil Liberties Union was under severe duress. Hate mail poured in, death threats, and the executive director was spat on. That moment, 40 years ago, fought over a planned rally by a small group of neo-Nazis in Skokie, Ill., would become one of the organization’s most notable cases, and to some, among its finest moments. The A.C.L.U. cemented its reputation for fighting for civil liberties, even, or especially, if it meant, in the words of its director at the time, “defending my enemy.” That philosophy came into renewed focus last week as the organization went to court to fight for the right of white nationalists to hold a rally at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Va. But the episode is likely to be remembered less for the constitutional principle than for its violent toll: brawls, ugly confrontations and the death of a 32-year-old woman. “I won’t be a fig leaf for Nazis,” a member of the A.C.L.U. of Virginia board, Waldo Jaquith, posted on Twitter, announcing that he was resigning from the organization. Among his parting messages to the organization was, “Don’t defend Nazis to allow them to kill people.” "
26,"Donald Trump chose Trump Tower, the place where he began his presidential campaign, as the place to plunge a dagger into his presidency. Trump’s jaw-dropping defense of white supremacists, white nationalists and Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., exposed once more what many of us have been howling into the wind since he emerged as a viable candidate: That he is a bigot, a buffoon and a bully. He has done nothing since his election to disabuse us of this notion and everything to confirm it. Anyone expressing surprise is luxuriating in a self-crafted shell of ignorance. And yet, it seems too simplistic, too convenient, to castigate only Trump for elevating these vile racists. To do so would be historical fallacy. Yes, Trump’s comments give them a boost, grant them permission, provide them validation, but it is also the Republican Party through which Trump burst that has been courting, coddling and accommodating these people for decades. Trump is an articulation of the racists in Charlottesville and they are an articulation of him, and both are a logical extension of a party that has too often refused to rebuke them. It’s not that Democrats have completely gotten this right, either. Too often, in response to the conservative impulse to punish, the liberal impulse is to pity. Pity does not alleviate oppression; it simply assuages guilt. The pity is not for the receiver but for the giver. But in the modern age one party has operated with the ethos of racial inclusion and with an eye on celebrating varied forms of diversity, and the other has at times appealed directly to the racially intolerant by providing quiet sufferance. "
27,"HONG KONG — Carrots or sticks? Aid or sanctions? Engagement or containment? American attempts to counter North Korea’s nuclear program did not begin last week when President Trump promised to unleash “fire and fury” against the isolated government. For decades, Mr. Trump’s predecessors have waded into the diplomatic mire, trying to threaten or cajole North Korea’s ruling family into abandoning the country’s weapons programs. Each failed. North Korea, which conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, has detonated five test bombs and is expected to explode a sixth. Since 1993, the country has also launched a series of missiles, improving their distance, accuracy and lethality each year. Despite the North’s weapons tests and its bellicose bluster, the country has occasionally signaled a willingness to talk. The early 1990s brought the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war. North Korea threatened to withdraw from the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and begin to reprocess plutonium — both of which it eventually did. In 1993, the North launched a missile capable of hitting Japan. Former President Jimmy Carter went to negotiate with Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader, against the wishes of President Bill Clinton. The deal, which Mr. Carter struck and Mr. Clinton would eventually agree to soon after Kim’s death, amounted to a generous offer. President Clinton promised to lift decades-old sanctions, supply the North with 500,000 tons of oil a year and provide $4 billion in aid to construct a light-water reactor capable of producing nuclear energy but not weapons. In exchange for the reactor and oil, the North would end its weapons program and close — but not dismantle — the Yongbyon complex. "
28,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. All the major late-night shows on Wednesday continued denouncing President Trump’s defense of the right-wing protesters in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend. James Corden pounced on Mr. Trump after chief executives resigned en masse from two presidential councils, leading Mr. Trump to disband the advisory groups altogether. The way Seth Meyers sees it, Mr. Trump was using questions about the future of the chief White House strategist Steve Bannon to build intrigue in the news media. Mr. Meyers then took a look at the Twitter messages that Mr. Trump had posted in response to the departures of business leaders. Stephen Colbert said that Mr. Trump was not being unclear with his statements to reporters this week, he was deliberately professing his affinity for white nationalism. Mr. Colbert quoted from a report that Mr. Trump felt “liberated” after delivering his news conference. "
29,"Stanford, Calif. — California faces serious risks from climate change. Some are already being felt, like the severe heat this summer and recent episodes of extremely low snowpack in the mountains, which the state depends on for much of its water. Those are among the key messages in a new climate science report now under review in the White House. The good news is that California has been working hard to catch up with the climate change that has already happened, and to get ahead of what is still to come. The past five years have painted a clear picture of what is in store for California, according to numerous scientific studies that underpin the new assessment: Rising temperatures will bring more frequent and severe hot spells, intensifying heat stress; more precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, increasing storm water runoff; snow that does fall will melt earlier in the year, leaving less for the warm, dry season; and more moisture will be drawn out of soils and vegetation, increasing stress on crops and ecosystems. All of this will lead to more frequent and severe water deficits, punctuated by wet periods with increasing flood risk. Add rising sea levels, more extensive flooding during storm surges and the acidification of the coastal ocean, and California faces a phalanx of climate-related dangers to human health, agriculture, industry, economic productivity, and terrestrial and marine ecosystems. As the new report makes clear, California is not the only state facing such risks. However, California has been particularly ambitious in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience in the face of climate change uncertainty. The state’s hard work over the past two decades has yielded several lessons for cities, states and countries that face intensifying climate-related stresses. The first is that it is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also enjoying a thriving economy. Since 2001, California’s economy has grown, while its greenhouse gas emissions have fallen. The state recently renewed its landmark cap-and-trade program, which limits total statewide emissions while allowing a marketplace to determine the price polluters must pay. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. "

Then Mr. Trump again equated far-right hate groups with the groups protesting them. On Wednesday morning, chief executives moved to cut ties with the president who rose to fame as a businessman. On today’s episode: Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist for The Times, discusses the president’s relationship with American business leaders. Background reading: • With the collapse of the business councils, Mr. Trump has all but lost his most natural constituency — the corporate leaders who stood to benefit from his agenda of lower taxes and lighter regulation. "
31,"WASHINGTON — There is no annulling this marriage. For several weeks, congressional Republicans have grown more brazen, inch by careful inch, in creating a measure of distance from President Trump. Perhaps he should not declare war on the face of a female host of “Morning Joe,” they have suggested, or antagonize Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader straining to usher Mr. Trump’s agenda through the Capitol. More recently, they have allowed that when a president’s words give heart to neo-Nazis and other white supremacists, it is probably not ideal. Yet this fever dream of an era in Washington — where identifying as anti-Nazi has become grist for an executive-bucking profile in courage — has obscured a longer-term truth about the relationship between Mr. Trump and his ostensible allies in conservative policy making: For now, and almost certainly for much longer, they are stuck with each other. For one, much of the Republican base stands with Mr. Trump, rejecting criticisms of his equivocations about white supremacists and insisting that protest groups on the left are at least as insidious. For another, the president still has a pen — deployed too infrequently to date for elected officials who would prefer to have more to run on next year than a series of post office dedications. “If Republicans want to be in the majority, it’s not a question of sticking from Trump, it’s a question of accomplishing things,” Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said in a phone interview, driving away from a town hall-style forum this week in Ada, Okla. “And most of those things require a presidential signature.” "
32,"PHOENIX — The tweet landed without warning or elaboration, just days before a presidential visit to Arizona: In the early hours of Thursday, President Trump, not for the first time, savaged Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, calling him “toxic” and “WEAK,” hailing Mr. Flake’s primary challenger and drawing fierce pushback from fellow Republicans. By tiptoeing to the edge of endorsing Kelli Ward, a far-right former state senator, over an incumbent Republican, Mr. Trump further roiled a state and region already badly shaken by his campaign and its aftermath. Well before Mr. Trump’s rise, a pair of Western states — Arizona and Nevada — foreshadowed some of the consuming clashes of his presidency, over the definition of conservatism and the struggle for power between diverse, booming cities and far-flung rural precincts. But both states have emerged anew this year as a defining battleground for both parties, in no small part because of Mr. Trump’s thirst for vengeance against Republicans who have crossed him. In Nevada, Senator Dean Heller, who made a great show of denouncing an early effort by Republicans to repeal the federal health care law, drew a primary contest last week from Danny Tarkanian, a frequent political candidate who has branded himself a cheerleader for the White House. In Arizona, which Mr. Trump plans to visit Tuesday, there is Mr. Flake, who shunned Mr. Trump in 2016 and recently published a book denouncing his political worldview, alongside a fellow Republican, Senator John McCain, a biting critic of the president who cast the deciding vote to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. McCain swiftly went to his colleague’s defense Thursday after Mr. Trump’s tweet. Calling Mr. Flake a “principled legislator,” Mr. McCain said in a tweet: “Our state needs his leadership now more than ever.” "
33,"WASHINGTON — Despite ongoing rebukes over his defense of white supremacists, President Trump defiantly returned to his campaign’s nativist themes on Thursday. He lamented an assault on American “culture,” revived a bogus, century-old story about killing Muslim extremists and attacked Republicans with a renewed vigor. Hours after a terrorist attack in Spain, Mr. Trump recalled a debunked event in which Gen. John J. “Black Jack” Pershing supposedly killed Muslim rebels in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in the blood of pigs, which Muslims are forbidden to eat. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in Barcelona, where the driver of a van crashed into a busy tourist boulevard, killing 13. “Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,” Mr. Trump tweeted, spreading a mythical story even as he again accused the news media of being “Fake News” in another tweet. “There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!” As when he trafficked in the same unproven legend during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump ignored the conclusions of historians, who repeatedly have said it did not happen. Additionally, his claim that Pershing ended terrorism in the Philippines for 35 years is refuted by the violence that continued for decades after the rebellion that ended in 1913. Mr. Trump also appeared in peril of losing support from key Republicans he will need to advance his agenda in Congress. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, questioned the president’s “stability,” and Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, declared Mr. Trump’s moral authority is “compromised.” Mr. Corker, a sober voice on foreign policy and a frequent ally of the Trump administration, bluntly questioned the president’s ability to perform the duties of his office. "
34,"Nadia Murad was 21 years old when, she says, Islamic State fighters abducted her, beat her and raped her. Her offense: belonging to the minority Yazidi community, whom the Islamic State regards as infidels. Her cause for the last two years: demanding justice for the Islamic State’s atrocities. This week, Ms. Murad clinched a small, but important victory. Her country, Iraq, agreed to let the Security Council appoint a panel of independent investigators to gather evidence of the most serious crimes committed by the Islamic State, and not just those against Yazidis. Lacking that, the Security Council would have had to adopt a resolution to create such a panel. Still to be resolved is where and how those crimes will be prosecuted, and how to make sure those trials are credible and not displays of victor’s justice. Ms. Murad’s quest poses an acute test for the promise of international justice, born from the ashes of Nazi genocide 70 years ago, after World War II. If the most powerful countries in the world cannot hold accountable those who are accused of enslaving women for sex, beheading their perceived enemies, turning children into suicide bombers and carrying out what an international panel believes could be an act of genocide against the Yazidi people, what is the very notion of international justice good for? The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is accused of some of the gravest crimes known to humanity, and not only against the Yazidis. It does not have powerful countries defending it, as does say, the government of Syria, which also stands accused of a raft of war crimes. "
35,"The business elite has deserted President Trump’s advisory panels in drastic fashion. Now many of them are wondering whether Gary D. Cohn, the White House official whom they see as their man in the administration, will also jump ship. Mr. Cohn, the White House’s top economic adviser, looked uncomfortable standing next to Mr. Trump during the news conference on Tuesday in which the president defended white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Cohn, who is Jewish, was “disgusted” and “deeply upset” by Mr. Trump’s comments, according to several people close to him. But he hasn’t expressed his views publicly. And White House aides denied that he was planning to quit, even as the president disbanded two economic advisory councils as chief executives abandoned them. Perhaps that is because Mr. Cohn has other goals? He is said to be the leading contender to head the Federal Reserve when Janet L. Yellen’s term expires in February. And he appears determined to press forward with his portion of the Trump economic agenda: After the news conference, Mr. Cohn told reporters that the White House planned to focus on a tax overhaul in the fall and that he believed it could be in place by the end of the year. But Mr. Cohn is under pressure on multiple fronts. Others in the business world have questioned how long he can continue on the panel without irrevocably damaging his reputation, Reuters and CNBC reported. And he is locked in a battle with populists in the Trump administration. The White House’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, told The American Prospect: “We’re still fighting. There’s Treasury and Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying.” "
36,"SYDNEY, Australia — Australia’s Senate is rowdy and raucous, and often compared to a schoolyard. But after the leader of the anti-immigrant One Nation party walked into the chamber on Thursday wearing a burqa, the room went silent. Then came the stunned responses: “oh” and “what on earth.” The party leader, Pauline Hanson, took her seat as political rivals watched astounded. Senators from her party laughed. Removing the garment, Ms. Hanson, who is not Muslim, said that the burqa, a full-body and face covering, should be banned in Australia. She said that she wore the veil to draw attention to her party’s push to ban full-face coverings in public. “I’m quite happy to remove this because this is not what should belong in this Parliament,” she said as the Senate met during parliamentary sitting week, in which lawmakers debate legislation and other matters. In a speech in the chamber last year, Ms. Hanson said that Australia was “in danger of being swamped by Muslims.” A recent report from the Trump administration referred to Ms. Hanson in listing her party as a threat to religious freedom.

37,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • A widening gap. President Trump said today that it was “foolish” to remove symbols of the Confederacy, adding that U.S. culture was being “ripped apart.” Mr. Trump’s insistence that left-wing counterprotesters were as culpable as neo-Nazis and white supremacists for last weekend’s violence in Charlottesville, Va., has divided his core supporters from Republican leaders, who fear lasting damage to their party. Chief executives who planned to announce a mass defection from presidential advisory panels were pre-empted by Mr. Trump, who dissolved the two councils. Here’s what the executives are saying. After the president’s news conference on Tuesday, his aides described themselves as stunned, despondent and numb. But they also said Mr. Trump felt liberated. • The Confederate state of America. The violence in Charlottesville took place at a demonstration against the proposed removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee. "
38,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The Pacific has been gobbling up the California coast with growing voraciousness. A study this year by the United States Geological Survey predicted that as much as two thirds of Southern California’s beaches could be lost by the end of the century. Among the variables, said Patrick Barnard, a geologist and author of the report, are rising seas and intensified storms, both linked to climate change, as well as hundreds of river dams that are blocking the flow of sand to beaches. It all spells trouble for buildings and homes perched along the shore. The peril grew vivid last year in Pacifica, a seaside city just south of San Francisco. Widely shared drone footage showed apartment buildings poised at the edge of a cliff as mounds of dirt crumbled from its face and into the ocean. The structures were declared uninhabitable and torn down. In Big Sur this year, erosion accelerated by the wet winter knocked out a bridge and sent cascades of mud tumbling onto Highway 1. "

40,"Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had her 15 minutes of infamy today when she posted a photo on Instagram of herself exiting a military jet. The plane was stamped with the name of our country. Ms. Linton’s slim figure was emblazoned with brand names she tagged. Sunglasses: Tom Ford. Shoes: Valentino. Her scarf was, of course, Hermès. The comparisons to Marie Antoinette rolled right in. “Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable,” commented Jenni Miller, a Democrat from Portland, Ore. Rather than ignoring the comment, Ms. Linton opted for a retort one would expect from a grade-school bully: “Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable!” she asked. “Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?” Linton continued: “I’m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day ‘trip’ than you did.” Keeping it classy, she added, “You’re adorably out of touch.” It’s Ms. Linton who’s out of touch. And this isn’t the first time she has made headlines for being utterly tone-deaf. Ms. Linton, a 36-year-old native of Scotland, gained attention for her memoir about the time she spent in Zambia when she was 18. Title: “In Congo’s Shadow: One Girl’s Perilous Journey to the Heart of Africa.” "
41,"With white supremacists emboldened and a national spotlight shining on bigotry and hate, 67 former state attorneys general are calling on Americans and their leaders to condemn hatred unequivocally. Follow the example, they suggest, that an Alabama attorney general set four decades ago. In February 1976, that attorney general, Bill Baxley, received a threatening letter. It was from Edward R. Fields, a grand dragon in the Ku Klux Klan, who was furious that the state had reopened an investigation into the Birmingham church bombing that killed four young girls in 1963. He demanded a response, and Mr. Baxley obliged. “Dear ‘Dr.’ Fields,” he wrote. “My response to your letter of February 19, 1976, is — kiss my ass.” Mr. Baxley did not publicize his letter. (“For one thing,” he recalled in an interview on Tuesday, “I would have been worried about what my mother would say about me using that language.”) But the K.K.K. quickly released it, thinking it would hurt him politically. It did not quite work out that way. And four decades later, Mr. Baxley’s retort is the centerpiece of the former attorney generals’ statement. The statement — which was released Monday and is conspicuously addressed not to President Trump or any other official, but rather to the broad, unnamed public — begins, “There are times in the life of a nation, or a president, or a state attorney general, when one is called upon to respond directly to the voice of hate.” "
42,"Derek Black, a former white nationalist and a godson of David Duke, spoke with Michael Barbaro in an episode of “The Daily” that received a particularly intense response on Tuesday. In the podcast, Mr. Black describes his experience growing up in a white nationalist family, taking part in a radio show on his father’s website Stormfront.org and how he turned on the white nationalist movement. This is an unedited transcription from the podcast. Please listen to the corresponding audio before quoting from it. DEREK BLACK: Yeah, I was born into one of the most prominent white nationalist families in the country. MICHAEL BARBARO: Wow. D.B.: My godfather for lack of any other word was David Duke, who was married to my mother before I was born … and then my father started the largest white nationalist website .. Stormfront … it was the first white nationalist website on the internet, and it has been the largest one ever since. So I grew up with the leadership of the white nationalist movement, all coming over to the house, and when I got older, we’d go to conferences and it was my life. M.B.: Derek Black grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida, across from the president’s Mar-a-Lago mansion and he used to drive past it almost every day in a red pickup truck with a confederate flag sticker on the back window. His father is Don Black, once a grand wizard of the K.K.K. M.B.: It sounds like what you’re describing is like you’re the First Child of American white nationalism? "
43,"WASHINGTON — As anyone associated with the Trump administration knows, it only takes one outburst — a few haphazard emojis here, a call to The New Yorker there — to cement a new reputation. This week, in the time it took her to type out an Instagram screed, Louise Linton transformed herself from the Treasury secretary’s wife to a Real Housewife of the Treasury. The protests and rallies and arguments roiling the country for months have not seemed to bother Ms. Linton, a Scottish actress who spent the summer after her wedding to Steven Mnuchin posting evidence of her lavish lifestyle on Instagram. She zipped around on a speedboat in an Italian lake. She sipped wine at a restaurant overlooking the Louvre. She lounged in a very nice-looking pool with a very nice-looking giant inflatable swan, a tiny Chihuahua nestled in her arms. Along the way, Ms. Linton tagged and touted a parade of designers. “#TomFord.” “#Valentinorockstudheels.” “#HermesScarf.” This in-the-clouds lifestyle abruptly collided with her husband’s political day job on Monday after Ms. Linton, 36, dressed down a stranger on Instagram for criticizing her travels. She apologized hours later, but it was too late to stop the social-media dredging of her past mistakes, including “In Congo’s Shadow,” a much-criticized memoir about her spotty gap year spent in Africa. It was too late to stop critics from defacing her Wikipedia page, usually the first sign of any true social media frenzy. And it was too late to go back to her relatively under-the-radar Washington life. She even managed to upstage President Trump, a man who had just stared directly into the sun. "
44,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s declaration that “we will win” in Afghanistan came with bellicose language about taking “fast and powerful” retribution against militants and a promise to succeed where other presidents have failed to resolve the nearly 16-year-old conflict. Left unclear by the Trump administration was the answer to a question that has stumped Washington, including the two previous commanders in chief, since the United States became involved in the war there: What does winning look like in Afghanistan? For Mr. Trump, winning looks a lot like a very long war. “From now on, victory will have a clear definition,” Mr. Trump said on Monday during his prime-time televised address on his strategy for Afghanistan. “Attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing Al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.” But hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the president’s top advisers offered a far different view of success, arguing that the ultimate solution to the conflict in Afghanistan was a settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban, who would theoretically be beaten down by the Americans and forced to the negotiating table. Mr. Tillerson endorsed that approach on Tuesday, arguing that the president had laid out a strategy “intended to put pressure on the Taliban.” "
45,"ERBIL, Iraq — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis asked the president of Iraq’s Kurdish autonomous region on Tuesday to postpone a referendum next month on Kurdish independence. Mr. Mattis’s meeting with President Massoud Barzani was part of a broader push by American officials to head off what they fear may be a new period of political instability as Iraq continues its battle against the Islamic State. “Our point right now is to stay focused like a laser beam on the defeat of ISIS and to let nothing distract us,” Mr. Mattis told reporters, using an acronym for the Islamic State, shortly before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous region. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson made a similar appeal for the Kurds to postpone the referendum, which is scheduled for Sept. 25, in a telephone call earlier this month with Mr. Barzani. So did Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command, who visited Iraq last week. But Kurdish officials said that Mr. Barzani did not pull back from the referendum in his meeting with Mr. Mattis even as he has kept the door open for further talks with Iraqi officials in Baghdad and with the United States. “We intend to proceed with the referendum on Sept. 25 to allow our people to determine their own future,” Masrour Barzani, a top Kurdish security official and the son of Massoud Barzani, said on Tuesday night. “This remains the only solution; forced coexistence in Iraq isn’t working.” "
46,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday denied Egypt $96 million in aid and delayed $195 million in military funding because of concerns over Egypt’s human rights record and its cozy relationship with North Korea. Analysts said they were surprised by the moves, which followed an Oval Office meeting in April between President Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, during which Mr. Trump lavished praise on the military strongman. “I just want to let everybody know, in case there was any doubt, that we are very much behind President el-Sisi,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt. The United States has, believe me, backing, and we have strong backing.” Egypt is among the largest recipients of United States aid. But on Tuesday, the State Department confirmed that it was curtailing its funding to the country because of its lack of progress in human rights and a new law restricting the activities of nongovernmental organizations. Asked if Egypt’s robust relationship with North Korea played a role in Tuesday’s action, a State Department official would say only that issues of concern have been raised with Cairo, but refused to provide details about the talks. While Mr. Sisi approved the new law almost two months after his meeting with Mr. Trump, concerns over Egypt’s human rights record and its relationship with North Korea have been percolating for years. "
47,"A federal jury in Las Vegas declined to convict four men of any crimes for their participation in the 2014 armed standoff near the Bundy ranch in Bunkerville, Nev. During that conflict, ranchers and militia members blocked federal officers from confiscating livestock owned by the Nevada cattleman Cliven Bundy. On Tuesday, jurors acquitted the defendants Richard R. Lovelien and Steven A. Stewart of all charges and O. Scott Drexler and Eric J. Parker on most counts against them. Jurors could not reach a decision on two charges against Mr. Drexler and four charges for Mr. Parker, all related to an alleged assault on a federal officer while carrying a firearm. The United States District Attorney’s office in Nevada issued a statement on Tuesday saying that prosecutors had not decided if they would retry the men on those charges. “That is huge,” said Andrea Parker, whose husband, Eric, was photographed pointing a rifle at officers and others during the confrontation. The image became a symbol of the standoff. “The government did everything they could to stack and get guilty charges,” she continued. “I might actually get to hug my husband for the first time in 18 months.” The decision is only one chapter in the best-known land use case in the contemporary West. For years, officials had ordered Mr. Bundy to remove his cattle from a publicly owned desert expanse near Bunkerville, Nev., northeast of Las Vegas. When he did not, the authorities moved in to do it themselves, but allies of Mr. Bundy traveled from around the country to stop them. "
48,"Last Wednesday, even as top executives were abandoning President Trump’s business advisory councils after his remarks on white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va., other industry leaders were busy making their interests known to a business-friendly White House. Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group, traveled to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to meet with Mark Calabria, the chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence. The men talked tax reform, and Mr. Howard pressed for incentives including the mortgage interest deduction. It was the kind of back and forth that goes on between business interests and the administration every day. And that relative normalcy — even on a day when a number of prominent C.E.O.s publicly abandoned Mr. Trump — served as a reminder that no matter the president’s missteps, his top legislative priorities, particularly tax reform, still draw strong support from business leaders. Now, with some signs that the worst fallout from Mr. Trump’s response to Charlottesville has passed — and with the departure of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s volatile strategist — some in the business community are voicing hope that the administration can tackle tax reform. “Everyone is similarly motivated to reach some version of success, to get a tax bill to the president’s desk that he can sign,” said Rohit Kumar, a tax specialist at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “On tax, there’s a lot of business community support, there’s a lot of similar incentives.” Efforts to overhaul the tax code are expected to begin in earnest this fall. Already, big business groups are lining up to support the White House’s efforts. "
49,"WASHINGTON — A few thousand American troops to train the Afghan Army. A single-minded focus on counterterrorism, with C.I.A. drones and Special Operations units hunting down terrorists. A healthy skepticism of Pakistan as an abettor of Islamic extremism. And an explicit repudiation of grand plans to nurture a Jeffersonian democracy in Central Asia. These are the hallmarks of the Afghanistan strategy  President Trump set out on Monday night. They are also the hallmarks of the strategy  former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried unsuccessfully to sell to President Barack Obama in the fall of 2009. The parallels between Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Biden’s plans provided a sense of irony — even comfort — for the Washington foreign policy establishment, which has felt deeply alienated during this presidency, watching Mr. Trump’s unorthodox statecraft with a mix of horror and dismay. But the similarities are more than a historical footnote: Mr. Biden has talked about running for president in 2020, and he would start off as a front-runner in a splintered Democratic field. If Mr. Biden were to run, he would no doubt make his foreign policy credentials, and Mr. Trump’s haphazard debut on the global stage, a major theme of his campaign. Now that Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Biden’s plan for Afghanistan, he has blurred a line between him and Mr. Obama’s No. 2, as well as with the foreign policy establishment Mr. Trump ran against in 2016. “I had a strong sense of déjà vu listening to Trump’s speech,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “It’s almost as if our national security institutions and foreign policy elite are only capable of recycling different versions of some of the same ideas discussed for more than a decade and a half on Afghanistan.” "
50,"To the Editor: Re “In Speech, Trump Sets U.S. Strategy for Afghan War” (front page, Aug. 22): So after President Barack Obama tried to extricate us from the longest war in our history, President Trump is going to send thousands more American troops into Afghanistan without an exit strategy. Never mind the corrupt government, the ineffective Afghan Army, various warlords, the religious factions that have hated one another for a century. Why spill more blood and spend more money in an effort that is just plain stupid? TOM MINNERICK, ELGIN, ILL. To the Editor: President Trump was supposed to tell us about his new strategy for Afghanistan. I watched, I listened and I realized … same strategy, nothing new. I got suckered into what was nothing more than another effort to divert attention from the major kerfuffle about his comments on Charlottesville, Va. All in all it was a great speech, and kudos to the writer(s). But nothing new was learned about Afghanistan. So given the bait and switch, I would like a refund of my 30 minutes, please. LINDA WILLIAMS, MINT HILL, N.C. To the Editor: President Trump and the generals’ “new” strategy for Afghanistan is to kick the can down the road. Letting the generals make decisions based on conditions on the ground — to increase troop levels, to back them down or to get out, without any time frame — is to continue to muddle along. Muddling along isn’t a bad plan when you cannot come up with a better one. There is no real upside other than the postponement of the uncertainties of leaving now. But the downside is real: the continued sacrifice of our soldiers for an uncertain end. We remain on the horns of a dilemma. "
51,"WASHINGTON — Three American presidents have spent nearly 16 years alternately cajoling, coaxing, threatening and bombing Pakistan, all with a goal of trying to change the Pakistani government’s decisions about the factions it supports in Afghanistan’s desperate civil war. The latest of those, President Trump, tried a different approach during his speech on Monday night. After chastising Pakistan for harboring militants and terrorists, he called on India — Pakistan’s archrival — to flex its economic influence in Afghanistan to help stabilize the country. It was an unsubtle warning that Mr. Trump would not hesitate to put a thumb on one side of the balance in South Asian power politics, publicly drawing the United States closer to India while casting Pakistan as a friendless pariah state. But there was broad skepticism on Tuesday — both in Washington and Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan — that the tactic would force Pakistan’s government to abandon its longtime strategy in Afghanistan. Some even predicted that Mr. Trump’s approach would have the opposite effect, causing Pakistani military and intelligence leaders to recommit to the groups they have long supported in the Afghan conflict. Some said it would further cement links between Pakistan and China, which sees India as a rival in Asia. “Afghanistan continues to be a proxy war between New Delhi and Islamabad, and both sides see it as a zero-sum game,” said Seth G. Jones, an Afghanistan expert at the RAND Corporation, a policy research institute. “Will any of what Trump said move the dial in Islamabad? Probably not,” he said. American officials have spent years trying to persuade Pakistan to sever ties with the Taliban and the Haqqani network, one of its most dangerous factions, which Islamabad has historically seen as reliable proxies to advance Pakistani interests in Afghanistan and blunt Indian influence there. Officials said the support includes both active help with money and military equipment as well as benign neglect — allowing leaders of the groups to use western Pakistan as a base of operations for attacks into Afghanistan.

54,"The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises. What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility, complicated by the position of Mr. McConnell’s wife, Elaine L. Chao, in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, according to more than a dozen people briefed on their imperiled partnership. Angry phone calls and private badmouthing have devolved into open conflict, with the president threatening to oppose Republican senators who cross him, and Mr. McConnell mobilizing to their defense. The rupture between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell comes at a highly perilous moment for Republicans, who face a number of urgent deadlines when they return to Washington next month. Congress must approve new spending measures and raise the statutory limit on government borrowing within weeks of reconvening, and Republicans are hoping to push through an elaborate rewrite of the federal tax code. There is scant room for legislative error on any front. A protracted government shutdown or a default on sovereign debt could be disastrous — for the economy and for the party that controls the White House and both chambers of Congress. Yet Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are locked in a political cold war. Neither man would comment for this article. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, noted that the senator and the president had “shared goals,” and pointed to “tax reform, infrastructure, funding the government, not defaulting on the debt, passing the defense authorization bill.” Still, the back-and-forth has been dramatic. In a series of tweets this month, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. McConnell publicly, and berated him in a phone call that quickly devolved into a profane shouting match. "
55,"Tony A. de Brum, a longtime political leader in the Republic of the Marshall Islands who helped negotiate his country’s independence in the 1970s and decades later fought for its survival in the face of climate change, died on Monday in the capital city, Majuro. He was 72. Hilda C. Heine, the country’s president, announced his death. President Heine called Mr. de Brum a “national hero” for advocating for nuclear disarmament and for giving the Marshall Islands, in the central Pacific, an outsize voice in global climate-change negotiations. In dozens of speeches to the United Nations over the years and in various government roles, Mr. de Brum would weave together the dominant themes of his country: the struggle for independence, the lingering suffering from nuclear testing that the islanders had endured, and the threat of rising sea levels from climate change. The 67 nuclear tests the United States conducted in the Marshall Islands from 1946 to 1958 led to widespread fallout contamination and numerous documented cases of illness and death related to radiation. The nuclear issue was vividly real to Mr. de Brum: As a boy, in 1954, he had witnessed from a fishing boat a test of what was then the most powerful nuclear bomb ever developed by the United States.

56,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Soon after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the United States military’s attention turned to Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda’s leaders were based. The world awaited an invasion that many knew was sure to come. What nobody knew was that the invasion to rout the Taliban and Al Qaeda would turn into a war that has now stretched into its 16th year — America’s longest. It has vexed three American presidencies and outlasted a dozen American military commanders. The war also opened a window into a country where modernity clashed with tribal customs and religious edicts. On Monday night, President Trump announced a new strategy for the war, bringing with it a possible increase in troop levels and a seemingly open-ended commitment to American involvement. Here in reverse-chronological order are images that depict the arc of the war, as seen through the eyes of New York Times photographers who shadowed the soldiers of the United States and its allies.

57,"Beginning in early 2017, I began asking teenagers around the country to make videos in which they responded to the following question: “What are your values as a person? What are American values? Do you think the country is living up to those values today? Why or why not?” Their answers have a new urgency in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Va., which has brought lingering questions about America’s past, present and future to the forefront of the national conversation. The footage in the video above was all submitted before the rally in Charlottesville. I was inspired to collect it by my conversations with young people in the months following the 2016 election. It started with an election-week experiment — I wanted to hear what first-time voters in Pennsylvania had to say about starting their voting lives in what already felt, to me, like a historically bizarre time. In the weeks that followed, I talked to young protesters, youth reporters at a local newspaper and teenage environmental activists. Adults often dismiss teenagers, assuming that they’re callow, apathetic or uninformed. But the kids I was meeting cared passionately about education, foreign policy, racial justice and more. Even when they weren’t sure how they felt about a certain candidate or issue, they were clearly thinking deeply. Struck by what I’d heard, I decided to solicit young people’s opinions in a more systematic way, to paint a picture of how their generation sees the country today. That’s how this collection of personal videos came about. I wrote to dozens of teenagers — young people I’d met at protests, young Republicans I’d talked to around Election Day, teenagers who were already vlogging about their high school experiences on YouTube. I also reached out to Christian youth groups, home-schooling associations, L.G.B.T. rights organizations, groups representing Native American youth and many other organizations, asking them to recommend young people who might want to participate. My goal was to pull together a group that was diverse in as many ways as possible: geographically, politically and in terms of race, gender and sexual orientation. Not everyone said yes — one teenager wrote to me that “Trump could learn from President Putin how to deal with ‘journalists’ like yourself.” But in the end, I got more than 30 videos in which teenagers talked about their values. Some of them also agreed to submit follow-up videos in which they told me more about the communities where they lived. The video above contains a sampling of the videos the teenagers submitted. It’s not as scientific or wide-ranging as a poll or a survey. Instead, think of it as a kind of preview: This is how our country looks today to some of the young people who will help decide its future. "
58,"To the Editor: Re “Why Trump Loves Arizona,” by Tom Zoellner (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Aug. 23): With regard to Arizona’s affinity for President Trump and its rejection of political liberalism, one might at least point out that Arizona flourishes only as a result of handsome federal subsidies by and large financed by strapped taxpayers living elsewhere. In fact, in 2014, the Grand Canyon State received about 43 percent of its operating funds from the national government, the highest ratio in the country. Perhaps the most dismaying failure of liberal Democrats is their consistent inability to hammer home the extent that would-be rugged individualists (most of them white and disdainful of “welfare”) are in fact dependent on the kindness of strangers.

59,"Last week President Trump, facing a mutiny by American business leaders on two of his business advisory councils, abruptly shuttered them. The councils were largely ceremonial, but suddenly they were an opportunity for executives to take a stand against Mr. Trump’s equivocations following the recent white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. And the executives, not often looked to for moral guidance, were being lauded for taking a principled stand against the president. All of which raises a question. What about the people who actually are supposed to provide moral guidance — the president’s 25-member Evangelical Executive Advisory Board? The board, which Mr. Trump created in 2016 while he was running for president, is likewise a largely ceremonial body, though also one designed to give cover to the famously irreligious candidate and allow him an entree to millions of evangelical voters. In exchange, the board members got unprecedented access to the White House; one activist later said the president had them on “speed dial.” President Trump has also followed through on many of his promises to the evangelical community, such as nominating an anti-abortion jurist to the Supreme Court and taking on Planned Parenthood. But access comes at a price. While these leaders may think they are doing the right thing for their followers in keeping a clear line to the president, in doing so they are forced to be silent on his transgressions. So far only one member of the board, A. R. Bernard, a pastor in Brooklyn, has resigned, citing “a deepening conflict in values between myself and the administration.” Although he submitted his resignation on Aug. 15, Mr. Bernard said that he had already decided to leave a few months ago.

60,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — At least seven people were killed Wednesday in southern Afghanistan, where a Taliban suicide car bombing struck an Afghan National Army convoy, Afghan officials said. It was the first major attack since President Trump announced his strategy for Afghanistan in a speech Monday night. Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand Province, said that a car bomb exploded at the parking lot of the Police Headquarters of the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. The target appeared to be a parked convoy of soldiers, but the explosion killed two women and a child, as well as four soldiers. Another 38 people were wounded, most of them civilians, Mr. Zwak said. The parking lot was also used by civilians visiting the Police Headquarters. “Next to the bombing site we have a mosque in which children are studying religious subjects, they suffered casualties from the powerful bombing,” said Abdul Salam Afghan, a spokesman for the Helmand police. He said he did not know how many students were hurt, but that several were in critical condition. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.. In a statement emailed to reporters, the Taliban’s spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that the attack was carried out by a member of the “Battalion of Martyrdom Seekers,” which targeted a convoy of Afghan forces inside the Police Headquarters. The Taliban control most of Helmand Province outside the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, where suicide attacks by the insurgents are common. As the Taliban have gained territory through the country, they have killed government forces at the highest rate of the war. On an average day, 31 Afghan police officers and soldiers are killed, as well as nine civilians, according to official data. "
61,"ALBUQUERQUE — Wander into El Super, a sprawling grocery store in the same valley where fortune seekers on horseback laid claim nearly four centuries ago to one of Spain’s most remote possessions, and the resilience of the language they brought with them stands on display. Reggaetón, the musical genre born in Puerto Rico, blares from the speakers. Shoppers mull bargains in the accents of northern Mexico. A carnicería offers meat, a panadería bread, a salchichonería cold cuts, and there’s also a tortillería — that one’s self-explanatory for many who never even studied the language of Cervantes. “Everything I need here is in Spanish,” said Vanessa Quezada, 23, an immigrant from the Mexican state of Chihuahua, gesturing toward the branch of the First Convenience Bank, where tellers greet people with a smile and “Buenas tardes.” Indeed, the United States is emerging as a vast laboratory showcasing the remarkable endurance of Spanish, no matter the political climate.

The made-in-America global hit song of the summer? “Despacito.” At the same time, more than 20 states have enacted laws making English the official language, President Trump won the election with a platform that included building a border wall, and his push for new limits on legal immigration would require that applicants speak English to obtain legal residency green cards. "
62,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has widened an extraordinary rift with his own party, as he threatened a government shutdown over his long-promised border wall and attacked key lawmakers whose votes he needs heading into a crucial legislative period. The escalating tensions between the Republican president and the Republican Congress endanger delicate negotiations in the coming weeks to overhaul the tax system, keep the government running and avoid a costly default on the country’s debt. They are the clearest signs to date that the uncomfortable alliance between Mr. Trump, who won the presidency promising to “drain the swamp,” and Republican lawmakers who hoped to enact long-stalled conservative priorities, has begun to fray. In a challenge to Republicans late Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to shut down the government in a matter of weeks if Congress did not fund the wall on the southern border that was a signature promise of his campaign for the White House. “If we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” Mr. Trump told a raucous rally in Phoenix as his supporters chanted, “Build that wall!” “The American people voted for immigration control — that’s one of the reasons I’m here,” he added. “One way or the other, we’re going to get that wall.” On Wednesday, he followed up on the threat by attacking Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who has said he is skeptical of building a border wall between the United States and Mexico unless, as Mr. Trump promised, Mexico pays for it. Mr. Flake is one of two Republican senators up for re-election next year in a swing state, and the president has put his finger on the scale toward a primary challenger, Kelli Ward. "

65,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has invited Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia to visit the White House in September despite Mr. Najib’s involvement in a billion-dollar corruption scandal. The White House said in a statement on Wednesday that the visit was intended to “strengthen and broaden our bilateral relationship and expand regional cooperation with one of America’s closest partners in Southeast Asia.” The invitation represents a significant boost to Mr. Najib’s international standing and is likely to put to rest rumors in Malaysia that he would be arrested the next time he stepped on American soil. In July, the Justice Department filed a civil complaint in a money-laundering case outlining how Mr. Najib, identified as “Malaysian Official 1,” received $731 million from a government fund he oversaw. Investigators around the world are tracking the money trail to his bank accounts in what has become a billion-dollar scandal. Critics say the visit, scheduled for Sept. 12, also demonstrates that the Trump administration places concerns about corruption well behind other issues. Mr. Najib is yet another visitor to the Trump White House with a history of suppressing free speech and intimidating the political opposition, said Robert G. Berschinski of the advocacy group Human Rights First. The invitation is “just another sign that this White House pays only lip service — if that — to the idea that promoting human rights or fighting corruption redounds to the benefit of the United States,” he said. Since abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that would have tied together a dozen nations and 40 percent of the world’s economy, the Trump administration has been casting about for ways to regain its lost clout in Southeast Asia, a region increasingly dominated by China. "
66,"President Trump’s angry condemnation of the news media during a campaign-style rally on Tuesday heightened the fear among journalists that verbal attacks on the profession could lead to physical attacks. While criticizing media coverage has long been a surefire tactic to rile up crowds, the depth of the president’s most recent jabs took even seasoned journalists by surprise. He called journalists “sick people,” accused the news media of “trying to take away our history and our heritage” and questioned their patriotism. “I really think they don’t like our country,” he said. Throughout the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump would frequently turn the attention of rallygoers to the areas containing journalists, who would then be greeted with obscenities and taunts. Journalists are well-accustomed to being disliked at his rallies. But Tuesday’s remarks struck a tone that alarmed journalists more than usual. Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist for The Washington Post, called it “the most sustained attack any president has ever made on the press.” “To see this sort of attack coming yet again from the president is deeply disturbing,” said Courtney C. Radsch, the advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists. “It creates an environment in which attacks on the press, both verbal and potentially physical, could become common.” There has been little doubt that journalists have faced increasing harassment online, leading to widespread self-censorship, Dr. Radsch said. Journalists have been targets of “doxxing,” or publishing sensitive personal information like phone numbers and home addresses of the journalists and their families. "
67,"The screenwriters Tracy Oliver and Kenya Barris set their sights on “Girls Trip” the moment they heard murmurings about the project, a comedy that would examine the friendship among four black women attending the Essence Festival in New Orleans. That film, released in July, just made history by being the first with an all-black creative team in front of and behind the camera to earn $100 million at the box office. (It’s also the first time a female African-American writer has ever reached that milestone.) The two now hope the film’s success will lead to more movies starring black actors and created by black writers. In phone interviews on Tuesday, Ms. Oliver, whose credits include the web series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,” and Mr. Barris, the showrunner of the ABC comedy “black-ish,” discussed what the film’s success may or may not mean for future Hollywood productions, and the role their work is playing in national conversations about racism. Here are edited excerpts from the conversations: “Girls Trip” just crossed the $100 million threshold. What does this accomplishment mean to you and what does it mean about the possibilities for films starring black actors and written by black writers? TRACY OLIVER I could not believe it, I basically went online and tried to fact-check it myself because I was like, “That cannot be true.” What I realized is that this represented an issue that still needs to be fixed because there are movies like “Hidden Figures,” for example, that have black women in lead roles that have grossed over $100 million but when you look into them further, most of the time they’re not written by black people at all. That’s something producers and studios need to take a harder look into and start reaching out to people of color more often. KENYA BARRIS It opens up the possibility for what it means to be a person of color in this industry, a woman, all at the same time. The thing that is most interesting to me is what it is doing for the international box office. Traditionally we have been told that our movies don’t do well overseas. That is one of the biggest obstacles to making movies with people of color and I’m actually seeing that this movie is having some steam overseas. Do you think it will translate into more films being made? OLIVER I hope that it translates into more opportunities. Personally I’ve seen my opportunities increase and all of the opportunities that I’m interested in are about black women. As far as the industry at large, if there’s been an uptick or increase in opportunities, I can’t speak to that. I hope that it’s not a Halle Berry situation, where it takes another decade or so before you see any kind of increase again. "
68,"Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, has faced unease and frustration in his newsroom over his stewardship of the newspaper’s coverage of President Trump, which some journalists there say has lacked toughness and verve. Some staff members expressed similar concerns on Wednesday after Mr. Baker, in a series of blunt late-night emails, criticized his staff over their coverage of Mr. Trump’s Tuesday rally in Phoenix, describing their reporting as overly opinionated. “Sorry. This is commentary dressed up as news reporting,” Mr. Baker wrote at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday morning to a group of Journal reporters and editors, in response to a draft of the rally article that was intended for the newspaper’s final edition. He added in a follow-up, “Could we please just stick to reporting what he said rather than packaging it in exegesis and selective criticism?” A copy of Mr. Baker’s emails was reviewed by The New York Times. Several phrases about Mr. Trump that appeared in the draft of the article reviewed by Mr. Baker were not included in the final version published on The Journal’s website. The draft, in its lead paragraph, described the Charlottesville, Va., protests as “reshaping” Mr. Trump’s presidency. That mention was removed. The draft also described Mr. Trump’s Phoenix speech as “an off-script return to campaign form,” in which the president “pivoted away from remarks a day earlier in which he had solemnly called for unity.” That language does not appear in the article’s final version. Contacted about the emails on Wednesday, a Wall Street Journal spokeswoman wrote in a statement: “The Wall Street Journal has a clear separation between news and opinion. As always, the key priority is to focus reporting on facts and avoid opinion seeping into news coverage.” In February, Mr. Baker fielded tough questions at an all-hands staff meeting about whether the newspaper’s reporting on Mr. Trump was too soft. Mr. Baker denied that notion, and he suggested that other newspapers had abandoned their objectivity about the president; he also encouraged journalists unhappy with the Journal’s coverage to seek employment elsewhere. But apprehensiveness in the newsroom has persisted. This month, Politico obtained and published a transcript of a White House interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mr. Baker and several Journal reporters and editors. Unusually for an editor in chief, Mr. Baker took a leading role in the interview and made small talk with Mr. Trump about travel and playing golf. When Ivanka Trump, the president’s older daughter, walked into the Oval Office, Mr. Baker told her, according to the transcript, “It was nice to see you out in Southampton a couple weeks ago,” apparently referring to a party that the two had attended. The Wall Street Journal is owned by the media magnate Rupert Murdoch, who speaks regularly with Mr. Trump and recently dined with the president at the White House. "
69,"WASHINGTON — President Trump often talks about “clean coal” in his speeches, but it is not always clear what he means by the term. Consider his comments at a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday night. “We’ve ended the war on beautiful, clean coal,” Mr. Trump said. “And it’s just been announced that a second brand-new coal mine where they’re going to take out clean coal — meaning they’re taking out coal, they’re going to clean it — is opening in the state of Pennsylvania.” That’s a little confusing, to say the least. The term “clean coal” was popularized in 2008 by coal industry groups, at a time when Congress was contemplating climate change legislation. While the term is deliberately vague, it is often understood to mean coal plants that capture the carbon dioxide emitted from smokestacks and bury it underground as a way of limiting global warming. This technology, known as carbon capture and storage, is still in its infancy. Only one coal plant in the United States, the Petra Nova project in Texas, actually captures CO2 in this fashion, having come online in January with the help of $190 million from the Obama administration. The carbon dioxide is pumped underground into nearby oil fields to help extract hard-to-reach crude. "
70,"The emergence of Great Wall Motors as a potential partner for Jeep highlights just how much Fiat Chrysler, Jeep’s owner, has looked to China to help bolster its fortunes. The New York Times notes that Fiat Chrysler has openly sought investors for two years and, as early as last year, the carmaker sent a team specializing in mergers and acquisitions to China. The Italian-controlled automaker had been in discussions with Chinese companies about potential equity investments or deals involving its Ram pickup division and the Jeep brand. Then Great Wall, a big maker of sport utility vehicles, made public its interest in Jeep. Great Wall was not one of the companies with which Fiat Chrysler had been talking — but that doesn’t mean Fiat Chrysler wasn’t interested. Investors reacted by sending Fiat Chrysler shares trading in New York to their highest point in more than two years. But a sale to a Chinese buyer could be problematic. It might be subject to government reviews. Great Wall — which acknowledged that it hadn’t actually contacted Fiat Chrysler because of “big uncertainties” about how to proceed — may struggle to secure financing or approval for the deal. "
71,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The path to the governorship of California winds through the Central Valley. That, at least, is the idea animating the candidacy of Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a former two-term mayor of Los Angeles and speaker of the State Assembly. While California is a blue state, candidates in the 2018 governor’s race won’t be able to rely on Democratic votes alone. Among registered voters, roughly 45 percent are Democrats, and 26 percent Republican. Mr. Villaraigosa, 64, was raised by a single mother in a poor neighborhood on Los Angeles’s Eastside. In speeches and interviews, he has portrayed himself as a potential champion of California’s interior, where he spent time during an extended “listening tour” that began in 2015. Along the way, he’s taken shots at his better-funded rival, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and former San Francisco mayor, whose candidacy has been a favorite of voters in the Bay Area. "
72,"When President Trump sought solace from arguably the most disastrous week of his presidency, he headed toward Arizona — and seemed to have a grand old time. His speech Tuesday in Phoenix was classic Trump: He lambasted the “very dishonest media,” for almost a half hour; he relitigated his Charlottesville responses in petulant detail; he defended Confederate statues as “our history and our heritage.” And, just for fun, he dangled a possible pardon for Joe Arpaio, the hometown authoritarian former sheriff who was convicted of criminal contempt in July. What better venue for Mr. Trump, praised just the night before as presidential during his Afghanistan speech, to revert to his natural form? Arizona, after all, is the state that effectively made him president, and not merely for the 11 electoral votes it awarded him last November. The 45th president’s journey from a stunt candidate to a serious force began in Phoenix, on July 11, 2015, less than a month after his escalator-ride announcement in which he spontaneously excoriated Mexican immigrants as “rapists.” His tiny staff found themselves overwhelmed with ticket requests for a rally at a Phoenix hotel and had to book the Phoenix Convention Center on short notice. Something was about to burst forth that nobody full understood at the time — perhaps not even Mr. Trump himself. A few immigration activists showed up with banners, and were immediately set upon by an angry crowd of rally attendees who had just discovered that a loudmouth with a Queens accent was just the right person to shout their frustrations by proxy. Perhaps not coincidentally, this was one of the first rallies of his campaign to be broadcast live on cable. The rowdiness and near-gladiatorial atmosphere — along with the symbiotic and contradictory dynamic of media-bashing and media glare — made for ratings gold and would persist at Trump rallies through the campaign. But this strange recipe got its first taste-test in Phoenix. He started his campaign polling in seventh place; after that 2015 appearance in Phoenix, he was in the lead. And the crowds were genuinely impressive: The convention center was packed to its capacity of 4,200, though Mr. Trump later exaggerated the number by a factor of three. He made reference to its size again on Tuesday night. “The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight,” he marveled. “Believe me Arizona, I will never forget.” "
73,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Trump blames media for divisions. After a statesmanlike address on Monday about national unity, President Trump preached division at a raucous rally Tuesday night in Phoenix. (Watch video excerpts here.) The president accused the news media of misrepresenting his condemnation of bigotry after the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., and suggested that journalists were responsible for deepening divisions in the country. Outside, the police used tear gas to disperse thousands. Mr. Trump also implied that he planned to pardon Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff in Arizona convicted over his roundups of undocumented immigrants. “I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,” the president said. “I’ll make a prediction: I think he’s going to be just fine.” "

75,"President Trump deserves high marks for his new Afghanistan strategy. It is bold, reasoned and offers the prospect of success against the violent Islamist groups of the region. But it will also face opposition in the region. The president will have to show an unflagging commitment to the cause and be prepared to respond to moves by adversaries to disrupt his plan. The deliberative process worked well to arrive at this strategy. The administration reviewed American interests and objectives broadly, and all the key agencies participated effectively. The president’s admission that he changed his mind and shifted away from a rapid withdrawal is a sign of his seriousness of purpose and thoroughness of the review. Mr. Trump is now the third successive president to acknowledge America’s important national security interests in Afghanistan and the region, which include the threat of Islamist extremism and terrorism, even the potential for nuclear terrorism. He recognizes that abandoning Afghanistan would allow safe havens for international terrorist organizations to emerge once more. The new strategy is not only comprehensive but also a major evolution in American policy. Though he did not specify numbers, the president indicated that he will deploy a surge of United States forces, without any timeline for their withdrawal — the error of the Obama administration. Another major change from the Obama era is Mr. Trump’s decision to give American commanders in the field the flexibility they’ve long sought in assisting the Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and other insurgents. The president also adopted a realistic position regarding peace talks, moving away from President Barack Obama’s pursuit of reconciliation regardless of the deteriorating military situation. A key element of the new strategy is the recognition that America needs a new approach toward Pakistan. Unlike his two predecessors in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has chosen to address the fact that Pakistan has been playing a double game. He unequivocally called out Pakistan for pretending to be a partner and receiving large-scale American assistance while providing sanctuary and support for the Taliban and the Haqqani terrorist network, which have been killing Americans and Afghans. "
76,"Only three blocks long, Central Park South is lined on one side with busy buildings, where people live in apartments that are mostly pricey and often glamorous. Squirrels and statues reside on the other side, among the trees of Central Park. Patients who visit Dr. Daniel Kaplan, a periodontist and implant specialist who works in one building facing the park and lives in another a block away, often tell him that the view from his chair is “very calming,” he said. “It’s a soothing view. With each changing season, the park has a different coat.” Dr. Kaplan, 61, said he enjoyed the view so much that after opening his office at 200 Central Park South, in a mostly residential condominium, in 1989, he began looking for an apartment nearby. In 1994, he bought a two-bedroom, two-bath condo at 100 Central Park South, also known as Trump Parc East, with a panorama that extends to the park’s northern edge 51 blocks away. “You’ll laugh,” he said when asked the price: “I paid $750,000.” (At the moment, apartments in the building are listed for $2 million to $7 million, according to StreetEasy.) At first, he used the apartment on workdays, while his wife, Tova, and their three children, still in school, stayed in the leafy Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale. But these days, he and Tova spend most of their time there. “Riverdale is now the country house,” he said. “This street used to be hotel row,” he added. “Now, it’s more residential.” Most of the hotels have been completely or partially converted to condos or co-ops. Central Park, Dr. Kaplan said, “is our gym.” He jogs, walks and ice skates there. “We’re not planning to sell the apartment, ever.” This short stretch along the park has become a “micro-neighborhood,” said Lawrence Lee, an associate broker at Triplemint real estate. “An identity has formed: It’s fun and exciting, with people on the street speaking every language imaginable,” he said. "
77,"We’re supposed to be fixated, at the moment, on the shock of a president capable of finding “fine people” among hordes of white supremacists. More than a week ago, Donald Trump spent a lot of a news conference asserting such a thing was possible. According to him, there isn’t much difference between the supremacists who were protesting the removal of a statue memorializing the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in a park in Charlottesville, Va., and the appalled folks responding with a protest of their own. And that’s despite the murder of one and the injury of dozens of others after a 20-year-old nationalist plowed his car into a crowd. But to watch the movies or TV — or even to catch the hype for a certain boxing match — is to know that normalized white supremacy has been here all summer. It’s to know that the people who manufacture all sorts of popular culture have also, intentionally or not, tossed some racism onto the assembly line. It’s to know that whatever occurred in Charlottesville and then at that news conference didn’t happen in a vacuum. They were just the gnarliest flare-ups in a season of provocations that seem so business-as-usual that they scarcely feel provoked. How else could anyone explain Lee? Not the aforementioned hero of the Confederacy but the dunce from ABC’s “The Bachelorette.” Normally, “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” feature a gentleman or a lady who leaps into a heterosexual pool of suitors and climbs out with a potential spouse. That was more or less true this season, too. Only, for the first time ever, a black woman took the plunge. And the show, which concluded earlier this month, seemed to be of two minds: It didn’t want to make a big deal about it but understood what a big deal it was. So it played games. Before its official kickoff, in a sort of televised tailgate party, the bachelorette, Rachel, met a few of her suitors. One was a sweetie named Dean, who told her that he was “ready to go black,” as if he were preparing to head deep into outer space. But at least he seemed to understand the journey. Lee, a white musician from Florida, was stuck on dreary old Earth. His interest in Rachel went only as far as robbing other contestants of time with her. His primary targets were the other black men on the show, namely Kenny, a charming pro wrestler, whom Lee characterized to Rachel as “aggressive” and about whom he fabricated an altercation that culminated in Kenny’s heaving Lee from a van. "
78,"Growing up, I was aware of the kids-don’t-like-vegetables trope, but it didn’t make much sense to me. I never had any choice; all the traditional Iranian dishes my mom cooked teemed with herbs and vegetables. There was no eating around the fava beans, celery and eggplant that made up the fragrant rice and stew ­dishes she served each night, though my younger brothers certainly tried. I ate the food but didn’t think much of the vegetables one way or the other. Then I moved to Berkeley for college, and for the first time, I understood how someone could hate her vegetables: The pallid, overcooked steam-table brussels sprouts and zucchini served in the dining hall were depressing at best. So when I started busing tables at Chez Panisse a couple of years later, I wasn’t prepared for the daily sight of grown men and women cooing over fruits and vegetables. Soon after, I began working in the kitchen and quickly learned why each produce delivery was met with such excitement: flawless, just-picked vegetables are sweeter and more flavorful than anything you can get at the store. I learned to cook vegetables with the aim of preserving that perfection. That usually meant doing as little to them as possible. Much of the time, we’d simply boil the haricots verts, marble-size turnips or thick spears of asparagus in ample, salted water until they were barely cooked through, then pull them out and let them cool on a baking sheet in the fridge. We’d later quickly reheat them in boiling water or a sauté pan, then drizzle them with immoderate amounts of fruity olive oil before serving. No matter the vegetable, the only rule in the kitchen was ‘‘do not overcook.’’ The memory of that dining-hall mush was enough to scare me straight; my green beans were always perfectly crisp. Then I went to Italy. I apprenticed myself to Benedetta Vitali, a Florentine chef who ran a tiny trattoria on the outskirts of town. Eager to please my new boss, I tried to work ahead on the prep list one morning while she was upstairs in the office. I found the filet beans among the vegetable delivery, set a huge pot of water on the stove and trimmed away the stems while the water came to a boil. I cooked them just as I’d learned to in California, careful not to let all of the crunch boil away. I pulled them, vibrant and sweet, from the water and let them cool. Benedetta came downstairs. She cocked her head and picked up a green bean. ‘‘Who cooked these beans raw?’’ she asked, her voice incredulous, while the inch-long ash from her dangling cigarette threatened to fall onto the tray. Mortified, I took responsibility. She chuckled and poked fun at my American way with vegetables. ‘‘The only thing that should be cooked al dente here,’’ she said, ‘‘is pasta.’’ Then she heated a big, shallow pot, added a generous splash of olive oil and garlic, tossed in the green beans and lightly browned them. She turned down the heat, handed me the wooden spoon and told me to keep an eye on the pot for two hours. I was simultaneously horrified about how overcooked they’d be in that time and deeply ashamed about how far off I’d been. "
79,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump called himself a “problem solver” on Monday during his address on the war in Afghanistan. On “The Daily Show” the next night, Trevor Noah offered a second opinion. He said Mr. Trump’s speech hadn’t offered much in the way of specifics. Conan O’Brien wasn’t sure how responsible Mr. Trump was for preparing his prepared remarks. The “Daily Show” correspondent Desi Lydic donned a general’s uniform to get Mr. Trump’s attention, then offered a radical suggestion on handling the situation in Afghanistan. "
80,"Here was Donald Trump tethered by his generals. The new-old Afghan war strategy set out by the president Monday night contained a Trump line or two — terrorists as “losers,” the nixing of “nation-building” — but was the work of the adults in the room. They forced the commander-in-chief to curtail his wilder instincts. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, both have bitter experience of Afghanistan. John Kelly, the chief of staff, lost his 29-year-old son, First Lt. Robert Kelly, there. They were not about to let Trump declare Afghanistan “a complete waste,” as he did in 2012, and walk away. In a sense this is reassuring. Trump is not home alone. He fires off, gets a lesson on the real world, bridles again, and is momentarily muted. Qatar, North Korea, Iran and Charlottesville: the pattern repeats itself. It’s ominous but it has not sent the world over a cliff, yet. And now we have Afghanistan, the nearly 16-year-old war that just became Trump’s war, against the wishes of Steve Bannon, his ousted chief strategist. The decision not to leave was the right decision; and Trump was also right to note that telegraphing future pullout dates for American troops, as President Obama did, is military folly. Ashraf Ghani, the embattled Afghan president, needs United States help in holding the line against an invigorated Taliban. But what Trump announced did not amount to a strategy, let alone a new one. It amounted rather, in the tweeted words of Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University, to “a set of incoherent slogans.” Trump talked plenty about “victory” but did not even attempt to define what would constitute it. That’s because there can be no military victory in Afghanistan. The best that can be hoped for is keeping the Taliban from power, and bolstering government forces to the point the Taliban can be persuaded to sue for peace. In other words, the end game can only be diplomatic. "

82,"Berlin — To many Germans, the violence in Charlottesville, Va., this month and the American president’s reaction to it came as a shock. Even those who have come to expect little of Donald Trump — he’s a uniquely unpopular figure among Germans — were aghast. “It’s racist, far-right violence, and that requires determined and forceful resistance no matter where in the world it appears,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said. What a strange moment, when the German chancellor lectures the American president on how to deal with neo-Nazis. But it’s also an instructive one, in that it highlights how the two countries deal with extremism. In Germany, the very presence of neo-Nazis openly marching through a city bearing swastika-emblazoned flags, as in Charlottesville, is unthinkable. Unlike the United States, Germany places strict limits on speech and expression when it comes to right-wing extremism. It is illegal to produce, distribute or display symbols of the Nazi era — swastikas, the Hitler salute, along with many symbols that neo-Nazis have developed as proxies to get around the initial law. Holocaust denial is also illegal. The law goes further. There is the legal concept of “Volksverhetzung,” the incitement to hatred: Anybody who denigrates an individual or a group based on their ethnicity or religion, or anybody who tries to rouse hatred or promotes violence against such a group or an individual, could face a sentence of up to five years in prison. These laws apply to individuals, but they and others are also defenses against extremist political parties. The Constitutional Court, Germany’s highest court, can ban parties it deems intent on impairing or destroying the political order. This year the court came close to banning the extremist right-wing National Democratic Party but determined the organization was too weak to outlaw. This legal regime is backed by a political culture that effectively bans expression that might pass legal muster but still flirts with racist ideologies. The German right-wing-populist Alternative for Germany is a good example. Though its program and members do not openly embrace or reference Nazism, the party’s program dabbles in ideas that might be construed as racist, and as a result the party is considered untouchable by mainstream voters and politicians. "
83,"It should be no surprise that The Village Voice has ended its print edition in favor of an online, digital-only presence. The alternative newspaper, whose weekly edition once helped set New York’s political and cultural agenda, is merely going the same route as a slew of other newspapers and magazines before it. It’s a path likely to be well-trod by others in the near future. At least the publication will continue, which is more than The Boston Phoenix or The San Francisco Bay Guardian or a host of other late-lamented alt-weeklies can say. “Welcome to the 21st Century,” was one nostalgia-spiking tweet that popped up within minutes of The Voice’s press release. And yet, the announcement by The Voice’s current owner that he is cutting his losses by giving up ink, paper, delivery trucks and the red plastic bins on the street corners that made you fear for your health each time you reached inside had the unmistakable feel of one more piece of Old New York slipping away. It’s a loss that hardly ranks with the deaths earlier this year of two of The Voice’s great stalwarts — Nat Hentoff, whose columns on civil liberties and other issues were a weekly feature for 50 years, and Wayne Barrett, the old-school muckraker who was the first to report on a craftily ambitious young developer named Trump. The paper laid off both men in recent years in response to earlier economic concerns. Yet both would doubtlessly cheer for the paper to soldier on, even if no one will ever again spread a copy over a bar or across a table in a Greenwich Village coffee house. Hentoff and Barrett were just among the longest serving of a list of writers far too long to assemble who made The Voice, over several generations since its 1955 founding, a touchstone for against-the-grain journalism. "
84,"The Trump administration has no grounds for blocking the “fiduciary rule,” an Obama-era regulation that requires financial advisers to put their clients’ interests first when giving advice or selling investments for retirement accounts. But blocking the rule remains an administration priority, no matter how arbitrary, capricious and harmful that would be. In one of his first acts in office, President Trump effectively delayed the rule’s implementation date, April 10, by issuing a memorandum that called for its review and possible rollback. The Labor Department, which has jurisdiction over the issue, could find no legal way to alter or rescind the rule, so it took effect on June 9, with one catch: The department said it would not enforce the rule until Jan. 1, 2018, ostensibly to give financial firms time to adapt. Then this month, the department  requested a further enforcement delay, to July 1, 2019. The request will be considered by none other than the White House Office of Management and Budget, which vets regulation. This is obstruction, pure and simple. The fiduciary rule was debated and drafted over many years, before being completed in 2016. Since then, it has survived several legal challenges in federal court brought by the financial industry. In one of the cases, decided in February, the judge described the industry’s arguments as “without merit,” “unpersuasive” and “at odds with market realities.” Those judgments, as well as copious research that preceded the rule-making, attest to its importance: The fiduciary rule, properly enforced, would prevent banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies from steering customers into overly expensive products and strategies when comparable lower-cost option are available; such steering annually drains tens of billions of dollars in excessive fees from Americans’ retirement savings. Still the Trump administration persists in its efforts to derail the fiduciary rule. Why? Several financial firms that have already made strides in adapting to the rules may pine for a return to the old days, but that can’t be the whole story. Another plausible explanation is fear on Wall Street that consumers and regulators might someday demand similar, customer-first standards for all financial advisers, not just those handling retirement accounts.

88,"SANA, Yemen — At least 30 civilians were killed or wounded on Wednesday, the first day in two months that airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition struck targets around the capital of Yemen, a United Nations official said. Estimates of casualties made by the authorities in Sana, dominated by the Houthi rebels who are fighting the Saudis, were even higher, putting the toll at 71 dead or wounded from at least three airstrikes around the capital. For more than two years, the Saudis have been fighting the Houthi rebels, whom they believe are receiving military support from Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival. Saudi officials have insisted their aircraft avoid civilian targets, but hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities have been struck by Saudi warplanes. Last October, the coalition confirmed that one of its jets had accidentally bombed a wedding party in Sana, killing 100 people. Because of the risk of civilian casualties, the Saudis have said they were refraining from airstrikes in and around the capital, but the attacks resumed on Wednesday without explanation. The last airstrikes in Sana were in June. The resumption of airstrikes in the area comes as the Houthi rebels and their allies around former president Ali Abdullah Saleh have been on the verge of turning on one another. The Houthis have accused Mr. Saleh of trying to negotiate separately with the Saudi-led coalition, which supports the ousted government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, now exiled to the southern part of the country. Mr. Saleh has responded by ridiculing the Houthis’ ideology. "
89,"President Trump’s seesawing response to the deadly racial violence in Charlottesville, Va., has been rebuked by countless politicians, business executives, community groups and religious leaders. The leaders of Britain and Germany spoke about the need to condemn such violence. Now the United Nations has weighed in, too. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, a body of United Nations experts on Wednesday denounced “the failure at the highest political level of the United States of America to unequivocally reject and condemn” racist violence, saying it was “deeply concerned by the example this failure could set for the rest of the world.” Mr. Trump’s wavering responses to the violence — he has blamed “many sides,” but also singled out the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi groups and white supremacists for condemnation — has roiled his administration, but also unsettled rights advocates around the world. “We were shocked and horrified by what happened,” the committee’s chairwoman, Anastasia Crickley, said in an interview, expressing disgust at the televised images of white supremacists’ torchlit parade through Charlottesville. “I was horrified as well by the way leaders of that movement were able to state afterwards that they felt secure in their support.” In a two-page decision that was dated Aug. 18 but released on Wednesday, a day after Washington was informed, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination invoked “early action and urgent warning procedures” in deploring the violence and urging the United States to investigate. "
90,"The Plaza Hotel, with its marble lobby facing Fifth Avenue, crystal chandeliers, famed Palm Court and $35,000-a-night royal suite, has been a star of stage and screen in Manhattan for many decades. Now it’s at the center of an international battle over who will control one of New York’s enduring icons. Subrata Roy, the embattled chairman of the India-based Sahara Group and the principal owner of the Plaza, who has repeatedly put the hotel up for sale without ever making a deal, is looking for a buyer once again. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Mr. Roy had hired the JLL Hotels and Hospitality Group, which has represented him and his company for years, to begin soliciting offers. But Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation, a New York investment and development company, which together own a 25 percent stake in the hotel, have their own plans for the Plaza. And they don’t include Mr. Roy. The prince, who has been an owner of the hotel since 1995, formed a partnership with Ashkenazy earlier this year to buy out Mr. Roy and restore the Plaza to its five-star grandeur. Under the ownership agreement, the partners have the right to match any offer for the hotel and to take it over, according to real estate executives who have been briefed on the agreement and who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to disclose the details. “We are not selling our stake and are comfortable with our rights relating to any sale by others,” said Sarmad Zok, chief executive of the prince’s company, Kingdom Hotel Investments. “We are proud to have partnered with Ashkenazy to reinstate the glory of this unique asset.” "
91,"Tucked in the lower lobby of Trump Tower, near the restrooms, is a newsstand that long sold the usual fare of periodicals, lottery tickets, miniature yellow cabs and “I ♥ New York” T-shirts. Then came the election of Donald J. Trump. Now the stand, Roger’s News, has morphed into an outpost for Trump memorabilia, from $1 postcards to $40 bobblehead dolls. “People come to Trump Tower for Trump, and I give them Trump,” said the owner, Roger Sewani, 58, who began stocking Trump memorabilia after the presidential election. He has watched his little shop turn into a gold mine. “I’d say 90 percent of what we sell now is Trump.” Mr. Sewani rang up sale after sale in his cramped shop in the glitzy Fifth Avenue skyscraper that was Mr. Trump’s longtime home before moving to the White House. He said that tourists are eager for Trump items that come from “the source.” “They want to buy a souvenir from where he lived, the most authentic place,” said Mr. Sewani, who still sells Powerball tickets to local New Yorkers and snacks to Secret Service agents posted at the building. Gone from the shelves, however, are magazines and newspapers, to make room for Trump-themed merchandise. Most of the sales now are to tourists who make the shop one of the few places in New York City where one can find almost unanimous devotion to the president. "

ne of my favorite things about living abroad has always been the way that distance adds a fresh perspective on wherever it is one calls home. In my case, I often feel as though I never see the United States quite so clearly as I do when I’ve just returned after a long time away, which was the case last week. I was home for a wedding, a bit of work and a little vacation, and at every stop, I found myself marveling at the sheer American-ness of conversations and experiences. In my last newsletter, I shared a few of my impressions about Australia. What you’ll find below is its American counterpart — what I noticed in one small corner of the U.S. after months away, and what stood out more clearly in part because of my experience in Australia. Americans Are Exhausted Love him or hate him, Donald Trump seems to be wearing people out. Many of the journalists I talked to seemed spent, tired from covering a country that seems to convulse again and again, with each passing week. And among voters on opposite sides of the Trump divide, I heard a lot of exasperation and not a whole lot of understanding. A few Trump critics I saw at my friend’s wedding chewed over every speech and every new development after the Charlottesville protests; others seemed to have less capacity for continuous outrage, offering little more than an “I know” and a shake of the head, asking how anyone could see any Trump as a positive force. "
93,"RENO, Nev. — President Trump reverted to his script as commander in chief here on Wednesday. The morning after he delivered an aggrieved and impromptu defense of his comments on the violence in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump spoke in a more measured tone to the national convention of the American Legion, telling its members that “we are not defined by the color of our skin,” and that the country will overcome its challenges by reaffirming its common values. “We are here to hold you up as an example of strength, courage and resolve that our country will need to overcome the many challenges that we face,” the president said, speaking slowly and gravely as he read from a teleprompter. “We are here to draw inspiration from you as we seek to renew the bonds of loyalty that bind us together as one people and one nation.” It was a day-and-night contrast to Mr. Trump’s performance Tuesday night in Phoenix, where he lurched from subject to subject and accused the news media of ignoring what he insisted had been his message of unity in the aftermath of Charlottesville. But such contrasts have become a recurring motif of his presidency: Mr. Trump has toggled between Teleprompter Trump and Unplugged Trump every day since the deadly clashes in Virginia, leaving Washington and the rest of the nation with a chronic case of rhetorical whiplash. The split speaking personality is not new. Mr. Trump spent years mocking President Barack Obama for using a teleprompter. But ever since Mr. Trump won his first round of primaries and his path toward the Republican presidential nomination became likelier, his family members and some supporters have urged him — not with a lot of success — to professionalize his performances, and to try to avoid the dangers of the kind of spontaneous remarks he made in Arizona. "
94,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. As I listened to President Trump outline his new strategy in Afghanistan, I could not help wondering what his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was thinking. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, lost his son in Afghanistan in 2010. Shortly afterward, Kelly gave a eulogy for two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter, who were killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. The speech, published in 2013 by Business Insider, makes powerful reading, not least because the quality of unflinching valor evoked by Kelly sits at such a distance from Trump, a man whose fascination with the military is equaled only by his failure to come close to the “selflessness, courage and resolve” of America’s troops. Yale and Haerter, faced by an explosives-laden truck barreling down on them, did not flinch. As Kelly put it, “With their feet spread shoulder width apart, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could work their weapons. They had only one second left to live. The truck explodes. The camera goes blank. Two young men go to their God.” He concluded: “Not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag, or about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty...into eternity. That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight — for you.” Yale and Haerter were 22 and 20, respectively. Kelly’s son, First Lieutenant Robert Kelly, was 29. Such sacrifice demands more and better than a commander in chief who attempts (via Twitter!) to ban transgender people from the military and who, as a candidate, insulted the Muslim parents of a fallen American officer in Iraq. Trump’s Afghan strategy is full of holes. Militarizing American foreign policy while relegating diplomacy will bring no victories. But the deeper issue with Trump is his moral unfitness, his shifting neediness. How do those who serve him coax this troubling fact from their minds? "
95,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is preparing to give the Defense Department formal authority to expel transgender people from the military in an upcoming order, barring the Pentagon from recruiting transgender troops and cutting off payment for sexual reassignment surgery and other medical treatments for those already serving. A White House memo that is expected to be sent to the Pentagon in coming days gives Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, six months to enforce the transgender ban that Mr. Trump announced abruptly last month in a series of tweets. The directive was confirmed Wednesday by a person familiar with its contents but who was not authorized to discuss its details and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The authority has not yet been finalized. Once it is approved, it would allow Mr. Mattis to force out transgender service members by setting a legal standard of whether they would be able to deploy to war zones or for other lengthy military missions. The president’s order-by-social media caught senior military officials by surprise and short-circuited the customary interagency policy process that attends such sweeping decisions. At the time, as senior military officials scrambled to determine how to carry out the order, White House officials said they would work with the Pentagon to devise a policy to fit Mr. Trump’s tweets. "
96,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday released a major report urging actions to protect the “reliability and resilience” of the nation’s electric grid, a move that could lay the groundwork for future support of America’s ailing coal and nuclear industries. The 187-page study, commissioned by Energy Secretary Rick Perry in April, recommends that federal regulators make changes to wholesale electricity markets that could potentially benefit existing coal and nuclear plants. Revenues for many of these facilities have slumped in recent years as electricity prices have declined, mostly because of cheap natural gas, the study said, but also as a result of low electricity demand growth and the rise of wind and solar power. More than 200 coal plants and five nuclear reactors have closed across the United States since 2010, and President Trump has vowed to revitalize both industries, though doing so would require resisting powerful market forces reshaping the energy landscape. The Energy Department report concedes that the nation’s electricity system remains reliable today, even with a sharp rise in intermittent wind and solar power, in part because natural gas generators and existing hydropower can easily fill any gaps in renewable generation. But the study raises concerns that a future grid with fewer “baseload” coal and nuclear plants, which are capable of producing electricity around the clock, could pose challenges to grid operators trying to keep the lights on. "
97,"On a baking-hot evening in Phoenix on Tuesday, in another of the campaign-style rallies in red states that seem to give him strength when he runs into trouble in Washington, President Trump trotted out the usual enemies, the malefactors in the “very dishonest media” and the “anarchists” of the left to whom that very same media had paid too little attention. But this time he gave equal billing to his fellow Republicans in Congress — the people he will surely need if he hopes to deliver on infrastructure or anything else of value to the working-class Americans who elected him. Among these were Arizona’s two senators — John McCain, who cast the decisive vote in the Senate to dash Mr. Trump’s effort to repeal Obamacare, and Jeff Flake, a conservative who has been a thorn in the presidential side. Neither was mentioned by name. Mr. McCain was sarcastically referred to as “one vote.” As for Mr. Flake, “Nobody knows who the hell he is.” All this, as well as a broader attack on congressional “obstructionists,” came on the same day that The Times published an article detailing the rapid disintegration of the relationship between Mr. Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Mr. McConnell has fought fiercely and loyally for the president at every turn, whether on health care or his judicial nominees, and his support will continue to be important on major issues. Other presidents have gotten crosswise with their own parties, but this president seems to have alienated everybody. And whether one hopes to see the president’s agenda enacted or stymied, his failure to perceive this essential political dynamic is evidence of how little he understands what it takes to convert campaign positions into reality. Among Mr. McConnell’s sins, in Mr. Trump’s eyes, is that he has publicly questioned Mr. Trump’s understanding of the presidency and privately fumed at Mr. Trump’s threats against Republicans. Mr. Trump has not, in fact, been acting in a manner befitting his office, nor offering a coherent governing strategy. He has alternately abused and belittled his putative allies. During the health care struggle, he told Senator Shelley Moore Capito that she couldn’t ride home to West Virginia on Air Force One unless she voted for repeal. He dispatched Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, to threaten Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska with loss of federal funding unless she voted the right way. (She did not.) And he started calling out Mr. McConnell by name, in tweets and comments. “Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing,” he tweeted. Over the phone, the two engaged in a profane shouting match, as Mr. Trump, fearful of the F.B.I.’s investigation of his administration’s possible ties to Russia, accused Mr. McConnell of failing to protect him. "
98,"TORONTO — Last fall, one Canadian judge was required to appear before a very rare disciplinary panel because he asked a rape complainant why she had not kept her knees together. A decade ago, another had to answer questions about changes he made to a court transcript. On Wednesday, Justice Bernd Zabel of Ontario faced a four-member disciplinary panel because he arrived in his Hamilton courtroom wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat on Nov. 9 — the day after the United States election. The judge said it was meant as a joke, and a week later he apologized in his courtroom, stating that the hat was not a political statement or an endorsement of any political views, particularly not “the views and comments of Donald Trump.” But, as an indication of how pervasive American politics is in Canada and how divisive President Trump has become, that apology was not enough. More than 80 complaints from law schools, lawyers’ associations and individual lawyers poured into the Ontario Judicial Council demanding that Justice Zabel be sanctioned, so public trust could be restored to the bench. Even Justice Zabel, 69, seemed to agree that in Canada, Mr. Trump’s professed views are largely seen as contrary to Canada’s embrace of multiculturalism and human rights. “I’m not a racist,” he told the panel, according to Canadian media reports. “I’m not a bigot. I’m not a misogynist.” In Canada, judges are appointed, not elected, and they are considered largely apolitical, particularly at the lower court levels. "
99,"FRONT PAGE An article on Wednesday about President Trump’s rally in Phoenix referred incorrectly in some copies to the destroyer John S. McCain. It was named for Senator John McCain’s grandfather and father — John S. McCain Sr. and John S. McCain Jr., both Navy admirals; it was not named after the Arizona senator. INTERNATIONAL An article on Wednesday about similarities between President Trump’s strategy on Afghanistan and proposals made by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. quoted incorrectly from Mr. Trump’s speech on Monday night about Afghanistan. In a reference to terrorists, he said, “These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide,” not “no place” to hide. BUSINESS DAY An article on Wednesday about the future of Fiat Chrysler quoted incorrectly from comments by Kristin Dziczek, an analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. Referring to Fiat Chrysler’s debt, she said, “That does not bode well for investing in future product.” She did not say that the debt does bode well for future investments. • An article on Wednesday about a partnership between Walmart and Google misstated the role of the Google Assistant, the artificially intelligent software assistant, in the relationship with Walmart. The eventual plan is for Walmart customers to be able to buy products using the Google Assistant; customers cannot do that now. • An article on Tuesday about Sempra Energy’s winning the bidding for Energy Future Holdings misstated an outcome for a losing bidder, Berkshire Hathaway. It is not entitled to a $270 million breakup fee. SCIENCE TIMES An article on Tuesday about the accomplishments of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space missions misstated the date on which the PBS documentary “The Farthest” was broadcast. It was shown Wednesday night; it had not already aired at the time the article was published. OBITUARIES An obituary on Wednesday about the playwright, novelist and screenwriter Janusz Glowacki, using information from his family, misstated the year of his marriage to Olena Leonenko. It was 2014, not 2015. Because of an editing error, an accompanying picture caption misspelled the original surname of Mr. Glowacki’s first wife, Ewa. As the obituary correctly noted, it is Zadrzynska, not Zadrzyska. And the obituary misstated, in some copies, the year of the Andrzej Wajda film “Walesa: Man of Hope,” for which Mr. Glowacki wrote the screenplay. It was 2013, not 2003. • An obituary on Sunday about the architect Gunnar Birkerts omitted an architect whose work inspired Mr. Birkerts.

100,"Every time you think President Trump’s anti-press rhetoric can’t get worse, he finds a way of surprising you and not surprising you all at the same time. That he will attack journalists on a regular basis should be expected at this point, and it is. The surprising part comes when he manages to outdo himself. After all, he couldn’t possibly top “enemy of the people,” could he? Yet there he was in Phoenix on Tuesday, telling a crowd of thousands of ardent supporters that journalists were “sick people” who he believes “don’t like our country,” and are “trying to take away our history and our heritage.” The moment matters. Mr. Trump’s latest attack on the media came at a time of heightened racial tension stoked by a white supremacists’ rally in Charlottesville, Va., and continuing now in the national debate over removing statues that commemorate Confederate figures from the Civil War. Mr. Trump’s speech in Phoenix reprised a question spawned by his raucous rallies during the presidential campaign: How long before someone is seriously hurt, or worse? “Coming off the violence in Charlottesville, with tensions so high and the kindling so dry, it felt like President Trump was playing recklessly with fire, singling out a specific group of people — the media — for disliking America and trying to erase our country’s heritage,” Jim VandeHei, chief executive of the Axios news website, told me. “He’s just wrong to paint so wildly with such a broad brush, and, worse, putting reporters at real risk of retribution or violence.” (In a passionate appeal on Twitter on Wednesday, Mr. VandeHei posted the following message: “To family/friends who support Trump: What he said last night was despicable, extremely deceptive, dangerous.”) "
101,"For years, the presidential conference calls were a nonpartisan holiday tradition: President Barack Obama would speak by phone with hundreds of rabbis in advance of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, in what participants described as a meeting of minds, largely free of raw politics. But that emerging tradition was thrown into jeopardy on Wednesday, in a sign of the still-intensifying backlash against President Trump’s response to the violence this month in Charlottesville, Va. Four coalitions of rabbis, hailing from different strains of American Judaism, publicly spurned Mr. Trump, denouncing him in unusually pointed language, and pre-emptively announcing that they would not participate in any conference call before the Jewish holidays next month. Mr. Trump has drawn widespread criticism, and in some cases condemnation, from Jewish leaders after a string of public remarks in which he has played down the racist and anti-Semitic views of white supremacist demonstrators in Virginia. Jewish members of his administration have faced calls to condemn the president or resign, and a few have expressed public and private discomfort with his comments, including Mr. Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman. But the rabbinical groups’ announcement on Wednesday was a rebuke on a different level, and appeared to signal that Mr. Trump will encounter extreme difficulty in any immediate efforts to reach out to American Jews. In a joint statement, the organizations — which claim the backing of more than 4,000 rabbis and congregations — accused Mr. Trump of having given “succor to those who advocate anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia” with his comments after the bloodshed in Charlottesville, where a young woman was killed after a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters. All four Jewish groups — the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Rabbinical Assembly, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism — said they could not participate in interactions with Mr. Trump around the fall holidays. "
102,"LONDON — In his first solo trip to the broader Middle East as President Trump’s designated peacemaker, Jared Kushner has found both cause for optimism and reminders of just what a daunting task his father-in-law has given him. Over the course of two days, he met with leaders from several influential Arab countries and emerged encouraged by their stated eagerness to help him bring Israelis and Palestinians together. But his visit on Wednesday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt showed how other issues can easily complicate the initiative as both sides sought to paper over a dispute over American aid. Just a day earlier, the United States cut or delayed nearly $300 million in aid to Egypt, a symbolic blow to a strategic relationship that has been a pillar of American policy in the Middle East for almost four decades. It was also a sign of growing impatience on the part of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who does not share Mr. Trump’s affinity for Mr. Sisi. Mr. Kushner was caught out by bad timing — his trip to Egypt had been fixed weeks earlier and officials said the aid decision was driven by schedules unrelated to his travels. Mr. Sisi and Mr. Kushner gave no public hint of discord as they grinned and shook hands for the benefit of news photographers; Mr. Sisi’s office later issued a lengthy statement praising relations between the two nations. Mr. Tillerson tightened the purse strings to signal displeasure with Mr. Sisi for several reasons. One was a harsh law enacted by Mr. Sisi in May making it virtually impossible for some nongovernmental organizations to operate freely in Egypt. The other was Egypt’s close relationship with North Korea, which stretches back to the 1970s but has become a serious irritant amid the recent surge in tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. Mr. Kushner, however, hopes to enlist Egypt as a partner in making progress between the Israelis and Palestinians. He accompanied Mr. Trump, his father-in-law, on a visit to the region and separately traveled to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders over the summer. But this was Mr. Kushner’s first trip to see leaders from Arab states he considers critical to resolving the generations-old conflict. "
103,"SEATTLE — Amazon’s bid to become a bigger player in the grocery business took a major step forward Wednesday, as federal antitrust regulators approved the internet company’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market. And earlier in the day, Whole Foods shareholders voted to approve the $13.4 billion deal, which will give Amazon a major bricks-and-mortar presence with more than 460 stores in a huge retail category where success has eluded the company. The Federal Trade Commission, which was handling the federal review of the deal, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the agency had concluded that the deal would not harm competition. “Based on our investigation we have decided not to pursue this matter further,” Bruce Hoffman, the acting director of the F.T.C.’s bureau of competition, said in the statement. “Of course, the F.T.C. always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.” The agency’s approval removed the last major hurdle to the deal’s closing. Antitrust lawyers had not expected the acquisition to be blocked by regulators, largely because Amazon and Whole Foods are not major competitors today.Amazon has run an internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but it accounts for less than a 2 percent share of total grocery spending in the United States, according to estimates by Cowen & Company, a stock research firm. Amazon has said the deal is expected to close this year, and on Wednesday the company did not change that prediction. Despite its prominence as a purveyor of high-end groceries, Whole Foods is also a relatively small player in the overall grocery market. The food and beverage portion of the grocery business is one of the largest categories of consumer spending, totaling more than $800 billion a year, with more than $450 billion in additional spending on personal care, pet and other consumable products, according to Cowen. Combined, Cowen estimates Amazon and Whole Foods will be the fifth-largest grocery retailer in the country. Even if it seemed a long shot that regulators would stop the acquisition, there was still some uncertainty over the way competition regulators under the Trump administration would approach big acquisitions. There has been speculation about possible interference by the White House in antitrust reviews of deals like AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner. In the case of Amazon, President Trump has on several occasions expressed his animosity toward the company, accusing it earlier this month of killing retail jobs. He has also falsely accused the company of not collecting taxes on internet sales and has suggested that Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is using his personal ownership of The Washington Post to intimidate members of Congress from examining Amazon. "
104,"PHOENIX — Noemí Romero still shudders when she hears the name Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff responsible for the workplace raid in 2013 when she was arrested and spent two months in jail. So when President Trump signaled that he was considering a pardon for Mr. Arpaio for his contempt conviction, her memories of trauma flared into outrage. “Trump is delivering a slap in the face to dignified, hard-working people whose lives were ripped apart by Arpaio,” said Ms. Romero, 25, a former supermarket cashier who now babysits to make ends meet. “Arpaio belongs in jail, getting a taste of his own medicine. Trump wants to put Arpaio above the law, showing they are both about white supremacy.” Mr. Trump’s expression of support for Mr. Arpaio, the 85-year-old crusader against illegal immigration, has ignited a debate across Arizona about the tactics used to crack down on Latinos, the reactions the strategy spawned in fueling the repudiation by voters who ousted Mr. Arpaio, and the nationalist sentiment stoked by Mr. Trump, one of the former sheriff’s most ardent admirers. Detested by some, loved by others and facing up to six months in jail for failing to heed a federal judge’s order to stop targeting Latinos based solely on the suspicion of their legal status, Mr. Arpaio finds himself thrust back into the political fray at a time when he could quietly be in the twilight of his career. This enduring prominence and the expressions of support from Mr. Trump suit some in Arizona just fine. "
105,"HOUSTON — A federal judge blocked Texas from enforcing its revamped voter identification law on Wednesday, ruling that the State Legislature’s attempt to loosen the law did not go far enough and perpetuated discrimination against black and Hispanic voters. The decision was only the latest chapter in a yearslong court battle over the state’s voter ID rules, and comes amid concerted efforts by the Trump administration to enact tougher voting restrictions. The stakes are particularly high for Texas: As a result of previous court rulings, the state could be forced to undergo federal oversight of its election procedures. The judge — Nelva Gonzales Ramos, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas — had previously found that the original law, one of the most restrictive in the nation, was passed in 2011 with the intent to discriminate against blacks and Hispanics. It required voters to show one of seven forms of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, before casting a ballot. The Republican-controlled Legislature softened the law, in response to legal challenges and court rulings, by allowing potential voters to sign an affidavit and show more widely available types of identification, including a utility bill or a bank statement. The new law, known as Senate Bill 5, was set to take effect in January, despite complaints from critics that it created criminal penalties for those who made false claims about needing to use alternate IDs. In her ruling, Judge Ramos noted that the retooled law still barred voters from showing state or federal employee ID cards. Because those who lack the accepted forms of identification were “subjected to separate voting obstacles and procedures,” Judge Ramos wrote, “S.B. 5’s methodology remains discriminatory because it imposes burdens disproportionately on blacks and Latinos.” "
106,"LONDON — Qatar restored full diplomatic relations with Iran on Thursday, the latest volley in an 11-week-old geopolitical feud that has set the tiny yet fabulously wealthy Persian Gulf nation against its neighbors and rattled a previously placid part of the Middle East. Qatar’s Foreign Ministry announced that it was sending its ambassador back to Tehran after a 20-month hiatus that started in January 2016, when Qatar broke off relations after attacks on two Saudi diplomatic facilities in Iran. The Qataris gave no explanation for the sudden move. But the timing suggested a purposeful snub of Saudi Arabia, which along with three other countries began a punitive boycott of Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting terrorism and having a too-cozy relationship with Iran. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut their air and sea routes to Qatar, and closed its only land border, with Saudi Arabia. Mediation by the United States, Kuwait and Germany has failed to resolve the feud in the gulf, the one corner of the Middle East that has been largely free of war, refugees or political turmoil in recent years. Analysts said the partial blockade has badly weakened the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council and threatens to undermine regional stability. The crisis lapsed into a stalemate after Qatar refused an initial list of 13 demands, which included cutting all ties with Tehran. But things took a turn for the worse this week after a visit by a minor Qatari royal, Sheikh Abdullah al-Thani, to the Saudi ruler, King Salman, at his holiday villa in Morocco. Sheikh Abdullah, who lives in London and comes from a wing of the ruling family that was ousted in a 1972 coup, posed for pictures with King Salman at his lavish coastal palace outside Tangiers. (Estimates of the cost of the king’s holiday run as high as $100 million — expensive even for a monarch who typically travels with an entourage of 1,000 or more.) "
107,"Last week, following the tragic events in Charlottesville, Va., President Trump took to Twitter to express his lament over the loss of Confederacy monuments, asking, “Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson — who’s next, Washington, Jefferson?” As we contemplate the removal of these statues and what they mean for race relations in this country, here are three books that address two Civil War generals and one president — all controversial historical figures — and how they are remembered. (We decided, rightly or wrongly, to let Washington rise above the fray.) READING THE MAN
A Portrait of Robert E. Lee Through His Private Letters
By Elizabeth Brown Pryor
688 pp. Viking Adult. (2007) In this epistolary biography, Pryor uses Robert E. Lee’s letters as a launching pad for essays that discuss his life story and his military record. She insists, in her preface, that “we cannot compartmentalize him, and we cannot simply lionize him. His letters show him to be too human for that.” Lee’s decision to leave the United States Army and side with the South, for instance, was not an easy one; the choice put him at odds with his family and friends, many of whom were in favor of maintaining the Union. Lee’s correspondence is well-written and revealing, and Pryor complements it with intelligent insight and analysis. STONEWALL JACKSON
The Man, the Soldier, the Legend
By James I. Robertson Jr.
950 pp. Macmillan Publishing USA. (1997) Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson, the man, has defied proper investigation. He was notoriously secretive, writing uninformative or bare bones letters in both his private and professional life. As a result, his story has been embellished to the point of becoming legend. In this book, however, Robertson mines the source material for new information, busting myths in the process. He delves into Jackson’s Presbyterian faith, which bordered on fanatical, and how it informed his merciless approach to battle. Jackson placed his fate in God’s hands, which made him fearless on the field. Our reviewer said this work propelled the writer “straight to the head of the class of Jackson biographers, and likely to remain there.” MOST BLESSED OF THE PATRIARCHS

400 pp. Liveright. (2016) This addition to the copious literature on Thomas Jefferson concentrates on his interior life, analyzing how his contradictions were most present in the “ambiguous moral geography” of Monticello, his mountain refuge. The writers divide the book into thematic chapters such as “Home,” “France,” “Politics” and “Privacy and Prayers” and investigate how Jefferson’s experiences shaped his philosophy. Rather than tackle the question of whether he deserves reproach or reverence, they address issues like freedom and slavery head-on, and reveal how Jefferson viewed himself and the American experiment.

108,"The events of the last few weeks have shown us that we are fully living in Trump’s America, with a president who is slow to condemn the actions of white supremacists. The realization has been exhausting. This week, we take a step back to think about what the political moment is doing to our emotional and physical states. We discuss our routines of self-care — and investigate the origins of the phrase and why it feels overused and even a little cliché. We also talk to Matthew Steinfeld, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine about our ailing country and get a few ideas for how to remedy ourselves, and perhaps one another.

109,"Tropical Storm Harvey strengthened into a hurricane on Thursday as it headed to coastal Texas, where it was expected to bring life-threatening flooding, meteorologists said. The National Hurricane Center said that Air Force hurricane hunter planes had spotted Tropical Storm Harvey strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico, with about 60-mile-per-hour winds more than 300 miles off the southern coast of Texas early Thursday. A hurricane warning, meaning hurricane conditions are expected, had been in effect from Port Mansfield in far southern Texas to Matagorda, about 100 miles southwest of Houston. But later in the day, the planes spotted the system strengthening, and the estimated maximum sustained winds increased to close to 100 m.p.h. the hurricane center said early Friday. It was expected to make landfall Friday night or early Saturday. Parts of Louisiana and the lower Mississippi Valley were also in the path of hurricane conditions from the storm system, the hurricane center said. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on Thursday that Hurricane Harvey was expected to hit Corpus Christi early Saturday as a Category 3 hurricane, but that its outer bands of rain could be felt earlier. The impact on Louisiana was expected early next week, he said. “It is getting more and more serious as time goes by,” Mr. Edwards said in a news conference. He said the weather service had told him there was a possibility the hurricane could make landfall in Texas and then re-enter the Gulf before moving east to Louisiana, he said. "
110,"CHICAGO — Note: Friday night, after this Op-Ed was published, it was announced that President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio. At his rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, President Trump strongly implied that he would pardon Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., who was found guilty in July of criminal contempt for defying a judge’s order against prolonging traffic patrols targeting immigrants. This is not idle presidential chatter: On Thursday morning, CNN reported that the White House has prepared the necessary paperwork, along with talking points for its allies. This is uncharted territory. Yes, on its face the Constitution’s pardon power would seem unlimited. And past presidents have used it with varying degrees of wisdom, at times in ways that would seem to clash with the courts’ ability to render justice. But the Arpaio case is different: The sheriff was convicted of violating constitutional rights, in defiance of a court order involving racial profiling. Should the president indicate that he does not think Mr. Arpaio should be punished for that, he would signal that governmental agents who violate judicial injunctions are likely to be pardoned, even though their behavior violated constitutional rights, when their illegal actions are consistent with presidential policies. Many legal scholars argue that the only possible redress is impeachment — itself a politicized, drawn-out process. But there may be another route. If the pardon is challenged in court, we may discover that there are, in fact, limits to the president’s pardon power after all. The only effective means courts have to prevent or stop governmental violations of constitutional rights is through injunctions. But injunctions have teeth only when they have the potential of a contempt conviction behind them. In other words, in issuing an injunction, a court is saying, “stop doing that or else.” The “or else” is a criminal conviction for contempt, leading to a fine, imprisonment or both. Absent the “or else,” the injunction is all but meaningless. But if the president signals to government agents that there exists the likelihood of a pardon when they violate a judicial injunction that blocks his policies, he can all too easily circumvent the only effective means of enforcing constitutional restrictions on his behavior. Indeed, the president could even secretly promise a pardon to agents if they undertake illegal activity he desires. "
111,"WASHINGTON — President Trump handed Democrats a gift this week with his vow to shut down the government if he doesn’t soon get money for his border wall. Democrats may be only too happy to let him follow through on his threat since it will now be easy for them to blame the president for any government interruption, which would probably aggravate many Americans. Rather than cowing Democrats, Mr. Trump’s tough talk is more likely to embolden the opposition in ongoing negotiations, particularly since he has now twice suggested he was willing to shutter government agencies if he didn’t get his way. It also puts more pressure on Republicans to find the votes internally to pass spending bills and an increase in the federal debt limit — two things hard-right conservatives in the House and Senate have refused to support in the past. That Republican resistance provides Democrats leverage — Republicans can either grant concessions such as no wall money or produce all the votes for the spending bills and debt limit increase themselves. Mr. Trump also has spent the past few weeks taunting and denigrating Republican leaders who will be responsible for navigating these formidable fiscal obstacles, providing them incentive to look out for themselves rather than the interests of the president. "
112,"It has become increasingly clear to me after the tragedy of Charlottesville that Donald Trump not only has no interest in being president of the entire country but also is specifically tailoring his so-called presidency to the white racial-grievance apparatus. This week he reinforced his racial rhetoric, appealing to loss of history and heritage. He defended Confederate monuments and mocked those who agreed to remove them. He tried to rewrite his own history of standing up for white supremacists. This is the man we have: one who doesn’t want to lead a country but wants to rule a tribe. Most of the people who support him are just fine with his approach and behavior. These people baffle the throngs who see a man unfit for office and possibly inching closer to diagnosable insanity. But I think that if people want to understand what is happening here, to understand why Trump’s support is so strong in some quarters, we need to broaden the scope of inquiry beyond just the Rust Belt states that he won by razor-thin margins and beyond border states where the wall would have great impact. We also need to look at Southern states that he carried by enormous margins. We have to look at states like Alabama. In doing so, we have to examine the history of Alabama and see how white supremacy tracks across time and culminates with Trump. "
113,"For months, the White House under President Trump operated with few real rules, and those were barely enforced. People wandered into the Oval Office throughout the day. The president was given pieces of unvetted information, and found more on his own that he often tweeted out. Policy decisions were often based on whoever had last gotten Mr. Trump’s attention. Mr. Trump’s Twitter habit shows little sign of abating. On vacation earlier at his private club in Bedminster, N.J., and now, ensconced again in the White House, he has been watching television — unfettered by any aides — and responding as he always has. But inside the West Wing, the president’s new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, has been trying to control the things he can. After being sworn in on July 31, he spent three weeks assessing how to create a less jumbled, chaotic churn around Mr. Trump, and how to create a system that the president’s staff will respect. In two memos sent to the staff on Monday he began to detail his plan, starting with how he wants information to get to the president, and how Mr. Trump will respond. Codifying of paper flow and decision-making is not usually of note in a White House, and the practices laid out were fairly standard in previous administrations. But in Mr. Trump’s White House, where fiefs have been in constant combat and decision-making has often been ill defined, the memos, first reported by Politico, mark a new era. The pair of memos, signed by Robert Porter, the assistant to the president for policy coordination and staff secretary, as well as Mr. Kelly, codified rules and procedures that a White House typically sets at the outset of an administration. Mr. Kelly’s predecessor, Reince Priebus, sent some similar guidelines around early in the administration, according to two officials, but they were never taken seriously. Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been treated with a different level of deference inside the building, those aides said. Staff members discovered early on that they could defy Mr. Priebus, the officials said, but crossing  a Marine is a different matter. "

115,"To the Editor: Re “The President Turns on His Own” (editorial, Aug. 24): President Trump not only risks his agenda by lambasting Republican senators but also continues to prove that he is not the great negotiator he constantly boasts that he is. A great negotiator does not bully his opponents, as Mr. Trump tried to do with senators over the health care bill. A great negotiator does not threaten to shut down the government to get Congress to pay for his wall (after he failed to get Mexico to pay for it — another negotiation fiasco). A great negotiator doesn’t hurl insults or threats that he wouldn’t follow through on, like a nuclear war with North Korea (or would he actually be willing to push that button?). So let’s burst Mr. Trump’s self-deluded bubble and remind him that bullying and threats, insults and self-congratulation, do not great negotiations achieve — as is clear from his lack of legislative victories. Gee, isn’t he tired from all this losing? JAMES S. BERKMAN, BOSTON To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Shutdown Threat Risks Splitting His Party” (front page, Aug. 24): President Trump now threatens to shut down the government if Congress does not fund a wall on the southern border of the United States. The demanded funding this year alone is $1.6 billion, and $3.6 billion over the next two fiscal years. Rather than creating an asset for America’s future, like highways, roads or bridges, this expenditure would further increase government debt spending. If this poorly conceived wall is built, one can imagine how it will require billions more in upkeep, or rapidly deteriorate and end up being a graffiti-covered monument to a failed investment, like a bankrupt Trump hotel. MARK MILLER, DOYLESTOWN, PA. To the Editor: As I recall, at many of Donald Trump’s campaign rallies, the overwhelming, unified response to the question ”And who will build that wall?” was “Mexico!” So why does Mr. Trump want the cost of the wall to be in our budget?

117,"KIEV, Ukraine — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis vowed on Thursday to help Ukraine stand up to Russian violations of its sovereignty and signaled that the Trump administration was considering providing defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military. President Barack Obama had resisted such a step, fearing it would be seen as a provocation by Russia. In the first visit to Ukraine by an American defense secretary in nearly a decade, Mr. Mattis seemed to be anticipating that argument. “Defensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor, and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor since it is their territory where the fighting is happening,” Mr. Mattis said at a joint news conference with Ukraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko. State and Defense Department officials have recommended that the United States provide Javelin anti-tank missiles and other defensive weapons to Ukraine to strengthen its forces and raise the potential cost to the Kremlin of a Russian attack. But President Trump, who has consistently taken a more conciliatory position toward Russia than have his top national security advisers, has yet to take up the matter. Mr. Mattis declined to disclose what he planned to recommend to Mr. Trump. Nor did he indicate any timetable for deciding the matter. But his comments suggested that he was sympathetic to supplying defensive weapons — long a topic of enormous interest in Ukraine. "
118,"To the Editor: Re “President’s Feud With McConnell Becomes Hostile” (front page, Aug. 23): The deterioration of the relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, should concern every American. The rancor between them is not merely political theater or a trivial battle for supremacy; rather, it is detrimental to the American system of governance. This extraordinary intraparty conflict virtually ensures that government gridlock will reign for the foreseeable future. The Trump-McConnell feud is a microcosm of a broader issue that has become pervasive in our nation. We cannot allow the acrimony and dissonance that have regrettably become commonplace in America to become an acceptable norm. Civility, not further conflict, can begin helping our nation heal. After the events in Charlottesville, Va., what we need is more dialogue and less discord. We need to come together, not tear ourselves further apart. N. AARON TROODLER
BALA CYNWYD, PA. "
119,"WASHINGTON — President Trump started his day on Thursday publicly criticizing leaders of his own party for not advancing his legislative agenda, which the president called “so easy.” Mr. Trump said he asked Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Representative Paul Ryan, the House speaker, to include language about the debt ceiling in a recent Department of Veterans Affairs bill. “They didn’t do it so now we have a big deal with Dems holding them up (as usual) on Debt Ceiling approval,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of Twitter posts. Congress has until mid-October to raise the legal borrowing limit or the United States could risk defaulting on its debt obligations. A White House official said on Thursday that Mr. Trump was specifically referring to a bill to extend emergency funding to the multibillion-dollar Veterans Choice program, which pays for veterans to receive care from private doctors if they face long wait times or travel distances. Congressional aides said on Thursday that there had indeed been a short-lived effort late last month to tie the debt ceiling language to the Choice bill. But with the veterans’ program set to run out of money by mid-August, apparent opposition from conservative budget hard-liners and a congressional recesses looming, the idea was never given serious consideration. The Choice legislation ultimately passed both the House and the Senate unanimously, shortly before each chamber began its summer recess. Mr. Trump signed it into law on August 12. Mr. McConnell said on Monday that there was no chance Congress would fail to raise the debt ceiling by the end of September. The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell has been disintegrating over the summer and could jeopardize urgent legislation when Congress returns from its August recess. Mr. Trump has been publicly critical of Mr. McConnell for not being able to “repeal and replace” President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation. He repeated his criticism in another tweet on Thursday: “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed! That should NEVER have happened!” Mr. Trump shifted his focus on Twitter briefly to the Obama administration on Thursday. The president shared a post from one of his supporters that was critical of Mr. Obama. And Mr. Trump called out Mr. Obama’s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., who has publicly questioned whether Mr. Trump is fit to be president. “I really question his ability to — his fitness to be in this office,” Mr. Clapper said on CNN this week. Mr. Trump also lashed out at “Fake News” on Thursday for reports on the different styles of his recent public speeches. Several news outlets, including The New York Times, wrote articles comparing his speaking style at recent appearances, including in Arizona at a campaign-style rally on Tuesday and at an American Legion convention on Wednesday night. "
120,"Challenging the Republican ascendance in states where labor once carried enormous sway, a prominent union plans to spend tens of millions of dollars during the 2018 campaign cycle to reverse the trend. The Service Employees International Union, one of the largest and wealthiest unions in the United States with roughly 2 million members, will fund an extensive campaign over the next 14 months to elect politicians with labor-friendly stands on the minimum wage, unions and health care. The effort will primarily aim at the traditionally industrial states of the Midwest and Rust Belt, where labor’s political influence has come under a furious assault from conservative forces in recent decades, culminating in President Trump’s electoral sweep of the traditionally Democratic states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Since 2010, four states in the region have enacted so-called right-to-work legislation that allows workers to opt out of paying fees to unions that bargain on their behalf. Elected leaders in several states have acted to block or reverse minimum-wage increases. “If you think about what the No. 1 job of an elected official ought to be, it’s raising the standard of living of citizens they’re elected to represent,” said Scott Courtney, an executive vice president of the union, which will formally unveil the initiative on Labor Day. “But if you look at what has been happening in battle ground states in the Midwest, it’s just the opposite.” The high-profile involvement of S.E.I.U., whose membership in the Midwest has steadily increased over much of the past generation, is in some sense a reflection of the changing economic landscape of the region, where health care has replaced manufacturing as the top employer in many states.

121,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) An intense debate is being waged in Sacramento over a proposal that would alter how crucial services are provided to Californians. Sponsored by the Service Employees International Union, the measure would require that counties adhere to a raft of new conditions before contracting out for services in health care, housing, public safety and other areas. Dozens of government, business and nonprofit groups have opposed it. So have newspapers across the state, including The Los Angeles Times, The Fresno Bee, San Francisco Chronicle and Sacramento Bee. (A “bucket of horse slop” is how one described it.) Still, the measure known as AB 1250 has been advancing through the Legislature. It was approved with Democratic support in the Assembly in June. It’s now in the State Senate. Supporters have argued that contracting out to private and nonprofit groups results in lower quality services. The rules, they say, are meant to ensure officials are held accountable for how tax money is spent. "
122,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. You grow numb. You grow weary. I recall discovering a few weeks back that President Trump had lied about two phone calls, one from the president of Mexico and one from the head of the Boy Scouts. The calls, supposedly to congratulate him, did not exist. They never happened. They were pure inventions. Asked if Trump had lied, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “I wouldn’t say it was a lie.” I actually remember shrugging. The shrug was terrifying. This is how autocrats — or would-be autocrats — cement their power. They wear you down with their lies. They distract you. They want you to believe that 2+2=5. They want you to forget that freedom withers when the distinction between truth and falsehood dies. In a dictatorship there is a single font of “truth”: the voice of the dictator. Remember Trump at the Republican National Convention a little over a year ago: “I am your voice.” And now his voice is everywhere. There’s the scripted Trump voice, which is fake. There’s the unscripted voice, which is genuine. The two tend to alternate; call this the choreography of disorientation. It’s confusing, like having a president who isn’t really a president but instead acts like the leader of a rabble-rousing movement. The Oval Office is a useful prop, no more than that. He’s held eight rallies since becoming president in January. The latest was in Phoenix, where he called the media “very dishonest people.” He led the crowd in a chant of “CNN sucks.” He attacked the “failing New York Times.” It’s familiar. That familiarity is menacing. It led me to think of my half-repressed shrug at the beginning of this month. Trump has one fundamental talent: a ruthless ability to mess with people’s minds and turn their anger into the engine of his ambition. A dishonest president calls the media that report on his dishonesty dishonest for doing so. This is where we are. This is the danger that Trump represents. "
123,"The generals publicly supported their intervention in Afghanistan, but in private they worried they were trapped. After 16 years, they feared they had produced “a recipe for endless war,” according to an American ambassador who met with them. But the generals, the ambassador said, “felt there was no alternative, no realistic alternative” than to continue fighting a doomed mission. Those generals were Pakistani. Their meetings with the ambassador, Tom Simons, took place in 1996. Mr. Simons recounted the experience to the journalist Steve Coll in 2002, one year into an American mission in Afghanistan that has now also lasted 16, and which President Trump announced on Monday that his administration would extend. There is a reason that Afghanistan’s conflict, then and now, so defies solutions. Its combination of state collapse, civil conflict, ethnic disintegration and multisided intervention has locked it in a self-perpetuating cycle that may be simply beyond outside resolution. “I’m not saying that state formation will never work in Afghanistan, but externally building, as we’re trying to do it, cannot work,” said Romain Malejacq, a political scientist at the Center for International Conflict Analysis and Management in the Netherlands. American-led efforts, despite some successes, have ended up reinforcing and accelerating the broader cycles of violence and fragmentation that have been growing since the state’s collapse in the early 1990s. “The more we go on, the more fragmented it gets,” Professor Malejacq said. “I’m getting more and more pessimistic. I don’t really know how Afghanistan is going to get out of it, to be truly honest.” "

125,"Sigh. If only President Trump denounced neo-Nazis as passionately and sincerely as he castigates journalists. What could be an easier task than distancing oneself from Nazis or violent white supremacists? Yet Trump manages to make it infinitely complicated — and then get distracted by self-pity and excoriate reporters for committing journalism. The key strain of his sulfurous speech in Phoenix on Tuesday was an extended attack on “dishonest” reporters (including at “the failing New York Times”). Look, we in journalism deserve to have our feet held to the fire. We make mistakes all the time, and too often we are superficial, sensationalist, unfair, defensive or diverted by shiny objects. Critics are right that we in the national media are often out of touch with working-class America, and distressingly often, we are lap dogs instead of watchdogs. Yet for all our failings, journalism remains an indispensable constraint on power. Trump has systematically tried to delegitimize the institutions that hold him accountable — courts, prosecutors, investigators, the media — and that’s the context for his vilification of all them, for we collectively provide monitoring that outrages him. The New York Times and The Washington Post have separately tallied Trump’s lies, with The Post calculating that he has now made more than 1,000 misleading statements since assuming the presidency. That’s a grueling pace of almost five a day, and it is accelerating (at the six-month mark, it was 4.6 a day). This prevarication proliferation is an indication that John F. Kelly is unable to rein in Trump, and that the problem was not Steve Bannon but the president himself. Trump’s caricature of journalists as dishonest is hypocritical, and it insults the courage and professionalism of my colleagues who sometimes risk their lives trying to get a story. "
126,"A great day of triumph for Donald Trump! The president went to an American Legion convention Wednesday and read a speech off a teleprompter. Nothing weird happened. Total victory. We now divide the president’s public addresses into two categories. There are the unremarkable and predictable ones written by someone else and the ones in which he ignores the script and just says what’s on his mind, terrifying and confusing all Americans who are not in his base. (About the base. Polls make it very clear that 30 to 40 percent of voters are going to approve of what Trump does, no matter what. Many of them don’t mind if he comes on stage and starts talking like Uncle Fred Who Gets Drunk at Family Dinners. They enjoy Uncle Fred. Some of them are Uncle Fred.) Any other president who went to a convention of veterans and called for Americans to “work together” would have gotten no notice whatsoever. But Trump was coming off his spontaneous appearance in Phoenix when he frightened the whole country with his rants about the media and his wild riffs of self-congratulations. “Now you know, I was a good student,” Trump ad-libbed at his Arizona rally. “I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They’re elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.” Three points about this comment, only one of which is: “Wow, the president of the United States is so insecure he finds it necessary to brag about his grades in school.” The second is that we know about as much about his actual grades in school as we do about his tax returns. "
127,"In the wake of the presidential election, we’ve all been asking simplistic questions about how Donald Trump won. Was it economics? Was it racism? Was it misogyny? Did it come down to identity? We know that it can’t have been just one thing, and that President Trump’s triumph was a concoction of many things. Nonetheless, several factors came together in a peculiar way, with serious electoral consequences. Millions of white voters began to see themselves more openly not as white supremacists but as white identified. It is no secret that the president has capitalized on the increasing salience of race and ethnicity in recent years. The furious reaction to many different historical and cultural developments — mass immigration; the success of the civil rights and women’s rights movements; the election and re-election of a black president; and the approaching end of white majority status in the United States — has created a political environment ripe for the growth of white identity politics. Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke, puts it this way: White voters for whom racial identity is important include a minority faction of white supremacists, but as a whole they constitute a much broader and encompassing group. In an Aug. 16 essay for The Washington Post’s Monkey Cage, Jardina wrote: A total of 36 percent of whites described their racial identity as either “very important” (16 percent) or “extremely important” (20 percent), according to an American National Election Studies survey in January 2016. Another 25 percent said it was “moderately important.” Careful examination of Trump’s initial support shows the key role of white identity voters in Trump’s ascendance. Between Jan. 22 and Jan. 28, 2016, as Trump consolidated his early support on the eve of the Republican caucuses and primaries, ANES conducted a special pre-election survey. To explore the role of white voters for whom racial identity was especially important, three political scientists — John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck — analyze the ANES data in their forthcoming book, “Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America.” The survey, they write, On the basis of that scale, the authors assembled the data illustrated by the accompanying chart, which shows that fewer than five percent of white Republicans who indicated that their racial identity was of little importance supported Trump. Among those who said their identity as whites was extremely important to them, Trump’s support reached 81 percent. "
128,"When it comes to Afghanistan, we’ve tried everything. The lesson is: Nothing works. We’ve tried “light footprint.” From the initial defeat of the Taliban in 2001 until 2007, monthly U.S. troop numbers never exceeded 25,000. Result: a reconstituted Taliban, their leadership secure in Pakistan, made inroads into more than half of Afghanistan. We’ve tried big footprint. Barack Obama ran for the presidency calling Afghanistan “a war that we have to win.” After he came to office, he ordered a surge that brought force levels to 100,000, along with tens of thousands of NATO troops. Result: The Taliban were pushed out of many of their strongholds, which were brought under government control. But because the surge had a predetermined deadline, the Taliban knew they could wait us out. “NATO has all the watches, but we have all the time,” went their refrain. We’ve tried nation building. At least as of 2014, the United States had spent $104 billion on Afghan relief and reconstruction funds, most of it for security but also nearly $30 billion for “governance and development” and $7.5 billion on counternarcotics. Result: As of 2015, more than three in five Afghans remained illiterate. Afghan security forces lost 4,000 members a month — less to the Taliban than to simple desertion. The country ranks 169th out of 176 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, ahead of only Somalia, South Sudan, North Korea, Syria, Yemen, Sudan and Libya. Opium production is surging. We’ve tried killing terrorists. Lots and lots of them. As many as 42,000 Taliban and other insurgents have been killed and another 19,000 wounded in fighting since 2001, according to one rough 2016 estimate. The United States has also carried out more than 400 drone strikes in Pakistan, decimating Al Qaeda’s core leadership. Last year a drone took out the Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. "

Trevor Noah took a close look at President Trump’s rally on Tuesday in Arizona. He said the event seemed like a success, at least if you dampen your expectations. Conan O’Brien pointed out that people at the rally spent some time assailing the mainstream news media. But he said there might be one network they dislike even more. The “Daily Show” correspondent Roy Wood Jr. returned to the air on Wednesday to examine the crowd at Mr. Trump’s rally. He focused in on one person in particular: the lone black man shown behind Mr. Trump throughout the rally, holding a sign saying “Blacks for Trump.” Mr. Wood explained that the man goes by the name “Michael the Black Man,” and was once a member of the Yahweh Ben Yahweh cult, which was responsible for over a dozen killings, including some by beheading.

130,"To the Editor: Re “I Was Wrong,” by Julius Krein (Op-Ed, Aug. 20): While it is admirable for an adult in politics these days to actually admit a mistake, Mr. Krein’s mistake — the support of a presidential candidate with no cohesive policy proposals and a temperament obviously and egregiously unsuited for the job — has had dire consequences. If he and a few of his conservative thought-leading peers had had the simple intellectual foresight that almost 66 million other Americans had, paired with the courage of their convictions to put country before party, we would still be nit-picking about Hillary Clinton’s email servers instead of teetering on the brink of nuclear war with North Korea and facing a white supremacist resurgence at home. Therefore, I pose to you, Mr. Krein: You helped make this mess and you have admirably and publicly apologized for it; how do you intend to clean it up? ADAM E. BLOCK
PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. To the Editor: I commend Julius Krein for his humble apology. His (and others’) misunderstanding of Donald Trump has been extremely confounding to me. He is a thoughtful conservative. I am a thoughtful progressive. From the beginning, I saw Donald Trump as a con man of the highest order: manipulative, dishonest, unprincipled, amoral. Unless Mr. Krein limited his news access to extremist outlets, he must have seen the same videotapes that I have seen. So why is Charlottesville the last straw? He mentions Mr. Trump’s notorious “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone,” and I assume that he is aware of the boast about grabbing women, the invitation to the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, the exhortation to his supporters at his rallies to assault protesters, the denigration of John McCain’s military service, not to mention the endless lies. There must be more at work here than just the desire to see conservative policies enacted. Perhaps the pundits of the future will explain it to us all. JENIFER KOLKHORST
ORINDA, CALIF. To the Editor: Is Julius Krein’s acknowledgment that it was a mistake to support Donald Trump’s candidacy a plea for absolution? I can forgive a coal miner who naïvely believed that Mr. Trump could revive an industry doomed to extinction. I cannot forgive a politically sophisticated individual who was fully aware that he was promoting a candidate with a lifetime history of personal and public behavior unbecoming a future president. You bought this presidency. You are not forgiven. SCOTT MARTIN MILLER, CHICAGO "
131,"In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Adam Kirsch and Francine Prose discuss what free speech means in the context of Charlottesville and beyond. By Adam Kirsch Liberalism is founded on the belief that we should tolerate one another’s error. Nowhere is the unnaturalness of liberalism more obvious than when it comes to the principle of free speech. Political speech involves making claims about what is true: the planet is warming; the president is a criminal; Jews are out to destroy white America. If I disagree with your truth claim, then I believe you are either ignorant or a liar, and it is not immediately obvious why ignorance and lies deserve any kind of respect. Shouldn’t I use every means in my power to stop you from spreading falsehood? Isn’t it my moral responsibility to do so? This kind of reasoning is especially compelling when it deals with speech that has potentially dangerous consequences. If you deny global warming and try to convince people that it doesn’t exist, while I believe it presents an immediate danger to the survival of the species, then it makes sense that I would take any measures necessary to silence you, for the sake of humanity’s very future. And this does not apply only to empirical threats. For a true religious believer, nothing is more dangerous than the propagation of false beliefs about God, since heresy imperils something even more important than lives — it threatens our souls. The Inquisition burned heretics because it saw in their speech such a spiritual threat; surely it was an act of kindness to protect the innocent from deadly lies? It took the Western world many generations of religious wars and persecutions before liberal thinkers, in the 17th and 18th centuries, began to challenge this imperious logic. The key to the invention of free speech was the recognition of pluralism — the fact that, in any human population, there will be people with irreconcilably different understandings of the truth. Pluralism is not relativism: I do not have to agree that there is no truth about climate change or racism or God. But I must recognize that we do not all agree on what that truth is. The question is what to do with that disagreement. Liberalism is founded on the belief that we should tolerate one another’s error, not because we approve of it, but to avoid the violence that would result if we each sought to silence the other. The liberal believes that life is more important than truth — that it is better to live in a peaceful society full of error than in a pure society full of persecution. The price of this toleration is that we must constantly put up with hearing speech that we consider wrong; we must smother our moral instincts. As the poet Robert Lowell put it, the liberal is someone who “bites his own lip to warm his icy tooth.” "
132,"OKLAHOMA CITY — For months, health officials in this socially conservative state capital have been staggered by a fast-spreading outbreak of a disease that, for nearly two decades, was considered all but extinguished. Syphilis, the deadly sexually transmitted infection that can lead to blindness, paralysis and dementia, is returning here and around the country, another consequence of the heroin and methamphetamine epidemics, as users trade sex for drugs. To locate possible patients and draw their blood for testing, Oklahoma’s syphilis detectives have been knocking on doors in dilapidated apartment complexes and dingy motels, driving down lonely rural roads and interviewing prison inmates. Syphilis has led them to members of 17 gangs; to drug dealers; to prostitutes, pimps and johns; and to their spouses and lovers, all caught in the disease’s undertow. “Syphilis doesn’t sleep for anyone,” said Portia King, a veteran Oklahoma state health investigator. “We have 200 open cases of sex partners we’re looking for. And the spread is migrating out of the city.” It took months for investigators to realize Oklahoma City had a syphilis outbreak. Last fall, the juvenile detention center reported three cases — a boy and two girls, the youngest, 14. The center had never had a syphilis case in seven years of testing for it. Investigators were mystified: The teenagers did not know each other, live in the same neighborhood or attend the same school. "
133,"BEARS EARS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Utah — Parts of this sprawling region of red-rock canyons and at least three other national monuments would lose their strict protection and could be reopened for new mining or drilling under proposals submitted to President Trump by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday, according to congressional aides and others who have been briefed on the report. Environmentalists, ranchers, tribal governments and Western lawmakers had been watching closely to see if Mr. Zinke would propose changing the borders of the Bears Ears National Monument, which President Barack Obama established at the end of his term, and other scenic and historic areas under federal protection. In recent days, Mr. Zinke had been considering a dramatic reduction to Bears Ears, to approximately 160,000 acres from 1.35 million, according to multiple people familiar with the process. No president has ever reduced a monument by such a large amount. Shrinking the monuments would be widely seen as a direct blow to Mr. Obama’s environmental legacy, and would probably prompt the first major legal test of a century-old conservation law. Mr. Zinke was believed to be leaning toward such a step. But when he submitted his recommendations on Thursday, he declined to announce specifically what he had proposed for Bears Ears or the other monuments under review. He referred to his recommendations only in general terms, saying they would “provide a much-needed change for the local communities who border and rely on these lands.” The people briefed on the plans said that along with Bears Ears, Mr. Zinke had proposed reducing the size of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, also in southern Utah, and two others. "
134,"Questions about the ownership and corporate structure of the HNA Group, one of China’s biggest — and most acquisitive — companies, are mounting, prompting scrutiny by regulators in the United States and Europe and leading at least one Wall Street bank to step away from it. The mystery surrounding HNA is illustrated by its relationship with a New York-based company, the Pacific American Corporation. HNA has previously said that PAC, as it is known, is an independent company that buys engines, spare parts and other airline equipment for HNA’s subsidiary, Hainan Airlines. HNA has said that it has no ownership stake in PAC. Previously unreported corporate documents reviewed by The New York Times show a closer relationship. PAC is run by the son and younger brother of HNA’s co-founder and co-chairman Chen Feng, and was once controlled by HNA. The younger brother of HNA’s co-chairman was also instrumental in helping create the initial ownership structure of HNA Group, these records show, through the use of entities set up outside China, in Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands. These offshore companies effectively obscured the control wielded by top executives and their relatives. The lack of such disclosures in HNA’s regulatory filings may have violated China’s securities laws on “connected” transactions, two experts in Chinese law say. The omissions are likely to raise more questions about who ultimately controls HNA, a private company that in recent years has spent more than $30 billion acquiring stakes in global companies like Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank.

135,"BETHEL, Alaska — The contractions were coming eight minutes apart, and Billie Jo Yupanik was breathing into them, her gaze down, hands cradling her abdomen. Around her, other pregnant women padded around the open, airy rooms of the Yukon-Kuskokwim prematernal home, chatting on phones or grabbing coffee from the pot. They mostly smiled and nodded at Ms. Yupanik as they passed, but otherwise seemed to pay her little mind. Going into labor, after all, is hardly remarkable in this place. Childbirth has become more dangerous for women across much of the United States over the last two decades; maternal death rates have doubled since the late 1980s, according to federal figures. Rural places — here in Alaska and across the lower 48 states — are among the hardest hit as vast distances, widespread poverty and fewer doctors make it harder to obtain access to health care. And Native populations are often on the very edge of that disparity: A baby born to an Alaska Native mother is four times as likely to die in the first year of life as a white baby. But here on the far western end of the nation’s biggest and most rural state, where roads are nearly nonexistent and populations are scattered across tiny villages, caregivers are trying to change the equation not by sending more doctors out, but by bringing more women in. At their first prenatal visits to the hospital, doctors assign a due date for the baby and a “be in Bethel” date 30 days earlier, for a stay at the prematernal home, which the hospital operates nearby. An added stern warning makes most women comply: If they don’t come, they might give birth without a doctor’s care at all. Bethel, population 6,400, is the biggest town for more than 350 miles in any direction, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, the one hospital in the region, serves an area the size of Oregon.

President Trump is threatening to shut down the government in a matter of weeks if the Republican-led Congress doesn’t fund his long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. That complicates an already ambitious congressional to-do list, including resolving the budget, avoiding a default on the country’s debt and overhauling the tax system. The president also attacked lawmakers, notably Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, whose votes he’ll need when Congress returns next month. Mr. Trump promised on Wednesday to improve medical care for veterans, in a speech that contrasted sharply with his rally the night before. "
137,"HAMBURG, Germany — If you haven’t heard anything about the election campaign in Germany, that’s because there isn’t much of one, despite the fact that nationwide elections that will determine, among other things, whether Chancellor Angela Merkel stays or goes are set for Sept. 24. Yes, we are talking about the same Germany that has taken in roughly one million refugees and migrants in the last two years. The same Germany that bailed out bankrupt European states with billions of euros. The same Germany that has taken a tough stance toward Russia after its annexation of Crimea. The same Germany that is switching off all its nuclear power plants and turning to green energy. All of this has happened under Ms. Merkel’s watch, and all of it is controversial here. And yet there is little doubt that she will win her fourth run at the chancellorship, which she has held since 2005. According to polls, if the elections were to take place now, she would beat her opponent, the Social Democrat Martin Schulz, by 20 points. As of now, the only question appears to be whether Ms. Merkel will seek a coalition of her Christian Democrats with the Liberals or the Green Party. And while both candidates have held rallies and made speeches, the public, and even much of the news media, seems either uninterested or resigned to the results. It’s not that Germans are uninterested in politics or the issues; it’s that they’ve accepted the fact that the country’s national politics are locked in place by a centrist consensus that gives them little choice at the ballot box. This mass resignation highlights two paradoxes about German politics right now. The first paradox is that German voters are so temperamentally conservative — i.e., afraid of change — that they are about to re-elect a chancellor who has brought about the most drastic changes the country has seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall. “You know me” was Ms. Merkel’s central message in the run-up to the previous elections, in 2013. But it was only after she had retaken office that the Germans really got to know her. Nobody would have believed that this rather reserved, calculating physicist would, based on a gut decision in September 2015, allow several months of largely uncontrolled immigration into Germany. After the influx, Ms. Merkel’s message was “we’ll manage this,” without explaining what exactly “we,” “manage” and “this” mean. "
138,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Days after President Trump’s announcement of a new strategy for Afghanistan, the top American officials in Kabul said Thursday that a promised increase in United States military personnel and air power was already underway in the country. At a news conference in the Afghan capital, the military commander for United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson, said that the influx of new troops — mostly trainers for the Afghan security forces — would continue over the next few months. He did not provide details on the number of troops, and he emphasized that American forces would remain in Afghanistan with no prestated timeline for withdrawal. Previous reports have suggested that the increase, which Mr. Trump has put in the hands of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former Marine general, would amount to around 4,000 additional American troops. They would be joining an American force that officially totals about 8,400, but that the Pentagon recently acknowledged to The Wall Street Journal is closer to 12,000. More than 4,000 troops from other NATO countries are also said to be in Afghanistan. “There will be additional capabilities, some of that is already arriving,” General Nicholson said. “But we are not going to talk about the specific numbers. We are not going to telegraph to the enemy what it is we are going to do and how we are going to influence the battlefield.” General Nicholson said that air support to the Afghan forces would also be ramping up. That support has already been extensive in a year of major territorial gains for the Taliban insurgency. The United States Air Force reported dropping about 1,250 bombs and other ordnance in the first seven months of this year, almost twice as many as in the same period last year. "
139,"CLARENCE, N.Y. — In early June, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo joined forces with Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, and declared in no uncertain terms that he would do whatever he could to help unseat six Republican members of New York’s congressional delegation in next year’s midterm elections. Since then, more than a dozen Democrats have announced their candidacy in those six districts, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission, joining nearly a dozen others who had preceded the governor’s declaration of war. The Republicans are certainly taking the threats to their seats seriously, especially considering the historic trend of losses for the president’s party in midterm elections. And there is no question that the stumbles of the Trump administration and the still-stinging November loss by Hillary Clinton have encouraged a groundswell of energy in the Democratic Party base. Yet the decision by Mr. Cuomo to wade into the federal races has added an interesting dynamic to the contests — one that the Republicans do not seem to mind at all. “If Cuomo and Pelosi want to come to our districts to try to bring us down, I would encourage them to,” said Representative Tom Reed, who represents a large swath of the state’s Southern Tier. In races throughout the state, Republicans indicate they will try to link Democratic candidates to Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat who is thought to have national ambitions, but whose approval ratings have been hurt by New York City’s failing subway system. Such a strategy is based on Mr. Cuomo’s lack of popularity in the very districts he hopes to flip: During his 2014 re-election campaign, he lost each and every one of them, sometimes by embarrassing margins. And President Trump won each of those districts last fall. "
140,"WASHINGTON — President Trump traveled to storm-brushed Corpus Christi, Tex., on Tuesday to survey some of the damage caused by Tropical Storm Harvey and demonstrate his personal commitment to a region still in the grips of a historic natural disaster. Mr. Trump, who pushed aides to schedule a trip to Texas as early as possible after Harvey made landfall there on Friday night, settled on visiting Corpus Christi because it was the closest he could get to the hardest-hit areas without disrupting recovery efforts, according to state officials. The port city of 325,000 is 30 miles from the most severely affected parts of the Gulf Coast, and suffered relatively light damage from the initial impact of the storm. After meeting at a Corpus Christi firehouse with state and federal officials, the president flew to Austin, Tex., for another meeting with officials involved in responding to the flooding before returning to Washington. Members of Mr. Trump’s staff said the trip was mainly a humanitarian mission and that the president winced while watching televised scenes of ruin and rescue on the flooded streets of Houston on his way to Corpus Christi. But they conceded that the stakes were high for Mr. Trump on his first visit to a disaster area that was inevitably seen as a test of his competence and empathy. For the most part, Mr. Trump kept to the script. But there were a few jarring, quintessentially Trumpian moments. "
141,"SEOUL, South Korea — The United Nations Security Council condemned on Tuesday North Korea’s recent missile tests, including one that sent a ballistic missile soaring over Japan, as “outrageous actions.” But it gave no indication that it was prepared to take tougher measures against Pyongyang, which called the latest launch a “curtain-raiser.” The 15 members of the Security Council met for nearly four hours in an emergency session to discuss a response to the North’s latest test, which sent an intermediate-range ballistic missile over the Japanese island of Hokkaido. They unanimously adopted a statement condemning that launch and three others on Saturday, calling them “not just a threat to the region but all U.N. member states.” But nothing in the statement suggested the council was ready to further toughen the eight sets of sanctions it has imposed on the North, and it was unclear what additional action, if any, might be taken. Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said the statement showed that “the world is united against North Korea.” She hinted at a possible American response, saying that “the United States will not allow this lawlessness to continue.” President Trump said in a statement earlier Tuesday, “All options are on the table.” North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has authorized more than 80 missile tests since taking power almost six years ago. But all those missiles landed in nearby waters because they were of limited range or fired at a sharp angle, high into space, so they would splash down without going too far. "
142,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a statement condemning what it called North Korea’s “outrageous actions” in launching a ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday and launching three missiles last Saturday. But there was no suggestion that the council was ready to toughen sanctions. President Trump warned that “all options are on the table,” while China called on the North to suspend its missile tests in return for a halt to U.S.-South Korean military exercises. And Japanese citizens, some of whom received a beeping alert on their cellphones just four minutes after the projectile was launched, may be rethinking support for their pacifist Constitution. _____ "
143,"The Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is all too familiar with roadblocks: Over the last few years he has fought disputes with the governments of China and Britain as well as with the Lego Group, to name a few. This time, he’s being challenged by a much smaller group: The Washington Square Association. Mr. Ai is currently plotting a large-scale public art installation across New York City, entitled “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” The exhibition, commissioned by the Public Art Fund in celebration of its 40th anniversary, will bring 300 works centered on the theme of borders and immigration to all five boroughs. But the Washington Square Association is protesting Mr. Ai’s proposed installation in the park’s archway, as the Washington Square Park Blog first reported. The Association has reported receiving widespread complaints from the community members, who contend the installation would compromise the arch’s own artistic integrity and disrupt the annual holiday tree lighting. “This installation sets a dangerous precedent that one of New York City’s most recognized monuments and pieces of art can be decorated and co-opted for four months at a time,” Trevor Sumner, the Association’s president, wrote in an open letter addressed to the Public Art Fund. In an interview, Mr. Sumner said that although the exhibition was announced in March, the Public Art Fund waited until four weeks ago to inform the Association of its plans, and left little time for change or negotiation. “It’s ironic that the installation is called ‘Good Neighbors,’” he said, given that the Fund did not formally consult with neighbors like his association and the Washington Square Park Conservancy. The Fund did, however, meet with the members of the Manhattan Community Board No. 2 about the project. In an interview, Nicholas Baume, the director and chief curator of the Public Art Fund, said that the installation has been cleared by relevant city agencies and officials — including the Landmarks Preservation Commission — and that his organization has contacted various members of the community. “Every organization, with the exception of the Association, has been absolutely enthusiastic,” Mr. Baume said. He also said the Fund would pay for the relocation of the holiday tree and would meet with the community board on Sept. 6 to respond to questions. The installation, which renderings depict as a large cagelike structure sitting in the archway, is scheduled for display from Oct. 12 through Feb. 11. It arrives just as President Trump seeks funds for a border wall along the Mexican border. In an email interview with The New York Times in March, Mr. Ai spoke about the need for such an installation: “We are witnessing a rise in nationalism, an increase in the closure of borders, and an exclusionary attitude toward migrants and refugees, the victims of war and the casualties of globalization.” "
144,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Airstrikes in western Afghanistan killed more than a dozen civilians, according to residents and officials on Tuesday, adding to the record number of  civilians who have died this year as violence has intensified. The exact number of casualties in the airstrikes Monday afternoon in the Shindand district of Herat Province was unclear. Gaelany Farhad, a spokesman for the province’s governor, said that 13 civilians and 16 Taliban fighters had been killed in Zer Koh, a remote and mountainous area where factions of the Taliban have a foothold but have sometimes fought one another. But several residents contacted by The New York Times said that the Taliban had left the area about three hours before the strikes, and that all of the victims were civilians, many of them women and children. A spokesman for the American military in Afghanistan, which often carries out airstrikes to try to provide support to Afghan forces, said that the strikes on Monday were by the Afghan Air Force. Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, confirmed that the country’s air force had carried out the strikes, and said that 18 Taliban fighters had been killed. “There are reports of civilian casualties, and the government has appointed a delegation to investigate the incident,” Mr. Waziri said. But a senior Afghan Air Force official in the west of the country, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, denied his forces were involved. "

146,"I would like to believe that what fascinated Donald Trump about the floodwaters of Texas and pulled him to the state on Tuesday were the scenes of human suffering. I would also like to believe that I’m a dead ringer for Brad Pitt. But what Trump saw in Hurricane Harvey was a mirror of his own majesty. A storm worthy of a stud like him. A meteorological complement to one of his resorts, rallies or steaks. Something really, really big. “Even experts have said they’ve never seen one like this!” Trump marveled on Twitter, and I read exultation into that not because I’m sour on the president but because I have eyes. Also because I have a memory. He has used almost exactly those words to describe a buffet of developments in his rise and reign, always with an air of self-impressed wonder. I keep hoping against hope that a new challenge will tease out a new Trump and that if he malingers in the presidency long enough, he’ll meander in the direction of eloquence, slouch toward poetry and tumble into inspiration. Stranger things have happened. I’ll have to get back to you on what they were. But Trump’s hurricane talk and hurricane tweets were like his fair-weather fare: childishly intent on superlatives, puerilely obsessed with size, laden with boasts and lavish with discordant asides. “Thanks!” he exclaimed at the end of a tweet that was mostly about the “historic rainfall in Houston” and the “unprecedented” flooding. True, he was referring to the “spirit of the people” that he also squeezed into that 140-character nook, but his chirpy gratitude had a kooky ring. It framed him not as a leader sweating the fate of his people but as a spectator watching nature’s angriest reality show. "
147,"The fashion world has a new darling. She’s a size 4, counts Queen Elizabeth I and Marie Antoinette as her style icons and has “a flat stomach, great legs and curvy hips,” according to Vogue. She also happens to have perpetrated one of the greatest leaks of classified government material in American history. But that’s not the primary concern of the breathless media coverage afforded Chelsea Manning, born Bradley. Ms. Manning is the subject of a reverent profile and Annie Leibovitz photo spread in the September issue of Vogue, the magazine’s most important edition. The author, Nathan Heller, portrays the “graceful, blue-eyed” and unapologetic former Army private traipsing across Manhattan in a Gabriela Hearst dress and Dr. Martens, dispensing fashion tips like state secrets. (“I’ve been a huge fan of Marc Jacobs for many, many years,” she says. “He captures a kind of simplicity and a kind of beauty that I like — projecting strength through femininity.”) In a separate feature, the magazine took Ms. Manning vintage shopping as she assembled her “femme Johnny Cash” look. Not since Vogue published a piece about the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, “The Rose in the Desert,” for which it subsequently apologized and scrubbed from its website, has it celebrated such a morally compromised figure. Anna Wintour’s glossy isn’t the only fashion outlet fascinated with Ms. Manning’s transition from soldier to advocate and from male to female. “I choose my lipstick colors carefully,” she says in an exclusive for Yahoo Beauty. “I’m not just saying, ‘I like this edgy color.’ This is an expression of my humanity. And beauty, to me, is self-expression.” On Instagram, Ms. Manning certainly expresses herself emphatically, posing with her boot stomping the camera and promising to “defend against fascism by any means necessary,” the violence-endorsing slogan of the antifa movement. Ms. Manning also serves as artistic muse. On her website, the illustrator Molly Crabapple displays a florid birthday card she sent the imprisoned Ms. Manning three years ago. “We breathed the same air twice, at the courtroom in Fort Meade,” Ms. Crabapple wrote. At Greenwich Village’s Fridman Gallery, Ms. Manning is the subject of an exhibition in which the artist, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, rendered 3-D images of the former prisoner using DNA pulled from cheek swabs and hair samples she mailed from jail. Ted Hearne, the composer of an opera about Ms. Manning, “The Source,” which ran in San Francisco this year, insists she committed a “victimless crime.” That’s not true. When Ms. Manning transmitted 750,000 secret military records and State Department cables to WikiLeaks in 2010, she not only jeopardized continuing missions and disrupted American diplomacy. She also put an untold number of innocent people’s lives in danger. "

149,"When the American author James A. Michener went to Afghanistan to research his work of historical fiction, “Caravans,” it was 1955 and there were barely any roads in the country. Yet there were already Americans and Russians there, jockeying for influence. Later, the book’s Afghan protagonist would tell an American diplomat that one day both America and Russia would invade Afghanistan, and that both would come to regret it. Michener’s foresight was uncanny, but perhaps that is not terribly surprising. Afghanistan has long been called the “graveyard of empires” — for so long that it is unclear who coined that disputable term. In truth, no great empires perished solely because of Afghanistan. Perhaps a better way to put it is that Afghanistan is the battleground of empires. Even without easily accessible resources, the country has still been blessed — or cursed, more likely — with a geopolitical position that has repeatedly put it in someone or other’s way. In the 19th century there was the Great Game, when the British and Russian empires faced off across its forbidding deserts and mountain ranges. At the end of the 20th century it was the Cold War, when the Soviet and American rivalry played out here in a bitter guerrilla conflict. And in this century, it is the War on Terror and a constantly shifting Taliban insurgency, with President Trump promising a renewed military commitment. Wars of the last three “empires” to invade Afghanistan coincided with the age of photography, leaving a rich record of their triumphs and failures, and an arresting chronicle of a land that seems to have changed little in the past two centuries. Over an 80-year period, the British fought three wars in Afghanistan, occupying or controlling the country in between, and lost tens of thousands of dead along the way. Finally, exhausted by the First World War, Britain gave up in 1919 and granted Afghanistan independence. "
150,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — For the past 16 years, whenever the United States has been faced with the reality of a failing war in Afghanistan, it has blamed Pakistan. Efforts to bring freedom to the valleys of Afghanistan, this narrative claims, have been thwarted by a double-dealing “ally” that takes American aid while supporting its enemies. The narrative inadvertently casts American presidents, generals, diplomats, spies and others who have been part of the war effort as credulous dupes and casts poor light on the American military, stuck in a quagmire despite having the world’s most advanced weapons and largest financial resources. It also assumes that Pakistan has a clear interest in harming both the United States and Afghanistan. Those assumptions are wrong. Pakistan joined President George W. Bush’s war on terrorism reluctantly but proved itself an effective ally in the fight against Al Qaeda and helped decimate its ranks. That contribution was sullied by Pakistan’s failure to locate Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States established a partnership with Pakistan over a decade and a half — handing out substantial amounts of aid, sophisticated weapons and the status of major non-NATO ally. Pakistan continues to require American military hardware, and middle-class Pakistani children continue to dream of attending American universities and of working on Wall Street. The United States is the biggest market for Pakistani exports, and Pakistani-Americans form its seventh-largest diaspora group. China’s rising global status, and its explicit push for regional influence, has reduced Pakistan’s dependence on the United States, but the rumors of the demise of America’s importance in Pakistan are greatly exaggerated. Despite these factors, neither the United States nor Pakistan has gained all that it would like from the relationship. Pakistan has not been able to convince the United States of the validity of its primary interest in Afghanistan — preventing it from becoming a “proxy for India” and stemming fears of “encirclement” in Pakistan despite India’s proclamations of merely offering economic assistance to Afghanistan.

152,"President Trump has largely left management of his administration’s tax overhaul to the former Goldman Sachs executives Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin. That is making some conservatives nervous. For one, the advisers’ ambitions have already drifted. • The 15 percent corporate tax rate proposed in April is now more likely to be set at 20 to 25 percent, according to people familiar with the recent thinking. • A proposed 35 percent ceiling on the highest personal income tax rate could be shelved altogether, leaving the top rate at the current 39.6 percent. There is also the question of whether their experience in finance is enough to succeed in Mr. Trump’s Washington. • People who have attended meetings with Mr. Cohn say he is nimble with data and has a keen understanding of the economy. But he has also made comments that some lawmakers suggest betray a lack of understanding about the political process. (For instance, he reportedly joked to Senate Democrats that “Only morons pay the estate tax.”) • Mr. Mnuchin has made it clear that he has Mr. Trump’s ear and is speaking for him. He is also more careful and more reserved than Mr. Cohn — and more deferential to lawmakers. "

155,"WASHINGTON — An anti-immigration Republican who is a fervent supporter of President Trump announced on Tuesday that he will challenge Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, a move that solidifies the president’s stamp on the emerging electoral landscape for 2018. The announcement by Representative Lou Barletta gives Republicans a relatively well-known challenger to Mr. Casey as the party tries to take advantage of an electoral map that heavily favors Republicans. But it also shows the political headwinds the Republicans face: The party’s base voters remain loyal to the president and his agenda, even as the larger electorate drifts away. Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Barletta to run, and in jumping into a crowded primary field, the 61-year-old congressman buoyed Republicans from the president’s wing of the party. He announced his candidacy in a three-minute biographical campaign video in which he reprised Mr. Trump’s slogan, pledging to “make Pennsylvania and America great again.” His entry into the race comes as national Republicans are working feverishly to recruit candidates. So-called Trump Republicans are emerging in states from Florida — where the Republican governor, Rick Scott, is toying with running against Senator Bill Nelson — to Michigan, where the rock musician Robert James Ritchie, better known as Kid Rock, has dropped hints that he will challenge Senator Debbie Stabenow. Mr. Ritchie, along with Sarah Palin and the right-wing rocker Ted Nugent, paid Mr. Trump a memorable visit to the White House. But if Mr. Trump’s backers are enthusiastic about the prospect of increasing their numbers in the Senate, mainstream Republicans are terrified that candidates who cast themselves in the mold of Mr. Trump will cost them seats. In two states — Arizona and Nevada — Trump Republicans are making life exceedingly difficult for Republican incumbents by waging primary challenges against them. “The party needs to be extremely careful,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist in Kentucky who is close to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. He warned that if Congress switched hands, Democrats would move to impeach Mr. Trump. “You do not want to put yourself in a situation to give the Democrats an opening to ruin this presidency,” he said. "
156,"HOUSTON — This has been a harrowing year for the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have put down stakes in Houston. Stepped-up enforcement of immigration measures put many on edge over deportations, while Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed one of the nation’s most punitive laws against cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. President Trump has amplified his harsh line on illegal immigration and renewed his promise to build a border wall. Then came the chaos of Hurricane Harvey. Families among Houston’s estimated 600,000 undocumented immigrants – the largest number of any city in the United States except New York and Los Angeles, according to the Pew Research Center – fled their homes to escape the flooding despite their anxiety over being turned away at shelters or facing hostile immigration agents. “People were telling each other that the immigration men were coming to check our papers,” said Eloy González, 40, a truck driver who made it to the sprawling shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center. All he had were the drenched clothes he was wearing when he escaped the flooding in Pasadena, a suburb of Houston where thousands of immigrants live in the shadow of oil refineries. “The rumors are false but the fear is still there,” said Mr. González, an immigrant from northern Mexico, emphasizing that he was one of the “lucky ones” who is legally in the United States. Even as political leaders in Houston sought to reassure residents that routine immigration enforcement would not be conducted at shelters and food banks, many people fleeing their homes expressed dismay over what they described as mixed signals coming from immigration authorities in the upheaval around Hurricane Harvey. "
157,"The tax overhaul promised by President Trump and Republican congressional leaders is lugging a remarkably heavy load. The goal is not only to reduce the tax bills of corporations and small businesses, but also to stimulate investment, create jobs, increase global competitiveness and promote economic growth. Whatever the intentions, though, pushing the world’s largest and most diversified economy in any particular direction is a colossal undertaking. In addition, there is a large and sophisticated tax avoidance industry dedicated to frustrating the most carefully worded proposals. And as Mr. Trump prepares to outline his corporate tax overhaul ideas in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., economists and tax experts warn that the path is likely to be treacherous. Consider the tantalizing $2.6 trillion in global profits that American companies are keeping out of their home accounts and out of the Internal Revenue Service’s reach. A pro-growth tax policy would presumably aim not only to reach profits kept abroad as a tax dodge, but also to encourage companies to use that money to expand their business and hire more workers. That was what President George W. Bush set out to do in 2004 when he imposed what was meant to be a one-time reprieve and lowered the tax on those funds to 5.25 percent from a potential top rate of 35 percent. More than $300 billion flowed back into the United States, but despite safeguards, companies used most of the money to pay shareholder dividends or buy back stock, not to reinvest. "
158,"HOUSTON — Five days after the pummeling began — a time when big storms have usually blown through, the sun has come out, and evacuees have returned home — Tropical Storm Harvey refused to go away, battering southeast Texas even more on Tuesday, spreading the destruction into Louisiana and shattering records for rainfall and flooding. Along 300 miles of Gulf Coast, people poured into shelters by the thousands, straining their capacity; as heavy rain kept falling, some rivers were still rising and floodwater in some areas had not crested yet; and with whole neighborhoods flooded, others were covered in water for the first time. Officials cautioned that the full-fledged rescue-and-escape phase of the crisis, usually finished by now, would continue, and that they still had no way to gauge the scale of the catastrophe — how many dead, how many survivors taking shelter inland or still hunkered down in flooded communities, and how many homes destroyed. For everybody, it was another head-shaking 24 hours: • The storm made its second landfall early Wednesday morning in Louisiana, just west of the town of Cameron, the National Hurricane Center announced at 4 a.m. As Harvey moves northeast through the state scarred by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, forecasters expect it to gradually weaken and become a tropical depression by Wednesday night. • Local officials in Texas said at least 30 deaths were believed to have been caused by the storm through Tuesday, up from eight a day earlier. The dead included a Houston police officer, Sgt. Steve Perez, 60, who was caught in flooding on Sunday while trying to report for duty. “I expect that number to be significantly higher once the roads become passable,” said Erin Barnhart, the chief medical examiner for Galveston County. "
159,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis kicked President Trump’s proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military down the road, announcing that transgender service members will continue to be allowed to serve pending the results of a study. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Mattis said that he was establishing a panel of experts, serving within the Pentagon and the Homeland Security Department, whose task will be to “provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the president’s direction.” Mr. Trump announced last month in an abrupt series of tweets that transgender people would no longer be allowed to serve in the military. The Twitter messages took the Pentagon by surprise, and since then, Defense Department officials have been trying to cobble together a policy that takes into account their desire to allow currently serving transgender people to remain, while at the same time following the dictates of a commander in chief who, by most accounts, had not put a lot of study into the ramifications of his instructions. Last week, Mr. Trump signed the directive precluding transgender individuals from serving, but gave Mr. Mattis wide discretion in determining whether those already in the armed forces can continue to serve. By putting the onus on Mr. Mattis, the president appeared to open the door to allowing at least some transgender service members to remain in the military, contrary to his initial tweet that all would be disallowed. Mr. Mattis’s statement on Tuesday appeared to open that door further. “Once the panel reports its recommendations and following my consultation with the secretary of homeland security, I will provide my advice to the president concerning implementation of his policy direction,” Mr. Mattis said in his statement. “In the interim, current policy with respect to currently serving members will remain in place.” He said he will issue “interim guidance to the force concerning the president’s direction, including any necessary interim adjustments to procedures, to ensure the continued combat readiness of the force until our final policy on this subject is issued.” "
160," Emergency workers rescued many more soaked and frightened people in southeast Texas on Tuesday as floodwaters continued to rise and officials counseled patience, warning that conditions would not improve soon. The slow-moving, record-shattering tropical storm Harvey battered the region for a sixth straight day and began to move into southwest Louisiana, where it made its second landfall early Wednesday morning. With hundreds of thousands of people under evacuation orders, shelters in Houston filled to bursting with people who craved some news about the safety of their loved ones and the state of their homes. For now, the city’s focus “will continue to be on rescue,” and not on damage assessment — much less recovery — Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, said at a news conference. Here is the latest: • The storm made its second landfall just west of Cameron, La., the National Hurricane Center said at 4 a.m. Wednesday. Harvey was expected to move northeast, gradually weakening and becoming a tropical depression by Wednesday night. • Local officials in Texas have reported at least 30 confirmed and suspected flood-related deaths. • Mr. Turner imposed a curfew in Houston from midnight to 5 a.m. until further notice. • Parts of the Houston area set a record for rainfall from a single storm anywhere in the continental United States, with a top reading on Tuesday afternoon, since the storm began, of 51.88 inches. Jeffrey Lindner, a meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, said 25 to 30 percent of Harris County’s 1,800 square miles of land was flooded. "
161,"Howard Kaminsky, who honed his instincts for publishing commercially successful books at scrappy Warner Books and parlayed that sense into high-level positions at Random House and Hearst, died on Saturday in Manhattan. Mr. Kaminsky, whose authors included Richard M. Nixon and Donald J. Trump, was 77. His daughter Jessica Kaminsky said the cause was a heart attack. Brash and witty, Mr. Kaminsky developed his reputation at Warner with best sellers like “Never-Say-Diet” (1980), by Richard Simmons; “Megatrends” (1982), by John Naisbitt; sequels to “The Happy Hooker,” by the former madam Xaviera Hollander; potboiler fiction by Andrew Greeley, a Roman Catholic priest; the paperback edition of Judith Krantz’s “Scruples”; and novels by Nelson DeMille. But his best-known deal was certainly the one that Warner made with a recently disgraced former president: Barely six weeks after Nixon resigned in 1974, Mr. Kaminsky signed him to an estimated $2.5 million deal to write his memoirs. “We have an absolutely signed contract, signed by the former president,” Mr. Kaminsky told The New York Times. “His handwriting looks damn good to me. It looked like black ink; he signed it in California.” Warner subsequently sold the hardcover rights to Grosset & Dunlap, which published “RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon” in 1978. Laurence Kirshbaum, who worked at Warner in the 1970s and ′80s, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Kaminsky had been an entrepreneurial, risk-taking executive as the company grew quickly from a mass-market publisher of genre paperbacks to one that also competed heavily to sign major hardcovers. (Warner Books was part of the company that would become Time Warner.) "
162,"When is a shoe not just a shoe? When it is a pair of very high, needle-thin heels worn by the first lady of the United States on her way to the site of a natural disaster. Then it becomes a symbol for what many see as the disconnect between the Trump administration and reality; another example of the way in which this president and his family continue to define “appropriate” their own way; and an excuse for partisan name-calling. Or so became apparent Tuesday morning when President Trump and his wife left the White House to fly to Texas for a briefing on the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, and Mrs. Trump appeared on the lawn in black pegged trousers, black shades, an olive green bomber jacket — and her stilettos, now a trademark. Very much the same kind of shoes, in other words, she has been wearing since long before she joined her husband on the campaign trail. Though by the time the plane had landed Mrs. Trump looked altogether more grounded, in white sneakers and crisp white shirt, with a ponytail pulled through a black baseball cap emblazoned with the word “FLOTUS,” during her time in the air the original shoes went from being mere footwear to objects of vilification thanks to social media’s specific kind of alchemy. In response to the critical reaction, Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s communications director, emailed the following statement: “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas, and people are worried about her shoes.” "
163,"CHICAGO — The Illinois attorney general filed a lawsuit against Chicago on Tuesday, seeking a court-enforced consent decree to overhaul officer training and remedy discriminatory practices that were outlined early this year in a scathing federal critique. Mayor Rahm Emanuel had said in January, with only days remaining in Barack Obama’s presidency, that he would work toward such a consent decree. But no deal materialized after President Trump took office, leading Lisa Madigan, the state attorney general, to press the case in federal court. “In the absence of a committed Justice Department, my office will seek the reforms and support police officers need to implement safe and constitutional police practices,” said Ms. Madigan, a Democrat, who spoke of a “broken trust” between black and Hispanic Chicagoans and their police force. The lawsuit, which seeks a consent decree overseen by a judge, represents a state-level response to federal reluctance to accuse police departments of systemic wrongdoing. During Mr. Obama’s tenure, the Justice Department negotiated consent decrees in Cleveland; Ferguson, Mo.; and other cities where investigators found a pattern of police abuses. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions has spoken skeptically about such agreements and called for greater reverence and support for the police. Negotiations for federal monitoring in Chicago broke down months ago, Mr. Emanuel said. "
164,"WASHINGTON — President Trump vowed on Wednesday that he would not talk to Kim Jong-un, cooling off what has become his on-again, off-again cultivation of North Korea’s rogue dictator. But if Mr. Trump’s tweet, in which he said, “talking is not the answer!,” seemed to reignite tensions with North Korea, it also revealed a paradox in how Asia experts view the crisis. Some fear less that Mr. Trump is going to start a war with Mr. Kim than that he is going to stumble into a risky, unpredictable dialogue with him. The world’s attention has understandably focused on Mr. Trump’s saber-rattling threats against Mr. Kim — most dramatically, his promise to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea if Mr. Kim fired ballistic missiles at United States territory. But a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, these experts said, could open the door to ratifying North Korea’s nuclear status or scaling back America’s joint military exercises with South Korea. That could sunder American alliances with Japan and South Korea and play to the benefit of China, which has long advocated direct dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang. “What the North Koreans are angling for is to bring the danger and tension to a crescendo, and then to pivot to a peace proposal,” said Daniel R. Russel, who served until March as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs. “All of this is focused on pressuring the U.S. to enter direct talks with Kim on his terms. That is the big trap.” Previous presidents avoided that trap, Mr. Russel said, even if Bill Clinton briefly contemplated meeting Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il. But Mr. Trump brings a deal-maker’s swagger to the North Korea issue that his predecessors did not. He has in the past expressed a willingness to sit across a table from the willful young scion of North Korea’s ruling family. "
165,"GENEVA — The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that President Trump’s repeated denunciations of some media outlets as “fake news” could amount to incitement to violence and had potentially dangerous consequences outside the United States. The rebuke by Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, at a news conference in Geneva was an unusually forceful criticism of a head of state by a United Nations official. Mr. al-Hussein was reacting to Mr. Trump’s recent comments at a rally in Phoenix during which he spoke of “crooked media deceptions” in reports of the violent clashes at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., that resulted in the death of a counterprotester. In Phoenix, the president’s words also appeared to whip up audience hostility toward journalists. “It’s really quite amazing when you think that freedom of the press, not only a cornerstone of the Constitution but very much something the United States defended over the years, is now itself under attack from the president himself,” Mr. al-Hussein said. “It’s a stunning turnaround.” Asked for comment, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in an emailed statement, “We believe in free press and think it is an important part of our democracy, but the press also has a big responsibility to the American people to be truthful. Their job is to report the news, not create it. "
166,"KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 11 civilians were killed Wednesday in American airstrikes in southeastern Afghanistan, witnesses and officials said, the second deadly allied strike in three days to add to the country’s mounting civilian death toll. The airstrikes, near Dasht e Barai, in Logar Province, came during a joint Afghan and American military operation to pursue Taliban forces, said Salim Salih, a spokesman for the provincial governor, and it was part of President Trump’s new strategy to bolster Afghan forces combating insurgents. The allied forces had come under fire from the Taliban and had called for air support, Mr. Salih said, and the Taliban fighters sought cover in nearby homes. A delegation dispatched from the provincial capital, Pul e Alam, to the site of the battle found 11 civilians had been killed and 16 wounded, Mr. Salih said. He added that two Taliban commanders were also killed. “Three families were living in the house which was bombed; 11 people, including eight women, were killed,” Hawas Khan Kochai, a resident of the Dasht e Bari area, said by phone. “We recovered all the bodies with an excavator after several hours, but two children are still missing.” Capt. Bill Salvin, a spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan, said an American helicopter had made a “precautionary landing because of a maintenance issue” in Logar on Wednesday, but there were no casualties. He would not say whether the airstrikes occurred in the area where the helicopter had landed. “We are looking into reports of civilian casualties,” Captain Salvin said. United States military officials said recently that they had increased American air support and personnel to help train Afghan security forces since President Trump announced more than a week ago his new strategy for the war in Afghanistan. The air support is meant to bolster Afghan forces who are fighting difficult battles against a resurgent Taliban, who have regained control of portions of the country. From January through July, the United States military dropped 1,245 bombs and other ordnance in Afghanistan, over 500 more than had been dropped during the same period last year. The Afghan Air Force, too, has been increasingly active, but its bombs are harder to track. On Monday, residents and officials in Herat Province in western Afghanistan said airstrikes there had killed more than a dozen civilians. A spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense said that the strikes had been carried out by the Afghan Air Force and that 18 Taliban fighters had been killed. With the Taliban deeply entrenched in Afghan villages, and often no clear front line to the war, civilian casualties have become a recurring issue as the American-led coalition deploys more air power to help support Afghan forces trying to regain territory lost to the Taliban. During President Barack Obama’s troop surge after 2010, frequent civilian casualties caused by airstrikes were a main reason that relations deteriorated between Washington and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. "
167,"WASHINGTON — The United States has about 11,000 troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, acknowledging for the first time publicly that the total forces there are higher than formally disclosed in recent years. Previously, Defense Department officials had said 8,400 troops were in Afghanistan as part of NATO’s Resolute Support mission. An additional 2,000 American troops, which military officials have not publicly acknowledged, are in Afghanistan to help local forces conduct counterterrorism missions. The new count includes covert as well as temporary units, defense officials said. The disclosure came after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis expressed frustration with how troops in war zones were counted. To get around Obama-era restrictions on the number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, commanders sometimes resorted to ad hoc arrangements. “The secretary has determined we must simplify our accounting methodology and improve the public’s understanding of America’s military commitment in Afghanistan,” said Dana W. White, the Pentagon’s chief spokeswoman. Before Mr. Mattis sends 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan, as he is expected to do under President Trump’s new strategy for the war there, he has said he wants to know how many troops are on the ground. “The first thing I have to do is level the bubble and account for everybody who’s on the ground there now,” Mr. Mattis told reporters last week. “The idea being that we’re not going to have different buckets that we’re accounting for them in, to tell you what the total number is.” "
168,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!” That was President Trump’s latest comment, via Twitter, on rising nuclear tensions with Pyongyang. It came as the U.S. demonstrated the capabilities of its missile defense system, successfully intercepting a medium-range ballistic missile, above, off the coast of Hawaii. The British prime minister, Theresa May, on a visit to Japan to discuss a post-Brexit trade deal, called on China to strengthen its actions against North Korea, refused to rule out British military involvement and is set to discuss new sanctions with her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, today. _____ "
169,"To the Editor: “Melania Trump, Off to Texas, Finds Herself on Thin Heels,” by Vanessa Friedman (On the Runway, nytimes.com, Aug. 30), was inappropriate. I am no fan of any of the Trump family, but this column crossed the line from valid critique to nit-picking. The woman is a former model, married to a rich man and accustomed to dressing well according to high fashion standards. Her husband ran for office; she did not. The fact that she wore high heels when boarding a plane, regardless of her destination, is not newsworthy.

170,"WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — “Come in! Back here!” André Leon Talley’s voice rang out, instructing a visitor to enter his elegant white colonial here, which is surrounded by a tidy lawn and large hydrangeas. Mr. Talley, 68, did not rise from his position on a sofa, seated like a pasha amid enormous pillows, in his cozy TV-reading room with its leopard-print carpet. “This house has 11 rooms, but I only use two of them,” said Mr. Talley, the longtime Vogue fashion arbiter who, though no longer working full-time there, is still a contributing editor and does podcasts for the magazine. Mr. Talley has been keeping plenty busy. He is the subject of a new documentary, “The Gospel According to André,” directed by Kate Novack, which screens at the Toronto International Film Festival beginning on Sept 8. And he curated the exhibition “The Glamour and Romance of Oscar de la Renta,” which is scheduled to open Oct. 8 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. His home, where he has lived since 2005, is filled with art and baubles. Most of the items were gifts or auction purchases. Mr. Talley said that he particularly favored the sales at Doyle New York. In the TV-reading room, amid stacks of books on slipcovered African chairs, there is a silver ice bucket in the shape of an elephant’s head that he says Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis gave him; an original Elsa Peretti snake belt that he sometimes wears as a necklace; a satirical cartoon of himself by the designer Karl Lagerfeld; and several items he says were given to him by the shoe designer Manolo Blahnik, including Mr. Blahnik’s drawing of a shoe. "
171,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has given Congress a point-by-point rebuttal of a dossier alleging that he has deep ties to Russian officials — an effort to clear his name as the Justice Department and congressional committees investigate Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s election. Mr. Cohen encouraged lawmakers to investigate those who paid for the salacious 35-page dossier, which surfaced online early this year and alleges that President Trump and his campaign conspired with Russia in the November election. The dossier, compiled by a retired British spy, portrays Mr. Cohen as a central figure in the conspiracy. In an eight-page letter to the House Intelligence Committee, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen offered a full-throated rejection of any suggestion that Mr. Cohen was involved in an effort to work with Russia to disrupt the election. “We have not uncovered a single document that would in any way corroborate the dossier’s allegations regarding Mr. Cohen, nor do we believe that any such document exists,” wrote the lawyer, Stephen M. Ryan. “Mr. Cohen vehemently denies the claims made in the dossier about him, which are false and remain wholly unsubstantiated.” The letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, follows a similar denial by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who spoke to congressional investigators in July. "
172,"Elected to lead the biggest city in the nation, Mayor Bill de Blasio often seems to hunger for a brighter spotlight. He tried to shape the debate in the last presidential election, only to be spurned by candidates in his own party. He flew to Germany in July to speak at a rally during a meeting of world leaders, only to be criticized for leaving New York hours after a police officer was murdered. Now he has seized hold of the national debate over the removal of confederate monuments by ordering a review of all possible “symbols of hate” in the city — once again grabbing national attention while simultaneously putting himself in a tricky situation. He has been peppered with questions about how far the review will go to cleanse New York of potentially offensive figures and whether this or that sculpture should stand or fall. Some see him as playing into the hands of President Donald J. Trump, who warned that the push to remove Confederate monuments could go too far. “He’s going to create some kind of star chamber to see who’s politically correct and who’s not,” said Kenneth T. Jackson, a historian who edited The Encyclopedia of New York City, echoing other historians who have cautioned against the rush to remove statues and monuments. “It’s almost like McCarthyism of a reverse sort: Let’s find out who has got something in their closet that they should be ashamed of. I don’t think we need this,” he said. Ulysses S. Grant — commemorated in at least two statues in Brooklyn and a monumental tomb in Upper Manhattan — issued an order to expel Jews from three states during the Civil War. Horatio Seymour — a New York politician whose portrait is displayed in City Hall — ran as the Democratic presidential candidate against Grant in 1868, heading up a racially-charged campaign in which some of his supporters used the slogan, “This is a White Man’s Country; Let White Men Rule.” The Duke of York, namesake of New York City, was involved in the slave trade.

173,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Tropical Storm Harvey shifted its wrath to areas east of Houston, hitting the Beaumont-Port Arthur area of Texas with record-breaking rainfall and devastating floods. At least 38 deaths have been reported throughout the region. Among the victims was a woman who was swept into a canal and drowned, while her child survived by clinging to her. This video shows the emotional and physical toll on storm survivors. Our journalists are fanning out to cover the storm and its aftermath. Here’s a collection of the most powerful photographs, (like the one above, of an intersection in northeastern Houston), and a guide to our coverage. Access is free. _____ "
174,"As a brutal storm continues to pound the Gulf Coast, tens of thousands of homeowners are turning to the government for help in repairing and rebuilding. Much of the aid they receive will require taking on debt — an unpleasant surprise to those who may lack the income to pay it back. And as victims of past disasters can attest, that aid may be cumbersome to obtain, insufficient to cover the cost of reconstruction, and take years to fully pay out. Government officials emphasize that the federal programs are meant to supplement, not replace, insurance and other financial buffers against catastrophe. But even more than victims of other disasters, those who have lost homes and businesses to what was once Hurricane Harvey are likely to need substantial help. More than 40,000 households affected by the storm have so far been approved for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to Mark J. Peterson, an agency spokesman. Flooding inflicted much of the storm’s damage, but few in the affected areas have flood insurance — and even those who do will often face rebuilding costs exceeding what their insurance will cover. Jamette Riley Moyer of Rockport, Tex., a coastal town near Corpus Christi, is among those navigating the federal aid labyrinth. The storm smashed her rental home into a pile of timber and shattered furniture, destroying nearly everything she owned. "
175,"As Tropical Storm Harvey barrels down the Gulf Coast and talk of a disaster-relief bill begins, Republican lawmakers from Texas are rushing to defend their 2013 votes against spending $50.5 billion on Hurricane Sandy relief. Senator John Cornyn’s spokesman, Drew Brandewie, tweeted on Friday that the senator “voted for Sandy relief, just not the package that became law.” He said the final bill included “extraneous” money for items unrelated to disaster relief. (Mr. Cornyn voted for an amendment that would have provided about $24 billion in funding.) On Tuesday, in an interview with NBC’s Katy Tur, Senator Ted Cruz put a specific number on unrelated spending in the 2013 legislation: “Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy.” And on Wednesday morning, Representative Bill Flores echoed criticism of the Sandy relief bill during a local radio interview. Congress “went crazy with it, packing it full of pork,” he said. “Most people don’t realize that the $51 billion bill included spending for almost all 50 states” as well as Guam, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa. But these claims are hyperbolic and misleading. Of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one — $195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services — were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required. The spokesman also pointed to a Congressional Quarterly analysis that said that $17 billion in the bill went toward immediate aid for Sandy victims while $33.5 billion was for “near- and long-term assistance and mitigation” of damage from future disasters. "
176,"Even before the damage from Hurricane Harvey is tallied, big corporations are breaking out their checkbooks. Chevron, an energy giant with several offices in the Houston area, pledged $1 million to post-Harvey disaster relief efforts. So did Exxon Mobil and Dow Chemical, two companies with facilities hit by the storm. Companies in less regional industries also donated: Amazon offered to match $1 million in donations to the American Red Cross, while Verizon promised $10 million. Walmart, which took a front-line role in the clean-up after Hurricane Katrina, sent truckloads of emergency supplies to the affected area. In all, corporations have pledged more than $65 million to help clean up the wreckage from Harvey, according to a Wednesday morning estimate by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. That is an impressive figure, and a sign that corporations are capable of stepping up in a crisis. Hurricane Harvey may be one of the costliest natural disasters in American history, according to initial forecasts. Moody’s Analytics has estimated that the storm’s damage may be as much as $50 billion, though it is hard to know at such an early stage. As Houston recovers, its business community should feel especially compelled to help. That is partly because Houston and the surrounding area, as well as the state of Texas, have been generous to big business in recent years, showering companies with tax breaks, subsidies and other perks in an effort to keep them happy and create new jobs. Houston has benefited from the presence of large corporations, adding thousands of jobs and becoming one of the fastest-growing cities in America. But those companies have benefited, too — sometimes to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The help Houston has given businesses over the years raises an important question: What is the moral obligation of big companies — especially those that have benefited from a region’s largess — after such a major disaster? "
177,"WASHINGTON — A Trump administration official said Wednesday that the administration wanted to stabilize health insurance markets, but refused to say if the government would promote enrollment this fall under the Affordable Care Act or pay for the activities of counselors who help people sign up for coverage. The official also declined to say whether the administration would continue paying subsidies to insurance companies to compensate them for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. Without the subsidies, insurers say, they would sharply increase premiums. The administration, the official suggested, will do the minimum necessary to comply with the law, which Mr. Trump has called “an absolute disaster” and threatened to let collapse. “I don’t think we can force people to sign up for the program,” the official said. The official said the Trump administration had not set any numerical goals for sign-ups under the health care law, and the official did not know if the administration would do so. President Barack Obama used such goals to motivate a small army of counselors, “navigators” and assistants who helped millions of people sign up for insurance in the last four years. About 20 million people have gained coverage, through private insurance policies and Medicaid. Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to repeal the health law, but their efforts have stalled, with no consensus on how much of the law to scrap and how much to preserve. The Trump administration official spoke to about 20 journalists on Wednesday on the condition of anonymity, evidently because major decisions had not been made. The fifth annual open enrollment period, when people can sign up for insurance or switch plans, will run from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, about half as long as the last one. "
178,"Before it began to rain in Houston last week, the spectacularly wealthy pastor Joel Osteen could have opened up his megachurch to serve as a logistics center. He could have announced that evacuees were welcome to take shelter there when Hurricane Harvey landed. Instead he wrote tweets like “God’s got this” and “don’t drift into doubt and fear … stay anchored to hope.” Only a couple of his posts on Twitter offered “prayers.” On Sunday, Mr. Osteen’s church announced that it was inaccessible because of “flooding.” But intrepid journalists proved otherwise. After Mr. Osteen was humiliated on social media, he finally opened the 16,800-seat church to the public on Tuesday. When asked about the delay, Mr. Osteen said that “the city didn’t ask us to become a shelter.” President Trump, too, revealed his morally bankrupt soul during the storm when he said that he timed his pardon of the racist former sheriff Joe Arpaio to coincide with the hurricane’s landfall because he assumed that it would garner “far higher” TV ratings than usual. Mr. Trump did visit Texas, but there was apparently no mention of dead or displaced Texans, and no expressions of sympathy. Mr. Trump and Mr. Osteen are mirrors of each other. Both enjoy enormous support among evangelicals, yet they lack a command of biblical scripture. Both are among the 1 percent. Natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey are the worst kind of crises for people like Mr. Trump and Mr. Osteen, who purvey their own versions of the prosperity gospel. This is a belief that says if you think positively and make affirmations, God will reward you with financial success and good health. If you don’t, you may face unemployment, poverty or sickness. (Mr. Trump in particular always speaks in laudatory terms about himself and his companies.) "
179,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration notified Congress on Wednesday that it was putting $255 million in military assistance to Pakistan into the equivalent of an escrow account that Islamabad can only access if it does more to crack down on internal terror networks launching attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. The dueling messages sent to Pakistan — promising aid but attaching strings if the country’s counterterror efforts fall short — are part of an increasingly confrontational turn in an alliance that has long been strained. The United States has provided Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid since 2002. But the annual funding has declined in recent years as Washington became increasingly disenchanted with Pakistan’s quiet support for the Haqqani network and the Taliban, whose attacks have been responsible for the deaths of American troops in Afghanistan. Still, American officials have long recognized that Pakistan has tried to crack down on terror groups, and plays an important role in facilitating supply shipments to the United States military in Afghanistan. Last week, in announcing his new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, President Trump excoriated Pakistan. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” Mr. Trump said. "
180,"HOUSTON — A federal judge in San Antonio on Wednesday blocked Texas from enforcing its ban on so-called sanctuary cities, questioning the constitutionality of a law that has pitted Republican state leaders against several Democratic-leaning cities. The judge’s ruling was only temporary, and prevents the law from taking effect on Friday while a suit against it goes forward. But the decision, which Texas said it would appeal, served as a legal blow to one of the toughest state-issued immigration laws in the country and puts the brakes on a measure backed by the Trump administration that critics had called anti-Latino. The law has become so divisive that it served as the backdrop of a shoving match at the Texas Capitol between Hispanic Democratic lawmakers and their white Republican colleagues. The law, known as Senate Bill 4 or S.B. 4, prohibits cities and counties from adopting policies that limit immigration enforcement, allows police officers to question the immigration status of anyone they detain or arrest and threatens officials who violate the law with fines, jail time and removal from office. It also directs local officials to cooperate with so-called immigration detainer requests, which allow foreign-born detainees to be transferred to federal custody after they are released from state or local custody. A number of the state’s biggest cities, including Houston, Austin, San Antonio and Dallas, all of which are run by Democrats, joined a lawsuit against Texas seeking to strike down the law, which was passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, in May. In his ruling issued Wednesday evening, the judge, Orlando L. Garcia of United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, granted a preliminary injunction preventing the law from taking effect while the suit continues. Judge Garcia appeared to block three provisions of the law, including one that stated that local government entities and officials may not “adopt, enforce or endorse” any policy limiting the enforcement of immigration laws.

181,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. “Houston’s perfect storm is coming — and it’s not a matter of if but when,” journalists wrote, a year and a half ago. “Why isn’t Texas ready?” The story was a joint project of The Texas Tribune, an excellent local publication, and ProPublica, the deservedly well-regarded national group. Headlined “Hell and High Water,” it exposed the lack of preparedness, and downright denial, in Houston about flood damage. The project mixes maps and text, and you can dip into it briefly or dig into the details. “We’re sitting ducks. We’ve done nothing,” Phil Bedient, a Rice University professor and storm-surge expert, says in the story. “We’ve done nothing to shore up the coastline, to add resiliency ... to do anything.” The article isn’t perfectly clairvoyant — no story is. It falls into the common trap of exaggerating the economic effects of a news development that’s bad for other reasons. But the story offered an important — and, sadly, unheeded — message: Even though it’s possible to mitigate the effects of extreme weather, we’re instead making choices that aggravate them. To give them their deserved credit, that story is by Neena Satija, Kiah Collier, Al Shaw and Jeff Larson. In Slate, Henry Grabar points out that grasslands around the city could have absorbed some of the nearly 52 inches of rain that have fallen so far — had they not been cut by development. To make matters worse, he writes, officials “encouraged development in low-lying, flood-prone areas without regard to future risk.” At CityLab, Tanvi Misra notes that the failure to prepare for floods often hurts low-income, minority communities the most. These communities “are most vulnerable to flooding, or near petrochemical plants and Superfund sites that can overflow during the storm. This is especially true for Houston.” So far, Harvey has submerged an area greater than 15 times the size of Manhattan. “It’s basically impossible for any of us to get our heads around the scope of just how much damage there’s going to be when this is over,” MSNBC’s Chris Hayes tweeted (although these maps, from The Times, give us a good idea). On a more uplifting note, Time’s Maya Rhodan has the backstory of the Houston sheriff’s deputy whose helping of two small children ricocheted around social media. In The Times, Frank Bruni writes, of Trump’s Texas trip: “The weather around him changes. The weather inside him doesn’t. It’s a warm bath of self-regard — the biggest ever, I’d wager — and it overrides everything else.” "
182,"The current recovery has entered its ninth year — long by economic standards — but it is showing some unexpected vigor. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter of the year, better than initially estimated, and a substantial acceleration over the first quarter’s lackluster 1.2 percent pace. The revised figure is still well below President Trump’s goal of 4 percent growth, but it is the economy’s best quarterly showing in two years. Mr. Trump talked up the latest figures in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., laying out his plans for tax overhaul. Despite nearly uniform skepticism from mainstream economists, he insisted that much faster economic growth was within reach. “I happen to be one who thinks we can go much higher than 3 percent,” the president said. “There is no reason why we should not.” There are several reasons that his goal is probably far-fetched, namely the country’s aging work force and slower population growth than in the past. Combine that with low productivity growth, and hitting Mr. Trump’s target begins to look like a Sisyphean challenge. "
183,"To the Editor: Re “Trump, in Texas, Says His Goal Is the Best Relief Effort Ever” (news article, Aug. 30): Visiting Texas in the midst of Hurricane Harvey, President Trump said: “We want to do it better than ever before. We want to be looked at in five years, in 10 years from now as, this is the way to do it.” But Mr. Trump is doing his best to create more such disasters, by dismantling every effort of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Power Plan to move us out of the fossil-fuel economy into a renewable-energy world of millions of good jobs. His pro-coal, pro-oil policy intensifies such storms by supercharging the air with carbon dioxide and methane, heating our Earth, and overfilling clouds with water vapor that then falls as unprecedented floods of rain. Doing it better would require him to reverse direction. Otherwise he will be known in five, 10, 50, 100 years as the person most responsible for bringing utter disaster on America and all humanity.

PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: Our president, after visiting the catastrophic Harvey scene, is on his way to Missouri to push for tax relief for our wealthiest and least needy citizens. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people on the Gulf Coast will need long-term temporary housing, temporary schools, food, clothing, electricity, air-conditioning, medical care, and the list goes on. It would be wonderful if he could decide to change his priorities, to be a caring president. I could also win the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries in the same week. DAVID A. LOOMAR, NEW YORK To the Editor: President Trump seeks to appear presidential amid the incalculable suffering and devastation caused by Harvey, while his budget would cruelly slash funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His policies, if unchecked, will also destine us to react to increasing cataclysmic weather events rather than being proactive. Proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including a draconian 32 percent cut to its main ocean, weather and climate research center, tell the sad tale louder than his command center visit to Texas. MARY O’CONNOR, NEW YORK To the Editor: In “The Devastation in Houston” (editorial, Aug. 29) you aptly describe “how unchecked urban sprawl and paving over of wetlands and prairies have increased the risk posed by floods.” So let’s see if our builder-in-chief president can direct the Texas rebuilding effort with the smartest infrastructure necessary to avoid another flood catastrophe. That begins with the understanding that conserving our coastal wetlands and creating urban parks are vital when planning housing developments and industrial parks. STEVE COHEN, NEW YORK "
184,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California, home to nearly 40 million people, has commonly been declared ungovernable. That’s why some people think we should carve it up. In contrast to the so-called Calexit movement, which aspires to secession, these proponents see California’s salvation in greater local autonomy within the union. A few years ago, a bid to create six states out of California drew wide media attention but ultimately fizzled. Now, the architect of that effort, a tech billionaire named Timothy C. Draper, is back with another idea: three Californias. He submitted paperwork that would put the question before voters in 2018. “No one can argue that California’s government is doing a good job governing or educating or building infrastructure for its people,” Mr. Draper said in an email. “And it doesn’t matter which party is in place.” "
185,"SPRINGFIELD, Mo. — President Trump on Wednesday pitched a sweeping tax overhaul that he said would unleash the American economy and help ordinary people, promising that a large corporate tax cut and trims to individual income tax rates would boost the middle class. The president wrapped his message in the populist rhetoric that powered his presidential campaign. But he described a plan that on its surface appears to offer relatively little to ordinary Americans, granting instead huge tax cuts — “the biggest ever,” he said — to corporations and their shareholders. Mr. Trump gave few specifics on Wednesday beyond a goal of slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, down from 35 percent, and eliminating “loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests,” a reference to his call to scrap some itemized deductions in the code. The politically difficult legislation has yet to be drafted despite months of private negotiations among members of the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Time is running out for enactment of the bill before year’s end, and the White House is keenly aware that if Mr. Trump fails to deliver his promised tax cuts, he will emerge from his first year in office devoid of any major legislative accomplishments. “This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hard-working Americans,” the president said as he stood in front of a giant American flag at the Loren Cook Company, a fan manufacturer. “And I don’t want to be disappointed by Congress.” “Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers,” he added. Many economists believe it is not that simple. They argue that large corporate tax cuts would do relatively little — particularly in the near term — to boost wages or create jobs. Instead, they would boost corporate profits and benefit the wealthiest Americans who own the most corporate stock. There is little evidence that large tax cuts will prompt American corporations to invest more; they are already sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash. "
186,"“Quit tweeting.” “Chill out, man.” “Listen to women.” Those were the admonishments to President Trump from a 12-person focus group, an effort on Tuesday night in Pittsburgh to test the mood of registered voters after the president’s first seven months in office. The focus group, conducted by Peter D. Hart, a veteran pollster, was commissioned by Emory University and featured five Democrats, four independents and three Republicans. Five voted for Mr. Trump, six for Hillary Clinton and one for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Mr. Hart asked the group members, seven men and five women, how they felt about the direction of the country, and the response was largely pessimistic. One man said the country was “more divisive” now than it has been since the Civil War. Only two additional people shared that view. But in general, the group expressed disappointment and even exasperation with how Mr. Trump has handled his time in office. “He has no social skills,” said Bart Morgan, an independent who voted for Ms. Stein. “It’s almost like he never was taught the right way to act.” “His learning curve has been a little disappointing,” said David Turner, a Republican who said his impulse was still to give Mr. Trump and other officials more of a chance so early in a term. "
187,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a statement condemning what it called North Korea’s “outrageous actions” in launching a ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday and launching three missiles on Saturday. But there was no suggestion that the council was ready to toughen sanctions. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called the latest launching a “curtain-raiser” and warned of more missile tests in the Pacific. President Trump said in an earlier statement that “all options are on the table.” And Japanese citizens, some of whom received a beeping alert on their cellphones just four minutes after the projectile was fired, may be rethinking support for their pacifist Constitution. Above, an evacuation drill in Wajima, Japan, on Wednesday. _____ "
188,"In 1941, shortly after Pearl Harbor pulled the United States into World War II, a group of volunteer American aviators led by Gen. Claire Chennault known as the Flying Tigers fought Japanese aggression in China. They were so successful that many people believe they were decisive in holding back Japan, eventually leading to its defeat. Although they were paid volunteers rather than members of the American military, they were not denigrated as “mercenaries.” The Flying Tigers — who now would be called contractors — fought for China and the United States and, like paid American contractors in theaters of war today, fought as bravely and patriotically as American soldiers. As policy makers in Washington decide what to do in Afghanistan, they should keep the Flying Tigers in mind. Such a force could be just the solution Afghanistan needs. The reasons are as obvious as they are compelling: Last week, President Trump announced his “new strategy” to end the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history. But in promising to add more dollars to the more than $800 billion already spent, not to mention more American troops to the thousands already dead or wounded, President Trump’s strategy is sadly more old than new. Fortunately, it is not too late to alter the course. This spring, as Afghanistan policy was debated in Washington, the president asked for fresh options to end the war honorably. Faced with two choices — pulling out entirely or staying the course — I argued strongly for a new approach, a third path that would put in place a light footprint of American Special Forces, as well as contractors to work with Afghans to focus on the goal that Americans really care about: denying America’s enemies the sanctuary they used to plan the Sept. 11 attacks. "
189,"I’m just back from visiting all of our key air bases in Iraq, Afghanistan and along the Persian Gulf, and I find myself wrestling with two stark contrasts: the contrast between what is happening there in the air and what is happening on the ground, and the contrast between the decency of the U.S. military personnel fighting this war and how unworthy Donald Trump — who has become our divider in chief — is to be their commander in chief. The first contrast was summed up in two wall-size digital maps at our Kuwait-based command center for the war on ISIS. One map displays every military aircraft the U.S. has in the skies over Syria and Iraq (as well as Russian, Syrian and Iranian aircraft) pounding ISIS targets. There are little symbols for B-52s, U-2s, F-16s, F-22s, F-15s, MQ-9 Reapers and jet refuelers. It is a giant aerial armada, a flying killer symphony orchestrated by the U.S. Air Force. The other map uses different colors to depict the disposition of forces on the ground. It looks like a broken kaleidoscope. Our U.S. military briefer explained: Purple is for Syrian regime forces and their Russian, Hezbollah and Iranian allies; light green shows Syrian Kurds and dark green Iraqi Kurds; light blue represents “disciplined” Iraqi Shiite militias, while the “undisciplined” ones are another shade. Pro-Turkish Sunni militias have their own color, as do the pro-American Syrian Sunni militias. ISIS fighters are another color, and the official Iraqi security forces are a different one still. As our briefer noted dryly: “Not everyone here has exactly the same endgame in mind.” This is our war in the Middle East today in two maps: “Star Wars” meets “Game of Thrones.” You can’t look at these two screens without thinking about the power that comes from our ability to make one out of many — or the power that is lost to a society like Syria or Iraq that needs an iron fist to make its many into one, and when that fist is removed, how the society fractures into small shards. So you can’t help but get upset seeing our own president deliberately dividing our country between his tribe and the rest of us — undermining what truly makes America great. Fortunately, though, you also can’t help but be buoyed by the young men and women you meet visiting our key air bases in the war effort. They remind you what America is on its best days — still resistant to Trump’s divisive dog whistles. "
190,"“The arithmetic for us is simple,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said on CNBC in May. If Congress were to cut the 35 percent tax on corporate profits to 20 percent, he declared, “I know exactly what AT&T would do — we’d invest more” in the United States. Every $1 billion in tax savings would create 7,000 well-paying jobs, Mr. Stephenson went on to say. The correlation between lower corporate taxes and more jobs, he assured viewers, runs “very, very tight.” As Congress prepares to take up tax legislation this fall, including an effort to reduce the corporate tax rate, this bold jobs claim merits examination. Notably, it comes from the chief executive of a company that’s already paying comparatively little in federal taxes. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, AT&T enjoyed an effective tax rate of just 8 percent between 2008 and 2015, despite recording a profit in the United States each year, by exploiting tax breaks and loopholes. (The company argues that it pays significant taxes, at a rate close to 34 percent in recent years, but that includes deferred taxes and state and local levies.) Despite the enormous savings AT&T has realized, the company has been downsizing. Although it hires thousands of people a year, the company, by our analysis at the Institute for Policy Studies, reduced its total work force by nearly 80,000 jobs between 2008 and 2016, accounting for acquisitions and spinoffs each involving more than 2,000 workers. The company has also spent $34 billion repurchasing its own stock since 2008, according to our institute report, a maneuver that artificially inflates the value of a company’s shares. This is money that could have gone toward research and development or hiring. "
191,"A
s for so many other people, election night did not pan out quite the way Robert Stryk expected. Stryk began the night slumped in a Morton’s steakhouse in downtown Washington, tuning out the guests at his watch party to type out the campaign announcement of a buddy who — in the wake of Donald J. Trump’s all-but-certain defeat and the Republican Party implosion that was sure to follow — planned to make a long-shot bid for chairman of the Republican National Committee. He ended it by closing down the bar at the Mayflower Hotel, and after the race was called, giddily marching down Connecticut Avenue with his friends as they chanted, ‘‘Make America Great Again!’’ Stryk, who owned a lobbying firm so small it didn’t actually have an office, spent most of his time in California and owned a small vineyard in Oregon, and he had helped out the Trump campaign as a sort of informal West Coast hand. He was still reveling in Trump’s upset win two nights later, over a bottle of wine on the patio of the Four Seasons in Georgetown, when a chocolate Lab padded over to his table to sniff his crotch. Stryk and the dog’s owner got to talking about wine and cigars and finally, like most of the country, about Trump. It turned out that she worked for New Zealand’s Embassy in Washington. New Zealand’s prime minister still hadn’t connected with the new president-elect, she told Stryk — a diplomatic and political embarrassment. Stryk cocked an eye across the table. ‘‘What if I said I could get you the number of someone to call the president?’’ he asked her. The following afternoon, Stryk found himself in a cab, headed for a meeting with New Zealand’s ambassador to the United States, Tim Groser. Stryk was more than a little nervous. On the way over, he called a friend named Stuart Jolly, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who ran Trump’s field operation during the Republican primary and spent election night with Stryk at Morton’s. Jolly reached out to someone he knew in the Trump high command and delivered a cell number, but Stryk didn’t know if it would actually work. At the embassy, Groser invited him in, uncorked a bottle of pinot noir and called the prime minister to pass along the number. A week later, President-elect Trump was finally able to accept a congratulatory phone call. But even before the call went through, plans and possibilities were blooming in Stryk’s mind. ‘‘I said to myself: ‘This could be very, very interesting,’ ’’ he told me when I first met him this spring. ‘‘ ‘The world’s going to change.’ ’’ Stryk, who grew up in Arizona, had bounced around the minor leagues of politics for most of his adult life. At 41, he has the frenetic energy of a serial entrepreneur and the motley résumé to match. After dropping out of college to intern on Capitol Hill, Stryk wrote voter-contact scripts for a Republican P.R. firm, helped start a political job-listing website and eventually opened his own Beltway lobbying shop, Sonoran Policy Group. The firm almost collapsed in 2009, after Stryk tried to acquire a troubled Maryland-based security-guard business. Stryk decamped to California, owing thousands of dollars in back rent, and reinvented S.P.G. as a procurement and political-consulting business. He traded tequila shots with the California congressman Dana Rohrabacher, ran for mayor of a town in Napa Valley, handled P.R. for an arms dealer accused of smuggling weapons to Libya — the case was dropped last fall — and helped clients sell the government everything from flashlights to missile-guidance software. By the time he hooked up with the Trump campaign, Stryk had hustled his way to a good living, and he knew his way around Washington. But he was no one’s idea of a Beltway insider. When the phone call to Trump went through, Stryk saw the geography of a new world forming before his eyes. Interests that spent millions of dollars studying Washington and shaping it to their liking had been taken totally by surprise by Trump’s win. The rules had changed, and no one was sure what the new ones were. For Stryk, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for. As he saw it, the lobbying old guard — the guys that threw down black Amex cards at Joe’s Crab and sent fat quarterly bills to clients they barely did any work for — were on the defensive. New people would have a chance. People like Stryk. "
192,"It’s admirable that Americans’ first instinct when disaster occurs is to open their wallets and volunteer their time. Since this has never been a nation that relies wholly on government to take care of those in need, citizens’ first impulse is to pitch in, whatever their politics or faith. As the first images of suffering emerged from Houston, the flow of cash, food, clothing and rescue equipment into Texas seemed to rise in tandem with the floodwaters. Yet it’s inevitable that not all this largess will reach Harvey’s victims, or be well spent. For that reason, it is important for Americans to be as discerning with their money as they are philanthropic, avoiding scams and asking for greater accountability from trusted charities like the American Red Cross. The Red Cross is the flagship of charitable institutions. It is also a master of promotion. After every disaster, its ads, celebrity testimonials and distinctive logo are everywhere, beseeching Americans to donate blood and money. This week Barack Obama became the Red Cross’s latest Twitter pitchman, urging Americans to make a $10 donation by texting “HARVEY.” During President Trump’s televised update on the response in Texas on Tuesday, a Red Cross representative sat front and center. Corporations find donations to the Red Cross a ready way to demonstrate they care: The organization has already raised millions from JPMorgan, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Dow Chemical and others for its Harvey efforts. This is all to the good, assuming the money flows to the right places. But after years of media reports documenting the Red Cross’s disaster relief failures — including after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy and the Haiti earthquake — some Americans instead are giving to smaller, local charities with a track record in Texas. A 2015 investigation by ProPublica and NPR documented the Red Cross’s glaring failure to account for how it spent the $488 million it raised in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake in 2010, including such basics as how many people were assisted and how much money was spent on overhead. "
193,"WASHINGTON — In the hours after European antitrust regulators levied a record $2.7 billion fine against Google in late June, an influential Washington think tank learned what can happen when a wealthy tech giant is criticized. The New America Foundation has received more than $21 million from Google; its parent company’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt; and his family’s foundation since the think tank’s founding in 1999. That money helped to establish New America as an elite voice in policy debates on the American left and helped Google shape those debates. But not long after one of New America’s scholars posted a statement on the think tank’s website praising the European Union’s penalty against Google, Mr. Schmidt, who had been chairman of New America until 2016, communicated his displeasure with the statement to the group’s president, Anne-Marie Slaughter, according to the scholar. The statement disappeared from New America’s website, only to be reposted without explanation a few hours later. But word of Mr. Schmidt’s displeasure rippled through New America, which employs more than 200 people, including dozens of researchers, writers and scholars, most of whom work in sleek Washington offices where the main conference room is called the “Eric Schmidt Ideas Lab.” The episode left some people concerned that Google intended to discontinue funding, while others worried whether the think tank could truly be independent if it had to worry about offending its donors. Those worries seemed to be substantiated a couple of days later, when Ms. Slaughter summoned the scholar who wrote the critical statement, Barry Lynn, to her office. He ran a New America initiative called Open Markets that has led a growing chorus of liberal criticism of the market dominance of telecom and tech giants, including Google, which is now part of a larger corporate entity known as Alphabet, for which Mr. Schmidt serves as executive chairman. Ms. Slaughter told Mr. Lynn that “the time has come for Open Markets and New America to part ways,” according to an email from Ms. Slaughter to Mr. Lynn. The email suggested that the entire Open Markets team — nearly 10 full-time employees and unpaid fellows — would be exiled from New America. "

Five days after making its first landfall in Texas, the hurricane-turned-tropical storm hit Louisiana early this morning. It’s a state where memories of Hurricane Katrina are still fresh. Here’s a quick guide to what’s happening. At least 30 people have died in Texas, and officials cautioned that the rescue-and-evacuate phase was still underway. Our maps track the storm’s destructive path and the extent of flooding. Water is still rising in some areas. Check here for the latest, and here for how to help the victims.

195,"I started at The New York Times in April and quickly learned that by Times standards I would probably be “new” for quite some time. Almost every person I met seemed to have been here for 10 or 20 years — often even more. Their expertise has been honed over hundreds of interviews and investigations; they have traveled the world and the country reporting on everything from the Ken doll’s new look to tax reform to the dire situation in Venezuela. Luckily for me, their knowledge drives my weekly Newsbook column, in which I write timely reading lists to help readers understand issues in the news. Newsbook, which includes short summaries of three books on a central theme and runs online and on Page A3 of the paper, is part of a larger effort by the Books desk to offer more service-oriented content. News articles often raise many questions about history and context, so I ask: What events or issues need illuminating? I try to figure out what readers want to know — what I want to know — and the books that will best answer those questions. Significant cultural moments like Wimbledon or Gay Pride Month often warrant a column as well. That brings me to the most common question about my job: Do you read all the books you recommend? In short, no. I am sure there are people who can read three to six books a week, but sadly I am not one of them. It would take me months to read the number of books I consider weekly. So I rely heavily on my colleagues: When I wrote a literary primer to the Great American Eclipse, for instance, I reached out to Nicholas St. Fleur, a science reporter who sent me the reading list he had compiled while preparing for his trip to Carbondale, Ill., where he witnessed and reported on the longest instance of totality in the United States. In the throes of President Trump’s planning to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, I emailed Coral Davenport, who has covered energy and environmental policy since 2006, for suggestions of the best books on climate change. Although it is ideal to draw on reporters’ expertise to inform my column, it is not always possible, so I have become intimately acquainted with the Times archives. I spend hours reading old reviews — in The Times and other publications — as well as skimming the books themselves to get a grasp of the writer’s argument and what it adds to the zeitgeist. "
196,"Partisanship and contentiousness typically dominate Washington news. In the clamor, it’s easy to overlook the national consensus on a significant issue: the need to revitalize America’s most crucial security alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I was nominated as United States ambassador to NATO by President Trump in late June. As I made my rounds of congressional offices before my confirmation hearing, I found near unanimity from Republicans and Democrats alike on NATO’s future. There is no appreciable difference of views among the president, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and senators of either party on the need to revitalize NATO so it can meet today’s security needs while maintaining the fundamental principle of Article 5 of the organization’s founding treaty — that an attack on one is an attack on all. There is a strong consensus that a renaissance of NATO offers the best hope to unite our Western allies against threats including intolerable Russian aggression in Ukraine, international terrorism, nuclear and missile capacities of rogue nations, and efforts to wipe out religious and individual freedoms around the globe. NATO is the most successful alliance in world history. It was founded on the conviction that a potent joint effort by the democracies of Europe and North America was the most effective way to deter and counter Communist expansion and prevent World War III. That idea held the alliance together more than 40 years, through many changes of government, and it won the Cold War. "
197,"United Technologies is finally close to buying the airplane parts maker Rockwell Collins, according to The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times. If the purchase price comes in at around $140 a share, as the newspapers report and that DealBook hears is roughly accurate, it would value Rockwell Collins at roughly $22.7 billion. That would make the deal the biggest ever in the defense and aerospace industry. Here are the five largest acquisitions thus far in the sector, as compiled by Thomson Reuters: • United Technologies’ $18 billion takeover of Goodrich in 2011 • Boeing’s $15.3 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas in 1996 • British Aerospace’s $12.9 billion acquisition of Marconi Electronic Systems in 1999 • Raytheon’s $9.5 billion takeover of Hughes Aircraft in 1997 • Lockheed Martin’s $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky in 2015 A Rockwell deal could be announced as soon as next week, The Journal and The F.T. say. But talks are ongoing and the timing of an agreement could shift. Related reading: • A deal would probably not have antitrust hurdles because there is little overlap in what the companies produce. But it would need to soothe worried customers, according to the Lex column in The F.T. Problems with United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney engines have caused delays and canceled orders. • Bloomberg Gadfly argues that the deal only makes sense in the context of a bigger breakup of United Technologies. The aerospace divisions are growing more quickly and should be separated from units like the one that makes elevators and air-conditioners. "
198,"WASHINGTON — The United States conducted a missile-defense test on Wednesday off the coast of Hawaii and intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile, just days after North Korea’s bold missile test over Japan. The missile test on Wednesday was conducted by the United States Missile Defense Agency and Navy sailors on the John Paul Jones, a guided-missile destroyer. “We are working closely with the fleet to develop this important new capability, and this was a key milestone,” in advancing the capability to intercept missiles, said Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves, the director of the Missile Defense Agency, which is part of the Defense Department. “We will continue developing ballistic missile-defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves.” Tensions between the United States and North Korea have been rising in recent months over Pyongyang’s development of its nuclear program. The United States regularly tests its missile-defense systems, and this was the second time one of its Standard Missile-6 missiles successfully intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile, the agency said. The test had long been planned. North Korea’s most recent missile test early Tuesday local time prompted the Japanese government to tell residents to take cover. That missile traveled over the northern island of Hokkaido and landed in the sea. The test was considered a direct challenge to President Trump, who has threatened the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that America would respond with “fire and fury” to provocations. "
199,"If you watched Julia Roberts cycle through Bali’s artfully cultivated rice terraces in the film “Eat, Pray, Love,” it’s easy to understand why this so-called “Island of the Gods” is often referred to as a tropical paradise. But the film, and the Elizabeth Gilbert book of the same name, obscure an unpleasant reality that has been brewing for years: Bali is struggling to cope with its own popularity. The island of four million hosted a record 13 million visitors (nearly five million international, and more than eight million domestic) in 2016 and is on pace to better that mark this year. I wasn’t aware of this when I booked a midsummer three-week trip to Bali, but we felt the reality of those numbers immediately in Ubud, the once sleepy artist’s village where Ms. Gilbert (played by Ms. Roberts in the film) found love. The raves I had read about Bali’s charming people and their distinctive Hindu culture were true but I wasn’t prepared for the intense traffic or how unpleasant it would be to traverse Ubud’s congested streets on foot with our boys, Leo, 8, and James, 6. Bali has more than three million registered vehicles, but we discovered that there are a host of nearby islands — Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and the Gili Islands — that are car and scooter free. (Nusa means island in Balinese; Gili means small island in Bahasa Indonesian.) The Indonesian archipelago has more than 17,000 islands, and I wanted to spend a week in one of the car-free ones. I eliminated Penida and Lembongan, since they are only a half-hour ferry ride from Bali and thus probably too accessible. Of the three main Gili Islands, each about two to three hours from Bali by speedboat ferry (or a much quicker ferry ride from Lombok), Trawangan, often simply called Gili T, is considered the party island, Meno the quiet one, and Air somewhere in between. Hoping to find our sweet spot, I booked a ferry passage to Gili Air and hoped for the best. An hour into what turned out to be something of a white-knuckle adventure in rough seas, Leo turned flush and announced that he wanted off the boat. I have subjected my children to a host of unpleasant travel experiences around the world, usually while pursuing some elusive undiscovered paradise, and I wondered if Gili Air would be worth the bother. "
200,"Update, Aug. 20, 2018: We have now announced our 2018-19 Student Contest Calendar. _________ Every year our contests become more and more central to what we do. Hearing from teenagers around the world on the issues and ideas of the day — whether via essays, editorials, political cartoons, videos, poetry or culture reviews — has become, for us, an essential part of our mission of “teaching and learning with The New York Times.” Last school year, we received over 25,000 submissions to the eight contests we ran, and this year we hope to get even more. Please invite the students you know. Below you’ll see we’re bringing back most of the contests we ran last year, but we’re also adding three new ones — one about news literacy, another that asks students to make connections between the classroom and the world, and a third on podcasting. In addition, we’re offering an ongoing weekly opportunity for your students to be recognized via our Current Events Conversation. Here is a calendar of each contest’s dates to help you plan ahead. We’ll update this page with all the relevant rules, submission forms and related lesson plans as the date for each contest approaches. For now, we have also included links to contest rules, lesson plans and winners from past years for reference since the guidelines for our contests stay more or less the same year after year. Remember, all of our contests are always open to anyone 13 to 19 years old, from anywhere in the world. The work students send us is then considered by experts, whether Times journalists, outside educators from partner organizations, or professional practitioners in a field related to that contest. Winners and their work are always honored on our site with special posts that go out to our entire audience. "
201,"Waiting for Uber to finally go public? You’ll have to wait a bit longer. The company’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told employees on Wednesday at his first staff meeting that Uber should go public in the next 18 to 36 months. Such a timetable would mean an initial public offering in 2019 at the earliest. That may annoy those who had hoped the ride-hailing giant would hit the stock market next year. But the company has been in talks to allow existing shareholders to sell to new investors, like SoftBank of Japan. Among the new C.E.O.’s first pronouncements: Change is coming. “What got us here is not what’s going to get us to the next level,” he said. He was introduced by his predecessor, Travis Kalanick, who was ousted in part because of a revolt by existing shareholders like the venture capital firm Benchmark. But Mr. Kalanick had something to celebrate as well. Judge Samuel Glasscock III of Delaware’s Court of Chancery ruled that a legal dispute between Mr. Kalanick and Benchmark be moved to arbitration for now. Benchmark’s lawyers had argued for trying the case in open court, but said the company was willing to arbitrate parts of its complaint. President Trump, speaking in Missouri on Wednesday, made his long-awaited pitch for a sweeping tax overhaul. But it was still missing details. "
202,"In the pilot of CW’s “Valor,” Capt. Leland Gallo (Matt Barr) tells the helicopter pilot Nora Madani (Christina Ochoa) why secretive special-operations units, like the one they belong to, have become so central to American fighting. “People don’t want boots on the ground, so this is what war is now,” he says. As in life, as on TV. This fall, “Valor” and two other new network dramas about precisely the same sort of military unit are seeking to enlist the viewing public. CBS’s “SEAL Team” tells fictional stories of the Navy SEAL Team Six — just as “Six,” on History, did earlier this year. NBC’s “The Brave” involves a different special-forces outfit, but it’s the same in all but name. The military may be having a TV moment, but as Captain Gallo says in “Valor,” these shows assume that the public doesn’t want a deep engagement. Instead, they present combat as a quick-hit operation. War may be hell, but this fall it’s just another action-drama genre. The common response to the announcement of these series last spring was that they were a network pander to “Trump’s America.” But while they may well land differently in the political climate of 2017, they could have as easily been aired in the Obama or Bush administrations. (At least judging by the rough-cut pilots, which could change before airing.) There’s nothing specifically Trumpian about the shows’ premises or tones. While Muslim terrorists are prominent, for instance, the shows conspicuously avoid any West-vs.-the-world clash-of-civilizations framing. They’re cast multiculturally and multiracially; “The Brave,” like “Six,” includes Muslim soldiers in its special-operations unit. And each series tries to balance the red meat of shootouts and explosions with the vegetables of network-TV moralizing. In the pilot of “The Brave,” a soldier dismisses Doctors Without Borders workers in Syria as “bleeding hearts” who don’t get that “it’s just too dangerous to try and help people over here.” His comrade, a devout Christian, replies that “God gave us two hands, one to help ourselves, one to help others.” "
203,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. When The Times invented the “Op. Ed. Page” in 1970, the editors announced that they were hoping to create “an intellectual forum” with “divergent” views. In that spirit, I want to call attention to a piece taking issue with a recent Times Op-Ed. (Yes, the punctuation style on Op-Ed has changed since 1970.) Last week, the author Caroline Randall Williams wrote an article addressed to Barack Obama, urging him to speak up against President Trump, especially after Charlottesville. “We need your voice,” she wrote. “There is not a saner, more trustworthy opinion that many of us would rather hear.” In The Daily Beast this week, Jamil Smith disagreed. Hearing from Obama more often may well offer relief to progressives. But Smith argues — persuasively, to my mind — that a more talkative Obama would hurt the causes that matter to Obama and his allies. A higher-profile Obama would help drive Republicans and some independents back into Trump’s corner, given that many of them don’t like the former president. Even as president, Obama came to understand this dynamic and sometimes, rather than inserting himself into an issue and polarizing it, he held back. Remember: The opposition to Trump is doing pretty well. He is struggling, with a record-low approval rating and frequent criticism from his own party (and even his own appointees). "
204,"With drinking water cut off, its river still rising, and most routes in and out of the city flooded, Beaumont suffered the worst of Texas’ hardships on Thursday, and they showed no sign of abating. Flooding shut down the pumping plants that supply water to Beaumont in the morning, prompting a hospital to transport its patients out of the city, and trucks carrying bottled water struggled to reach the largely isolated city. The Neches River surged far beyond its banks, into streets, houses and businesses in the city of almost 120,000 people 70 miles east-northeast of Houston, reaching six feet above the previous record by afternoon, the National Weather Service reported. It was projected to rise another foot by Friday afternoon. The loss of water was just one of a host of new dangers emerging in the aftermath of Harvey, a storm system that pounded southeast Texas with record rainfall for several days before blowing across Louisiana and into Mississippi. Once a Category 4 hurricane, Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical depression. A series of small explosions shook a chemical plant about 25 miles northeast of downtown Houston on Thursday and more blasts were expected, after floodwaters shut down the cooling systems that kept the chemicals stable. Twenty-one emergency workers were treated for exposure to the resulting fumes and smoke, which were described as a lung and eye irritant. It appeared that the health and safety risk from the plant was limited. But in a region dotted with chemical factories, oil refineries and natural gas plants, the explosions at the Arkema plant near Crosby, Tex., underscore the worries that many people have about the lingering dangers that damage from the storm poses to the region’s infrastructure, economy and health. "
205,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The upending of the pornography industry is just one more tale of tech’s takeover of old-guard industries. It’s the subject explored in a new podcast series by the British journalist Jon Ronson, who spent a year reporting on how pornography production in the San Fernando Valley has been reshaped by the internet age. Called “The Butterfly Effect,” the podcast tests the theory that small actions can ripple out in history-altering ways. In the case of adult movies, Mr. Ronson explains, a young German named Fabian Thylmann unleashed a tidal wave in the 2000s after he took over a fledgling website called PornHub, a sort of YouTube for pornography. Suddenly, everybody’s videos were appearing on free sites. Caught off guard, an industry that had been enjoying fat times off DVD sales and paid sites was unable to counter the wide-scale distribution of its copyrighted work. "
206,"SEOUL, South Korea — A group of American and Canadian humanitarian workers who were traveling in North Korea recently had to make a tough decision: leave the country immediately and hope to return to their lifesaving work in the future, or stay in the North and face possible problems trying to go home later. This time, however, the uncertainty of their situation was not because of the North Korean government, but rather because of the Trump administration’s intention to bar Americans from traveling to the already isolated country. Under the order, announced in July, Americans must leave the North by Friday. “I didn’t want any of the staff or any of the colleagues to potentially face issues when they were getting out,” said Kim Taehoon, founder of DoDaum, a humanitarian group based in the United States that has organized an H.I.V.-diagnosis and treatment program in North Korea for the past several years. “Because of the uncertainty of the travel ban, we don’t know if we will be able to do on-the-ground work anymore.” Washington announced the ban in response to the death of Otto F. Warmbier, 22, an American college student who had been serving a 15-year sentence of hard labor in North Korea after being convicted of trying to steal a political poster. Mr. Warmbier died in June shortly after the North released him in a coma. The travel restrictions also reflected the United States’ growing impatience with North Korea over its missile tests and pursuit of nuclear weapons. By imposing the travel restriction, Washington hopes to discourage people from visiting North Korea, whose brutal government has detained American visitors for offenses like leaving a Bible behind in a hotel room. But at the same time, the sweeping ban threatens the efforts of hundreds of humanitarian workers in the North — Americans and those who collaborate with them — and the lives of North Koreans who badly need help. “One way or another, this program must go on. Otherwise, lives are lost,” said Stephen W. Linton, an American who oversees the Eugene Bell Foundation, a nonprofit group that has treated 250,000 tuberculosis patients in North Korea since 1997, including those with multidrug-resistant strains of the disease that are costlier to treat and harder to cure. "
207,"SEOUL, South Korea — The United States and South Korea wrapped up their annual joint military exercises on Thursday by flying some of their most powerful warplanes in bombing drills in a show of force two days after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan. Two B-1B supersonic bombers and four F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States Air Force and Marine Corps joined four South Korean F-15 fighter jets in live-fire bombing exercises over a military range in eastern South Korea, officials said. On their way to join the South Korean jets, the American warplanes flew together with two F-15s from Japan’s Self-Defense Forces over waters near the southwestern Japanese island of Kyushu, the United States Pacific Command said in a statement. ”This complex mission clearly demonstrates our solidarity with our allies and underscores the broadening cooperation to defend against this common regional threat,” said Gen. Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy, commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, referring to North Korea. South Korean F-15s conducted a similar bombing drill over the same range on Tuesday, hours after a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile from North Korea flew over northern Japan and splashed into the Pacific after a flight of nearly 1,700 miles. North Korea’s test on Tuesday represented the first time that one of its missiles had flown over another country. Its leader, Kim Jong-un, said on Wednesday that the test could be a “curtain raiser” for more such tests in the Pacific. The missile test rattled a region increasingly concerned about North Korea’s fast-advancing missile capabilities and its increasingly bold way of demonstrating them. Mr. Kim said that he would watch the United States’ actions before deciding whether to conduct more missile tests, including in waters around Guam, an American territory that is home to Andersen Air Force Base, from which the B-1B Lancer bombers participating in the drills on Thursday took off. The F-35 jets flew from an American base in Iwakuni, Japan. Hours after Mr. Kim’s warning, the United States conducted what it called a previously planned missile-defense test, intercepting a medium-range ballistic missile fired from a Navy guided-missile destroyer off the coast of Hawaii. Also on Wednesday, President Trump declared “talking is not the answer” to resolving the prolonged standoff over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. But hours later, when asked by reporters if the United States was out of diplomatic solutions with North Korea, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis replied, “No.” The Ulchi-Freedom Guardian, the 11-day joint military exercises the United States and South Korea completed on Thursday, involved tens of thousands of American and South Korean troops, although the exercises were conducted largely through computer simulations. Whenever such joint exercises take place, North Korea accuses the South and the United States of preparing for an invasion and often conducts its own military exercises and missile tests. "
208,"A political faction in the state of Western Australia is stirring a debate about seceding from the country’s federation of states over a long-running grievance about tax revenues. After Britain voted to leave the European Union in a move known as Brexit, and some Californians agitated to leave the United States after President Trump’s election, has “threatening to leave” become the new political solution to thorny problems? A faction of the Western Australian Liberals, the right-leaning party led by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, is holding a conference this weekend. On the agenda is a motion to set up a committee to investigate “WAxit,” the somewhat awkward moniker for the proposal to secede from Australia. The committee would report back in 2018. The idea might sound far-fetched, but it’s not the first time Western Australia has considered it. In 1933, 68 percent of the state — which had only signed on to the Australian federation reluctantly in the first place — voted to secede. The British House of Commons had final say on the matter, but refused even to consider it. Western Australia was placated with the establishment of a system that had the effect of redistributing Australia’s wealth in its favor — and it’s that system that the rogue Liberal faction is now upset about. “Western Australia has a long history of discontent,” said Alan Fenna, a politics professor at Curtin University in Perth. “But it’s political and economic discontent. It’s not an identity issue as you’d see somewhere like Quebec.” "
209,"SYDNEY, Australia — Residents of the Japanese island of Hokkaido were woken on Tuesday by warnings that they should take cover from an approaching North Korean missile. The missile launching was the latest in a recent string of provocations from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who is intent on demonstrating his country’s progress in building a nuclear arsenal. Pyongyang’s displays of its nuclear and missile technology are terrifying. But Washington’s development of new nuclear-weapon and missile technologies is also contributing to global instability. American nuclear advances threaten to start a new arms race and change the logic of mutually assured destruction, which has undergirded nuclear stability since the 1950s. In recent years, the Pentagon has increased the overall offensive power of its nuclear arsenal. Those changes, along with further upgrading, will amount to more destructive power from all three legs of the American nuclear triad: sea, land and air-launched nuclear weapons. From the sea, a nuclear missile “super fuze” timing element improves the accuracy of submarine-based warheads by allowing for detonation closer to targets. The United States began incorporating this new fuze system into the ballistic-missile submarine fleet in 2009, and some analysts believe the entire submarine force has already been equipped with the technology. And last week, the Pentagon announced that it had awarded contracts for updated versions of both the ground-based nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal and the air-launched nuclear-tipped stealth cruise missile, designed to penetrate enemy territory undetected. According to some nuclear weapons experts, enhancements like the super fuze have increased by up to threefold the destructive capacity of America’s nuclear arsenal. And Andrew C. Weber, a former assistant defense secretary, recently described the upgraded stealth cruise missiles as “a destabilizing system designed for nuclear war fighting,” rather than a necessary addition to the system of nuclear deterrence. "
210,"This summer, Dave Chappelle returned to the stage for an ambitious, monthlong residency at Radio City Music Hall in New York. We saw the show independently, on separate nights. What we witnessed inspired us to dedicate an entire episode to the legacy of Chappelle’s comedy as he works to re-establish his place in American culture. But much has shifted in the decade since Chappelle, through his much-loved TV show, “Chappelle’s Show,” brilliantly explored how black people are represented and misrepresented: Nowadays, he’s no longer interested in speaking on behalf of anyone else. We consider his past to consider where he might be headed and whether we still need comedians — and comedy, for that matter — to help us make sense of the present.

211,"I
f you are, like me, a person with no sense of style and a stomach paunch, you might understand why dressing for a fashion show would be a psychological challenge. The day before my first one, I begged my best-dressed co-worker to chaperone my visit to a fast-fashion outlet. I’d coveted a pleated gold-foil skirt I’d seen on the store’s website. My co-worker had approved the skirt on the model. I tried it on. She did not approve it on me. In person, the gold foil looked cheap, the waistband of the skirt unflattering. Instead, she picked out a rose-colored accordion skirt that I would never have thought to buy. I put it on the next morning. Four hours later, I spilled steak juice all down my front. Maybe another person would have given up at that point, but I was on my way to meet Elaine Welteroth, the editor in chief of Teen Vogue. Hired at 29, she is the youngest-ever editor in chief of a Condé Nast publication, and only the second black woman to hold the title there. Since taking over the magazine last year, she has become a personality of sorts, appearing as herself on ABC’s ‘‘black-ish’’ and being photographed cuddled up to celebrities: the Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, the actors Gabrielle Union and Aja Naomi King. As I headed to the Coach fall show this February, I found myself growing increasingly nervous to meet her. It wasn’t that she was famous, really. But I spent a significant portion of my adolescence fantasizing about running my own teen magazine, and, like her, I am a young, black New York-based editor with curly hair and myopia. She was famous to me. The current iteration of Teen Vogue is, if you listen to anyone who likes it — and you’d be surprised at the diversity of people who do — a ‘‘revolution’’ in magazines. Devoid of the prom- and weight-loss-themed articles that usually litter teen magazines, the title, read primarily by 18-to-24-year-olds, is now full of articles like an open letter by Mckesson to Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old black boy who was fatally shot by police, or a conversation between the singer Troye Sivan and the model Hari Nef about being members of the L.G.B.T. community in the current political climate. It certainly feels strikingly different from the Teen Vogue that began showing up at my family’s house in the early aughts. Back then, it was mostly indistinguishable from the other teen magazines I read: CosmoGirl (for sassy white girls), Seventeen (for ambitious white girls), YM (for white girls prone to toxic-shock syndrome). Teen Vogue — for rich white girls — was explicitly dedicated to fashion, less ‘‘finding a prom date’’ and more ‘‘finding a prom color palette.’’ What sticks out most in my memory is ‘‘A Room of My Own,’’ the back-page feature that almost always presented a very posh New York girl whose bed was inevitably from either Crate and Barrel or some cool, unnamed Brooklyn thrift store. Even though my life didn’t resemble the ones I saw in those pages, I read the magazines as soon as they arrived. I knew the themes were corny and hypocritical — breathless embraces of self-love despite diet tips 12 pages later — but I was convinced they would teach me how to be a person in the world. I hadn’t thought about Teen Vogue for years when I noticed a cover story about Willow Smith, an outspoken teenage singer with brown skin and dreadlocked hair. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen a black girl on the cover of a magazine. I flipped to the article. It was just as effervescent and slightly cheesy as the ones from my youth — ‘‘She may very well be from a distant planet, a foreign place where women are homegrown superheroes, nurtured to become god­desses,’’ went the description of Smith — but it was a far cry from the profiles of racially homogeneous, apolitical teeny-boppers I was used to reading. Welteroth wrote it herself. At the fashion show, people started to take their seats in front of the runway. I craned my neck, searching for Welteroth, who is difficult to miss. She has tight, springy curls that she herself cuts into a corona around her face, and is perhaps the only person who can wear a pair of oversize aviator glasses without looking as if she wandered out of a 1970s-era most-wanted poster. Just as the first models started down the runway, my phone buzzed: It was Welteroth. They closed the doors early. She didn’t make it in. "
212,"[Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] Vice President Mike Pence’s recent swing through Latin America quickly acquired an unwanted label: the cleanup tour. Almost everywhere Mr. Pence went, one question followed: Did President Trump really mean it when he spontaneously threatened a United States military intervention in Venezuela? Mr. Pence did his best to disavow Mr. Trump’s words without actually saying that was his intent. Every administration suffers its share of “what the president meant to say” moments. Even the most disciplined commander-in-chief misspeaks from time to time. Take one last question at a news conference, tackle an unfamiliar issue, talk too loosely at a fund-raiser, and the damage is done. Aides quickly deny the plain meaning of the president’s words, contort them to conform to policy, or feign outrage that anyone could have failed to grasp what the president meant. This, however, is not just any administration. Just listen, and Mr. Trump’s discordant policy notes sour nearly every foreign policy tune. Mr. Trump threatens to make South Korea pay for missile defense and seems to invite Seoul and Tokyo to build their own nuclear arsenals; Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis jumps in to say never mind. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeks to calm the crisis between Saudi Arabia and Qatar; Mr. Trump’s tweets embolden the Saudis to double down in the feud. Mr. Tillerson, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, Mr. Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., advocate preserving the nuclear agreement with Iran; Mr. Trump scolds, “If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.” Mr. Trump calls for banning transgender people from the military; an array of senior Pentagon officials, including General Dunford, say the policy remains unchanged. When Mr. Trump finally issues a formal order weeks later, Mr. Mattis says it will require further study to implement. And on Russia, the administration speaks with one voice — except Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Pence, in the Baltics, praises tough new congressionally mandated sanctions; Mr. Trump tweets that the sanctions will send United States-Russia relations to “an all-time & very dangerous low.” Moscow’s meddling in the presidential election? Thomas Bossert, the president’s chief counterterrorism adviser, and other senior national security advisers back the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia sought to influence the election in Mr. Trump’s favor. Mr. Trump equivocates: “Well I think it was Russia, and I think it could have been other people and other countries. It could have been a lot of people interfered.” "
213,"Yes, I recently went to Casper, Wyo., to see the total eclipse, but this column isn’t about that. It’s prompted by something else I saw in Casper after the sun reappeared. A few hundred yards from the hillside where we watched the eclipse is a museum called the National Historic Trails Interpretive Center. A cooperative venture of the federal Bureau of Land Management, the city of Casper and a local foundation, it tells the story of the nearly half-million people who passed through Casper in the mid-1800s on their way west to what they dreamed – or, more like it, desperately hoped — would be a better life. Included there are artifacts and accounts of the pioneers’ Oregon Trail; the route the Mormons took after they were driven from Illinois and Missouri; and the path to California followed by those drawn by visions of gold nuggets. Never having lived more than shouting distance from the East Coast, I had little sense of this history or of the “torrent of humanity,” as a National Park Service brochure puts it, that followed trails with wheel ruts still visible across the West. The museum’s exhibits are engaging, with ample commentary and interactive maps. On the wall near the entrance is a plaque with these words: “The westward urge was a human instinct, like the need to love or to taste spring air and believe again that life is not a dead end after all.” Those words were written not by a federal bureaucrat, but by a mid-20th-century Western writer, David Sievert Lavender, in a 1963 book called “Westward Vision.” Still, a federal agency put them up in a visible position, and keeps them there. Earlier in the day, I had seen one example of nature’s power when the sky went dark. Now here, under federal auspices, was a testament to and celebration of another force of nature: the human instinct that compels people to leave where they are and go, even at their peril, to someplace new, someplace safe. The words lingered in my mind as anomalous, even subversive, as I emerged from the museum into the bright sunlight of another day in the age of Trump. I actually hesitated before quoting the words here, in case Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke or one of his minions learns about them and decides they’re too off-message to remain. "
214,"I know that Harvey is heavy on America’s heart. It is certainly heavy on mine. My oldest brother lives in the hard-hit suburban Houston town of Humble, just outside of George Bush Intercontinental Airport and on the shores of the Spring Creek and the west fork of the San Jacinto River. And now the storm is barreling toward my hometown in North Louisiana where my mother and two of my brothers live. I’m anxious. I wish that I could take a reprieve from politics and simply focus on the human suffering and human altruism on display in the affected areas. But, alas, I cannot. Politics keep creeping in. Politics keep occurring concurrently. Set aside for a moment that Donald Trump is the person who pulled America out of the Paris climate accords, even though models suggest that climate change makes severe weather more severe, and as Politico reports, “Harvey is the third 500-year flood to hit the Houston area in the past three years.” Forget for a moment that, according to Slate, just 10 days before Harvey made landfall Trump signed an executive order that included “eliminating an Obama-era rule called the federal flood risk management standard that asked agencies to account for climate change projections when they approved projects.” The final assessment on how this administration handles the storm can’t be made while it still rages, but what Trump says and does now is open to analysis. In that vein, a line from Trump’s joint press conference with the president of Finland stood out. When asked about pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio as Harvey was making landfall, Trump responded: “Actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally.” Consider what this man is saying: He used the horror and anxious anticipation of a monster storm menacing millions of Americans — particularly in Houston whose population is 44 percent Hispanic — in a political calculation to get more ratings and more eyeballs on the fact that he was using the power of the presidency to forgive, and thereby condone, Arpaio’s racism. "
215,"Houston isn’t the only major city reeling from record rainfall and devastating floods. In Mumbai, India, where summer monsoons are annual events, as much rain fell in 12 hours on Tuesday as normally does over 11 days in a typical monsoon, paralyzing the city, India’s financial capital. So far this summer, flooding has killed more than 1,000 people in India, Nepal and perennially flood-prone Bangladesh. The United Nations says at least 41 million people have been directly affected by flooding and landslides in South Asia, with homes and croplands destroyed. Floods from heavy rainfall have also ripped through Britain, Ireland, Sudan and Uganda in Africa. On Aug. 14, torrents of water swept through the streets of Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, and a massive mudslide left some 1,000 people dead or missing. Like the calamity in Texas, these unnatural rainfalls carry two messages. One is the risk of unregulated development. As in Houston, officials in India have paid little attention to the consequences of rapid urban growth in low-lying, watery environments with few natural defenses against a deluge when it comes. And, like Houston, which has suffered floods in the past, Mumbai was hit by severe flooding in 2005 that claimed more than 500 lives, yet it did little to address the issues that made that flooding so deadly. The second message is that unabated climate change does, indeed, exact a price. Warmer weather heats the oceans, which causes more evaporation, which increases moisture in the atmosphere, which then falls as driving rain. Warmer oceans also rise, partly due to thermal expansion, which in turn threatens low-lying areas; among climate scientists, Bangladesh has for years been the poster child of nations that are likely to face famine, flooding and forced migration as a result of rising sea levels caused by global warming. It does not have to be this bad the next time around. Cities around the world are taking steps to become more resilient, so they can better cope when exceptional weather events occur. Upgrading sewage, drainage and transportation infrastructure; increasing green spaces; restoring wetlands; and using zoning laws to prevent new construction in known flood plains and vulnerable coastal areas are all obvious steps that can help. Early-warning systems, sorely lacking in many developing countries, are also critical, as are evacuation and emergency response plans. Reforestation can help prevent landslides and bolster the capacity for rain to be absorbed upstream. As the world has long recognized, most recently at the Paris summit meeting on climate change in December 2015, poor nations will need a helping hand from rich ones as they transition to cleaner, low-carbon energy sources. This is not something the Trump administration seems inclined to offer, any more than it seems inclined to listen to the scientists, join with other nations to combat the problem or do something about America’s own greenhouse gas emissions. That’s unconscionable, even borderline nuts, especially now that President Trump himself has seen at first hand the results of inaction. "
216,"In the face of America’s abysmal voter participation rates, lawmakers have two choices: They can make voting easier, or they can make it harder. Illinois made the right choice this week, becoming the 10th state, along with the District of Columbia, to enact automatic voter registration. The bill, which could add as many as one million voters to the state’s rolls, was signed by Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who had vetoed similar legislation last year. Under the new law, all eligible voters will be registered to vote when they visit the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agencies. If they do not want to be registered, they may opt out. “The right to vote is foundational for the rights of Americans in our democracy,” Mr. Rauner said at a bill-signing ceremony on Monday. “We as a people need to do everything we can to knock down barriers, remove hurdles for all those who are eligible to vote, to be able to vote.” These are incontestable propositions, and yet for most officials from Mr. Rauner’s party, showing even mild support for them is apostasy.

219,"The Obama administration had an idea it thought would help address the pay gap between white men and almost everyone else: requiring companies to report how much they paid people, along with their sex and race. On Tuesday, that regulation became the latest of those reversed by the Trump administration, before the requirement was to go into effect next year. Pay transparency, alone, would not have solved the pay gap problem. But without it, employees and regulators won’t have evidence that a problem exists at any particular company — and employers will face less pressure to fix it. There is little data on whether forcing companies to disclose pay makes it more equitable, mostly because the pay of individual workers or companies is generally kept secret. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys companies about compensation, but publishes only aggregate, anonymous data. Researchers who have studied the few instances in which companies have publicly disclosed individual salaries say it is not enough to close pay gaps, nor is it essential — some companies have closed them on their own, without publicly reporting pay information. But most companies have no incentive to close pay gaps. The regulation provided that incentive — by pressuring them into it. “Part of the motivation behind it would be to shame certain employers that found large gaps into doing something and taking proactive steps,” said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied the issue.

221,"President Trump made his pitch for tax reform this week, but the odds are not favorable for legislation that would reduce individual and corporate rates and promote economic growth without driving up the national deficit. For inspiration, maybe Mr. Trump and lawmakers in Congress should look in their own backyard. The District of Columbia, a political entity whose city council lies ideologically somewhere to the left of Bernie Sanders, has done exactly that. The capital’s financial affairs were in such disarray by the mid-1990s that they were taken over by a federal financial control board that operated until 2001. Yet in 2014 the council cut corporate and business taxes, reduced individual rates for everyone earning less than $1 million and broadened the tax base by eliminating many loopholes. As a headline on the conservative website The Daily Caller put it, “Hell Freezes Over: DC Passes Tax Reform.” In the ensuing years, economic growth and tax receipts have surged, enabling the city to accelerate cuts that were being phased in. The legislation was not revenue neutral, in the sense that broadening the tax base offset the reduction in rates. It was a tax cut. But in a development that would surely warm the hearts of pro-growth Republicans, the economic lift was so strong that tax receipts increased, and last year hit a record. Even more remarkable, the plan drew praise from across the ideological spectrum, including that of conservative supply-side advocates like Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, which opposes all tax increases. "
222,"BEIJING — The Chinese Communist Party will hold a once-every-five-years leadership reshuffle in October, the state-run news media reported on Thursday, confirming the date of a closely watched meeting that will serve as a test of President Xi Jinping’s power. About 2,300 delegates, including senior officials, will meet in Beijing for a party congress on Oct. 18, according to news reports. They are expected to confirm Mr. Xi for a second five-year term and to appoint a new cohort of officials under him. Mr. Xi, already one of the most influential Chinese leaders in decades, is likely to emerge from the meeting even more formidable. As president, he has reasserted China’s power in Asia, restructured the military and led a relentless anticorruption campaign that has ensnared scores of low-level officials and political enemies. Now, Mr. Xi is poised to win an even broader mandate for his policies and authoritarian style by stacking the party’s most influential bodies with close allies. He may also defy the standard script and lay the groundwork for extending his tenure by delaying the designation of a successor. “He’s large and in charge,” said Christopher K. Johnson, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "
223,"HOUSTON — A series of explosions at a flood-damaged chemical plant outside Houston on Thursday drew sharp focus on hazards to public health and safety from the city’s vast petrochemical complex as the region begins a painstaking recovery from Hurricane Harvey. The blasts at the plant, owned by the French chemical company Arkema, came after its main electrical system and backups failed, cutting off refrigeration systems that kept volatile chemicals stable. While nearby residents had been evacuated, 15 public safety officers were treated at a hospital after inhaling smoke from chemical fires that followed the explosions. The Arkema plant has been identified as one of the most hazardous in the state. Its failure followed releases of contaminants from several other area petrochemical plants and systemic breakdowns of water and sewer systems in Houston and elsewhere in the storm-struck region. The explosions — more are expected, the company said — will bring fresh scrutiny on whether these plants are adequately regulated and monitored by state and federal safety officials. The chemical plant accident came as devastation from Harvey, now a tropical depression moving into the Mississippi Valley, continued to spread across the region. The known death toll from the storm and flooding remained at 39, the authorities said. Record-breaking floods swept through Beaumont, Tex., 100 miles east of Houston, damaging the water system and leaving the city’s 120,000 residents without clean water. "
224,"WASHINGTON — With the election of President Trump, the nation’s consumer watchdog agency faced a quandary: how to shield the Obama-era institution from a Republican administration determined to loosen the federal government’s grip on business. In the weeks after the election, Richard Cordray, the Democrat who leads the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, directed his staff to compile stories from ordinary Americans thanking it for resolving complaints. The anecdotes, which he solicited in an email to share with the Trump transition team, could provide a counterpoint to critics who had cast the agency as a regulatory scourge on the economy. And implicit in his request to employees was the belief that some accolades would come from parts of the country that helped elect Mr. Trump — evidence that the popularity of consumer safeguards transcends party divisions. “There must be hundreds of such stories,” Mr. Cordray wrote in the email in November, which was obtained in a public records request. He added, “I can think of no better vindication” of the agency’s consumer relief efforts. While many federal agencies have begun to loosen the reins on the companies they regulate, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, born out of the Dodd-Frank financial law in 2010, has taken the opposite course. Congress granted it unusually broad authority — and autonomy from the White House and Congress — to both enforce existing federal rules and write new ones, including issuing fines against financial companies. Under Mr. Trump it has openly embraced its mission, cracking down on debt collectors, pushing out a major new financial rule on arbitration and pursuing a flurry of enforcement actions against payday lenders and others.

226,"The legal challenge that helped to free scores of travelers who were detained at airports around the country in the confusing early days of President Trump’s travel ban, prompting thousands of demonstrators to demand their release, was quietly settled on Thursday in a Brooklyn courtroom. Under the settlement agreement, the federal government is required to identify and send a letter to every individual who was improperly barred from entering the country under the original travel ban, providing a list of free legal services organizations that can help recipients obtain visas or other entry documents. Approval is not guaranteed, but the government agreed to process their applications in good faith. “For the people who were never able to come back, this is the best opportunity we can give them,” said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. The agreement did not provide any damages or monetary compensation for those affected by the ban, nor any award of legal fees to the groups who fought it in court. People who never reached an American airport because they were kept from boarding flights are not covered by the settlement. “Although this case has been moot since March, when the president rescinded the original executive order and issued a new one that does not restrict the entry of Iraqi nationals, the U.S. government has elected to settle this case on favorable terms,” Nicole Navas Oxman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement. The travel ban was an attempt to fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The original version of the executive order imposing the ban was issued in January, barely a week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. After that order was blocked in court, Mr. Trump issued a revised version, which will be the subject of arguments before the Supreme Court this fall. "

228,"Though the Supreme Court’s decision in Fisher v. University of Texas last year upheld the university’s right to use race as a factor in admissions, affirmative action policies continue to be scrutinized. This month, The New York Times reported that President Trump’s Justice Department would begin to investigate and even sue colleges over “intentional race-based discrimination.” Critics contend that the proffering of special consideration or benefits to blacks and Latinos is a form of “reverse discrimination,” while supporters argue that affirmative action merely evens the playing field; a recent analysis found that even with these measures, black and Latino students are still more underrepresented in the country’s top colleges and universities today than they were 35 years ago. Below, two books delve into the debate, while another shows why affirmative action may not be enough. FOR DISCRIMINATION
Race, Affirmative Action, and the Law
By Randall Kennedy
304 pp. Pantheon. (2013) This book presents a balanced defense of what the writer, the Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy, refers to as “positive discrimination.” Kennedy explores the history of race-related laws and asks why, despite preferential treatment in college admissions for people based on special categories like geography or legacy status, consideration on the basis of race has always been contentious. His focus is on higher education, where these discussions have historically taken place because of the scarcity of available seats and top universities’ role as “gateways to opportunity, socialization and certification” and “ training grounds for the power elite.” Kennedy concedes some of the costs of affirmative action — the potential to stoke resentments, as well as the stigma and self-doubt that follows high-achieving black Americans, for instance — but concludes that these drawbacks are outweighed by the net benefits. And his defense is not, as he writes in his introduction, because of the many ways he’s benefited from these policies, though he details them in his introduction. Rather, he views affirmative action as a “positive good,” a moral necessity and the responsible choice in a society marred by historical race-based inequity. WHEN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WAS WHITE

229,"Durham, N.C. — Some of the most heartening images to emerge from storm-torn Houston this week have been of neighbors doing what we all hope our neighbors will do when we are in trouble. From shuttling victims to safety in their personal boats to braving waist-high water searching for the stranded, neighbors have been helping neighbors cope with the worst natural disaster ever to strike the nation’s fourth-largest city, and doing it without regard to politics or ideology. Another neighbor has offered to help us in these desperate times, a neighbor that also came to our aid when Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Gulf Coast 12 years ago. That neighbor is Mexico. The Trump administration should accept its help again, and do so with thanks and gratitude. Because, as Hurricane Harvey can teach President Trump, that’s what neighbors do. I witnessed Mexico’s willingness to be a good neighbor while serving as the No. 2 at the American Embassy in Mexico City in 2005. Within hours of Hurricane Katrina’s landfall in New Orleans, Mexican officials were on the phone offering to send army field kitchens and naval cleanup crews to the stricken areas. Those offers frankly caught us flat-footed. We were accustomed to looking at Mexico as the poor relation who needed our help, not the other way around. Even more surprising, the Mexican Army was by far the most nationalistic and anti-American element in the Mexican government. Yet it ended up leading a convoy of more than 200 Mexican soldiers to assist displaced Americans in San Antonio, where it eventually served 170,000 meals, distributed more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations. "
230,"No, no, no, says Richard A. Luthmann, a lawyer who practices politics on Staten Island with a blunt-edged hatchet. It is not trolling, Mr. Luthmann said, to set up phony Facebook pages to embarrass candidates — such as one in which a Republican Assembly candidate in a conservative district calls for more housing projects, or another, in which a liberal Democrat City Council member “welcomes” a welfare hotel for drug addicts and criminals. While Mr. Luthmann neither denies nor admits creating the pages, he insists that there would be absolutely nothing unusual if he had. Moreover, he said, trolling is the wrong term for such tactics. “It’s what is called a dirty trick,” Mr. Luthmann said, who misappropriated a term from Plato to deem Facebook spoofing a form of “noble lie.” Thanks to an expose by reporter Amanda Farinacci of Spectrum News NY1, there is scant doubt about Mr. Luthmann’s role in creating a string of bogus pages to cause trouble for candidates running for district attorney; the assembly; the City Council; and the mayoralty. Were candidates he was aligned with glad to have him doing the dirty work? In private Facebook Messenger exchanges obtained by NY1, Mr. Luthmann wrote to Ron Castorina Jr., a Republican member of the Assembly, when they learned of a challenge from another Republican, Janine Materna, in the September 2016 primary.

231,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration signaled on Thursday that the black abolitionist Harriet Tubman may not replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill after all. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined to endorse the plan for a 2020 redesign of the $20 bill that was announced by the Obama administration last year. “People have been on the bills for a long period of time,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC. “This is something we’ll consider. Right now we’ve got a lot more important issues to focus on.” President Trump, who has described himself as a “big fan” of the populist rabble-rousing president from Tennessee, made clear as a candidate that he didn’t like the proposal to replace Jackson. “I would love to leave Andrew Jackson and see if we can maybe come up with another denomination,” he said in April 2016, after the decision was announced. "
232,"To the Editor: Re “Who Decides if Trump Is Unfit?,” by Peter D. Kramer and Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, Aug. 29): May I respectfully disagree with the esteemed psychiatrists, whose position is that politicians and not mental health professionals should decide on President Trump’s fitness for office. They write that “many experts believe that Mr. Trump has a narcissistic personality disorder.” These experts are concerned about his mental and emotional instability. People with this disorder distort reality to meet their extreme ego needs, rendering them blind to other views and facts but their own. Mr. Trump is capable of any belief or action that feeds his extreme narcissism, no matter how absurd. His actions are driven by his obsession to gain the praise and adoration of others. This inability to understand reality and the truth, which we have clearly seen in Mr. Trump, renders him incapable of evaluating situations and making informed, appropriate decisions. It is time the mental health community step up and join, if not lead, the effort to remove our president from office. KEN LEFKOWITZ, MEDFORD, N.J. To the Editor: Concern about President Trump’s behavior has led many to posit mental instability as a way to remove him from office. The conflation of bad character and mental illness is both dangerous and unnecessary. Mr. Trump’s impulsivity, dishonesty, divisiveness and outright unpresidential behavior are easily condemned without resorting to a psychiatric diagnosis. In fact, labeling it as illness serves only to excuse his bad behavior. Mental illness may affect judgment and interfere with functioning, but it does not cause bad character. It is dangerous to invoke the label of a mental illness in an attempt to disqualify those with whom we don’t agree. Those of us who are concerned about the effects of his unpresidential and sometimes frightening behavior must turn to other branches of government, such as Congress and the courts, to curb his influence. "
233,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • American citizens must leave North Korea by today under the Trump administration’s travel ban, adopted after the North released a detained American student in a coma. Aid workers fear damage to their missions in the impoverished country. The U.S. and South Korea ended annual joint military exercises with a display of air power — B-1B supersonic bombers, F-35 stealth fighter jets and F-15 fighter jets — and live-fire bombing exercises that came just two days after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan. Above, an image released by South Korea. Our White House correspondent polled Asia experts on the North Korean crisis, and found that some have greater fears that President Trump will open a risky, unpredictable dialogue with the North than that he will go to war. _____ "
234,"The world’s nuclear inspectors complicated President Trump’s effort to find Iran in violation of the two-year-old nuclear accord with the United States and five other world powers, declaring on Thursday that the latest inspections found no evidence that the country is breaching the agreement. Mr. Trump has made no secret of his desire to scrap the agreement, even over the objections of many of his top national security officials. But the reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency make it harder to create an argument that Iran is in violation. The latest declaration by the I.A.E.A. came just a week after Mr. Trump had sent his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, to Vienna to meet with the top agency officials, who are responsible for conducting the inspections and monitoring Iranian compliance. Ms. Haley was pressing the agency to be more aggressive, and some administration officials have argued that the I.A.E.A. should demand access to a series of Iranian military sites. But under the accord, the agency can only do so when there is a reasonable suspicion that Iran is conducting illicit nuclear-related activities at those sites. So far, according the I.A.E.A. and American officials, the United States has not delivered a list of suspect locations. Ms. Haley, who is rumored in Washington to be a leading candidate to become secretary of state if the incumbent, Rex W. Tillerson, steps down later this year or next, made no comment on Thursday on the report’s findings. But she issued a statement that suggested that the administration would push the inspections argument further, despite an Iranian declaration several days ago that its military sites are off-limits. "
235,"For all of the uncertainties that await Houston and coastal Texas, we can be reasonably sure about one thing: Many of those flooded out by Hurricane Harvey will watch their investments and savings collapse into debt and bankruptcy. And the heaviest burdens, of course, will fall on the shoulders of low- and middle-income residents. Preliminary estimates put losses from the storm at $30 billion to $40 billion. If past disasters are any indication, those numbers will only grow in the coming days and weeks. Whatever the ultimate figure, the losses will represent, in part, the aggregation of hundreds of thousands or more individual financial calamities. When the waters recede and Houstonians and others hit by this storm return home, with all their pluck and determination, to muck out and clear debris, many will learn too late that their homeowners’ insurance does not cover flood damage. Even for the lucky 15 percent of homeowners in Houston and surrounding Harris County, who have a federal flood policy in place, collecting claims will most likely be a protracted and contentious process. (Hurricane Katrina and Sandy victims have stories to tell about fraudulent or erroneous claims adjustments, delayed payments and their homes being unlivable for years.) Many of the other 85 percent were not required to have a flood policy because they were not officially at “high risk” on the region’s flood maps — maps that President Trump no longer wants the government to pay for. Those homeowners will be forced to fall back on some combination of disaster relief, loans and savings. Although homeowners with government-backed mortgages will be able to hold off on payments for at least 90 days, eventually they will have to honor mortgages on houses that are uninhabitable or even swept away. Renters may never return home. In short, many Texans will be starting over economically. As the legal scholar Michele Dauber has shown, President Franklin D. Roosevelt understood the relationship between “ruined landscapes and ruined lives.” Roosevelt likened the Great Depression to the devastation of the Dust Bowl, tornadoes in Georgia, and floods on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to build his case for the huge public investments and assistance programs that transformed the fates of Americans who were also starting over. "
236,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday that he had signed deployment orders for some of the American reinforcements that are to be sent to Afghanistan. It is the first tangible step that the Pentagon has taken to carry out the new strategy that President Trump announced last week to step up the fight in Afghanistan and try to take back the initiative from the Taliban. “I have signed orders, but it is not complete,” Mr. Mattis said. “In other words, I have signed some of the troops that will go and we are identifying the specific ones.” Although Mr. Mattis did not say which forces were being deployed, administration officials have previously said the Pentagon will send nearly 4,000 additional troops, some of whom are expected to come from the 82nd Airborne Division. The United States currently has about 11,000 troops in Afghanistan to advise Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism missions. The new reinforcements, officials have said, will enable the United States to advise select Afghan brigades in the field, step up the effort to train Afghanistan’s special operations forces and call in American and allied air and artillery strikes. “When you go into Afghanistan and you are carrying a gun, you are going into a combat zone,” Mr. Mattis said. “By and large, this is to enable the Afghan force to fight more effectively. It is more advisers. It is more enablers — fire support, for example.” The military is also reorganizing some of the forces already in Afghanistan to carry out the new mission. Pentagon officials have yet to publicly explain the new mission in detail or make the case why they think the new strategy will be effective when the deployment of 100,000 troops to Afghanistan during the Obama administration failed to break the back of the Taliban and other extremist groups, or force them to the negotiating table. Mr. Mattis said he would begin to outline the rationale for the forces in more detail when he testifies to Congress on Wednesday. "
237,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security took the first major step on Thursday toward building a barrier on the border with Mexico, a key campaign promise of President Trump, as officials announced that they had awarded contracts to build several prototypes of a concrete wall. Four companies will build the prototypes in the San Diego area, said officials at Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the department. The companies selected will each have 30 days to complete the projects after the agency gives them the order to proceed. “The border wall prototypes and designs will complement other tools we employ to secure our borders,” said Ronald D. Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner at Customs and Border Protection. Mr. Vitiello said that the prototypes would be about 30 feet high and that the contracts were between $400,000 and $500,000 each. The department has reallocated $20 million from other programs to pay for the prototypes and related costs. Homeland Security officials said the prototypes would be added to the existing walls in the San Diego area and would allow the agency to evaluate which barriers are most effective in giving Border Patrol agents time to respond to reports of illegal drugs and human smuggling. The awarding of the contracts for a border wall comes as the government assesses the damage from Hurricane Harvey, which has devastated parts of Texas. Some congressional critics have accused the administration and its Republican allies of proposing to cut billions in funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead department for disaster recovery, to pay for a border wall. "
238,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration ordered Russia on Thursday to close its consulate in San Francisco and two diplomatic annexes, in New York and Washington, in a carefully calculated riposte to Russia’s order that the United States cut its diplomatic staff in Russia. The tit-for-tat move, which Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson conveyed to Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in a morning phone call, bore all of the hallmarks of a Cold War-era grudge match. But the administration seemed eager to contain the fallout, casting the move as a straightforward return to diplomatic parity between the countries rather than the latest volley in an increasingly combative relationship. “In the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians,” the State Department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement, the United States would require Russia to close the three offices by Saturday. Russia’s reaction was similarly measured. The Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Lavrov “expressed regret at the escalation of tension in bilateral relations” and said that the Russian government would study the move before deciding how to respond. Russia’s new ambassador to the United States, who arrived Thursday in Washington to be greeted by the news, was quoted by a state news agency as saying Moscow would respond without “hysterical outbursts.” “It’s necessary to calmly sort things out,” said the ambassador, Anatoly I. Antonov. “It’s necessary to act calmly and professionally.” The administration’s response had been expected for the past month, since Russia ordered the American Mission to cut its staff by 755 people — a sign of its displeasure after Congress imposed sanctions because of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. "
239,"Providing new evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Facebook disclosed on Wednesday that it had identified more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on hot-button issues purchased by a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin. Most of the 3,000 ads did not refer to particular candidates but instead focused on divisive social issues such as race, gay rights, gun control and immigration, according to a post on Facebook by Alex Stamos, the company’s chief security officer. The ads, which ran between June 2015 and May 2017, were linked to some 470 fake accounts and pages the company said it had shut down. Facebook officials said the fake accounts were created by a Russian company called the Internet Research Agency, which is known for using “troll” accounts to post on social media and comment on news websites. The disclosure adds to the evidence of the broad scope of the Russian influence campaign, which American intelligence agencies concluded was designed to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Donald J. Trump during the election. Multiple investigations of the Russian meddling, and the possibility that the Trump campaign somehow colluded with Russia, have cast a shadow over the first eight months of Mr. Trump’s presidency. Facebook staff members on Wednesday briefed the Senate and House intelligence committees, which are investigating the Russian intervention in the American election. Mr. Stamos indicated that Facebook is also cooperating with investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, writing that “we have shared our findings with U.S. authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary.” Mr. Stamos wrote that while some of the ads specifically mentioned the two candidates, most focused instead on issues that were polarizing the electorate: “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.” "
240,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, just days after saying President Trump should hold off on scrapping an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, reversed course on Wednesday and said the president made “the right call” by ending the program. Last week, as Mr. Trump weighed whether to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Mr. Ryan said, “I actually don’t think he should do that.” He added that Congress, not the president, should be making such policies. “This is something that Congress has to fix,” the speaker said. On Wednesday, he again said Congress needs to step in, but this time, he did not second-guess the president. Mr. Trump, he said, “was right in his decision” to give Congress the time to find a compromise that could protect the 800,000 young adults brought to the United States illegally as children who qualify for the program, also known as DACA. “He gave us time to work out a consensus, to find a compromise,” Mr. Ryan said. “Where does that compromise exist? That’s what we’re going to spend the next months figuring out, where that compromise is.” After Mr. Trump decided to do away with the DACA program, the issue landed in Congress’s lap, and pressure is mounting. Democrats have pressed for a stand-alone Dream Act, first drafted in 2001, to offer legal status to young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. But Mr. Ryan indicated that any legislative deal for the so-called dreamers would have to include measures more palatable to conservatives. He hinted that a legislative effort to help DACA recipients would need to be linked to efforts to increase border security. “I think there’s a serious humane issue here that needs to be dealt with, but it’s only fitting and reasonable that we also deal with some of the root causes of this problem,” he said, “because what we don’t want to have happen is another DACA problem 10 years from now.” The Senate Judiciary Committee made plans on Wednesday to hold a hearing on DACA next week, though committee aides cautioned that the timing was subject to change. Meanwhile, Democrats urged Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to immediately consider the Dream Act. “We all agree that President Trump’s decision to end DACA is a despicable act of political cowardice,” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, said at a news conference with others from her party. Nearby, Karen Caudillo, a junior at the University of Central Florida who owns an organic cleaning business, wept. Ms. Caudillo, 21, immigrated from Mexico with her family when she was 4. “I’m in tears because I have been fighting for so long to be able to sustain myself and go to school and to be productive,” she said. “And, it just feels like everything is going to waste because I could go back to Mexico.” "
241,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, is set to meet with Senate Judiciary Committee investigators behind closed doors on Thursday to answer questions about his June 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, committee officials said. Committee aides said the interview, Mr. Trump’s first with congressional investigators, will be transcribed and could last for much of the day. It will largely focus on the meeting in Trump Tower, which appears to have been set up to deliver harmful information about Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign, according to emails disclosed in June. Democrats, led by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had also agreed to testify at a public hearing before the committee and that he would probably be subpoenaed if he did not follow through on that agreement. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the panel’s chairman, declined to discuss the committee’s dealings with Mr. Trump. Lawyers for Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment. The closed-door interview is the clearest indication yet that the Senate Judiciary Committee — after months of being eclipsed by the Senate and House intelligence committees — is emerging into a higher-profile role in investigating the president, his family and his associates in the coming months. The committee is trying to get answers about the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director this spring and has staked out a broad investigation that aims to look at everything from the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia to the Obama Justice Department’s handling of the Clinton email case last year. The Judiciary Committee investigation, which began this summer, has received less public attention than the intelligence committees’, which have been looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election since early this year. But with the committees now jockeying for witnesses and documents, and the potential for public hearings this fall, that is likely to change. "

243,"The terms of the debate over President Trump’s decision to revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are familiar, as are the terms of the larger conversation about immigration in this country: On one side are hardworking immigrants; on the other are politicians who wrongly claim that these immigrants harm the economic interests of native-born Americans. As protests broke out across the United States in response to Mr. Trump’s move, reporters and immigrant advocates stressed that the administration’s actions will hurt achievers — people who have graduated from college, people who have bought houses, people who work for high-tech companies. There is nothing wrong with this story. It’s one that most, if not all, immigrants like to tell about themselves — even if their actual story doesn’t neatly fit the narrative. In fact, as Hannah Arendt pointed out in her essay “We Refugees,” written in 1943 at the height of the 20th century’s refugee crisis, people whose stories fit the narrative least well — the most desperate and the worst-wounded of the immigrants — are especially invested in thinking of themselves as destined for success and, of course, as future loyal citizens. But something goes awry when this becomes the dominant story told about immigrants in America. This has been happening for a number of years: The good people of America talk about immigrants as hard workers who conscientiously contribute to the economy. (I myself have made it onto a few lists of exemplary immigrant success stories.) In fact, DACA was designed to reward achievement: to qualify for the program, an applicant had to be in school or hold a high school diploma or equivalent, or have been honorably discharged from the armed forces. Those who hadn’t been able or lucky to meet those requirements were apparently deemed unworthy of staying in the country where they had lived since they were children. When Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning entry by citizens of predominantly Muslim countries, American technology companies responded with a lawsuit in which they stressed that immigrants have founded and run many large tech companies. The revocation of DACA has brought forth similar — and much-quoted — responses from Silicon Valley. When the president threw his support behind a reform plan that would drastically reduce immigration to this country, editorial writers argued against it by pointing out that immigrants benefit the economy. These arguments usually begin by stating that America is a “land of immigrants.” This not only is an insult to Native Americans and the descendants of those who were brought to this country against their will but also constitutes a sort of sleight of hand. It turns the stories of individual immigrants into the “story of America.” It’s one thing for individuals to base their sense of self-worth on their contribution to the American economy. It’s quite another to claim that America values immigrants because of this contribution: This paves the way to thinking that America should make decisions about immigrants based on whether they benefit the economy. It can even reframe giving safe haven to the persecuted as giving jobs to the well qualified. "
244,"Early this year, The Times brought together a group of national correspondents to write in-depth stories about regions and people who might have received short shrift in the run-up to last November’s election. One thing we would not pursue was endless post-mortems on the election itself. President Trump might not even be mentioned in these articles, conceived under the in-house rubric “Fault Lines.” “What we desperately want is for our stories to shed light, to tell our readers things about America they do not already understand, with fairness, clear eyes and empathy in abundance,” David Halbfinger, who was the deputy national editor, wrote to us in an email. The articles, mostly deep dives after many weeks of reporting, have begun rolling out. Their subjects include a look at the religious left, the collision of two worlds in an act of vandalism at an Arkansas mosque, an immigrant’s choice to “self-deport” from Iowa and a dispatch of mine from an Illinois truck stop about long-haul drivers. My latest contribution, an account of an auto parts factory in Michigan, strays a bit from the mission. It probably won’t satisfy many people still looking to understand Trump Country. "
245,"When news leaked on Monday that President Trump had decided to dismantle Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — the 2012 policy that granted administrative relief to some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors — some commentators tried to find a ray of hope in the dismal forecast. Trump, they noted, would give Congress six months to save the DACA-protected “Dreamers” from deportation with a legislative fix. Never mind that House Republicans sabotaged a chance to help Dreamers in 2013, when John Boehner, the House speaker, refused to hold a vote on an immigration-reform bill that had passed in the Senate to a vote on the House floor. Now, NPR reported, Republicans might favor a bill introduced by Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship. “Overwhelmingly, Republicans tell me: ‘Yes, I could support giving these young immigrants permanent status in our country,’ ” Curbelo told “All Things Considered,” “ ‘as long as we continue moving towards better border security, the enforcement of our immigration laws.’ ” Yet among the undocumented activists whom I got to know while reporting in Arizona earlier this year, such a compromise is hardly viewed with relief. Rather it is the Catch-22 that they have been dreading ever since Trump was elected. In emergency meetings and conference calls following Trump’s victory last November, immigrant rights activists prepared for the coming changes in federal immigration policy. Even then, they worried about what to do if Congress linked the extension of DACA’s protections with a broader enforcement crackdown. As I detailed in May, Dreamers were once viewed skeptically by other undocumented activists, who believed that campaigns designed to help Dreamers could undermine efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reforms. These rifts were largely resolved when Dreamers rallied behind efforts to help their parents after President Obama issued the executive order on DACA. By the time Senators Bernie Sanders and Dick Durbin held a private round table with immigrant rights leaders in December 2016, the general sentiment within the movement had become: divided, we fall. Erika Andiola, the first president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, argued that Democrats should filibuster any legislation that targeted undocumented immigrants, even if it helped Dreamers. Greisa Martinez, the advocacy director for United We Dream, who also attended the meeting in Sanders’s office, told me: “It’s not a choice between do you protect the Dreamers or do you protect the broader community.” She continued: “We believe that our responsibility is to be able to do both things at once. One does not come at the cost of the other.” That idealistic unity may have begun to fracture 11 days ago, when leaks began suggesting that Trump might terminate DACA, a scenario that provoked terror among DACA recipients. In their DACA applications, they were required to provide the federal government with detailed information about themselves and their parents — names, addresses — in order to gain work permits, driver’s licenses and other benefits of deferred action. “Can you imagine? The government made a promise to us: come forward, come out of the shadows and we’re going to promise you that you’re not going to be in deportation proceedings,” Reyna Montoya, a Dreamer in Phoenix, told me. “But they deferred our deportation, and now we’re there in the line.” Worried that Trump might kill the program in a late-night tweet, Montoya took to setting her alarm clock for 5 a.m., so she could start each morning by checking whether her DACA protections had been destroyed. In many cases, the stress of such uncertainty was felt not only by Dreamers but also by their families. Their fears extended beyond the nightmarish possibility of being tracked down through the information volunteered in DACA applications. Though the general public often imagines DACA recipients as college students, many of them are in fact parents or full-time employees whose relatives depend on their legal income for survival. And many undocumented family members have placed assets like cars or homes under a DACA recipient’s name, or relied on a DACA child’s Social Security number to take out loans. Even Andiola, a well-placed DACA recipient who is now the political director of Our Revolution, could lose the ability to make mortgage payments on the house that she bought for her mother, Maria Guadalupe Arreola. Arreola told me that she knows many families in the same predicament. Regardless of whether immigration agents deport the Dreamers, with DACA gone, she said, their families “will be ruined.” "

Now we need to come together in support of the 800,000 young people who are at risk from Tuesday’s catastrophic and cowardly actions of the president and the attorney general. The young people who have been protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are just as American as my native-born children. For those who came here at a young age, this is the only country they have known. They want the same things my young adult children want: security and opportunity. Some of them have been courageously assisting with relief and recovery efforts in Houston. They deserve our respect, not the callousness and dishonesty on display Tuesday in our nation’s capital. We Americans — and especially our religious and congressional leaders — need to stand up to the administration by advocating for and enacting veto-proof legal protections for the children of immigrants. (REV.) DOUGLAS L. CLARK
GUILFORD, CONN. To the Editor: President Trump’s decision to remove protections against deportation for Dreamers is economically foolish, morally troubling and politically shortsighted. Studies show that the 800,000 young immigrants granted work and study permits under DACA contribute strongly to economic growth. We should be crafting a fair route for them to seek citizenship, not making their lives harder and more uncertain. In 1994, California passed Proposition 187, a ballot initiative (later overturned in the courts) that denied many social services to illegal immigrants. Despite its initial popularity, a backlash against the law, especially among Hispanic voters, played a big part in consigning the state Republican Party to long-term electoral irrelevance and helped brand it as anti-minority and anti-immigrant. Likewise, Republican members of Congress should think twice before rubber-stamping a presidential decision that is bound to cast them in a similar unfavorable light. LEIF WELLINGTON HAASE
KENSINGTON, CALIF. To the Editor: As President Trump moves to overturn DACA, let’s pause for a moment and fathom its implications for the lives of millions of young people for whom America is the only home they have ever known. Brought to the United States as infants or children, they grew up like so many other kids, going to high school proms, donning silly outfits for Halloween, marking the Fourth of July with barbecues and fireworks, rooting for their favorite sports teams. They became Americans in every possible way. "
247,"When the Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would end an Obama-era program that shielded young undocumented immigrants from deportation, Sherwin Sheik quickly sized up the potential toll on his business. Mr. Sheik is the chief executive and founder of CareLinx, which matches home care workers with patients and their families. The company relies heavily on authorized immigrant labor, making the looming demise of the program — which has transformed around 700,000 people brought to this country as children into authorized workers — a decidedly unwelcome development. The move, Mr. Sheik said, would compound an already “disastrous situation in terms of shortages of supply.” He added, “This is a big issue we’re focusing on.” Recalling the revolt among business executives that followed President Trump’s refusal to single out white supremacists for causing violence last month in Charlottesville, Va., leaders of companies in the finance, manufacturing and technology industries, including Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase, have been quick to oppose the decision to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Those executives may have empathy for the beneficiaries of the program, known as Dreamers, as well as a broader interest in more liberal immigration policies to satisfy their labor needs. But the practical effect on their businesses will typically be minimal. The number of workers who benefit from the program is tiny alongside a national labor force of more than 150 million, and the DACA workers are spread out relatively evenly across most industries. In health care, on the other hand, the economic impact could be significant, depriving patients of help they depend on and driving up costs for families and taxpayers. "

249,"To the Editor: Re “Who Decides Whether Trump Is Unfit?,” by Peter D. Kramer and Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, Aug. 29): The growing discussion about the 25th Amendment, which provides a mechanism for presidential removal and succession, is timely and important. As it stands, the amendment contains a fatal flaw. Absent Congress’s decision to establish a body to declare the president unfit for office, the 25th Amendment requires a majority of the cabinet to act against the president. Yet if the president is erratic or irrational (rather than medically incapacitated), a president could simply fire his or her own cabinet. Congress must delegate this heavy responsibility to living former presidents and vice presidents. No one is better qualified. This group of people held the office, or were in direct line of succession, and know firsthand the pressures of the presidency, and skills required. Additionally, they no longer have political ambitions of their own and would be above the political fray. Not only that, they are trusted and respected by the American public. Regardless of what happens with Donald Trump, the United States needs a reliable mechanism in place to protect the presidency, and our democracy. Congress should pass my Strengthening and Clarifying the 25th Amendment Act. EARL BLUMENAUER

250,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has selected a dozen charitable organizations, including the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, to support with personal donations to help with Hurricane Harvey relief, White House officials said on Wednesday. Mr. Trump, one of the wealthiest men ever to hold the presidency, announced last week that he would give a total of $1 million from his own pocket. The White House named the recipients on Wednesday as part of an effort to encourage Americans to chip in with contributions, just hours after the House approved nearly $8 billion for hurricane relief and reconstruction. “The president and first lady witnessed the work of some of these groups firsthand while visiting with hurricane survivors, first responders, volunteers, and federal, state and local officials, and are proud to further assist the recovery efforts in Texas,” Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Air Force One. Mr. Trump’s history of charitable contributions has come under fire. The Washington Post won a Pulitzer Prize this year for articles reporting that many of Mr. Trump’s claims of donations over the years were exaggerated or not genuinely charitable. Sensitive to the criticism, Mr. Trump has been donating his $400,000-a-year presidential salary to charitable or governmental organizations, and aides said he chose the recipients of his hurricane donations in part from recommendations by White House reporters. The White House repeatedly asked reporters for such recommendations. The Red Cross and Salvation Army will each receive $300,000, according to the White House. Reach Out America and Samaritan’s Purse will each receive $100,000. Eight other organizations will receive $25,000 each: the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Habitat for Humanity, the Houston Humane Society, Operation Blessing International, Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon. Mr. Trump’s reported donations came as another hurricane was bearing down on Florida. He has not said whether he will repeat the gesture for organizations providing relief for the new hurricane, Irma. "
251,"WASHINGTON — It is the scenario that President Trump’s most conservative followers considered their worst nightmare, and on Wednesday it seemed to come true: The dealmaking political novice, whose ideology and loyalty were always fungible, cut a deal with Democrats. If Mr. Trump’s agreement with the two Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, to increase the debt limit and finance the government for three months did not yet represent the breaking point between the president and his core, hard-right base of support, it certainly put him closer than he has ever been to tipping his fragile political coalition into open revolt. Stunned and irate, conservative leaders denounced news that Mr. Trump had agreed to rely on Democratic votes to win congressional approval for a temporary extension of the debt ceiling and funding of the government until mid-December. “These are the moments that can derail President Trump’s presidency,” said David Bozell, the president of For America and a Trump supporter, who added that the president’s base would be watching the next few months very carefully. “He is not Teflon,” Mr. Bozell added. “Trump spent some of his own political capital today.” Adam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, offered a searing judgment of the president: “Talk about burning bridges with the grass-roots.” “Meet the Swamp,” read the headline on the Breitbart News site. Beneath it was a picture of Mr. Trump meeting at the White House with Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Schumer and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. "
252,"WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate health committee said Wednesday that he hoped the panel would reach a consensus by the end of next week on a small, bipartisan bill to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent prices from skyrocketing next year under the Affordable Care Act. “The blame will be on every one of us, and deservedly so,” if senators fail to reach agreement, said the chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. Mr. Alexander laid out elements of a possible compromise at a hearing on Wednesday: Republicans would agree to continued payment of subsidies to insurance companies to compensate them for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. Democrats would agree to give states freedom to relax some insurance requirements in the Affordable Care Act. “To get a result,” Mr. Alexander said, “Democrats will have to agree to something — more flexibility for states — that some may be reluctant to support. And Republicans will have to agree to something, additional funding through the Affordable Care Act, that some may be reluctant to support. That is called a compromise.” The senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, said: “Threading this needle won’t be easy. But I do believe an agreement that protects patients and families from higher costs and uncertainty, and maintains the guardrails in our current health care system, is possible.” The seven-year Republican push to repeal the Affordable Care Act appeared to reach a dead end this summer when multiple versions of repeal legislation failed to gain even a simple majority in the Senate. Lawmakers in both parties said Congress would have to get back to a more orderly approach to making health care policy, and Wednesday’s hearing was a start. "
253,"MANDAN, N.D. — President Trump on Wednesday used the backdrop of an oil refinery here to repeat his call for an overhaul of the nation’s tax code, including a steep cut in the business tax rate. Speaking to a small but friendly crowd in a state that he won by 36 points in November, Mr. Trump urged North Dakotans to pressure members of Congress to support a plan that he promised to detail within weeks. “My administration is working with Congress to develop a plan,” Mr. Trump said, promising a one-page tax form, a “major, major” middle-class tax cut and a top rate for businesses that he hopes will be as low as 15 percent, down from 35 percent. The president said the current rates on businesses were the highest in the developed world and were putting American companies at a significant disadvantage as they tried to compete with businesses in other countries. “We want our companies to hire and grow in America,” Mr. Trump said. “That is how we will all succeed and grow together.” Pitching his plan as something that should have bipartisan appeal, Mr. Trump noted that President Ronald Reagan won passage of a major tax plan with a Congress led by Democrats. “Are you listening, Heidi?” Mr. Trump joked, motioning toward Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the state’s Democratic senator, who joined the president on Air Force One for the flight to her state. “Yes, Heidi is listening.” “Thank you, Heidi,” he added. “We’re not going to put her on the spot.” Ms. Heitkamp, who faces a difficult re-election campaign next year in the heavily Republican state, has been coy about whether she will support Mr. Trump’s tax plan. But the president made clear on Wednesday that he wants to persuade her. He also made clear that he intends to make his tax proposals a key part of his legacy. “We are not surrendering anymore,” Mr. Trump said. "
254,"WASHINGTON — Officials at Washington National Cathedral will remove two stained-glass windows that pay tribute to the Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, a decision reached after two years of discussion and made more urgent by the recent racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, Va. Church leaders voted Tuesday night in an “overwhelming majority” to remove the windows and announced the decision on Wednesday in a letter, concluding that the windows “tell an incomplete and misleading account of our history.” The two 4-by-6-foot windows were donated in 1953 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and a private donor, but were not noticed by current church leaders until 2015. “We were joining a conversation that was very much alive,” said Mariann Edgar Budde, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who learned about the windows after the mass shooting in 2015 by a white supremacist at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C. “It was no longer abstract. It was right there in our cathedral.” Scaffolding went up Wednesday at the cathedral, the site of state funerals and memorial services for several presidents and the second largest church building in the country, after the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. Removal of the windows will begin Thursday; they will be cleaned, conserved, stored and potentially moved to another part of the church to be used in an educational setting unaffiliated with worship. “As difficult as it is to remove something that was dedicated in a sacred space, we felt it was a Christian imperative and our moral responsibility,” Bishop Budde said. “They are not the objects we wish to have in a sacred worship space.” The decision comes as cities across the country have removed plaques and statues commemorating the Confederacy, and others are weighing whether to follow suit. While opponents say the monuments should be removed because they celebrate a shameful racial legacy, President Trump has said he sees a slippery slope toward erasing other contentious aspects of the nation’s history. Still, some descendants of the Confederate generals themselves have applauded the efforts to remove or rename monuments and landmarks. "
255,"NEWARK — Senator Robert Menendez spent seven years enjoying a “life of luxury he could not afford” in return for acting as a personal senator to a wealthy ophthalmologist in Florida, federal prosecutors told jurors here on Wednesday during the opening chapter of a case whose outcome could reverberate far beyond New Jersey. But a defense lawyer argued that those actions were rooted in a friendship — “that one word, friendship, that the evidence will show is the true nature of that relationship. And acting out of friendship is not improper, it is not corrupt, it is not illegal.” As both the prosecution and the defense presented their opening statements in the federal corruption case against Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, and Dr. Salomon Melgen, the ophthalmologist, they offered little in the way of new evidence or facts. Instead, they debated questions that will be central to the case: What constitutes a permissible friendship with a politician? What represents an official act by a senator? And whom does a senator work for and represent? The case has attracted wide interest because it is the first time in decades that a sitting United States Senator faces a federal bribery trial and the verdict could have broad political implications at a time of deep polarization in Washington. “This case isn’t really about what happened, it’s about why it happened,” Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, said. Mr. Lowell said Dr. Melgen and Mr. Menendez had been friends for many years and the doctor had given Mr. Menendez gifts well before he entered the Senate. A lawyer for Dr. Melgen, Kirk Ogrosky, made a similar argument. “I’m here to tell you that every single thing my client shared with his friend and every single political contribution he gave was out of friendship done out of sincere belief that Senator Menendez was good for this country,” he said. "
256,"President Trump’s immigration policies faced a renewed legal onslaught on Wednesday, as a coalition of Democratic attorneys general, nonprofit groups and private companies announced they would oppose his rollback of Obama-era protections for people who entered the country illegally as children. In an echo of the campaign against Mr. Trump’s effort this year to ban travelers from parts of the Muslim world, a group of 16 attorneys general — all Democrats — filed suit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, claiming that Mr. Trump had improperly upended the policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. Led by Attorneys General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Bob Ferguson of Washington, they alleged Mr. Trump’s shift was driven by racial animus toward Mexican Americans and that the Trump administration failed to follow federal rules governing executive policy making. On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration would phase out DACA beginning next March. The decision came as a group of Republican attorneys general threatened to sue the administration if it did not end the program. Announcing the legal challenge Wednesday alongside a crowd of young immigrants and immigration advocates, Mr. Schneiderman accused the Trump administration of using the threat of lawsuits as a “pretext” that hid the president’s true motives: bias against immigrants and Latinos. Mr. Schneiderman’s lawsuit said that “ending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination of President Trump’s oft-stated commitments — whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof — to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.” "
257,"A reporter in West Virginia who was arrested four months ago after he aggressively questioned Tom Price, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, will not be prosecuted, officials announced Wednesday. The May 9 arrest of the reporter, Dan Heyman, had stoked concerns about possible efforts to stymie the free press. In a joint statement released by the Kanawha County prosecutor’s office and Mr. Heyman’s legal team said that the State had determined “after a careful review” that Mr. Heyman had not acted unlawfully. He had been charged with a misdemeanor count of willful disruption of governmental processes. Mr. Heyman, a reporter for the Public News Service, has maintained that he was simply asking questions of a federal official as that official walked through the West Virginia State Capitol. In another statement released Wednesday, Mr. Heyman said he was “very relieved” by the state’s decision. “Facing six months of jail time for asking a question as a journalist was pretty troubling,” he said. “We all need to keep asking the tough questions of elected officials,” he continued. “The intense response to my arrest gives me confidence that people will defend the free press, because they believe in it.” "
258,"Puerto Ricans have ample experience with hurricanes, but the storm approaching on Wednesday brought an added level of anxiety. The island’s dire financial straits have left essential public works, from power plants to retaining walls, weakened by years of scrimping on maintenance. “This is not an event that is occurring in the Netherlands, where they’re ready for it and they have a strong economy,” said Miguel A. Soto-Class, president of the Center for a New Economy, a research group on the island. “This is an event happening on a very poor island that’s been in a depression for the last 10 years.” Puerto Rico effectively sought bankruptcy protection in May, burdened with about $123 billion in bond debt and unfunded pension obligations. Its case is being handled in federal court under a special new law, called Promesa, because the existing bankruptcy law excludes Puerto Rico. Under Promesa, Puerto Rico’s finances must be supervised by a federal board until its house is back in order, a process that is expected to take years. Relations between the board and the elected government of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló were contentious even before Hurricane Irma, with the governor first agreeing to a five-year austerity plan, then reversing course and threatening to go to prison rather than accepting the entire package. In particular, the governor has refused to furlough government workers, and to reduce the pensions of retired government employees by an average 10 percent. The fiscal oversight board has sued the governor, asking the court to order him to carry out the entire austerity plan. The furloughs were supposed to have begun on Sept. 1. Despite the legal dispute, the board’s executive director, Natalie Jaresko, said in a statement Wednesday that the board was “working closely with Governor Rosselló to coordinate support for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storm.” "
259,"WASHINGTON — President Trump insisted that he and President Xi Jinping had a “very strong phone call” on Wednesday. But if Mr. Trump kept alive the rapport he has painstakingly cultivated with the Chinese leader, the 45-minute call still served to underscore the widening fissures between Washington and Beijing and the deepening confusion about how the Trump administration is managing the relationship. The National Security Council is conducting a review of the White House’s China policy — taking into account Mr. Trump’s populist trade agenda and differences over how to curb the rogue government in North Korea — but it has commanded little attention. Aside from Mr. Trump himself, it remains unclear who in the administration wields genuine influence on the relationship. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who helped broker the first meeting between the two presidents last April, was once expected to function as a high-level conduit. But his involvement in China has waned; he did not accept an invitation from the Chinese to go to Beijing this month for a visit that some expected would be in preparation for Mr. Trump’s state visit in November. Other officials who have staked a claim to China, such as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, have run afoul of Mr. Trump, either on specific policies or broader issues. And Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, is not playing the coordinating role on China that several of his predecessors did. That lack of a guiding hand has contributed to the administration’s dissonant signals toward Beijing. Two months ago, Mr. Ross tried to negotiate a deal with China on steel exports, only to be publicly rebuffed by Mr. Trump. On Sunday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, threatened to cut off trade with any country that does business with North Korea — an unsubtle, and impractical, warning to its main trading partner, China. "
260,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council that would effectively empower the United States Navy and Air Force to interdict North Korean ships at sea, inspect them to determine whether they are carrying weapons material or fuel into the country, and use “all necessary measures” to enforce compliance. The language is included in a remarkably broad draft that would ban the shipment of all crude oil, refined petroleum and natural gas to North Korea, essentially seeking to plunge a country of 25 million people into a deep freeze this winter if its leaders fail to begin giving up their nuclear weapon and missile programs. The resolution — circulated three days after the North conducted its largest nuclear test to date — would also seek to block all the assets of Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, and virtually all the assets of the country’s military and its sole political party. The resolution, which the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said this week she wanted to bring to a vote by next Monday, seems certain to meet vociferous objections from China and Russia. Both hold veto power at the Security Council. But if the sections authorizing interdictions at sea survive, it could set the stage for some of the tensest encounters on the high seas since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when President John F. Kennedy ordered a complete blockade around the island to prevent Soviet missiles from being installed. The resolution calls for something far less comprehensive than a total blockade, which is widely considered an act of war. But it would authorize a committee of the Security Council to “designate vessels for nonconsensual inspections” and authorize all members of the United Nations — using military vessels and aircraft — “to inspect on the high seas any vessel designated by the committee.” "
261,"Federal prosecutors in New York announced on Wednesday the filing of a new indictment that charges a former Turkish economy minister and three other Turks with participating in a broad conspiracy to violate the United States’ sanctions against Iran. The new charges represent a significant expansion of a case that had already drawn the attention of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, senior members of the Trump administration and President Trump’s informal adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani has been retained by one defendant, Reza Zarrab, to try to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to his case. Mr. Giuliani has met with Mr. Erdogan to discuss the case; in the past, Mr. Erdogan claimed there were “malicious” intentions behind Mr. Zarrab’s prosecution. Prosecutors have charged that Mr. Zarrab, a gold trader and dual citizen of Iran and Turkey, and his co-defendants conspired to facilitate millions of dollars in transactions on behalf of Iran and other sanctioned entities through the use of front companies and false documentation. The most prominent new defendant charged was Mehmet Zafer Caglayan, 59, who served as the Turkish economy minister from 2011 until 2013 and currently serves in the Turkish Parliament, the indictment said. While Mr. Caglayan was a minister, the indictment charged, he “received tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bribes in cash and jewelry from the proceeds of the scheme to provide services” to the Iranian government and concealed those services from United States regulators. The new indictment also said that high-ranking government officials in Iran and Turkey “participated in and protected this scheme,” with some officials taking bribes. In addition, the indictment said, the leaders of a bank that is majority-owned by the Turkish government “participated in the design of fraudulent transactions intended to deceive U.S. regulators and foreign banks.” Other court filings show it is Halkbank. The new indictment comes at a time of testy relations between Turkey and the United States, which are both members of NATO. Last week, Mr. Erdogan denounced another federal indictment — against three of his bodyguards over a brawl in Washington during his visit in May. Twelve other Turkish security officers were charged in that case in June. Mr. Erdogan has also repeatedly called on the American authorities to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. He is the leader of a Turkish Muslim sect accused by Mr. Erdogan of having helped orchestrate an attempted coup that roiled Turkey in July 2016. Mr. Gulen, a longtime critic of Mr. Erdogan’s, has denied any connection to the coup attempt and vowed to fight extradition. In addition to Mr. Caglayan, the new indictment charged Suleyman Aslan, a former general manager of the bank; Levent Balkan, another former bank executive; and Abdullah Happani, an associate of Mr. Zarrab’s. The four defendants charged on Wednesday are not in United States custody, prosecutors said. Mr. Zarrab has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, had no comment. "
262,"This week, the Senate will do something it hasn’t done in seven years: hold bipartisan hearings on the future of the Affordable Care Act. Serious and creative ideas will be presented. But don’t expect big policy changes anytime soon. Experts and lobbyists close to the congressional process say that, despite consensus that Obamacare’s markets are too thin and too expensive, very few reforms have any chance of becoming law before insurers begin selling Obamacare plans for next year. Instead, the most likely action — if there is any — will simply be to patch cracks in the market caused by President Trump and prevent him from doing more damage. Congressional leaders are looking at a fix that would bring certainty to payments the federal government makes to subsidize plans for low-income Americans. Those payments, which are called cost-sharing reductions and go to the insurers, are outlined in the Affordable Care Act, but the law left it unclear whether the money could be distributed without a clear spending bill from Congress. So far, the payments have been made every month. But President Trump has repeatedly threatened to stop them. Many health insurers have said their worries about the payments have led them to exit Obamacare markets or charge substantially higher insurance prices next year. Legislation that assures the subsidies for a year or two could tie the president’s hands and reduce the uncertainty for nervous insurers. But even though some Republican congressional leaders have embraced the idea, it’s not clear whether enough Republicans will end up voting yes. "
263,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee to lead the Justice Department’s civil rights division defended his work on both sides of discrimination cases on Wednesday during his confirmation hearing, seeking to ease the concerns of civil rights advocates who have denounced his nomination. Mr. Trump’s choice, Eric S. Dreiband, a partner at the Jones Day law firm and a former George W. Bush administration official, vowed to enforce the law as vigorously as he defended major corporations. “In private practice, lawyers are ethically bound to zealously advocate for their clients,” said Mr. Dreiband. “I think it prepares you well to serve in public service.” Mr. Dreiband has defended major corporations in discrimination cases related to age, pregnancy and religion. He also represented the University of North Carolina last year in litigation against the Justice Department over transgender bathroom access, and in one of the most high-profile instances, he argued before the Supreme Court in 2015 that Abercrombie & Fitch had been justified in refusing to hire a Muslim woman because she wore a head scarf that clashed with its dress code. Civil rights activists have condemned Mr. Dreiband’s nomination to lead the division, which handles voting rights, policing and discrimination cases. As America’s top civil rights lawyer, he would inherit a number of politically charged investigations, including the Justice Department’s joint inquiry into last month’s deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., at a counterprotest of white nationalists. Mr. Dreiband pledged to uphold the division’s mission. “Anyone who perpetrates crimes or any other civil rights violations that come within the jurisdiction of the civil rights division should know — they should be on notice, if I’m confirmed — that the civil rights division is coming for them,” Mr. Dreiband told the Senate Judiciary Committee, deploring “the bigotry and ideology” of white supremacy. "
264,"To the Editor: Re “White Supremacist Groups Don’t Deserve Tax Exemptions” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Aug. 29): David J. Herzig and Samuel D. Brunson argue that the I.R.S. should revoke the tax-exempt status of our organizations, New Century Foundation and VDARE Foundation, because we are “white supremacist groups.” Anyone who has actually read our websites will laugh at this. The sole quotation that the writers use to support the claim of white supremacism — from New Century Foundation’s statement of purpose — is “We also believe the European-American majority has legitimate group interests now being ignored.” Would this statement be “supremacist” if it were about Hispanics or blacks? The VDARE Foundation focuses on immigration and has long supported policies very close to those on which President Trump ran — and won. Do the authors think Mr. Trump and his 63 million voters are white supremacists? The writers cite the Supreme Court’s 1983 decision revoking tax exemption for Bob Jones University as precedent. However, Bob Jones was engaging in conduct that the court found to be racially discriminatory. We are not engaging in any such conduct. We are exercising the right of free speech. The I.R.S. lacks authority to withdraw a tax exemption simply because Mr. Herzig and Mr. Brunson disagree with us. JARED TAYLOR PETER BRIMELOW OAKTON, VA. Mr. Taylor is president of the New Century Foundation, and Mr. Brimelow is president of the VDARE Foundation. "
265,"“BoJack Horseman,” Netfiix’s animated series about a Hollywood has-been who happens to be a talking horse, has had a storybook existence. Released in 2014 to shrugs, it caught on after its second season, becoming a fiercely loved critic’s favorite and a fixture on top-10 lists. By the logic of the show’s world, in which success is fleeting and disaster is one ill-advised pitch meeting away, Season 4 (available to stream on Friday) represents a dangerous moment. Can it keep its momentum? Can it maintain its tricky balance, as a lovingly acidic showbiz satire that’s also a moving meditation on, and deconstruction of, the showbiz satire genre? To paraphrase Sarah Lynn, the debauched child star who appeared alongside BoJack in the ’80s sitcom “Horsin’ Around”: that’s too much to expect, man. The 12 episodes of the new season have episodes and moments equal to the show’s best. They also have ideas that don’t pan out, and an overall lack of cohesion — the main characters seem sequestered in separate story lines that don’t really mesh. A weekend binge is still recommended, but it won’t have the impact of the second or third seasons. For the uninitiated, “BoJack Horseman” is set in Hollywoo — so called since the D in the Hollywood sign was destroyed in Season 1 — and in a world where animals and humans coexist without comment. Ineffably silly animal jokes remain one of the show’s chief pleasures. In the opening episode, the sassy bovine waitress at the Silver Spoon Diner announces, “This cow likes getting tipped.” "
266,"WASHINGTON — Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday that he would resign in mid-October, an unexpected decision that gives President Trump greater leverage over central bank policy. Mr. Fischer, 73, cited “personal reasons” in a brief letter addressed to Mr. Trump. His four-year term was to have ended next June. The resignation puts immediate pressure on the Trump administration to replenish the Fed’s depleted board. Mr. Fischer’s departure would leave only three people in the seven board seats, the smallest number of governors in the Fed’s history. It also means that Mr. Trump can appoint a majority of the Fed’s board, bending the direction of its policy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants the Fed to loosen some of the regulatory strictures it has imposed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Among the decisions the president will have to make is whether to replace Janet L. Yellen as chairwoman or keep her on when her four-year term ends in early February. He faces a choice between a nominee who, like Ms. Yellen, stresses economic growth, or someone more palatable to conservatives who favor greater emphasis on curbing inflation. Mr. Fischer joined the Fed’s board in May 2014 after a distinguished career as an academic economist and an international policy maker. He sometimes argued that the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly, sparring with Ms. Yellen. But he provided reliable support for measures strengthening financial regulation. "
267,"You star in ‘‘Difficult People’’ and ‘‘American Horror Story’’ this season, but I know you from ‘‘Billy on the Street,’’ your interview game show. I’m always nervous interviewing people who are interviewers. How has it changed you? It has made me much more sympathetic to all those Greenpeace people. I will always take your flier, because I know what it’s like. What makes a good interview for you? I might have jokes in my head, but the best interactions come when I listen to the person’s response. I let go of whatever my plan might have been, and I meet this person where they are, and I let them lead me wherever they want to go, to a certain extent. It always bothers me when I watch interviews — even serious ones on a news program — and there are no follow-up questions, and the journalist sticks to their plan, and they don’t let the conversation guide them. The ‘‘on the street’’ character comes from your real passion for pop culture and celebrity culture — but the show mocks your character for having that passion. You’re the butt of the joke. For the most part, the comedy of ‘‘Billy on the Street’’ comes from the fact that he never evolves. He’s funny because he sticks to his guns about what’s important, and what’s important is whether Cate Blanchett was snubbed this year. It’s me satirizing my disproportionate passion for the entertainment industry. I’ve had a subscription to Entertainment Weekly since I was 7 years old, and I would read it cover to cover. My parents would take me to Broadway shows and indie movies and foreign films and big studio movies, and I absorbed everything. But as I got older, I realized: This is ridiculous. I still love it all, but I use up a lot of space in my brain to think about these things. Now that you’ve seen the business up close, are you still as obsessed? I really still am a fan. I stayed up an hour too late last night because I got sucked down a Wikipedia hole because I couldn’t remember how many V.M.A.s Madonna has and what she won for. And I started to think: Wait a second, how many Grammys does she have? Was she even nominated for a Grammy before she won for ‘‘Ray of Light’’? And this has nothing to do with my job. I’m not doing anything with Madonna. This is just me, this is how I spend my time and these are the things I’m interested in. I really am ride or die for Madonna. "
268,"The longtime owners of Starrett City, the sprawling Brooklyn housing complex overlooking Jamaica Bay, are selling the development for more than $850 million, and among those who stand to benefit is President Trump, a partial owner. Starrett City is the largest federally subsidized housing development in the country, and the sale will require the approval of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and state housing officials, raising potential conflicts of interest for Mr. Trump and his family. Mr. Trump owns a 4 percent stake in the complex, according to his federal financial disclosure forms; other members of the Trump family also own stakes in the partnership. The buyer is a joint venture of the Brooksville Company, a recently formed residential real estate firm, and Rockpoint Group, a private equity firm that invests in real estate. The pending deal, which is expected to close early next year, was announced to tenants, employees and elected officials on Wednesday. Representatives Hakeem Jeffries, whose district includes Starrett City, and Elijah E. Cummings, a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, highlighted the potential conflict of interest in July when rumors circulated in New York that Starrett City would be refinanced. “The president is on both sides of the negotiation — he oversees the government entity providing taxpayer funds and he pockets some of that money himself,” they wrote in a July 7 letter to the Donald J. Trump Trust, which holds the president’s business interests, and Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Trump’s share of the proceeds — after the partners pay off their mortgage, transfer taxes and other transaction costs — could be about $14 million, according to real estate executives familiar with the details who spoke anonymously because they have no authority to disclose them. "
269,"In moments of national fragility, history rears its head. The past becomes a vast storehouse of grievance. Revived memory is manipulated to produce violent nationalism. This is what is happening today in the United States, a nation suddenly at war with its past. There is a reason for this war. America has been adept at evasion. A nation conceived as exceptional, a beacon to the world, could not but run from its original sin. How often I have wondered at all the museums and memorials to the Holocaust, the great crime against European Jewry that did not happen here, of which the United States was neither perpetrator nor victim. By comparison, the great American crime of slavery, the laceration and lynching of black bodies, was scarcely memorialized. Today there is a movement in people’s minds. If the 20th century saw decolonization and the fall of empires, the 21st century is seeing the internal corollary of that process: a relentless challenge in Western societies to the white mind-set, white assumptions, white amnesia. How, after all, could those Confederate statues stand for so long and so prominently in so many American cities when they memorialized men who took up arms for slavery and in opposition to the Union? It is hard and painful to refute your ancestry, disentangle individual honor from a lost and morally indefensible cause like that of the Confederacy, knit together a nation after a Civil War and 750,000 dead. Evasions accumulate. The South nursed its wounds, rewrote the story, adjusted the cause. Slavery died; Jim Crow began. The long struggle endured for black Americans to be heard, to be seen, to be equal before the law, to be not three-fifths of a human being but human beings in full. Yet, the issue behind the obfuscations was clear enough, enunciated by Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, who put his “great truth” in unequivocal terms: “That the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition.” Or, as Mississippi declared in seceding, “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world.” This is the cause for which Gen. Robert E. Lee fought; and it was of course the proposed removal of his statue in Charlottesville that precipitated the violence last month between leftists and the white supremacists who wanted Lee kept in place and were willing, in one instance, to kill for him. "
270,"WASHINGTON — On a sweltering day earlier this summer, operatives with the Central Intelligence Agency gathered at Arlington National Cemetery to bury two of their own. Brian Ray Hoke and Nathaniel Patrick Delemarre, elite gunslingers who worked for the C.I.A.’s paramilitary force, were laid to rest after a firefight with Islamic State militants near Jalalabad in Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan. There had been scant mention of Mr. Hoke’s death in local news reports in Leesburg, Va., his home, and nothing at all about Mr. Delemarre in news accounts in the Florida Panhandle, where his family lives. Their deaths this past October were never acknowledged by the C.I.A., beyond two memorial stars chiseled in a marble wall at the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va. Today there are at least 18 stars on that wall representing the number of C.I.A. personnel killed in Afghanistan — a tally that has not been previously reported, and one that rivals the number of C.I.A. operatives killed in the wars in Vietnam and Laos nearly a half century ago. The deaths are a reflection of the heavy price the agency has paid in a secret, nearly 16-year-old war, where thousands of C.I.A. operatives have served since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The deaths of Mr. Hoke, 42, and Mr. Delemarre, 47, show how the C.I.A. continues to move from traditional espionage to the front lines, and underscore the pressure the agency faces now that President Trump has pledged to keep the United States in Afghanistan with no end in sight. “We are going to be fighting this war for a very long time,” said Ken Stiles, a former C.I.A. counterterrorism analyst who worked closely with paramilitary officers in Afghanistan and who lost three friends in the war. Mr. Hoke grew up in South Dakota, played violin and football in high school, graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a degree in oceanography and in 1997 passed the grueling test to become a member of the Navy SEALs. He was deployed to the Middle East and Europe, and in 2004 joined the C.I.A. "
271,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan will participate on Thursday in a TimesTalks conversation with The New York Times, moderated by Jonathan Weisman, the Times’s congressional editor. When and where: 8:40 a.m. Eastern at the Newseum in Washington. How to watch: The conversation will be streamed live to The Times’s home page, YouTube page and Facebook page. How to participate: A portion of the conversation will be devoted to questions from the audience, including the audience on Facebook. Follow along and put your questions in the comment section, and they may be put to Mr. Ryan. Until then, here is a primer on what’s coming on Capitol Hill and what’s sure to be discussed with Mr. Ryan: After eight months political infighting and little legislative action, Congress returns to Washington from the August recess facing a crushing September. This month could determine whether Republicans deliver on any of their big promises before next year’s midterm elections. There is no time to spare: Government funding could run out at the end of September. The debt ceiling could be breached within weeks. And there is that promised rewrite of the tax code. The ability of Republican leaders to handle these tasks may determine how long the party stays in power. President Trump’s approval ratings have been sliding, and whispers have been growing louder as to whether the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, or Mr. Ryan will need to step aside if the tax overhaul collapses, like the repeal of the Affordable Care Act did. "
272,"WASHINGTON — President Trump struck a deal with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday to increase the debt limit and finance the government until mid-December, blindsiding his own Republican allies as he reached across the aisle to resolve a major dispute for the first time since taking office. The agreement would avert a fiscal showdown later this month without the bloody, partisan battle that many had anticipated by combining a debt ceiling increase and stopgap spending measure with relief aid to Texas and other areas devastated by Hurricane Harvey. But without addressing the fundamental underlying issues, it set up the prospect for an even bigger clash at the end of the year. In embracing the three-month deal, Mr. Trump accepted a Democratic proposal that had been rejected earlier in the day by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Mr. Trump’s snap decision at a White House meeting caught Republican leaders off guard and reflected friction between the president and his party. After weeks of criticizing Republican leaders for failing to pass legislation, Mr. Trump signaled that he was willing to cross party lines to score some much-desired legislative victories. The deal to keep the government open and paying its debts until Dec. 15 represented an extraordinary public turn for the president, who has for much of his term set himself up on the right flank of the Republican Party. But it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump’s collaboration with Democrats foreshadowed a more sustained shift in strategy by a president who has presented himself as a master dealmaker or amounted to just a one-time instinctual reaction of a mercurial leader momentarily eager to poke his estranged allies. Mr. Trump not only accepted the spending-and-debt plan advanced by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, but also aligned himself with them on immigration. A day after rescinding President Barack Obama’s program protecting younger illegal immigrants on the grounds that it went beyond a president’s authority, Mr. Trump said he wanted to work with Democrats to legalize the program. "
273,"Silicon Valley has long preferred to remain aloof from national politics, but the Trump era has altered that stance. In recent months, tech luminaries have repeatedly clashed with the president, criticizing his executive order on Muslim immigration, his ban on transgender troops, his “many sides” equivocation on white supremacists and his Tuesday announcement that he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which lets young undocumented immigrants remain in the country. A politically awakened Silicon Valley, buttressed by the tech industry’s growing economic power, could potentially alter politics long after President Trump has left the scene. But if the tech industry becomes a political force, what sort of policies will it push? A new survey by political scientists at Stanford University suggests a mostly straightforward answer — with one glaring twist. The study is the first comprehensive look at the political attitudes of wealthy technologists, whose views have long been misunderstood to the point of caricature by many outside the industry. The findings of the study, which is currently under peer review, were presented last week to the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association. The survey suggests a novel but paradoxical vision of the future of American politics: Technologists could help push lawmakers, especially Democrats, further to the left on many social and economic issues. But they may also undermine the influence of some of the Democrats’ most stalwart supporters, including labor unions. And they may strive to push Democrats away from regulation on business — including the growing calls for greater rules around the tech industry. Over all, the study showed that tech entrepreneurs are very liberal — among some of the most left-leaning Democrats you can find. They are overwhelmingly in favor of economic policies that redistribute wealth, including higher taxes on rich people and lots of social services for the poor, including universal health care. Their outlook is cosmopolitan and globalist — they support free trade and more open immigration, and they score low on measures of “racial resentment.” "
274,"At the age of 7, Ayad Akhtar, the son of two doctors in suburban Milwaukee, was seized by a religious fervor. He began asking his parents to take him to the one mosque in the area, a converted schoolhouse on the city’s Polish south side that they only occasionally attended. He taught himself to pray, and he saw the Prophet Muhammad in his dreams. One year, on the day in the calendar when some Muslims say all of creation bowed in respect to Muhammad, he stayed up all night, looking out his bedroom window and waiting to see the trees bend. “I don’t know why, but I was a very sensitive kid. I had an acute awareness of splendor,” Mr. Akhtar told me in one of the conversations we had over the summer. “The only thing that really responded to that register of life for me was the Quran — and ‘Star Wars.’” His devotion to Islam deepened until he reached high school and encountered a teacher who introduced him to the European Modernists: Kafka, Camus and others. Mr. Akhtar, who is now 46, went off to Brown, got a graduate degree in film at Columbia and then spent a big chunk of his early adulthood, six years, writing a novel in the style of his literary heroes. The book was 600-plus pages — and unpublishable. One friend considered it “unbearable.” For Mr. Akhtar, the response was both crushing and liberating: “I just thought, this is tiring, and I’m not even good at it.” What followed was an astounding creative explosion, both in its volume and quality. Over the course of four years, he produced a well-reviewed novel, “American Dervish,” a comic retelling of his own childhood, narrated by a boy from a secular Muslim household who turns deeply religious. His play “Disgraced,” an emotionally raw drama focused on a culturally conflicted Pakistani-American lawyer, was awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for drama. Mr. Akhtar’s subject has been the tension between the sacred and the secular — how to honor one’s culture, including its ancient religion, without being imprisoned by it. In October, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, he returns to Broadway for the first time since “Disgraced,” and his new play, “Junk,” marks yet another creative turn. The setting is Wall Street in the 1980s and the battle between an entitled old-money establishment and a new wave of aggressive corporate raiders. Like his other work, “Junk” is intensely interested in the issue of identity, but with a twist: There are no Muslim characters. This latest work is a progression rather than a departure for Mr. Akhtar. He once again mercilessly examines a faith and culture — in this case, money and Wall Street — and his characters are subject to the pull of a powerful orthodoxy. An idealistic journalist in the story sets out to “torpedo every piety of this new faux-religion of finance” but edges too close and is compromised and subsumed. The drama is not an overt comment on the current political moment, but it is a kind of parable. It implies we have all been co-opted, having traded our healthy suspicion of people with vast wealth for something more like worship. "

On today’s episode: • Peter Baker, who covers the White House, takes us back to June 15, 2012, when President Obama announced an executive action that would establish a program for young immigrants who had come to the United States illegally. • We talk about the origins and significance of the program with Cecilia Muñoz, who was Mr. Obama’s chief domestic policy adviser when he signed DACA. "
278,"Good morning on this wet Wednesday. The Trump administration announced yesterday it was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ordered by the Obama administration in 2012. In response, protesters around the city unleashed their tears, fears and chants at demonstrations from Trump Tower to Foley Square. Known as DACA, the program has offered temporary protection from deportation to nearly 800,000 people who were brought to the country illegally as children, allowing them to obtain work permits, be eligible for driver’s licenses and complete their schooling. It changed the lives of about 30,000 New Yorkers. Here’s a guide on what the decision means for DACA recipients going forward. Who will be affected right now? The cancellation is not immediate, but Mr. Trump called on Congress to replace the policy with legislation before it expires on March 5, 2018. Meanwhile, no new applications will be accepted. Current DACA holders have only until Oct. 5 to renew two-year permits set to expire on or before March 5. Does the Trump administration’s change mean Dreamers will be deported? Immigration officials said in their own Frequently Asked Questions document that immigrants who gave their personal information to the government to receive this legal status will not have the information “proactively provided” to immigration officials. There are exceptions, including cases deemed to be threats to public safety or national security. "
279,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Most late-night TV hosts were back on the air on Tuesday after a two-week break. As always seems to be the case, the news from Washington gave them plenty to discuss. This time, it was President Trump’s order to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The initiative allows the children brought to the United States by undocumented parents, often called “Dreamers,” to remain in the country as adults. Trevor Noah pointed out that the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was the one to announce the decision at a news briefing. Seth Meyers wanted to know why more Republican politicians do not oppose Mr. Trump — especially now, as DACA is broadly popular. Jimmy Kimmel said that Mr. Trump seemed most interested in ending the program because his predecessor had enforced it. Mr. Trump suggested on Tuesday that Congress should figure out how to replace DACA. Mr. Kimmel indicated that he wasn’t feeling rosy about that prospect. "
280,"WASHINGTON — Breaking ranks with many of their fellow Republicans, a group of prominent politicians filed briefs on Tuesday urging the Supreme Court to rule that extreme political gerrymandering — the drawing of voting districts to give lopsided advantages to the party in power — violates the Constitution. The briefs were signed by Republicans including Senator John McCain of Arizona; Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio; Bob Dole, the former Republican Senate leader from Kansas and the party’s 1996 presidential nominee; the former senators John C. Danforth of Missouri, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming; and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a former governor of California. “Partisan gerrymandering has become a tool for powerful interests to distort the democratic process,” reads a brief filed by Mr. McCain and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, on Oct. 3. The Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican State Leadership Committee all filed briefs on the other side. They urged the Supreme Court to reject a challenge to State Assembly districts in Wisconsin that, by some measures, gave Republicans outsize political power unjustified by the overall vote. Charles Fried, a Harvard law professor who served as United States solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan, and who is among the lawyers representing Republican politicians urging the Supreme Court to reject extreme political gerrymanders, said it was important to take the long view and to act on principle. “It’s not a partisan issue,” he said. “We are working for our republic, and not for Republicans.” Partisan gerrymandering is almost as old as the nation, and both parties have used it. But in recent years, as Republicans captured state legislatures around the country, they have been the primary beneficiaries. Aided by sophisticated software, they have drawn oddly shaped voting districts to favor their party’s candidates. "
281,"Intel has won a point in its antitrust battle with the European Commission — and the American technology industry as a whole may be feeling a little victorious as well. The Court of Justice of the European Union ordered a lower court on Wednesday to re-examine the 1.6 billion euro, or nearly $1.3 billion, fine imposed on Intel in 2009 for abuse of its dominant position in the computer chip market. The decision is a setback for the European Union antitrust authorities who have been investigating American tech giants like Google and Qualcomm. Here’s what happened in the Intel case: • Intel had offered rebates to entice computer makers to buy all, or almost all, of their X86 central processing units from it. • The European Union’s General Court upheld the 2009 fine in 2014. • Last October, the bloc’s advocate general, Nils Wahl, recommended that the General Court return to the case. He found that the court had been mistaken in its consideration of the “exclusivity rebates” as an abuse of a dominant market position. The fate of the Intel case is far from determined. And the European Commission still has other big investigations open: • Inquiries into Google center on two areas — whether the internet giant used its market position in online search to prioritize its shopping service over that of rivals, and whether the company abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on makers of Android devices. "
282,"WASHINGTON — Republican congressional leaders perched on the couches in the Oval Office froze in mid-smile on Wednesday afternoon when they realized President Trump was bypassing them to cut a short-term spending and debt ceiling deal with Democrats, and not them. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, had expected the rare bipartisan, bicameral meeting to be little more than a photo-op in which the broad outlines of a deal were discussed, aides said. Instead, Mr. Trump — who has often outsourced the details of negotiations to subordinates like Vice President Mike Pence — interrupted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as he argued for an 18-month debt ceiling increase to stabilize financial markets. When other leaders offered yearlong or half-year extensions, the president waved them off, according to the accounts of staff members briefed on the meeting. The three-month deal Mr. Trump eventually embraced is a significant tactical change for a president thus far anxious to preserve, not expand, his political appeal. The plan was pitched by two Democratic leaders he has relentlessly demonized and marginalized: Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. The deal will give Democrats increased leverage in coming negotiations, several senior members of Mr. Trump’s team lamented after the meeting. In his nearly eight months as president, Mr. Trump has tacked almost exclusively to the right to solidify his conservative populist base, earning him the limited, but granite, support of 30 to 40 percent of the public. In the past 36 hours, he seems to have abruptly abandoned that strategy, driven by the immediate need to pass spending bills after Hurricane Harvey — and chastened by the bipartisan backlash against his decision on Tuesday to phase out a program that allowed unauthorized immigrants brought to the United States as minors to remain here. "
283,"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The memory of the land mine that tore off the leg of Helena González’s nephew years ago is still fresh. Ms. González, 25, has spent much of her life fearing more attacks by Colombia’s Marxist rebels against her family. And last year, when given the chance to vote on a peace agreement to end a half-century of conflict, she joined the majority of Colombians in voting against the deal. “The pope may forgive them,” Ms. González said, coming out of church in the capital, Bogotá, this week. “But in my heart I don’t forgive them. I am still reconciling it all.” As Pope Francis arrived in Colombia on Wednesday for a six-day visit, the challenge before the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was clear: nudging the country, torn apart by 52 years of war, toward a peace with former guerrillas that remains controversial in the eyes of many of the war’s victims. “It’s dangerous ground for Pope Francis,” said Hosffman Ospino, a Colombian theologian at Boston College. “Half of the country disagrees with the peace process.” On the surface, much has gone well for the peace accords between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by their acronym, FARC. After failing in the referendum, the government reworked the deal and passed it through Congress, sidestepping voters. About 7,000 rebels left the jungle, gave up weapons and are returning to civilian life. "
284,"Before Ghada Tafesh left the Gaza Strip for college in the United States, her family gave her a necklace with two pendants. One was in the shape of historic Palestine. The other was an olive tree. “They wanted me to have something that would remind me of home, and to never be ashamed of where I come from,” she told me. Ms. Tafesh has much to be proud of as she begins the final year of her master’s program in humanities at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., this fall. But the trade-off was painful: getting her education meant not returning home for six years. In 2012, she faced one of the toughest decisions a Gazan teenager can make. With the help of a scholarship, she could attend college in the United States. It would afford her significantly more opportunity than she would ever have in her hometown. Gaza’s few universities provide only basic academic offerings, with very limited master’s and doctoral programs. Then there’s the city’s youth unemployment rate: 60 percent, by most estimates. But by opting to go abroad, Ms. Tafesh would be choosing a kind of exile, since returning at all would mean the risk of getting stuck back inside the blockade. “Receiving entrance and exit permits to and from the Strip is a lengthy and unpredictable process,” said Shai Grunberg of Gisha, an Israeli nonprofit that aims to protect freedom of movement of Palestinians. “There are no guarantees that if a student from Gaza receives an entrance permit to visit family in the Strip, they will manage to secure an exit permit in time to return to their studies.” Steven Keller, who directs scholarship and exchange programs in the West Bank and Gaza, agreed: “We advise students not to return to Gaza during school holidays, due to the personal risk of getting stuck and losing a scholarship.” Ms. Tafesh had already experienced life in the United States: She’d spent her junior year of high school as an exchange student, living with a host family in Laurel, Md. The sound of airplanes from the nearby international airport often woke her up at night and reminded her of Israeli warplanes that meant school was shutting down — “you could feel the walls and floor shaking,” she said, describing being in ninth grade while bombings went off nearby. But the opportunities in the United States amazed her. Until then, she’d been unaware of how limited life in Gaza was. “You accept your reality, until you see how other people live,” she told me recently. “I love to read poetry and novels,” counting Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf and Geoffrey Chaucer as among her favorites. “But there was no library at our school” in Gaza. There were no sports teams or science labs, either. “Our science books were full of experiments that we never got to do.” Eager for more, Ms. Tafesh contacted the Hope Fund, a program that secures scholarships from American colleges for talented Palestinian youth predominately from disadvantaged backgrounds. She applied to Wilson College and was accepted with a full scholarship. After she received her United States visa in July 2012, she was worried that she wouldn’t be able to get an Israeli exit permit to leave Gaza. "
285,"As Congress returns this week from its summer recess, Washington and its press corps are stirring from what has been a fitful August slumber. It will be a busy fall, just as it was in 1998, when I became the congressional correspondent for The Baltimore Sun as a new name entered the political conversation: Monica Lewinsky. Back then, the Capitol’s august press gallery above the Senate chamber was jam-packed with reporters. Every regional newspaper worth its salt had someone in the Capitol keeping an eye on its congressional delegation and the most pressing matters of the day. I sat crammed in next to a reporter from The San Francisco Examiner, another from New York Newsday, another from The Chicago Sun-Times and three from The New York Times. Then came the long eclipse: the decline of the mid-size, then major daily newspapers, and with them, the twilight of the congressional reporter. The Senate press gallery, with its century-old tile floors and chandeliers, is now a sadder place. Where I, a Baltimore Sun reporter, was once crammed into a carrel alongside such venerable Times reporters as Lizette Alvarez, Alison Mitchell and Eric Schmitt, there are file cabinets. I returned to the congressional press corps in 2012, this time as a reporter for The Times. The hallways of the Capitol were and still are packed with reporters, but most of them work for newsletters and pricey trade outlets catering to Washington lobbyists and insiders. The reporters writing for a national audience who remain on the Congress beat have greater responsibilities. They must inform readers around the country — indeed around the world — of major legislative actions, of fights brewing in both parties with the leadership of the House and Senate, and of developments on the backbenches, once the purview of regionally focused newspapers. In the era of President Trump, congressional reporters have a loftier responsibility as well — one that in the 20 years I have been in Washington I have never felt so keenly. They must cover the legislative branch through the prism of the Constitution, to see Congress not as a bumbling backwater of policy making but as a coequal branch of government, designed as a check on the power of the executive. "
286,"GENEVA — United Nations investigators added their voices on Wednesday to a mountain of evidence of the Syrian military’s responsibility for a chemical attack on a rebel-held town five months ago that left villagers foaming at the mouth and gasping for breath. A United Nations Commission of Inquiry monitoring the six-year conflict in Syria said that Sukhoi 22 aircraft operated by the Syrian Air Force carried out the attack on the village of Khan Sheikhoun early on April 4. It killed at least 83 people, injured close to 300 others and prompted President Trump to order dozens of cruise missile strikes on the airfield from which the jet fighters had launched their attack. The panel’s findings are the first authoritative statement to pin responsibility for the attack unequivocally on the Syrian government. Although a number of foreign governments, watchdogs and news organizations, including The New York Times, had concluded that Syrian forces were most likely behind the attack, the latest report — released by a body tasked with investigating violations by all sides in the conflict — carries more weight and will be harder for the Syrian government and its allies to dismiss as politicized. Moreover, the panel said that Khan Sheikhoun was the site of just one of at least 20 chemical weapons attacks carried out from March 2013 to March 2017 by government forces. (The number of reported, but not confirmed, uses of chemical weapons is vastly higher.) In March, for example, three people, including a surgeon and two patients, died in an attack on an underground hospital in Idlib Province after a helicopter dropped a barrel bomb that dispensed what appeared to be chlorine gas, the panel found. "
287,"After each North Korean provocation, a soothing mantra echoes through the halls of government and think tanks in the United States. China, it is frequently said, could solve this seemingly unsolvable problem, finally reining in North Korea, if Beijing were just properly motivated. But this oft-repeated line contains three assumptions, none of which has held up well in recent years. It assumes that outside pressure could persuade North Korea to curtail or abandon its weapons programs. That China has the means to bring about such pressure. And that Beijing will do so once it is properly cajoled or coerced. Each assumption has been tested repeatedly in recent years and, time and again, has collapsed. Yet three consecutive presidents — George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Donald J. Trump — have invested their hopes and their strategies in China coming to the rescue. Asked whether this were possible, even in the abstract, John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, answered, “No, the Chinese can’t fix this for us.” "
288,"SEOUL, South Korea — The United States military plans to complete the deployment of an advanced missile-defense system in South Korea on Thursday, days after North Korea detonated what it called a missile-delivered hydrogen bomb in an underground nuclear test, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. Despite angry protests from China, Seoul and Washington have agreed to push ahead with the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, which they said was designed to protect South Korean and American troops from possible missile attacks from North Korea. China has vehemently opposed the Thaad deployment, arguing that it would exacerbate tensions with North Korea and could undermine China’s own nuclear deterrent by giving the United States another means to monitor its missiles. Angry Chinese have boycotted South Korean cars and cultural offerings, like TV dramas. Villagers in Seongju, South Korea, where a Thaad battery was to be installed, also opposed the deployment, fearing that the powerful radar would hurt their health, a concern the Defense Ministry said was scientifically groundless. Joining forces with the farmers were political activists who argued that the Thaad deployment would only increase military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In April, the United States installed the radar and two of the six interceptor-missile launchers of the Thaad battery on an abandoned hilltop golf course in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, the capital. The battery became operational immediately. On Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said the remaining four launchers would be installed on Thursday in response to “North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile threats.” As word of the planned deployment spread, Seongju villagers blocked roads with farm equipment to stop military vehicles from carrying additional equipment to the Thaad base. South Korea and the United States agreed in July 2016 to the Thaad deployment. During his election campaign, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, then a liberal opposition leader, cast doubt on the usefulness of Thaad and said he would review South Korea’s decision to accept its deployment. After taking office in May, he suspended the installation of the four remaining launchers while ordering a study on the environmental impact of the deployment. But after North Korea conducted two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, he ordered his government to cooperate with the United States in installing the remaining launchers. Mr. Moon promised the installation would happen quickly when he talked to President Trump on the phone on Monday, a day after North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. "

Paul Ryan offered some warm words about Dreamers. Marco Rubio went further, distancing himself from President Trump’s new immigration policy by tweeting a passage from the Bible. John McCain was blunter still, calling the decision “wrong.” But words aren’t enough. They’re not nearly enough. Ryan, Rubio, McCain and the other members of Congress have the power to do something in response to Trump’s decision to subject the 800,000 Dreamers — law-abiding people who entered the United States illegally as children — to potential deportation. Congress can pass a law that removes the threat hanging over them and lets them continue with their lives. If Congress doesn’t act, yesterday’s expressions of concern are mere hypocrisy. “I have zero patience for empty virtue signalling on this,” Susan Hennessey of Lawfare tweeted, in response to Rubio. “You’re a member of Congress. Don’t tell us how sad and pious you are; pass a law.” Greg Sargent of The Washington Post noted that Congress should pass a law quickly, given the uncertainty plaguing Dreamers. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said Trump’s move had shifted Microsoft’s lobbying priorities. “The entire business community cares about a tax reform,” Smith told NPR. “And yet it is very clear today a tax reform bill needs to be set aside until the Dreamers are taken care of.” Smith also suggested Microsoft would try to block the federal government from deporting its Dreamer employees.

290,"When he was a presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump took a hard line against Saudi Arabia, criticizing its human rights record and slamming his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for the donations her family foundation received from the country. But as president, Mr. Trump has been more generous to Saudi Arabia, and newly published State Department records indicate that, in several dozen small but extravagant ways, it has been pretty nice to him, too. The records published by The Daily Beast this week list more than 80 gifts that Saudi Arabia gave Mr. Trump when he visited in May, some of which evoke both Indiana Jones and Liberace. (“Orange traditional shirt with silver floral embroidery and leather ammo holder and holster” is one entry.) Other eye-catching gifts include a sword, a copy of the Kuwaiti Constitution, a “sleeveless white silk cotton garment” and two robes lined with the fur of white tigers. Mr. Trump also received a portrait of himself and three chiffon dresses: one yellow, one pale pink and one yellow and turquoise. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump gave similar luxury items to his Saudi hosts, who also posted the president’s face on billboards in the capital and arranged a summit meeting of Muslim leaders and a concert by the American country singer Toby Keith. But Mr. Trump did give Saudi Arabia something it wanted: tough talk on Iran, its regional rival, and a $110 billion arms deal that includes $500 million in precision-guided munitions. Many of the gifts from Saudi Arabia drew interest online because of their opulence and — to an American audience — their oddity. Arms deals and summit meetings are familiar tools of statecraft, but an orange and gold robe lined with cheetah fur? "
291,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said his country opposed cutting off oil supplies to North Korea as part of new sanctions being considered in the wake of the country’s latest nuclear test, according to official accounts of his meeting Wednesday with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. The United States and its allies are pushing for a global embargo on oil exports to North Korea as the United Nations Security Council debates a new round of sanctions against the North. Russia has veto power over any such Security Council sanctions. North Korea has been getting most of its oil from China. But it has been trying to increase imports from Russia as an alternative source of energy for its military, as well as for its decrepit industries, amid signs that Beijing is growing impatient with the North’s nuclear adventurism, South Korean analysts said. During a meeting on the sidelines of an economic summit conference in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, Mr. Moon asked Mr. Putin to support the proposed oil embargo. But Mr. Putin said that sanctions and pressure would not persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for Mr. Moon. Stopping oil exports to the country would instead hurt ordinary North Koreans by disrupting hospitals and other civilian facilities, Mr. Yoon quoted Mr. Putin as saying. Mr. Putin said Russia exported less than 40,000 tons of oil a year to North Korea. “Without political and diplomatic tools, it is impossible to make headway in the current situation; to be more precise, it is impossible,” Mr. Putin said during a joint news conference with Mr. Moon.

292,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles. California is home to more than a quarter of the roughly 800,000 recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program, known as DACA, that has allowed young people who are undocumented to legally live and work in the United States. Within minutes of the Trump administration’s announcement Tuesday morning that it would end the program in six months, dozens of leaders from across the state condemned the move. Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the decision unconstitutional and said that California could file a lawsuit to keep the program alive as early as Wednesday. “We are prepared to go in tomorrow or whenever it seems appropriate to Court to make sure we stand up for those who have stood up and helped build this country and certainly California,” Mr. Becerra said during a news conference in Sacramento. “We are prepared to defend the DACA program because it is fully lawful and fully American in its value and its approach.” "
293,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr. told Senate investigators on Thursday that he set up a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer because he was intrigued that she might have damaging information about Hillary Clinton, saying it was important to learn about Mrs. Clinton’s “fitness” to be president. But nothing came of the Trump Tower meeting, he said, and he was adamant that he never colluded with the Russian government’s campaign to disrupt last year’s presidential election. During five hours of questioning, investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee pressed Mr. Trump on numerous topics related to the meeting with the Russian lawyer, including how the president’s aides this summer drafted a statement aboard Air Force One in response to queries from The New York Times about the meeting. Mr. Trump said he did not speak to his father about the draft statement because he did not want to involve him in something he “knew nothing about,” according to one person briefed about parts of his testimony. Lawmakers have wanted to know what, if anything, President Trump knew about the June 2016 meeting and whether he was involved in preparing the draft statement to The Times. In his prepared remarks on Thursday to Congress, the younger Mr. Trump said he was initially conflicted when he heard that the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, might have damaging information about Mrs. Clinton. Despite his interest, he said, he always intended to consult with his lawyers about the propriety of using any information that Ms. Veselnitskaya, who has links to the Kremlin, gave him at the meeting. A copy of Mr. Trump’s statement was obtained by The New York Times. The acknowledgment by the president’s eldest son that he intended to seek legal counsel after the meeting suggests that he knew, or at least suspected, that accepting potentially damaging information about a rival campaign from a foreign country raised thorny legal issues. "
294,"President Trump huddled for about an hour with top officials from New York and New Jersey at the White House on Thursday, including Senators Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand and Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo and Chris Christie, to discuss the future of a multibillion-dollar tunnel between the two states. The so-called Gateway project, to build a train tunnel under the Hudson River, is considered the linchpin of transportation infrastructure in the region and a top priority for many officials from the two states. It would provide a critical additional link between New Jersey and New York’s Pennsylvania Station. Thursday’s guest list signaled the project’s importance: In addition to the senators and governors, about a dozen members of Congress also attended the White House gathering. Mr. Trump was joined by Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary; Gary D. Cohn, his economic adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the budget director; and John F. Kelly, his chief of staff. “The meeting was positive. The president was receptive and wants to get back to us on Gateway,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. The White House, too, said the meeting had been “productive.” Mr. Cuomo was less bullish. “While the White House meeting was productive, it was inconclusive,” he said. Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, said in an interview that the meeting “could not have been more positive.” He added that the only specific numbers discussed were a $30 billion price tag and a 50-50 split between the federal government and the states in picking up those costs, which has been a point of contention in the past.

297,"This is Thursday’s storm coverage. Read the latest with Friday’s live updates on Hurricane Irma » Hurricane Irma, an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 storm with sustained winds of up to 155 miles an hour, continued to tear through the Caribbean on Friday, moving through the Bahamas and along the northern coast of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center said. The death toll from the storm was at least seven as of Thursday afternoon, but the authorities warned that the number could rise as emergency crews reached flooded areas and as communications improved. The hurricane is expected to hit the Florida Keys and South Florida starting Saturday evening, said Kevin Scharfenberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. A second storm, Jose, strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and could hit Antigua and Barbuda, which have suffered extensive flooding and wind damage from Irma, according to the National Hurricane Center. In Florida and Georgia, officials issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal and some inland areas, leading to gas shortages and heavy traffic on local highways. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for South Florida, the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee and Florida Bay and a storm surge warning for South Florida and the Florida Keys. • Half of the 100,000 residents of Antigua and Barbuda have had their homes destroyed or heavily damaged, the prime minister said. • The governor of Puerto Rico said at a news conference that electrical service had been restored to 144,000 households — which still leaves nearly a million in the dark.

298,"Jaime Ballesteros tried to contain his tears on Tuesday while teaching Brooklyn sixth graders about liquids, gases and solids. In between science classes at a charter school in East New York, he broke down at his desk. The government had just canceled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which had granted temporary protection from deportation to immigrants brought to the country at a young age. Under DACA, as the program is known, they attended college and obtained work permits, and many went back into the profession that inspired them in the first place. “The last three years that I have been teaching was like a world of possibility for me and my students,” said Mr. Ballesteros, 25, who is from the Philippines. “Today, I just didn’t feel that same level of hope.” He was just one of the estimated 30,000 DACA recipients in New York who now face uncertain futures, according to statistics kept by the city. The Trump administration gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative solution, while allowing the DACA permits to last until they expire. The jobs these DACA recipients, often known as Dreamers, do have a wide impact in New York, from small business owners to financial analysts to internet entrepreneurs and nurses. In May 2016, New York State allowed DACA recipients to get licenses for teaching and 57 other professions, after a 2015 appellate court decision paved the way in ruling that a DACA recipient from Staten Island, Cesar Vargas, could become a lawyer. "
299,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan voiced his disagreement with President Trump’s decision to cut a debt limit deal with Democrats and cast doubt on his call to cut the corporate tax rate by more than half in an interview on Thursday with The New York Times. The comments underscore the rift between the White House and the top House Republican at a time when they are pressing to reach several major legislative goals before the end of the year. However, Mr. Ryan said that he understood the president’s motivations. “What the president didn’t want to do is have some partisan fight in the middle of the response to this,” Mr. Ryan said, referring to Hurricane Harvey. “He wanted to make sure we had a bipartisan moment.” The remarks were Mr. Ryan’s first public comments on the matter since Mr. Trump blindsided Republican leaders on Wednesday. Before Mr. Trump made the deal, Mr. Ryan called such a strategy “ridiculous.” On Thursday, he said that he continued to believe that short-term debt limit extensions were not a good idea. “I personally believe, for the credit markets’ sake, we should have longer extensions of these,” Mr. Ryan said. "
300,"What do you know about DACA? What are your thoughts and feelings about President Trump’s move to end this program? In “After 16 Futile Years, Congress Will Try Again to Legalize ‘Dreamers’,” Yamiche Alcindor and Sheryl Gay Stolberg write: Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What do you think should be done for “dreamers”? Should there be a law to protect them and all children who are undocumented immigrants? If so, what protections would the law include, and why? "
301,"Last month, NPR published a list of the 150 greatest albums by women. The list was debated. It was discussed. There were alternative lists of 150 additional albums not on the NPR list. Quibbling with the particulars of the list is one thing. It did overlook a lot. But the quibbling misses an important concern about what it means to argue for a female-only canon. The power of the list came, in part, from its mere existence, from how necessary it felt. Behold the many artists ignored by mainstream coed lists! Aaliyah! Shakira! Tori Amos! Chaka Khan! Why would albums by women who rank so prominently on a list determined by women be missing from one determined by all genders but really mostly men? The question matters. This week we talk about why it does. We also talk about the very different ways we experienced the list, and we revisit the song of the summer, a phenomenon that, once again, was ruled by male artists.

By now, Trevor Noah said, it seems obvious that climate change is causing the catastrophic hurricanes that continue to sweep across the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean. Fed up with those who deny artificial climate change, he hatched a plan to change their minds. Meanwhile, Seth Meyers and James Corden didn’t find President Trump’s tweet about Hurricane Irma very comforting. Hillary Clinton takes swipes at Senator Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, in her new book, “What Happened.” Mr. Meyers returned those jabs in a segment called “Hey!” Jimmy Kimmel might not be the first in line at Mrs. Clinton’s book signing.

303,"Imagine yourself as Kim Jong-un, North Korean despot. Unlike your father Kim Jong-il, who took the throne in late middle age and died 17 years later, you came to it before your 30th birthday. Yours is the longer, harder road, albeit with the same constant aim: to rule for life and die comfortably in your bed. Everything else — the purges, the killing of the young American, the missile shots and nuclear tests, the brinkmanship with the Trump administration — serves that ambition. It ought to make you a pragmatist at heart. For nearly six years you have cultivated a reputation for capricious brutality. They say you fed your uncle to dogs after you had him arrested in full public view. They say you had your armed forces minister dispatched with an antiaircraft gun, to obliterate every trace of him from the face of the earth. They say you executed your deputy premier for education for slouching. Nothing strange in this. Tyranny is an art, the foremost requirement of which is to instill the appropriate sense of dread and awe. You — the fat kid with the boarding-school education and the basketball mania — had no chance of living without immediately demonstrating a relish for killing. Political murder in regimes like yours is always performance art. And so you did it, even as you eased economic controls and allowed private markets to flourish. You would not put North Koreans through another Arduous March, as your father had in the 1990s, allowing more than a million to starve so that Pyongyang’s elite could stay fed. Another lesson for tyrants: You do not subjugate a people by taking everything from them. You subjugate them by giving them something they know you can take away. Desperate people aren’t always obedient. Dependent people usually are. "
304,"The surge in Democratic enthusiasm and activism driven by animosity to President Trump is proving to be a mixed blessing. Renewed fervor improves Democratic prospects in 2018 House and Senate elections. At the same time, in a development reminiscent of the Tea Party Republican insurgency of 2010, moderate and centrist Democratic incumbents face primary challengers from the Sanders left. In some cases, these challengers raise the threat of bitterly contested midterm primaries that could leave House and Senate nominees weakened for the general election. Two moderate Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both face primary challenges from the insurgent progressive wing of their party, as do a growing number of Democratic House incumbents. Center versus left disputes within Democratic ranks have surfaced on several fronts, even as Democrats of all stripes have come to recognize the devastating costs of the Trump-era Republican attack on the nature of truth and the parallel rise of “alternative facts.” The Democratic National Committee, charged with a crucial organizational role in the coming presidential election, continues to struggle to regain standing with Sanders supporters after a series of conflicts in 2016 and 2017 over such matters as control of valuable donor lists and demands for a more progressive agenda. "
305,"Under the leadership of Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson, the State Department is considering a mission reform that includes the abandonment of democratic assistance and human rights. The current mission statement reads, “The department’s mission is to shape and sustain a peaceful, prosperous, just and democratic world and foster conditions for stability and progress for the benefit of the American people and people everywhere.” Dropping the words “just” and “democratic” would be fully consistent with the transactional realism that has characterized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric. And such a change might reflect a growing feeling that most of the programs to support democracy abroad and the importance of democratic ideals are wasteful, inefficient, unappreciated or even damaging. In America, the public (especially Republicans) has increasingly favored nationalism and isolationism, according to some polls, in which the United States focuses on its own problems, with many wary of global humanitarian engagement. But such a shift in United States foreign policy would be a historic mistake, abandoning America’s deepest values, eroding international commitments to human rights, and setting off dismay among friends and joy among foes around the globe. It would be the ultimate symbol of the end of American leadership in the world. This commitment to democracy is far from recent; it has been a red thread running through decades of bipartisan American foreign policy. A century ago, on April 2, 1917, during a speech asking Congress to declare war on Germany, Woodrow Wilson delivered one of the most resonant lines in the history of the American presidency: “The world must be made safe for democracy.” In 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, in the Atlantic Charter, committed the World War II allies to protect “the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.” And since then, democratic ideals have been articulated in speeches by every president, Republican and Democratic. "
306,"Nikki Haley laid the Trump administration’s cards on the table this week with a new proposal aimed at sabotaging one of the Obama administration’s most important diplomatic initiatives — the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. President Trump promised during his campaign to kill the deal, despite its clear benefits to American security. Ms. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, has set forth a scheme that could not only allow Mr. Trump to carry out his threat, but also shift final responsibility to Congress. The whole idea makes no sense to anyone but Mr. Trump’s hard-line advisers, who see Iran as the root of evil in the Persian Gulf. Instead of making sure the agreement works, the president would give Iran an excuse to revive what had been a rapidly advancing nuclear capability and confront the world with another intractable nuclear challenge in addition to North Korea. The deal, negotiated with Tehran by the United States and other major powers, imposed strict limits on Iran’s nuclear activities for 10 years in return for a lifting of international and American sanctions. As an added check, Congress requires the administration to certify every 90 days that Iran is abiding by the deal, in order to continue qualifying for relief from American sanctions. The administration has twice reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance and is required to revisit the issue again next month. Ms. Haley said she doesn’t know what Mr. Trump’s decision will be. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which put unprecedented strong procedures in place for monitoring Iran’s activities, has repeatedly judged that Iran is fulfilling its obligations. In July, Gen. Paul Selva of the Air Force, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that based on evidence submitted to intelligence agencies, “it appears that Iran is in compliance.” Mr. Trump, however, has reportedly kept pushing his advisers to find a way out, and Ms. Haley appears to have answered the call. The essence of her case, presented Tuesday to the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, is that technical compliance with the nuclear-related commitments is not sufficient and that the president “has grounds” to declare that Iran is not fulfilling the agreement because of other destabilizing or objectionable behavior, like its ballistic missile tests, support for Hezbollah and hostility toward the United States.

307,"Good morning on this wet-to-wonderful Thursday. Class is back in session for more than a million public school children today. For high school students, especially, this is a time of self exploration, growing pains, and, for those of us reflecting back, some regrets. We recently asked our readers to share some of the things they wished they had done differently in high school. Here are a few of their regrets: “What I wish I could’ve done differently: Listen. Be more aware of the potential signs of depression or bullying. I don’t believe I was an aggressor, but I participated in my fair share of it, so I wish I was more self aware, too.” — Sachin Arora, 29, Astoria, Queens “If I had to do high school over again, I’d leave aside the ice cream scooping and McDonalds customer service jobs for work that helped me figure out my longer term career, if at all possible.” — Suzanne Grossman, 42, Maplewood, N.J. “I regret not pushing harder for the one thing I loved: dance. If I could go back, I would tell my younger self to have courage, take risks and believe in myself because that’s what it takes out in the world.” — Annette Herwander, 37, Washington Heights “I would have wanted to have sex and try pot. Back then, programs like D.A.R.E. and ‘abstinence only’ scared me into obedience.” — Joey DeGrandis, 32, East Village "

310,"A billionaire property developer who has accused some of China’s most powerful officials of corruption has applied for political asylum in the United States, his lawyer said. The billionaire, Guo Wengui, who is in the United States on a tourist visa that expires later this year, is seeking asylum status because his public charges against Chinese officials have made him “a political opponent of the Chinese regime,” Thomas Ragland, a Washington-based lawyer representing him, said in a telephone interview late Wednesday. Asylum — even a pending asylum application — would give Mr. Guo more protection because he could stay in the United States while the application was being considered, a process that can take years, Mr. Ragland said. “Asylum offers a level of protection that is different from having a visa status,” Mr. Ragland said. “Visas can be canceled or revoked.” From his $68 million apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan, Mr. Guo, also known as Miles Kwok, has used Twitter and YouTube to publicize his claims that Wang Qishan, a member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee who oversees the ruling Communist Party’s own anticorruption efforts, and his family members secretly control one of China’s largest conglomerates. Some of the evidence he presents to back his claims is easily refuted or simply difficult to believe. But some of his accusations, such as those made against the family of Mr. Wang’s immediate predecessor, can be corroborated. "
311,"WASHINGTON — In his seven months in office, President Trump has proved to be the commander in chief of mixed messages. But even for him, the nighttime tweet on Tuesday was a head-turner. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had scrapped his predecessor’s program sparing younger illegal immigrants from deportation on the grounds that a president does not have the power to take such action by himself. He then put the onus on Congress by giving it a six-month deadline to “fix” the program before it would expire. Then, barely eight hours after his decision was announced, the president went on Twitter with a message that completely undercut both positions in just under 140 characters. “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do),” he wrote, using the initials for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. “If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!” By vowing to “revisit this issue,” Mr. Trump arguably took Congress off the hook by seeming to suggest that if lawmakers cannot agree, they need not worry about the political or human consequences because he may take unspecified action himself to protect the younger immigrants. But by his own argument earlier in the day, he does not have the power to do that. White House officials offered no immediate explanation about what the president intended by the message or how he could revisit the issue in six months. Asked during a media appearance with congressional leaders on Wednesday morning if he had any second thoughts on his decision, Mr. Trump said, “No second thoughts.” But the conflicting messages seemed to reflect what aides describe as the president’s own conflicting emotions about the issue. "
312,"FRANKFURT — Europe has taken a small step in its long march toward economic normalcy. The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it had pondered how to wind down its easy money policies, an enormous stimulus program aimed at promoting growth and inflation in the eurozone. But the bank also postponed a decision on when it would actually do so, and will likely decide at least some of the details at its next meeting in October, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, said. Even though the eurozone is arguably in its best economic shape in a decade, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the bank’s Governing Council have been exceedingly cautious about ending the emergency measures that helped prevent the euro from self-destructing after the global financial meltdown in 2008. The Federal Reserve in the United States began raising interest rates at the end of 2015, but the European Central Bank continues to flood the 19-nation eurozone with cash as a way to reduce interest rates, stimulate growth and nudge inflation from levels considered to be dangerously low. The measures have worked, for the most part, helping the region overcome a prolonged slump. But the program — known as quantitative easing — has also had side effects, including fueling a steep rise in real estate prices in Germany that have led to fears of a bubble. Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the benefits have far outweighed any negative effects. Still, with the Fed moving in the opposite direction, the European Central Bank has been under pressure to shift its policy. He began laying the foundation on Thursday for plans to “taper” the stimulus. Although the European Central Bank’s Governing Council left monetary policy unchanged, Mr. Draghi said policy makers had preliminary discussions about the program, and said they would make the “bulk” of the decisions about tapering late next month. "
313,"President Emmanuel Macron of France is liberalism’s new poster boy. Hailed as the answer to Europe’s populist tide, he has brought a buzz back into French diplomacy by facing down President Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. “The Macron method,” a leading European think tank gushed recently, is the new Third Way, threading the needle between technocracy and populism. At home in France, it’s a very different story. A recent poll found that Mr. Macron’s popularity fell by 14 points in August, after a fall of 10 points in July. Only 40 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with the president’s performance. To be fair, Mr. Macron never had much popular support to begin with. In the first round of the presidential election in April, when the vote was split among four main contenders, he won just under 24 percent. (By comparison, François Hollande received 28 percent of the vote in the first round in 2012. Nicolas Sarkozy won 31 percent in 2007.) Mr. Macron won the second round handily, but only because he was the lesser-evil candidate in the runoff — his competitor was Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right populist National Front party. Electoral arithmetic explains only so much. Mr. Macron’s popularity suffers from something more fundamental: Macronism. His entire political project has been far too focused on his personality. Much of his appeal has come from his youth, his dynamism, his good looks and his oratorical skills. This hyper-personalized approach always carried the risk that once his charm wore off, there would be nothing left for his supporters to like, which is exactly what is happening. Since taking office, Mr. Macron has put off many people by trying to recapture the grandeur of the presidency. In a phrase that may stick to him for the rest of his time in office, he said he wanted to make the presidency more “Jupiterian,” comparing himself with the powerful Roman god Jupiter, who ruled the skies. When he brought the Senate and Parliament together at the Versailles palace and spoke to them about his ambitions for the presidency, many in France bristled at the monarchical overtones. This arrogant attitude about power has destroyed the anti-establishment, upstart image that Mr. Macron cultivated during the campaign. The post-ideological platform on which he ran is starting to reveal itself for what it really is: an emptiness at the heart of his political project. "
314,"JERUSALEM — Overnight strikes Thursday on Syrian military sites — which are said to produce chemical weapons and advanced missiles — brought renewed attention to Syria’s chemical weapons, and appear to have been an escalation of Israel’s efforts to prevent its enemies from gaining access to sophisticated weapons. The Syrian military said Israeli warplanes had struck the sites early Thursday, killing two people near the town of Masyaf in western Syria and causing unspecified material damage. Israeli officials did not comment on the strike, but a Syrian monitoring group and two former Israeli officials said it had targeted an installation of a government agency that produced chemical weapons and a military base that produced advanced missiles. The strike came a day after a United Nations commission accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons in an attack in April that killed dozens in the town of Khan Sheikhoun and flooded clinics with victims gasping for breath. While many foreign governments and news organizations had previously concluded that Syrian forces were probably behind the attack, the unequivocal condemnation from the United Nations was the most authoritative statement blaming the Syrian government for it. Syria and its ally Russia have claimed that the Syrian government did not use banned munitions and that the attack was carried out by rebels on the ground. "

316,"If Gary D. Cohn is no longer considered a serious contender to take over the Federal Reserve, as multiple news media outlets report, what’s next for him? More important, will President Trump decide to keep Janet L. Yellen as leader of America’s central bank, or will he turn to someone like the former Fed governor Kevin Warsh? Here’s what we know: • Mr. Cohn’s public criticism of the president’s response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. has made it much less likely that he will succeed Ms. Yellen at the Fed, according to The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. • The New York Times says that Mr. Cohn has fallen out of favor, but is not totally out of the running. Still, Mr. Trump is known to place a premium on loyalty, and has complained about Mr. Cohn’s statements. • Even after his criticism of the president, Mr. Cohn has said that he needs to stay on board to work on matters like an overhaul of the tax code. It’s possible that if the initiative succeeds, he could regain Mr. Trump’s favor. Ms. Yellin’s tenure as chairwoman of the Fed expires in February. The White House could renominate her. Or it could pick from other candidates, including these mentioned by the news media: • John Taylor, an economist at Stanford • Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School • John Allison, the former chief executive of BB&T Bank "
317,"WASHINGTON — The top five House Democrats are urging Speaker Paul D. Ryan to establish a select committee on “the rise of white supremacy and domestic terrorism.” The lawmakers, in a letter sent on Wednesday to Mr. Ryan, argued that Congress needed to study an “outbreak of hate” brought on by last year’s presidential election, as well as the threat that white supremacist groups pose to “the security and stability of our nation.” Representative Joseph Crowley of New York said he had broached the idea of the select committee after watching Mr. Trump praise the “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly violence at a rally of white supremacists in Virginia. “A young woman lost her life as a result of what took place in Charlottesville,” Mr. Crowley said in an interview. “That cannot be understated, and that life ought to not go without recognition by the Congress.” Mr. Crowley called the new prominence of neo-Nazis and other groups like the Ku Klux Klan “a national crisis” and said he hoped that the committee could offer bipartisan solutions. He signed the letter along with Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California, Linda T. Sánchez of California, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. It is unclear whether Mr. Ryan will agree to establish the committee. Some conservatives have resisted efforts to shine a spotlight on right-wing extremists that is equal to the one on Islamic terrorists, even though studies have linked right-wing extremists to far more deaths in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. Under a Department of Homeland Security program known as Countering Violent Extremism, the Trump administration has ended grants to groups combating white supremacy, while keeping funding for organizations fighting Islamic terrorism. In their letter to Mr. Ryan, the lawmakers cited the Department of Homeland Security and other authorities in writing that there is “substantial energy behind the white supremacist movement, with traffic on leading websites soaring over the past year alongside a wide-reaching effort to recruit young people on college campuses.” “Given the surge of support for terror,” they wrote, “a more focused effort is needed to understand what is happening and how we can work together to protect our fellow Americans.” "
318,"I was 19 years old when I bought a first edition of “Sexual Politics” in 1970. Kate Millett’s first book, published the year before, was that unlikeliest phenomenon — a dissertation heard around the world. What I remember most about that year was the dizzying experience of reading Ms. Millett, who died on Wednesday, and the new theories of her sister feminists that came in its wake. Like one of Yayoi Kusama’s “Infinity Rooms,” my consciousness, and that of the women I knew, gained new dimensions. In my library today, that volume of “Sexual Politics” sits next to the feminist classics that soon followed. Both “The Dialectic of Sex” by Shulamith Firestone and “Sisterhood is Powerful,” Robin Morgan’s ambitious anthology, appeared in 1970. The following year, Germaine Greer published “The Female Eunuch” in the United States. Each year thereafter brought a major new work: Phyllis Chesler’s “Women and Madness” (1972); Mary Daly’s “Beyond God the Father” (1973); Andrea Dworkin’s “Woman Hating” (1974); and Susan Brownmiller’s “Against Our Will” (1975). These women and many others, including Adrienne Rich and Angela Davis, offered new insights, shaking foundation after foundation for me and my peers. But it was Ms. Millett’s book that made us feminists. I remember staring at Alice Neel’s image of a confident-looking Ms. Millett on a Time magazine cover in August 1970. It made me feel a little indomitable, too. That fall, I started to offer feminist analyses in my literature classes. Maybe I wasn’t ready to take on the world, but I could take on John Keats’s “La Belle Dame Sans Merci.” In 1963, Betty Friedan had called the “feminine mystique” the problem with no name. It was Ms. Millett who gave it a name — sexual politics — and explained its cause: patriarchal society. By introducing the concept of “patriarchy as a political institution,” she equipped her readers to become their own theorists of culture. Ms. Millett revolutionized our thought by helping us to perceive the power structures in what had previously been cast as apolitical terrain: the home; literature; romantic relationships. It felt so liberating to realize that we could follow her lead. We could take this fundamental insight to our jobs, our schools, our marriages — and to politics itself. Theory mattered. It was capable of propelling real change. "
319,"HOUSTON — As the floodwaters rose in my west Houston neighborhood after Hurricane Harvey landed, my husband and many of our neighbors pulled boats through waist-high water, knocked on doors and plucked people from their submerged houses. They rescued elderly couples, young roommates, families who do not speak English. There was no checking of IDs, no debate on whether a life was worth saving. All across the city, as catastrophic flooding threatened to drown us, regular people risked their lives to help others. Alonso Guillen, a radio host and D.J. who lived in Lufkin, Tex., two hours from Houston, brought a boat and a group of friends here to join in those efforts. He was on that boat, saving people he had never met before, when it capsized last Wednesday and he drowned. Alonso Guillen died a hero, if not an American citizen. He was a Dreamer, a beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and like the nearly 141,000 other Dreamers in Texas, he followed the requirements of the program — to stay in school or be gainfully employed — and had never been convicted of a crime. More than that, Texas was his home. Around the time Alonso Guillen was buried in Lufkin, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced President Trump’s decision to cancel the DACA program, saying that “enforcing the law saves lives, protects communities and taxpayers, and prevents human suffering.” Instead, what the announcement shows is how suffering can needlessly be inflicted. The end of DACA means that hundreds of thousands of people nationwide will lose their eligibility to work. As many as 80,000 Dreamers in the greater Houston area alone could be deported to countries where they have no relationships, where they do not even speak the language. It is the disaster of this decision — more than the hurricane — that threatens to tear our city apart. On Saturday, after Mr. Guillen’s boat capsized but days before his body was found, President Trump came to Houston for the second time since the hurricane, to meet with families at shelters and churches. In a dry, air-conditioned building, he met with elected officials, took a few selfies with evacuees and kissed their babies before leaving on his plane. "

Rick Scott as Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, left a path of devastation through the Caribbean and headed toward his state. There were already shortages of gas, water and sandbags. Above, motorists headed north. The death toll from Irma — at least seven — is expected to rise. A local official said that “95 percent” of the island of St. Martin was destroyed. Puerto Rico was spared the worst, but more than 70 percent of households there remain without power. Here’s the devastation in Irma’s wake, and a map of where it’s headed next. Our live briefing has the latest. _____ 2. The Republican-led Senate gave its reluctant approval to President Trump’s surprise deal with the Democrats to raise the debt limit, fund the government and provide billions in disaster aid. "
321,"WASHINGTON — A new round of contracts has been awarded to build prototypes for a wall along the border with Mexico, the Department of Homeland Security announced on Thursday. Two of the companies selected, Caddell Construction Company of Montgomery, Ala., and W. G. Yates & Sons Construction Company of Philadelphia, Miss., were also among firms awarded contracts last week to build concrete wall prototypes in the San Diego area. The other companies chosen to build the wall prototypes are KWR Construction Inc. of Sierra Vista, Ariz., and ELTA North America Inc. of Annapolis Junction, Md. The new wall prototypes will be 18 to 30 feet high and made of materials other than concrete, according to documents from Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. The agency did not say what those materials include. Officials said the prototypes, which will also be constructed in the San Diego area, are designed to deter illegal crossings. The border wall was a key campaign issue for President Trump, who said it would stop drugs and dangerous international gangs, although experts point out that most drugs are smuggled into the country through ports of entry, not over the border. Days after taking office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order instructing Customs and Border Protection to build a wall along large sections of the border. The wall has proved to be a tough sell in Congress. Mr. Trump has asked lawmakers to allocate $1.6 billion this year toward building a wall along the roughly 1,900-mile border with Mexico. A mix of barriers — from chain-link fences and steel walls that keep people from crossing to steel beams that stop vehicles — already stretches across about 650 miles of the border. Congress has provided $341 million this year to repair and bolster the existing barriers. The House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill that included $1.6 billion for 74 miles of fencing along the border. The Senate has yet to act on the proposal. Mr. Trump had threatened a government shutdown if the border wall is not included in the next spending bill. He later backtracked on the threat. The Senate approved a measure on Thursday to keep the government funded through December, but did not include funding for the border wall. The House still has to vote on the bill. The Center for Biological Diversity, an Arizona-based environmental group, sued the Trump administration in April for failing to study the environmental impact of the proposed border wall. On Tuesday, the group amended its lawsuit to include the border-wall replacement and prototype projects. "
322,"It is not just the threat of deportation that is hanging over Amparo Gonzalez. The 31-year-old single mother could also lose her job at a warehouse company, even if she stays in the country. With it would go the health insurance she gets through her employer, which covers her 13-year-old daughter, as well as the exams and treatments that Ms. Gonzalez needs for her chronic colon disease. “I lose everything without DACA,” she said, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that President Trump moved this week to eliminate. With the news that roughly 800,000 people across the country would begin losing their protected status under DACA, which offered work permits and temporary reprieves from deportation to young undocumented immigrants, the program’s beneficiaries are now scrambling to prepare for the various ways the decision could upend their lives. Living and working in the United States are the two privileges most often associated with DACA. But for many recipients, those are merely the first dominoes to fall if Congress does not pass a replacement. The shutdown of the program could reverberate far beyond those privileges and topple the many others that DACA protection can confer, from state-sponsored health coverage and financial aid to driver’s licenses and professional credentials. The loss of these things could, in turn, disrupt recipients’ abilities to go to school, support their families and keep a roof over their heads. Losing the ability to work legally would mean, for an estimated 450,000 people, forfeiting the health insurance and other benefits offered through employers, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Another 290,000 recipients, the center said, may lose their eligibility for state-subsidized health coverage when their protection expires. The law center’s researchers also found that more than half of DACA beneficiaries will be forced to relinquish driver’s licenses. And while many might find work under the table or from sympathetic employers, they could not obtain most occupational licenses, like those required for nursing and cosmetology. "

324,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan participated in a TimesTalks conversation in Washington on Thursday. He discussed the coming tax overhaul effort, immigration, this week’s surprise debt limit deal and what it’s like to work with President Trump. Here are the takeaways. From dealing with the debt ceiling to cutting corporate taxes, it was clear on Thursday that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump disagree on a wide variety of issues. It was also evident that their fortunes are tied and that Mr. Ryan will continue to do his best to cast their differences in a positive light. A day after calling Democrats’ debt ceiling proposal “ridiculous,” Mr. Ryan empathized with Mr. Trump, saying he was seeking a bipartisan moment in the face of crises. Mr. Ryan struck a similar tone on taxes as he called Mr. Trump’s hope for a 15 percent corporate tax rate unrealistic. Rather than focus on their differences, Mr. Ryan emphasized that Mr. Trump wants to get the rate as low as possible. One of the most contentious fights in the coming tax overhaul effort is likely to be the push the eliminate state and local tax deductions. Several Republicans in Congress from states with high tax rates have already expressed their opposition to this plan. Mr. Ryan made a full-throated case on Thursday for eliminating that deduction, arguing that the deduction generally helps the rich. He said that if the standard deduction was doubled, as he wants to do, then middle-income people would feel little effect from changes to the state and local deduction. "
325,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Bypasses G.O.P. to Strike a Deal on Debt” (front page, Sept. 7): While I am generally loath to say nice things about this president because his words and actions are usually beneath the dignity of the office, I have to give him credit for understanding one thing about Washington: If you want to get anything done, you have to deal with the Democrats. While the Freedom Caucus and other archconservatives may fume over the debt deal, the real takeaway lesson for them should be that if you want to be part of the solution, you have to stop being part of the problem. This deal may not usher in a new era of bipartisanship, but it does signal to these recalcitrant Republicans that there are other options and that this president is not afraid to take them. MICHAEL SCOTT, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: While it’s generally good news that President Trump struck a deal on the debt ceiling, let’s understand that it probably had less to do with Hurricane Harvey aid and bipartisanship than Mr. Trump’s own self-interest and inherent conflicts. A debt ceiling crisis, even not a full-blown default, would roil markets and increase the borrowing costs of businesses, certainly including Trump Organization businesses. So it is not without a smile that I can write that the G.O.P. has been hoist by its own petard. JONATHAN D. KARMEL, CHICAGO To the Editor: I have mixed emotions about the Democrats’ wanting to tie the debt ceiling to Hurricane Harvey funding. Although I overwhelmingly approve both funding for Harvey relief and raising the debt ceiling, which is the only responsible option, I think it should be a hard-and-fast rule that you do not politicize the debt ceiling. Ever. Defaulting on our debt is the fiscal equivalent of a unilateral nuclear strike. It is unthinkable. There should never be conditions set. There are reasons for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, to be concerned about our debt. Those concerns should be addressed in the budgeting process, not in keeping the promises to pay debt that Congress has already approved. Tying together Harvey relief funding and paying our bills on time puts both at risk, as it asks for political courage from G.O.P. legislators. Not a good bet. JEFFREY L. GARCEAU, CHICAGO The writer is research coordinator for MuniNet Guide, which covers public finance issues. "
326,"WASHINGTON — The Republican-led Senate on Thursday approved legislation to raise the debt limit and keep the government funded until December while providing $15 billion in disaster aid, giving a reluctant stamp of approval to the surprising deal that President Trump struck with Democratic congressional leaders. The Senate approved the measure 80 to 17. All of the senators voting no were Republicans. The Senate acted quickly to provide funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency as it helps Texas recover from Hurricane Harvey, and the federal government will probably be stretched further as Hurricane Irma heads toward Florida. The House passed a measure on Wednesday providing about $7.9 billion in disaster aid, and the Senate beefed up that aid package by adding another $7.4 billion, for a total of about $15.3 billion. “The recovery effort for a record-setting storm like Harvey has strained resources to the limit already,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. “The advance of another historic storm now makes the need for action even more urgent.” Republican leaders had wanted a longer-term extension of the debt limit, but were left with little recourse when Mr. Trump sided with the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, at a White House meeting on Wednesday, blindsiding his own party. The fiscal deal eases the pressure to resolve a thicket of pressing issues this month, but it sets up a high-stakes face-off later this year when lawmakers will need to agree on another funding measure to keep the government open in the long term. Congress will also need to take further action to raise the government’s borrowing capacity and likely will face a far larger hurricane-relief package. Democrats hope to be able to negotiate with Republicans on other issues, too, such as immigration and a measure to stabilize health insurance markets. The measure approved Thursday would continue government funding through Dec. 8 and extend the debt limit for the same period. It would also temporarily extend the National Flood Insurance Program, which is to expire on Sept. 30. "

328,"To the Editor: Re “It’s the Twitter Age. Let Trump Have His Way With Words,” by Farhad Manjoo (State of the Art column, Aug. 28): It’s not as if Donald Trump is an articulate, thoughtful or composed person who just happens to make spelling errors on Twitter. That would be forgivable. The problem is that his tweets are like a mirror held up to the inner workings of his mind: nonsensical, unintelligent, erratic and dangerous. The end result is a barrage of tens of thousands of tweets going back almost a decade that are full of not just spelling errors, but also a cascade of other public embarrassments: one-word sentences that operate more like dog barks, poor word choices, odd (or missing) punctuation, factual mistakes and outright lies. This is unforgivable for a president. End of story. MARK BESSOUDO, TORONTO To the Editor: In the business world, standards matter, including for writing, and proper spelling is essential to good writing. It helps ensure clarity, averting confusion, misinterpretation and mistakes. This is critical in a fast-paced business environment, where globally dispersed employees rely heavily on written communications and may have English as a second language. Spelling correctly is a best practice, whether on Twitter or email. In business, as in politics, everything you put into writing creates a record and reflects on you. HELEN CUNNINGHAM

329,"SEATTLE — Wanted: A place with a million people, a diverse population, good schools and malleable lawmakers. Room to accommodate up to 50,000 workers. Canadian provinces also welcome to apply. Amazon took the unusual step on Thursday of announcing it wants a second home outside Seattle, starting what is sure to be a fierce bidding war to lure Amazon — and the thousands of high-paying jobs it will bring to town — using a combination of tax breaks and other sweeteners. By the end of the day, cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, along with states like Michigan, were vocal about their interest, the first of many places expected to consider submitting proposals. Amazon has laid out in meticulous detail what it is looking for, even acknowledging that new laws may be required to get the high level of incentives necessary to hold the company’s attention. “This is the trophy deal of the decade as far as I can tell,” said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. “What governor or mayor doesn’t want to stand on a stage with Jeff Bezos to announce a deal like this?” The plan is the latest surprise from Mr. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, who has reshaped Seattle in the more than two decades since he founded Amazon. He overshadows even Bill Gates, the former Microsoft chief executive who put the Seattle area on the map as a destination for tech companies. Amazon is now the biggest corporate employer in Seattle, and it occupies 19 percent of the prime office space in the city, more than any other employer in a big American city, The Seattle Times reported last month. But Amazon executives have talked internally and with outsiders in recent years about how much more of the company’s hyper-growth Seattle would be able to handle. Housing prices here are skyrocketing, the competition for tech industry talent is getting more fierce and traffic chokes the roads. "
330,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. A 19th-century economist named Adolph Wagner made a prediction that came to be known as Wagner’s Law: As societies became wealthier, their taxes would rise. They would rise because people would want more of the services that government tended to provide better than the private market, like national security, education, medical care and a guaranteed retirement. Wagner’s Law has proven truer than not, but there are still many people who would like to pretend otherwise. Specifically, they wish we could summon a country with a strong military, good schools, health care and comfortable retirements — but falling taxes. It’s a nice fantasy. Yesterday, Larry Summers, the economist and former Treasury secretary, gave a lunchtime presentation in Washington laying out the statistics that debunk the falling-taxes fantasy. He effectively updated Wagner’s Law for the United States in 2017. “With the same values and preferences, and the same basic attitude about government activity versus private activity,” Summers said, “you should expect government to be larger in the future than it has been in the past.” There are four main reasons, he argued: • One, society is aging, which calls for greater spending on retirees. The ratio of elderly Americans — those expected to be in the last 15 years of their lives — to all other Americans will rise about 50 percent from 2010 to 2030. "
331,"The 1990s have been resurgent of late, largely thanks to their somewhat ignoble contributions to contemporary life: reality television and “Baywatch”; White House scandal and congressional shutdown; and, of course, the introduction of Donald J. Trump as a pop culture tabloid star. Well, we all need something to blame. Why not a time period? That it also happened to be an era when fashion had a knowing, energetic immediacy worth celebrating has been mostly overlooked. But on Wednesday, with the opening show of the New York spring 2018 season, Tom Ford came along to remind us. Returning to New York with his first full-on traditional runway show after seasons of flirting with alternate venues (London! L.A.!) and forms (video! dinner theater!) and some timeouts for films, Mr. Ford took a trip down his own glam-cobblestoned memory lane. The 1990s, after all, were the heyday of his Gucci years — he became its creative director in 1994, and left 10 years later — when he burst onto the fashion scene, injecting the concept of postmodern irony into unabashed luxury, adding a dose of sex and making it cool. Just consider that his new collection was in part the opening act for his new fragrance: Alliteratively titled, using first a crude word for sexual congress, followed by “Fabulous.” You fill in the blank. (That is honestly the name on the label.) "
332,"WASHINGTON — By the time President Trump woke up on Thursday morning, he was feeling upbeat. And as he watched television news reports about his fiscal agreement with Democrats, he felt like telling someone. He picked up the phone and called the two Democratic congressional leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. “The press has been incredible,” he gushed to Ms. Pelosi, according to someone briefed on their call. He was equally effusive with Mr. Schumer, boasting that even Fox News was positive. A few hours later, Mr. Trump went on TV himself, vowing to turn a one-time spending-and-debt deal brokered out of expediency into a more enduring bipartisan alliance that could transform his presidency. He signaled openness to a Democratic proposal to eliminate the perennial showdowns over the debt ceiling, and he repeated his desire to cut a deal to protect younger illegal immigrants from deportation. But even as Republicans fumed at being sidelined, many in Washington were skeptical that the moment of comity would last. Although Mr. Trump has at times preached bipartisanship, he has never made it a central part of his governing strategy. While he may have been feeling energized on Thursday by the collaboration, he is a politician driven by the latest expression of approval, given to abrupt shifts in approach and tone. He is a man of the moment, and the moment often does not last. There are also reasons to doubt whether Democrats would sustain a partnership with Mr. Trump beyond the deal they have cut to keep the government open for three months and paying its debts. The centrifugal forces of partisanship tug from the left as well as the right, and the liberal base has put pressure on Democratic lawmakers not to meet in the middle a president it loathes. For one day, though, the two sides sought to put months of acrimony behind them. “I think we will have a different relationship than we’ve been watching over the last number of years. I hope so,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “I think that’s a great thing for our country. And I think that’s what the people of the United States want to see. They want to see some dialogue. They want to see coming together to an extent.” "
333,"The standout college quarterback went to the meeting alone that winter night, looking to join. The fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha Psi, a predominantly black fraternity with a small chapter at the University of Nevada, knew who he was. He was a tall, lean, biracial junior, less than a year from graduating with a business degree. “When he came and said he had interest in joining the fraternity, I kind of looked at him like, ‘Yeah, O.K.,’” said Olumide Ogundimu, one of the members. “I didn’t take it seriously. I thought: ‘You’re the star quarterback. What are you still missing that you’re looking for membership into our fraternity?’” His name was Colin Kaepernick, and what he was looking for, Ogundimu and others discovered, was a deeper connection to his own roots and a broader understanding of the lives of others. Seven years later, now 29, Kaepernick is the most polarizing figure in American sports. Outside of politics, there may be nobody in popular culture at this complex moment so divisive and so galvanizing, so scorned and so appreciated. Attempts to explain who Kaepernick is — and how and why he became either a traitor (“Maybe he should find a country that works better for him,” Donald J. Trump said as a presidential candidate last year) or a hero (“He is the Muhammad Ali of this generation,” the longtime civil rights activist Harry Edwards said in an interview last week) — tend to devolve into partisan politics and emotional debates ranging from patriotic rituals to racial inequities. Kaepernick is now (and may forever be) known for a simple, silent gesture. He is the quarterback who knelt for the national anthem before National Football League games last year as a protest against social injustice, especially the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police.

334,"As New York City hot dog locations go, Tommy Chan’s vending spot in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens is a slow one. But that all changes every year in late August when the United States Open tennis tournament begins. That’s when his modest shack becomes a gold mine. For the two weeks of tennis, lunch-time crowds mob Mr. Chan’s little wooden hut, informally named Tommy’s Doghouse. As the only vendor permitted to sell food on the perimeter of the tournament grounds (aside from the snack counter at a pitch and putt nearby), Mr. Chan, 63, gets swamped with tournament workers and bargain-hunting fans seeking an affordable option to the considerably more expensive food offerings at the tournament, which is scheduled to end with the men’s final on Sunday. His $2 hot dogs are a bargain, compared with the franks inside, which tend to start at $6.50. While a small bottle of water costs $4.50 inside the gates, Mr. Chan charges $2. Erica Newell, of Queens, who works security at the tournament, said that she’ll squeeze in a trip to the doghouse during her 30-minute break for a $4.75 cheeseburger, “compared to inside where you can pay up to 11 bucks,” she explained. “Even though there’s usually a long line, you’re waiting to pay a cheaper price. It works.” "
335,"In Tecate, Mexico, a little boy with dark hair and curious eyes peers carefully over the barrier wall that borders San Diego County. Rising up almost 70 feet, his hands seemingly grip the barrier tightly, as if he were holding onto his mother’s body. The French artist JR pasted that plaintive image on Wednesday, his first installation in Mexico. The piece, based on his photo of a 1-year-old who lives with his mother and grandparents in Tecate, is fully viewable only from the American side of the divide. The idea came to JR in a dream. “Some people dream about fantasy worlds, I dream about walls,” he said in a phone interview. And though his artwork was not intended as a direct response to the Trump administration, it has extra resonance this week as the White House moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. “I wonder, is this kid worrying about what will happen? What does he think?” JR said. “At one year old, you don’t see the frontier or which side is better.” The United States-Mexico border has been especially fertile ground for artists lately. In Tijuana, the Japanese collective Chim Pom built a treehouse called the “USA Visitors Center,” that JR visited. An American photographer, Richard Misrach, and a Mexican composer, Guillermo Galindo, have joined forces to craft instruments from the objects migrants leave behind. And the Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu created “Carne y Arena,” an immersive virtual-reality exhibition that simulates crossing the border. It’s currently on view at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For JR, whose recent work has frequently dealt with immigrants and refugees, the Mexican installation is part of a continuing conversation. “People will always migrate,” he said. “When we built walls, people built tunnels. When we closed places, they went by the water. The history of humanity is the story of people migrating. Of course, that has to be regulated.” But the idea that borders should be closed, he said, “for me, that’s not a discussion. As an artist, I try to bring back perspective. For this little kid, there are no walls and borders.” "
336,"Sometimes an international offensive begins with a few shots that draw little notice. So it was last year when Melvin Redick of Harrisburg, Pa., a friendly-looking American with a backward baseball cap and a young daughter, posted on Facebook a link to a brand-new website. “These guys show hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US,” he wrote on June 8, 2016. “Visit #DCLeaks website. It’s really interesting!” Mr. Redick turned out to be a remarkably elusive character. No Melvin Redick appears in Pennsylvania records, and his photos seem to be borrowed from an unsuspecting Brazilian. But this fictional concoction has earned a small spot in history: The Redick posts that morning were among the first public signs of an unprecedented foreign intervention in American democracy. The DCLeaks site had gone live a few days earlier, posting the first samples of material, stolen from prominent Americans by Russian hackers, that would reverberate through the presidential election campaign and into the Trump presidency. The site’s phony promoters were in the vanguard of a cyberarmy of counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts, a legion of Russian-controlled impostors whose operations are still being unraveled. The Russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails or the fire hose of stories, true, false and in between, that battered Mrs. Clinton on Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik. Far less splashy, and far more difficult to trace, was Russia’s experimentation on Facebook and Twitter, the American companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and, in this case, did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda.

337,"BLURRED LINES
Rethinking Sex, Power and Consent on Campus
By Vanessa Grigoriadis
332 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $28. In July Candice E. Jackson, the top civil rights official in Donald Trump’s Department of Education, told The New York Times that 90 percent of campus rape allegations come from women who regret drunken consensual sex. (She later apologized for her “flippant” remarks.) The day after Jackson made this claim, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, met with groups representing students who say they were falsely accused of sexual assault, including the National Coalition for Men Carolinas. (Says a banner on the group’s website: “Don’t be THAT girl: Embarrassed by a hookup? Angry at a boyfriend? Willing to lie to destroy a life?”) Before the month was over, Columbia University announced that it had settled a lawsuit brought by Paul Nungesser, who became infamous after being accused of rape by Emma Sulkowicz, a fellow student. In 2014, outraged by how Columbia had handled her sexual assault claim against Nungesser, Sulkowicz began lugging a mattress around campus for an entire school year, an iconic piece of protest art that served as her senior thesis. Nungesser’s suit alleged that Columbia, by enabling Sulkowicz’s project, abetted “gender-based harassment” against him. Sulkowicz’s case was emblematic of the movement to use civil rights law to combat campus rape, but in the end the law offered redress to her accused rapist. It’s an irony appropriate to the Trump-era backlash against what his supporters perceived as the far-reaching anti-campus rape policies that took hold during Barack Obama’s presidency. Vanessa Grigoriadis did most of the reporting for her sometimes fascinating but often frustrating new book, “Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power and Consent on Campus,” during the Obama years, when the movement against campus rape was ascendant. Now as the book is released, the movement is on the defensive. This actually makes the subject of “Blurred Lines” more relevant rather than less. Every empirical claim about campus rape is under ferocious dispute: There’s no consensus about what constitutes sexual assault on campus, how common it is or how it should be prevented. In this confusing climate, a cleareyed elucidation of the murky campus rape phenomenon would be enormously welcome. “Blurred Lines” aims to be that book, but is too sloppy with the facts to succeed. Grigoriadis, a contributing editor at The Times Magazine and Vanity Fair, is terrific at capturing complicated personalities and subtle social dynamics. Her kaleidoscopic tour through the campus sexual assault controversy, which begins and ends with Sulkowicz, introduces readers to rape victims-turned-activists, faux-worldly sorority sisters, young men who say their lives were destroyed by false accusations and the college administrators struggling to enforce rapidly changing rules and norms. Grigoriadis puts in the time with students to get them to open up to her, and “Blurred Lines” shows us the parts of their world that defy easy sloganeering. From the outside, that world looks brutal, at least for young women who have internalized the idea that empowerment means mastering a coldly performative sexuality. At one point, a radical feminist at Wesleyan University admits her dislike of pornography in a whisper, saying, “You’re not supposed to say you feel that way.” It’s as if the only taboo desire is the desire for sexual taboos. "
338,"Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, plans to step down from the magazine in December after a 25-year tenure, leaving the role that established him as a ringmaster of the Hollywood, Washington and Manhattan power elite. Mr. Carter’s influence stretched from the magazine and entertainment worlds into finance, literature and politics, where President Trump, a target of Mr. Carter’s poison pen for decades, still bristles at the mention of his name. One of the few remaining celebrity editors in an industry whose fortunes have faded, Mr. Carter — famous for double-breasted suits, white flowing hair and a seven-figure salary — is a party host, literary patron, film producer and restaurateur whose cheeky-yet-rigorous brand of reporting influenced a generation of journalists. Now, he is moving on. “I want to leave while the magazine is on top,” Mr. Carter, 68, said in an interview on Wednesday at the kitchen table of his West Village townhouse. “I wanted to have a third act. And I thought, time is precious.” Mr. Carter co-founded Spy magazine in the 1980s, which helped forge the wry tone and visual style of modern publications. But Vanity Fair, with its fixation on actors, moguls and faded aristocrats, was a product of its editor’s highly particular interests: the golden age of Hollywood, the rituals of WASPdom, the European jet set, Anglophilia. His copious coverage of British royalty and out-of-date celebrities like the Kennedy family was often mocked; one critic found that one-third of the magazine’s issues from 2003 to 2011 contained at least one Kennedy-related article.

339,"WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the top Democrat on the panel announced on Tuesday night that they had reached agreement on a plan to prevent the imminent exhaustion of federal funds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The current appropriation runs out at the end of this month, and many states will exhaust their allotments of federal money later this year or early next year. Nearly nine million children receive health insurance through the program, on which the federal government has been spending about $14 billion a year. The program is for children in families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford other coverage. The agreement was announced by the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and the senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. “Congress needs to act quickly to extend the funding for CHIP,” said Mr. Hatch, who helped create the program in 1997 with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. Mr. Hatch said the agreement would provide “uninterrupted funding for CHIP” and “increased flexibility for states to administer the program.” "
340,"If voters sent any discernible messages in the contested Democratic primaries for New York City Council, they were that gentrification is bad, Albany legislators might be good, and a staunchly liberal vision is less important than a strong neighborhood constituency. Oh, and name recognition matters a lot in low turnout races, but is not everything: Five state legislators sought to trade an Albany commute for the shorter trip to City Hall; three of them won. With most of the races decided by late Tuesday, the results pointed to a modest reshuffling of the political map of the Democrat-dominated Council, whose 51 members include just three Republicans. It was a far cry from four years earlier, when a wave of progressive candidates filled about twice as many empty seats and shifted the city’s legislative body further to the left. Indeed, several of Tuesday’s victors were moderate Democrats like State Senator Ruben Diaz Sr., a household name in the Bronx, who voted against gay marriage in Albany and won handily. On the other hand, name recognition probably hurt Hiram Monserrate, the former councilman and state senator convicted of fraud and assault. He lost his comeback bid in central Queens to a state assemblyman, Francisco P. Moya. Much about 2017 was different from the last round of Council elections: the lack of a vibrant contest in the mayoral primary, which Mayor Bill de Blasio won on Tuesday in a walk; a far smaller number of exiting incumbents; and the virtual absence of spending by outside groups, which totaled $720,000 in all Council races this year versus nearly 10 times that in 2013. In the contests for 10 open seats and another 10 with embattled incumbents, local issues dominated, particularly those related to the perennial concerns of gentrification, development and homelessness. "
341,"Defeating a field of five other candidates, Eric Gonzalez won the Democratic primary election for Brooklyn district attorney on Tuesday, taking another step toward becoming the first Latino elected to this office. With no Republican scheduled to run in November’s general election, Mr. Gonzalez, who had already been serving as the acting district attorney, will essentially continue in his job as the borough’s top law enforcement officer. Such a crowded primary field would have been unlikely if not for the sudden death of the previous district attorney, Ken Thompson, who succumbed to cancer in October, in the third year of his four-year term. Five lawyers — all of them former prosecutors — stepped in to challenge Mr. Gonzalez, but none could overcome his wide institutional support or the advantage of his brief incumbency. With 94.4 percent of the precincts counted, Mr. Gonzalez had nearly 53 percent of the vote; his nearest challenger, Anne J. Swern, had 11.6 percent. “I am so happy,” Mr. Gonzalez said at his victory party Tuesday night. “Tonight we make history. I look around this room and see what’s beautiful about Brooklyn. I see the diversity.” The Brooklyn district attorney sets policies that affect the borough’s 2.6 million residents, overseeing an office of nearly 500 prosecutors that handles almost 85,000 criminal cases a year. "
342,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s voter fraud commission met in New Hampshire on Tuesday to discuss what members characterized as declining confidence in elections. But the most telling discussions of the session addressed declining confidence in the commission itself. As protesters outside the meeting accused the panel of promoting voter suppression, New Hampshire Secretary of State William M. Gardner, a Democrat on the commission, warned that “the specter of extreme political partisanship” threatened to undermine whatever work it was doing. And Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, another Democrat on the commission, dressed down the commission’s Republican vice chairman for what he called reckless statements about supposed voter fraud in New Hampshire. Even a commission member not in attendance made his critical voice heard. The panel “should be expanding the rights of our citizens to vote, instead of arguably looking for ways to keep people from voting,” wrote Alan L. King, a Democrat and probate judge in Jefferson County, Ala., in a stinging letter. “Some parts of our electorate wish to beat their chests on so-called ‘voter fraud,’ and there may be some isolated instances” of irregularities, he wrote. “But, I would venture to say, thousands upon thousands more people are stricken from voter rolls without justifiable cause or have their vote suppressed.” From its start in May, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity has been dogged by charges that it was established to bolster President Trump’s baseless assertion that fraud cost him a popular-vote victory last November, and to lay the groundwork for future Republican efforts to restrict voting rights. Mr. Trump collected 2.8 million fewer votes than his main rival, Hillary Clinton, but nevertheless won the Electoral College tally. Critics say the panel is politically stacked — the chairman and vice chairman are both Republicans — and loaded with extremists who contend that election fraud is rampant. "
343,"INTERNATIONAL The Guardia Sanframondi Journal article on Monday about a parade in which residents of the Italian town re-enact Bible stories described one of the scenes incorrectly. A villager portrayed the biblical patriarch Abraham as he offered his son Isaac in sacrifice; he did not portray Samuel anointing David as king of Israel. The error was repeated in a picture caption. SPORTS A picture on Saturday with an article about Major League Baseball’s decision to move the Yankees’ three-game series in St. Petersburg, Fla., against the Tampa Bay Rays to Citi Field was published in error. It showed the Yankees warming up for a 1998 regular-season game at Shea Stadium against the Mets, not the team warming up before a 1998 game that was moved to Shea Stadium because a beam had fallen at Yankee Stadium. • An article on Friday about the Yankees’ 9-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles referred incorrectly to the Yankees’ results in the series in Baltimore. It was their first series win — not sweep — in Baltimore since 2013. • An article on Friday about the women’s semifinals at the United States Open misstated Sloane Stephens’s results at major tournaments since reaching the semifinals of the 2013 Australian Open. She advanced past the fourth round once, at Wimbledon in 2013; it is not the case that “she had not advanced past the fourth round in a major tournament” until this year’s U.S. Open. • An article on Saturday about the men’s semifinals at the United States Open misidentified the last man representing South Africa to reach a Grand Slam final before Kevin Anderson at this year’s U.S. Open. The last to do so was Kevin Curren, at the 1984 Australian Open — not Johan Kriek, at the 1981 Australian Open. • An article on Thursday about the men’s quarterfinals at the United States Open misstated the given name of Rafael Nadal’s opponent. He is Andrey Rublev, not Andrew. "
344,"Mayor Bill de Blasio coasted to a decisive win on Tuesday in the Democratic primary in New York City, as he moved closer to securing a second term. Facing a group of underfinanced, little-known rivals, Mr. de Blasio received 74 percent of the vote. His main opponent, Sal F. Albanese, a lawyer and former city councilman making his third bid for mayor, received 15 percent. Mr. de Blasio will now focus on the general election, on Nov. 7, when he will face the Republican candidate, Nicole Malliotakis, an assemblywoman from Staten Island, and Bo Dietl, a former police detective running as an independent. “Tonight we took another big step toward a fairer city for all, tonight another ratification of all that we’ve been doing together and it’s going to give us the fuel to go farther,” Mr. de Blasio said at a victory party in Brooklyn, naming some of his achievements, including universal prekindergarten classes, a two-year rent freeze for rent-regulated tenants and a sharp reduction in the stop-and-frisk policing tactic. With no major Democrat willing to take on the incumbent mayor, the contest had all the urgency of a preseason football game, generating tepid interest among voters. "
345,"WASHINGTON — The House and Senate have unanimously passed a joint resolution urging President Trump to denounce racist and anti-Semitic hate groups, sending a blunt message of dissatisfaction with the president’s initial, equivocal response to the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., last month. The resolution passed the Senate without dissent on Monday and was approved without objection by the entire House on Tuesday night. It could be sent to the White House for Mr. Trump’s signature as early as Wednesday. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately answer a request for comment. The nonbinding measure specifically singles out for condemnation “White nationalists, White supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups.” That represents a sharp contrast to the president’s first comments after the deadly early August demonstrations in which he assigned equivalent blame for the violence on anti-fascist counter-protesters. Mr. Trump denounced “hatred, bigotry and violence — on many sides” and argued that many of the protesters who staged a torchlight march to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee were “very fine people.” One of the counterprotesters, Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a white nationalist demonstrator drove a car into a crowd. Two Virginia State troopers died when their helicopter crashed while monitoring the violence that swept through the usually sedate college town. The House version of the resolution, introduced by Republican and Democratic House members from Virginia, asks Mr. Trump to “use all resources available to the President and the President’s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States.” In a rare show of bipartisan unity, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, introduced the measure as a joint resolution, which requires a presidential signature. Two Republican congressional aides involved in the process said the intent was to put the president on the record calling out white racism by name. The text doesn’t include any reference to counterprotesters. It also calls on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to “investigate thoroughly all acts of violence, intimidation, and domestic terrorism by White supremacists, White nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, and associated groups” and to “improve the reporting of hate crimes” to the F.B.I. “What happened in Charlottesville was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated by a white supremacist, one that tragically cut short the life of a young woman, Heather Heyer, who was speaking out against hatred and bigotry,” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and a co-sponsor of the measure, said in a statement. “We will be pressing our colleagues to swiftly and unanimously approve this resolution in order to send a strong message that the United States Congress unconditionally condemns racist speech and violence.” "
346,"The University of California, Berkeley, has erupted this year in response to planned speeches by conservative flamethrowers like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter. On Tuesday, another figure was added to the mix: Stephen K. Bannon, the right-wing media executive and former chief strategist to President Trump. Mr. Bannon has agreed to speak this month as part of Free Speech Week, a four-day event organized by The Berkeley Patriot, a conservative student publication. Mr. Yiannopoulos is also scheduled to appear. Bryce Kasamoto, The Berkeley Patriot’s spokesman, confirmed in a Facebook message on Tuesday evening that Mr. Bannon and Mr. Yiannopoulos would appear at the event, which runs from Sept. 24-27. He indicated that there would be additional speakers but said that he could not name them yet because his group was “still working with the university and law enforcement to finalize our itinerary.” “It’s a valuable opportunity to have such a high-profile figure, who rarely speaks in public, come to our university,” Mr. Kasamoto, a senior at Berkeley, said of Mr. Bannon in an interview on Wednesday. He added that he and his fellow organizers — Mike Wright, also a senior, and Pranav Jandhyala, a sophomore — had invited both conservatives and liberals to speak. “Even if you don’t agree with him politically,” he said, Mr. Bannon “was one of the most influential figures in the 2016 election.” "
347,"Nancy Gibbs, the first woman to lead Time magazine, is stepping down as editor in chief, ending her four-year run at the publication’s helm. “It felt like it was time,” Ms. Gibbs, 57, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday night. “I’m now going to go do my next thing.” Ms. Gibbs, who joined Time in 1985 as a fact-checker and was named the magazine’s top editor in 2013, helped steer the nearly century-old magazine through a period of great transition for its parent company, Time Inc. Since the company spun off from Time Warner in 2014, it has brought on a new leadership team that has implemented an aggressive strategy to transform the print magazine publisher into a digital media company as it combats declining print advertising and circulation. This year, after fielding interest from potential suitors, the company said it had decided not to sell itself. Ms. Gibbs said that she had embraced the changes at Time Inc., whose stable of magazines also includes Sports Illustrated and People. “Change doesn’t scare me,” she said. “I know that our industry faces all kinds of uncertainty — I recognize that. But this is the golden age of storytelling, so if you’re not changing, you’re missing the opportunity.” Her decision comes on the heels of two other significant leadership announcements in the magazine industry. Last week, Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, announced he would step down in December after a 25-year run. And on Monday, Robbie Myers, the longtime editor of Elle, also said she was leaving her post. Ms. Gibbs said she would stay at Time Inc. through the end of the year as the editorial director of company’s news group, a position she has held since last year, and would help with the magazine’s transition. “Today marks the end of an era,” Rich Battista, the chief executive of Time Inc., and Alan Murray, the company’s chief content officer, said in a note to employees. “Nancy is one of a kind and cannot be replicated,” they added. “Nancy has built not only a remarkable legacy but also a remarkable news organization, and we are determined to maintain its power and relevance in the years ahead.” Time Inc. did not name a successor to Ms. Gibbs, but Mr. Battista and Mr. Murray said they planned to “move quickly” to appoint the magazine’s next top editor. The news that Ms. Gibbs was stepping down was first reported by Vanity Fair. During her 32 years at Time, Ms. Gibbs interviewed five presidents, including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Donald J. Trump, and numerous other leaders. Though she said she did not know what she would do next, she said she was eager to return to writing. “There are a number of things I can imagine would be interesting to explore,” she said. "
348,"WASHINGTON — Hope Hicks, one of President Trump’s longest serving advisers working in the White House, was formally named communications director on Tuesday, a title that most accurately describes the role she has played for years. Ms. Hicks’ appointment was one of a handful announced. Mercedes Schlapp, a Republican strategist and former Fox News contributor, will become the senior adviser for strategic communications, adding a new senior staff member to the reshuffled communications team. It was not immediately clear how Ms. Schlapp’s role would intersect with that of Ms. Hicks and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. Jessica Ditto, another campaign hand who has been serving as deputy communications director, is expected to continue in that role. But Ms. Hicks, who is perhaps the most press-shy member of the Trump administration, has been essentially filling the role of Mr. Trump’s communications director since her days on his campaign, when she was one of the only staff members. Until she took over the communications director role in an interim capacity, she was almost constantly by the president’s side when he traveled, and she held sway over what interviews he gave. Outside of Mr. Trump’s family members and his longtime security chief, Keith Schiller, who will leave the White House in the next few weeks, Ms. Hicks is his most trusted aide. Other changes that were announced appeared aimed in part at sending a message of continuity to a communications team that has been buffeted by nearly constant change for the past month. Raj Shah, who worked at the Republican National Committee and was seen as close to the previous press secretary, Sean Spicer, was elevated to principal deputy press secretary. Steven Cheung, who worked on the Trump campaign, will be the director of strategic response. "
349,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump welcomed Malaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak, to the White House on Tuesday, he thanked him for “all the investment you’ve made in the United States.” Mr. Trump did not single out Mr. Najib’s patronage of his hotel two blocks from the White House, but he could have: the Malaysian leader was spotted entering and exiting the Trump International Hotel, with his entourage, on Monday and Tuesday. The White House denied that Mr. Najib had picked the hotel at Mr. Trump’s behest. “We certainly don’t book their hotel accommodations,” the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “so I couldn’t speak to the personal decision they made about where to stay here in D.C.” Whatever the motivation, the choice of lodgings added to the awkwardness of a meeting already replete with ethical questions. Mr. Najib is under investigation by the Justice Department, part of a corruption scandal that critics said he has fended off by firing investigators and dismissing negative news reports about him as “fake news.” In these respects, he is not unlike Mr. Trump. So it was perhaps not a surprise that the two leaders skipped a news conference, kept their public remarks brief, and stayed on the safe ground of trade and counterterrorism. “We’re talking about trade – very large trade deals,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Najib, during a photo opportunity before they met in the Cabinet Room. “Malaysia is a massive investor in the United States in the form of stocks and bonds.” "
350,"WASHINGTON — A week after concerned Republicans promised quick work to shield young, undocumented immigrants from President Trump’s decision to end their federal protections, lawmakers have tied themselves in knots trying to figure out how to proceed — with only six months to find a way forward. If anything, advocates for immigrants brought to this country as children may have lost ground. Representative Mike Coffman, Republican of Colorado, pulled back a petition he had initiated to force the House to take up legislation to protect so-called Dreamers. A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into the issue was canceled this week. And Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he would not move on any such legislation before he addressed criminal alien gangs and border security. “With all the other things going on right now, it’s kind of put on the back burner,” Mr. Coffman conceded. When Mr. Trump announced last week that he would end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in six months, that time frame was supposed to light a fire under Congress. Instead, it may have hit the snooze button, Mr. Coffman said. “He could have done an immediate phase out,” he said. “That would really put pressure on Congress to put DACA right on the top of the agenda. But in giving Congress six months, with all the other things going on right now, the debt limit, the appropriations, tax reform, it’s not certainly on the top of the agenda right now.” Mr. Coffman, a top target for Democrats in next year’s midterm elections, had planned to circulate a “discharge petition” to force a vote on a three-year extension of DACA that he wrote with Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois. But he called off the action after Speaker Paul D. Ryan said he wanted a broader immigration measure that twinned enhanced border security measures with legalization for young immigrants. "
351,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily allowed the Trump administration to stop some 24,000 refugees from entering the United States while the court considers broad challenges to the administration’s revised travel ban. The court’s brief order effectively reversed part of an appeals court ruling that had lifted the travel ban’s restrictions on the nation’s refugee program. There were no noted dissents. The appeals court had also rejected the administration’s efforts to bar travel to the United States from six predominantly Muslim countries by people with grandparents, uncles, aunts and other relatives here. The administration did not challenge that part of the appeals court’s ruling, and the Supreme Court did not address it. The court will hear arguments on the lawfulness of the travel ban on Oct. 10. Tuesday’s order was the latest in a series of interim measures interpreting statements in a June ruling in which the court agreed to hear the case. In the meantime, the court temporarily reinstated the travel ban — but only for people without “a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The meaning of that phrase has been contested ever since. The court did not specify which relatives qualified, for instance, but it did say that spouses and mothers-in-law “clearly” counted. “As for entities,” the court said, “the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading” the executive order. It gave examples: students admitted to American universities qualified, as did workers with job offers from American companies and lecturers invited to address American audiences. "
352,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Stressed and exhausted families across the Southeast were assessing the damage from Hurricane Irma on Tuesday, even as flooding from the storm continued to plague some areas, like Jacksonville, and the worst of its wallop was being revealed in others, like the Florida Keys. Officials in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina tried to prepare residents for the hardships of recovery from the storm. Almost 4.4 million Florida homes and businesses remained without power on Tuesday evening, according to state officials, and there were widespread electricity problems in other states as well. At least 56 people have died as a result of the storm, including at least 13 in Florida, according to The Associated Press. Weakened now to a post-tropical cyclone, Irma moved toward the Ohio Valley and spread its clouds and rain over a vast area, while blue skies and sticky heat returned to Florida. The White House announced that President Trump, who twice visited Texas after Hurricane Harvey, will visit Florida on Thursday. Nursing homes and assisted-living facilities in areas without power struggled to keep residents cool and vital medical equipment operating with backup generators. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said on Tuesday that the state had shifted its attention to recovery and rebuilding efforts, while working to get water and food to those who needed it and to restore access to fuel. He said there were 30,000 people working to get the lights back on in the state, and that inspectors were checking the safety of bridges and sizing up repairs needed for sewage systems. "
353,"OTTAWA — A Canadian judge who wore a “Make America Great Again” cap into court the morning after Donald J. Trump’s election victory last year was suspended without pay and reprimanded by a disciplinary body on Tuesday. Disciplinary hearings against judges in Canada are rare. The decision about the conduct of the judge, Justice Bernd Zabel of the Ontario Court of Justice, was the first issued by the Ontario Judicial Council since 2014. The four-member council, which included a lay person and a lawyer, rejected Justice Zabel’s explanation that the campaign hat and comments he made about Mr. Trump in court were just jokes about an unexpected election result. But it also decided that removing him from the bench would be excessive, given his track record and the fact that he had apologized. “What would a reasonable member of the public think upon seeing Justice Zabel enter the courtroom wearing Trump’s signature red ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN’ hat and state that he did so ‘in celebration of an historic event?’ ” the review body wrote. “In our view, and indeed as Justice Zabel himself now acknowledges, a reasonable member of the public would think that Justice Zabel was making a political statement and endorsing Donald Trump’s campaign.” Justice Zabel had already been suspended by the court since late last year, but with pay. Under the council’s ruling, the justice will now be suspended for an additional 30 days, without pay. The next most severe sanction would have been to remove him from the bench. Judges in Canada are not elected. Appointments to Justice Zabel’s court are made by a nonpartisan, 13-member committee. Judges are not allowed to donate to political parties or participate in any political activities. "
354,"WASHINGTON — Six Baltimore police officers will face no federal charges in the death of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died of a severe spinal cord injury while in custody, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday. “After an extensive review of this tragic event, conducted by career prosecutors and investigators, the Justice Department concluded that the evidence is insufficient,” the department said in a statement, adding that it was unable to prove the officers “willfully violated Gray’s civil rights.” The closure of the criminal civil rights investigation into Mr. Gray’s death, which prompted unrest in Baltimore, a predominantly black city, and a federal examination of its police department’s practices, means that no officers will be held criminally responsible in his death. Mr. Gray was arrested in April 2015 and charged with illegal possession of a switchblade after running from officers. Following his arrest, he rode in a police van — shackled but unsecured by a seatbelt, as required by police department regulations — and was found unresponsive. He died the following week. Six officers were charged by the Baltimore state’s attorney with crimes related to Mr. Gray’s death, including manslaughter and murder. All were cleared in those cases as well. “At no time did we ever believe that there was evidence that any of the officers violated anyone’s civil rights or were guilty of violating any federal laws,” Michael E. Davey, a lawyer for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said in a statement on Tuesday. "
355,"To the Editor: Re “For E.P.A. Chief, Discussing Climate After Storms Is ‘Insensitive’ ” (news article, Sept. 12): The aftermath of climate-change-fueled superstorms like Harvey and Irma is exactly the right time to talk about man-made global warming, contrary to Scott Pruitt’s whining that the discussion is “misplaced.” When the current administration is quickly and relentlessly reversing progress made in fighting climate change, silence is dangerous. There is a scientific consensus that climate change played a role in intensifying the winds and rainfall associated with Harvey and Irma, worsening their devastation. From disbanding a federal climate advisory committee to rolling back flood-protection rules, the Trump administration is putting us on track for deadlier hurricanes that we’ll be even less prepared to endure. Not connecting the dots between climate change and Harvey and Irma only benefits polluting industries and the politicians beholden to them. When people are losing their lives, loved ones, pets and homes, how can we sit back quietly and let more coastal communities become sitting ducks for the next devastating hurricane? JOHN FLEMING, LOS ANGELES The writer is a staff scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity. To the Editor: Re “Irma, and the Rise of Extreme Rain” (column, Sept. 12): Although David Leonhardt clearly explains the impact of climate change on rainfall, his prescription about what to do about it falls short. According to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, approximately 40 percent of the United States population lives in coastal communities, some of which will continue to experience severe flooding from extreme weather events. These include Houston, New Orleans and other densely populated low-lying communities. There is no escaping the inevitable rise in sea level and warmer water due to climate change — an obviously lethal combination. Although I grieve deeply for the millions of people who suffer from the recent storms, we need to stop encouraging people in flood plains to rebuild communities that will soon be underwater again. Government flood insurance, among other programs, creates a false sense of security and promotes living in highly vulnerable areas. There is only one solution — difficult to contemplate but necessary — to this accelerating problem: Start planning for the relocation of millions of people away from the most at-risk coastal areas and regions of frequent flooding. "
356,"The notice went out on Facebook last year, calling citizens of Twin Falls, Idaho, to an urgent meeting about the “huge upsurge of violence toward American citizens” by Muslim refugees who had settled there. The inflammatory post, however, originated not in Idaho but in Russia. The meeting’s sponsor, an anti-immigrant page called “Secured Borders,” was one of hundreds of fake Facebook accounts created by a Russian company with Kremlin ties to spread vitriolic messages on divisive issues. Facebook acknowledged last week that it had closed the accounts after linking them to advertisements costing $100,000 that were purchased in Russia’s influence campaign during and after the 2016 election. But the company declined to release or describe in detail the pages and profiles it had linked to Russia. A report by the Russian media outlet RBC last March, however, identified the Secured Borders page as the work of the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg firm that employs hundreds of so-called trolls to post material in support of Russian government policies. A Facebook official confirmed that Secured Borders was removed in the purge of Russian fakes. The Secured Borders page, a search for archived images shows, spent months posing as an American activist group and spreading provocative messages on Facebook calling immigrants “scum” and “freeloaders,” linking refugees to crime and praising President Trump’s tough line on immigration. The page attracted more than 133,000 followers before it was shut down. "
357,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering reducing the number of refugees admitted to the country over the next year to below 50,000, according to current and former government officials familiar with the discussions, the lowest number since at least 1980. President Trump promised during his 2016 campaign to deny admittance to refugees who posed a terrorist threat. In his first days in office he took steps to radically reduce the program that resettles refugees in American cities and towns, capping the number admitted at 50,000 as part of his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. That was less than half the 110,000 refugees President Barack Obama said should be admitted in 2016. But in recent weeks, as the deadline approached for Mr. Trump to issue the annual determination for refugee admissions required by the Refugee Act of 1980, some inside the White House — led by Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser for policy — have pressed to set the ceiling even lower. The issue has created an intense debate within the administration, with Mr. Miller and some officials at the Department of Homeland Security citing security concerns and limited resources as grounds for deeply cutting the number of admissions, and officials at the National Security Council, the State Department and the Department of Defense opposing a precipitous drop. No final decision has been made, according to the officials, but as the issue is being debated, the Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the administration to bar almost any refugees from entering the country while it considers challenges to the travel ban order. The court will hear arguments in the case next month. "
358,"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — The first patient was rushed into the emergency room of Memorial Regional Hospital around 3 a.m. on Wednesday, escaping a nursing home that had lost air-conditioning in the muggy days after Hurricane Irma splintered power lines across the state. Another arrived at 4 a.m. After a third rescue call, around 5 a.m., the hospital’s staff was concerned enough to walk down the street to check the building themselves. What they found was an oven. The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills needed to be evacuated immediately. Rescue units were hurrying its more than 100 residents out. Dozens of hospital workers established a command center outside, giving red wristbands to patients with critical, life-threatening conditions and yellow and green ones to those in better shape. Checking the nursing home room by room, the hospital staff found three people who were already dead and nearly 40 others who needed red wristbands, many of whom had trouble breathing. The workers rushed them to Memorial’s emergency room, where they were given oxygen. The rest went to other hospitals nearby. Four were so ill that they died soon after arriving. In the afternoon, the authorities learned that another had died early in the morning, and was initially uncounted because the person had been taken directly to a funeral home. In all, eight were dead. “We had no idea the extent of what was going on until we literally sent people room to room to check on people,” said Dr. Randy Katz, the hospital’s chairman of emergency medicine. "
359,"WASHINGTON — The federal government moved on Wednesday to wipe from its computer systems any software made by a prominent Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, that is being investigated by the F.B.I. for possible links to Russian security services. The concerns surrounding Kaspersky, whose software is sold throughout the United States, are longstanding. The F.B.I., aided by American spies, has for years been trying to determine whether Kaspersky’s senior executives are working with Russian military and intelligence, according to current and former American officials. The F.B.I. has also been investigating whether Kaspersky software, including its well-regarded antivirus programs, contain back doors that could allow Russian intelligence access into computers on which it is running. The company denies the allegations. The officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiries are classified, would not provide details of the information they have collected on Kaspersky. But on Wednesday, Elaine C. Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, ordered federal agencies to develop plans to remove Kaspersky software from government systems in the next 90 days. Wednesday’s announcement is the latest instance of the apparent disconnect between the Trump White House, which has often downplayed the threat of Russian interference to the country’s infrastructure, and front-line American law enforcement and intelligence officials, who are engaged in a perpetual shadow war against Moscow-directed operatives. Kaspersky’s business in the United States now appears to be the latest casualty in those spy wars. Best Buy, the electronics giant, announced last week that it was pulling Kaspersky Lab’s cybersecurity products from its shelves and website, and the Senate is voting this week on a defense-spending bill that would ban Kaspersky Lab products from being used by American government agencies, effectively codifying Wednesday’s directive into law.

360,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is doubling down this week on his bid to remake the tax code, meeting with Democrats, tying tax legislation to hurricane recovery and dispatching his economic team to Capitol Hill almost daily to prod lawmakers into action. But he is bringing to the game a relatively weak team — a chief economic adviser whom he has openly disparaged and a Treasury secretary whose counsel he has dismissed — and is promoting quick passage of a new tax code that has yet to be written as members of his party bicker over the details. The urgency was evident on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump urged Congress to “move fast,” and Republican leaders seemed ready. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told House Republicans that the administration and congressional Republicans would release a detailed framework of their plan during the week of Sept. 25, with the goal of taking up legislation in late October. But Republicans remain divided on key details: whether they can meet Mr. Trump’s demand for a 15 percent corporate tax rate; which small businesses and partnerships would qualify for a new low business tax rate; whether tax cuts in the package should be paid for by closing loopholes; and whether hedge fund and private equity managers would continue to see their huge fees taxed at the low rate of capital gains instead of at income tax rates. Democrats have said they will reject any package that they see as skewed toward the rich, especially if it repeals the estate tax, as the president wants. Then there is a tough interim step: Republicans must pass a budget resolution to unlock the procedural tool that would let them move a bill through the Senate with a simple majority. Congressional leaders are bracing for a fight over that budget blueprint. "
361,"Looking across the globe, it might appear at times that violence, chaos and fear are getting the upper hand over order, democracy and reason. The world has always been a messy place, of course, and it may be that the internet and social media give the worst of times more prominence than the best. But there are real reasons for anxiety. Traditional democratic ideals and institutions are under attack. Some leaders in Eastern Europe espouse “illiberal” democracy, which treads on traditional human rights. Authoritarian leaders from Russia to Venezuela grow stronger; Kim Jong-un of North Korea defies the world in his pursuit of a doomsday weapon. And the United States under Donald Trump becomes more bitterly divided and unpredictable. Historically, however, there has also been pushback, a rejection of oppression and despotism. It brought about the end of apartheid, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, the acceptance of more than a million refugees in Germany. Countries rarely embrace democracy as their first choice; they have often tried monarchies, oligarchies or other forms of coercive government first. They come to democracy because, for all its messiness and inefficiency, it is the way to give people a voice in how they’re governed, and to allow them to change leaders peacefully. But it can never be taken for granted. It is constantly confronting challenges and threats and adapting to changing times. Those challenges will be discussed at the five-day Athens Democracy Forum this week in Athens, Greece. Now in its fifth year, the conference, convened by The New York Times, will gather global leaders to talk about the state of the world. In advance of the conference, The Times solicited essays on some of the challenges facing nations today. "
362,"WASHINGTON — Nearly 16 years to the day after Congress first authorized a military response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Senate on Wednesday rejected an effort to repeal the virtual blank check that Congress granted to the president while smoke still rose from the rubble of the World Trade Center. The debate pitted the Republican Party’s ascendant isolationist wing, represented by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, against its old-line interventionists, led by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is pressing his vision of a muscular military even as he battles brain cancer. Mr. Paul pressed for the repeal vote, in a strange bedfellows alliance with Senator Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who was his party’s vice-presidential nominee last year. But the effort failed when senators voted 61 to 36 to set the measure aside, rather than include it in the annual defense policy bill that senators are considering this week. “What we have today is basically unlimited war — war anywhere, anytime, any place on the globe,” Mr. Paul told his colleagues in a speech Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor. “I don’t think anyone with an ounce of intellectual honesty believes these authorizations allow current wars we fight in seven countries.” Mr. Paul had proposed repealing the declaration in six months, to give lawmakers time to consider a new one. The issue has been around since 2015, when President Barack Obama asked Congress to replace the authorization of military force passed to battle Al Qaeda with a new one crafted specifically to take on the Islamic State. But so far Congress has balked, declining to take on the difficult issue even as lawmakers such as Mr. Kaine insist that the legislative branch should reclaim its constitutional duty to declare war. "
363,"WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders on Wednesday night declared that they had a deal with President Trump to quickly extend protections for young undocumented immigrants and to finalize a border security package that does not include the president’s proposed wall. The Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, said in a joint statement that they had a “very productive” dinner meeting with the president at the White House that focused on the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. “We agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that’s acceptable to both sides,” they said. But on Thursday morning, the president contradicted the Democrats, saying no deal had been struck. (Read that article.) In a statement on Wednesday night, the White House was far more muted, mentioning DACA as merely one of several issues that were discussed, including tax reform and infrastructure. It called the meeting, which came a week after the president struck a stunning spending-and-debt deal with the Democratic leaders, “a positive step toward the president’s strong commitment to bipartisan solutions.” But the bipartisan comity appeared to have its limits. In a tweet, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, disputed the Democrats’ characterization of Mr. Trump’s stance on the border wall. “While DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to,” she wrote. Mr. Schumer’s communications director, Matt House, fired back on Twitter: “The President made clear he would continue pushing the wall, just not as part of this agreement.” "
364,"MELBOURNE, Australia — It was a scene that plays out nearly every day in schoolyards across Australia: A couple, standing among a dozen other parents, waited for the final school bell to ring. On cue, Reid Duggan-Tierney, 7, came bounding out of school last Friday and ran toward Michael and Jarrad Duggan-Tierney — his fathers. The Duggan-Tierneys are one of around 6,800 Australian same-sex couples with a child. In many ways, their family represents the chasm that has emerged between the law and people’s lives. As the debate over same-sex marriage in this country becomes increasingly hostile, gay parents are balancing the daily routines of playtime and homework with activism. Australians will soon vote in a national postal survey, a nonbinding poll intended to help the government decide whether to press forward with legalizing same-sex marriage. Ballots were mailed this week, and activists on both sides of the issue have used the well-being of children to make their arguments. Last week, John Howard, a former prime minister, said legalizing gay marriage would hurt children. “I believe there is a conflict here between those seeking the right for same-sex marriage and the rights of the child, and I believe the right of the child to have a mother and father should be preserved,” he told The Weekend Australian. The Duggan-Tierneys may not have a soapbox as large as Mr. Howard’s, but they have over 59,000 followers on Instagram. From their account, @the_real_dads_of_melbourne, they document their lives as parents: playing at the park, shopping for groceries. "
365,"WASHINGTON — In one Senate office building, some of the leading lights of the Democratic Party gathered Wednesday to embrace what was once a proposal only of the far left: a huge expansion of Medicare, large enough to open the popular, government-run health program to all Americans. In another Senate office building, a smaller but equally adamant group of Republican senators stood together to take one last stab at dismantling the Affordable Care Act. They proposed instead to send each state a lump sum of federal money, along with sweeping new discretion over how to use it. Important elements in both parties are trying to move beyond President Barack Obama’s health care law, which has always been a complicated, politically difficult mix of government and private health insurance. But they are moving in radically different directions. The proposals appeared to have only one thing in common: Neither is likely to be enacted any time soon. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the onetime candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed what he called “a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system,” and he said 16 Democratic senators supported it. Those included Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California — all names on the list of possible candidates for president in 2020. “Instead of wasting hundreds of billions of dollars trying to administer an enormously complicated system of hundreds of separate insurance plans, there would be one insurance plan for the American people with one single payer,” said Mr. Sanders, the ringmaster of an event that felt like a political rally, with banners and placards, consumers and patients, labor union members, nurses in red T-shirts and an audience full of fans who applauded, whooped and hollered. "
366,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Myanmar’s national leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, will not attend the upcoming U.N. General Assembly because of the crisis that has forced about 400,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in just weeks. International leaders and rights groups have denounced Myanmar for ethnic cleansing — some have called it genocide — and castigated her inaction. Here are the basics on the roots and history of the strife. Al Qaeda militants, meanwhile, urged Muslims around the world to support the Rohingya with aid, weapons and “military support.” _____ "
367,"President Trump on Wednesday blocked a China-backed investor from buying an American semiconductor maker over national security concerns, a rare move that could signal more aggressive scrutiny of China’s deal-making ambitions. The deal for Lattice Semiconductor has provided a test of the president’s economic and diplomatic relationship with China. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump reserved some of his harshest words for China, accusing the country of stealing jobs. In recent months, the president has turned more critical of Beijing, accusing it of failing to do more to restrain the nuclear ambitions of North Korea. Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who studies Chinese investment, said that the administration’s decision over Lattice was intended to send a political message. “We could let it die quietly,” he said, “but we’re going to kill it loudly.” The White House said on Wednesday that it prevented the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor, in part because the United States government relies on the company’s products. The integrity of the semiconductor industry, it said, was vital. The White House also raised concerns over the buyer’s close ties to Beijing. The investment group included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by state-backed entities, the White House said. "
368,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is eager to put his conservative imprint on the federal judiciary, but an impediment remains. Though the Senate has virtually eliminated the ability of the minority party to block appointments to the bench from the Supreme Court on down, individual senators can still thwart nominees from their home states by refusing to sign off on a form popularly known for its color — the blue slip. Now, with some Democrats refusing to consent as the Trump administration moves to fill scores of judicial vacancies, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, is for the first time publicly advocating that the blue slip be made strictly advisory when it comes to appeals court nominees — the most powerful judges after those on the Supreme Court. “My personal view is that the blue slip, with regard to circuit court appointments, ought to simply be a notification of how you’re going to vote, not the opportunity to blackball,” Mr. McConnell said in an interview with The New York Times for “The New Washington” podcast. He said he favored retaining the blue slip authority for lower-level district court judges. With the conflict escalating, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, has requested a meeting with Mr. McConnell and the top Republican and Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee to dissuade Republicans from weakening the blue slip. “Getting rid of the blue slip would be a mistake,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview. He said he would argue to Mr. McConnell and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that since majority control of the Senate has been in flux in recent years, members of both parties should remember that they could find themselves back in the minority. "
369,"ESPN, under intense pressure again in the hypercharged terrain of social media, elicited a rebuke from a White House official on Wednesday in response to a series of tweets posted by a “SportsCenter” host. Jemele Hill, who co-hosts the 6 p.m. “SportsCenter” program, called President Trump a white supremacist on Twitter on Monday, adding: “Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the comments were a “fireable offense.” “I think that’s one of the more outrageous comments that anyone can make,” Sanders said Wednesday during a press briefing, “and certainly something that I think is a fireable offense by ESPN.” ESPN, which like many news organizations has long wrestled with how to police employees’ social-media comments, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that Hill’s comments “do not represent the position of ESPN.” "
370,"When Russia created Facebook profiles of fake Americans to influence the 2016 American election, it could make up the names and biographical details. But it needed photos, too. Now a salesman in Brazil has stepped forward to say that his own family photos were stolen to concoct the profile of “Melvin Redick,” one of many American impostors involved in the spread of Russian propaganda on Facebook and Twitter. Last week, The New York Times featured Mr. Redick’s Facebook profile as an example of fake social media accounts that were used to attack Hillary Clinton, promote leaked emails obtained by Russian hackers and propagate the Kremlin’s political views. The supposed Mr. Redick was an early promoter last year of a website, DCLeaks.com, that American officials believe was created by Russian military intelligence. But The Times could find no American who fit the details he provided on Facebook. There was no such person in Harrisburg, Pa., where Mr. Redick said he lived. The high school and college he listed had never heard of him. And when The Times asked Facebook about him — as well as other profiles that appeared to be the work of Russians — the company concluded that they were impostors and removed them from the social network. "
371,"WASHINGTON — Tim Scott, the lone black Republican in the Senate, delivered a pointed history lesson on America’s 300-year legacy of racism to President Trump on Wednesday in response to what he called Mr. Trump’s “sterile” response to the riots in Charlottesville, Va., last month. The president invited Mr. Scott, a conservative from South Carolina who had expressed disgust with Mr. Trump’s equivocal reaction to the white supremacist protests that left one woman dead, to the Oval Office for what Mr. Trump’s staff described as a demonstration of the president’s commitment to “positive race relations.” Both men described the interaction as positive and constructive, but Mr. Scott clearly had a point to make. When a reporter asked the senator after the meeting if the president had expressed regret, a pained look flashed on Mr. Scott’s face. He paused for a few seconds and replied, “He certainly tried to explain what he was trying to convey.” White House officials emailed reporters a photograph of Mr. Trump listening intently as Mr. Scott made a point, with both sitting in chairs often used for bilateral meetings with foreign leaders. The White House misidentified him as Tom Scott. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Scott made it clear he did not go to the White House for a photo op, but to decisively rebut Mr. Trump’s claim — to the president’s face — that “both sides,” racists and anti-racist protesters, were responsible for the violence that followed a torchlight protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. “My response was that, while that’s true, I mean I think if you look at it from a sterile perspective, there was an antagonist on the other side,” Mr. Scott said. "

Three people were discovered dead at a nursing home in Hollywood, Fla., whose air-conditioning had been knocked out. That number grew to eight after other residents were evacuated to hospitals. “It felt like 110 degrees,” said the daughter of a 96-year-old resident. The police and state authorities are conducting a criminal investigation, and fanning out to check other nursing homes. Roughly 160 nursing homes in Florida — a state where one in five residents is over 65 — remain without commercial power amid high temperatures. _____ 2. On Capitol Hill, liberals and conservatives are planning to set forth two radically different proposals for health care: a huge expansion of Medicare, and a rollback of the Affordable Care Act. "
373,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will resume his role as the reassurer for American allies this week when he heads to Mexico, where he will try to mend relations after President Trump failed to quickly offer condolences for the earthquake on Friday that killed at least 96 people and severely damaged thousands of homes. Mr. Mattis will also try to signal to Mexican officials that ties between the United States and its southern flank remain strong. After four days without word from Mr. Trump about the 8.2-magnitude earthquake in Oaxaca State, Mexico on Monday rescinded its offer of aid to the United States for people affected by Hurricane Harvey. Mr. Trump had not responded to that offer of help — when it was made, he was tweeting that Mexico was one of the “highest crime nations in the world.” But Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas had said his state would accept the help. But the offer was withdrawn when Mexico’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that it needed the money to help care for victims of the earthquake, which was followed by Hurricane Katia. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had scheduled a call with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and that details of it would be shared with reporters. But as of Wednesday afternoon, the White House had not provided the promised readout of the conversation or confirmed whether it happened. “There are people here who say, ‘Why hasn’t he called? The Americans are deliberately slighting us,’” Duncan Wood, the director of the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. “That’s one view, which is widely held. Some people feel aggrieved.” "
374,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has imposed visa sanctions against four countries that have refused to take back citizens who were convicted of crimes in the United States and ordered deported, officials said on Wednesday. The Department of Homeland Security said it notified the State Department that the governments of Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone had denied or unreasonably delayed accepting the return of convicts. American diplomats in the countries were ordered to impose visa restrictions, officials said in a statement, but did not say what types of visas would be affected. “International law obligates each country to accept the return of its nationals ordered removed from the United States,” said Elaine Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security. “Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone have failed in that responsibility.” Officials said the restrictions would remain in place until the countries cooperate. The issue has been a longstanding problem for officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency charged with deportations. They say other nations will often refuse to issue travel documents or delay providing them. In turn, agency officials said, they are forced to release criminals, including those who have committed assaults and murders, in the United States. A 2001 Supreme Court ruling barred the government from detaining immigrants indefinitely simply for lack of a country willing to take them. "
375,"It was the morning after a resounding primary victory for Mayor Bill de Blasio, the kind that political mandates are made of, and as luck would have it, the mayor of New York had a tailor-made moment to bask in the glow of electoral success. It was not to be. The political gods had conspired to place Mr. de Blasio on Roosevelt Island on Wednesday, in an uncomfortable white plastic chair in the front row at the opening ceremony of the Cornell Tech campus, alongside Michael R. Bloomberg, his billionaire predecessor, with whom Mr. de Blasio has had an uneasy relationship, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has been Mr. de Blasio’s near-constant tormentor. Speaker after speaker praised Mr. Bloomberg, who had conceived of the tech campus when he was mayor and put the project in motion. But it was Mr. Cuomo who damned the current mayor with not even the faintest of praise. “Mike Bloomberg had the formula: vision plus confidence plus achievement equals progress,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Mike’s formula was shared by my father Mario Cuomo, who called himself a pragmatic progressive. Think about it. A progressive who gets things done, and gets results.” The governor did not include Mr. de Blasio, who sees himself as a paragon of progressivism, in his commendations. In many ways, Mr. de Blasio has benefited from circumstance and luck. Since he entered City Hall in January 2014, the city’s economy has steadily expanded and crime numbers have continued to drop. He has avoided, by and large, major crises. "
376,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin inquired about the use of a military plane for his European honeymoon last month, the Treasury Department confirmed on Wednesday, a disclosure that comes as he is already under scrutiny for taking a government plane to Kentucky before viewing the Aug. 21 solar eclipse. The Treasury Department said Mr. Mnuchin had asked about the military plane so that he would have access to secure communications when he was abroad. “It is imperative that he have access to secure communications, and it is our practice to consider a wide range of options to ensure he has these capabilities during his travel, including the possible use of military aircraft,” a Treasury spokesman said in a statement. According to the spokesman, Treasury officials withdrew the request after finding an alternative way to communicate about government matters securely. He noted that Mr. Mnuchin is a member of the National Security Council with responsibility for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. Mr. Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, a Scottish-born actress, were married in June. The revelation about the request, which was first disclosed by ABC News, quickly drew a backlash on social media, with critics accusing Mr. Mnuchin, a multimillionaire former hedge fund manager, of seeking to use taxpayer funds to finance his personal travel. It comes as Mr. Mnuchin is leading the Trump administration’s push to overhaul the tax code, which he has promised to make more fair for middle-class Americans. Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Linton had already come under criticism for their trip last month to Kentucky, where they traveled together for a tax reform event. Ms. Linton created a firestorm when she mocked a woman who had criticized her on Instagram for promoting luxury brands while traveling to a poor part of the country. The couple did travel by government plane on that trip, and the Treasury Department’s inspector general is reviewing the flight and whether any ethical violations were made. Treasury officials traditionally fly on commercial aircraft except in extenuating circumstances, because government planes can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to operate. Some suggested Mr. Mnuchin made the trip to Fort Knox by government plane so that he would have optimal viewing of the solar eclipse that occurred that day. Richard Delmar, counsel to the inspector general, said in a statement, “We are looking at all requests for use of government aircraft.” "
377,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A stunned look fell over the hot dog vendor’s face as a police officer, ticketing him for lacking a permit, reached into the man’s wallet and pulled out $60. The vendor and a passer-by recording the exchange protested. “That’s not right,” said the cameraman. “That’s how it works,” replied the officer, of U.C. Berkeley’s police department. And now, video of the encounter outside a Golden Bears football game Saturday has become a fixation of the internet outrage machine. Uploaded over the weekend, it’s been watched millions of times and prompted demands for the officer’s firing. It’s also reinvigorated a debate in California over civil forfeiture, which allows the authorities to seize cash and property from people suspected of wrongdoing. Last year, the practice brought the state’s law enforcement agencies more than $115 million, according to government figures. "
378,"In February, Sunayana Dumala lost her husband to a man who shouted “Get out of my country!” and unloaded a semiautomatic pistol in a Kansas bar. Ms. Dumala’s immigration status was tied to that of her husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, one of two Indian-born engineers shot that day. So along with dealing with the horror of his sudden death, she also had to face the fact that the man who shot him may have managed to put her at risk of deportation. Mr. Kuchibhotla was in the United States on an H-1B visa. Upon his death, Ms. Dumala’s residency status was terminated. And when she went to India to attend his funeral, she feared that she might not be able to re-enter the United States. It was also unclear whether she would want to. In an emotional Facebook post shortly after the shooting, she posed a question that she said “is in every immigrant’s mind: Do we belong here?” Her congressman, Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas’ third district, was “horrified” by the shooting, and pushed President Trump to condemn it in a joint address to Congress. Upon learning of Ms. Dumala’s immigration issues, he and his staff began looking at ways to assist her. “It would have been a real tragedy, on top of the initial tragedy she suffered, to attend her husband’s funeral in India and then be locked out of the U.S. because of it,” Mr. Yoder said in an interview on Wednesday. “This woman suffered enough. We need to fix this.” "
379,"Sean Spicer and Chelsea Manning are headed back to school. Sort of. Mr. Spicer, President Trump’s former White House press secretary, and Ms. Manning, a former United States soldier who served seven years in prison for leaking classified information, were named visiting fellows at the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday. Needless to say, their politics differ considerably. Mr. Spicer, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, objected when President Obama commuted Ms. Manning’s 35-year prison sentence in January. He called it “disappointing” and said ""it sends a very troubling message when it comes to the handling of classified information.” Ms. Manning does not appear to be too fond of Mr. Spicer, either. Her appointment drew criticism on Wednesday, and when Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor, said, “I think I’ll forego I.O.P. events this fall,” Ms. Manning replied: “Awesome! Can you ask Sean Spicer to do the same?” These two unlikely classmates can take comfort from the fact that being a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics is nothing like high school. They may not even come face to face. Visiting fellows travel to Harvard for what the school describes as “a limited yet comprehensive number of events” that “provide short-term engagement with the student community.” They do not need to worry about the tyranny of gym class or the complicated politics of cafeteria seating. That may be for the best because the list of fellows for the 2017-18 academic year reads like a who’s who of the flashing cable news chyrons and distressing tweet storms that have dominated America’s polarized politics in recent years. "
380,"TOKYO — Pyongyang’s recent missile launch over Hokkaido and its underground nuclear test have laid bare Japan’s Achilles’ heel: Our country’s national security policy is still woefully ill equipped for this mounting danger. The new sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council on Monday will hardly limit Japan’s exposure. North Korea’s latest provocations pose an unprecedented threat. Even during the Korean War in the early 1950s, Japan, as a rear support base for United States forces, was somewhat insulated; today, it is in the same theater as South Korea, also on the front lines. Any American military strike against North Korea would likely trigger retaliatory measures against Japan. Japan is in a terrible predicament: Highly exposed but with very few options, military or diplomatic, to help itself. Its defense ministry plans to double, to eight, the number of ships equipped with the Aegis missile-defense system. But the new fleet won’t be operational before 2021. Even if Japan also acquires the land-based Aegis Ashore system, as it is contemplating doing, none of this additional capacity could offer it enough protection against North Korea’s increasingly lethal missiles — much less deter North Korea from further developing its own arsenal. This is one reason Itsunori Onodera, the new defense minister, has been making a case for developing Japan’s offensive capabilities, so that it could strike military bases in North Korea, perhaps even preemptively. But such a move faces numerous obstacles — financial, tactical and strategic. No budget decision for such capabilities is expected to even be made until at least late 2018. Acquiring offensive weaponry would require redefining the terms of Japan’s existing security agreement with the United States, which relegates Japan to a purely defensive role and places all responsibility for any offensive action solely with America.

381,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan: There they go again. On Wednesday, a group of Republican senators plan to release a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It comes from Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and they will market it as a bill that gives states the flexibility to create the system that they want. But that’s deeply misleading. While it would theoretically give states more flexibility, the bill would mostly rob states of money to pay for health insurance — and millions of Americans would lose coverage as a result. Think of it this way: Every reader of this newsletter has the theoretical flexibility to buy a private jet. Cassidy-Graham, as the bill is known, ends up looking remarkably similar to previous repeal attempts. It would likely result in 15 million Americans losing their insurance next year and more than 30 million losing it a decade from now (based on analyses of an early version of the bill, which was similar to previous Republican health bills). “The similarities are more striking than the differences,” Aviva Aron-Dine of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told me. Right now, the bill looks unlikely to pass, because several Republicans, including Rand Paul, sound unenthusiastic, and it faces a Sept. 30 deadline, as a result of Senate rules. But I still take the bill seriously. President Trump supports it, as apparently do many Senate Republicans. "
382,"Alarmed that President Trump may soon take steps that could unravel the international nuclear agreement with Iran, more than 80 disarmament experts urged him on Wednesday to reconsider and said the accord was working. In a joint statement, the experts said the 2015 agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration and the governments of Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, was a “net plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts.” Because of the monitoring powers contained in the agreement, they said, Iran’s capability to produce nuclear weapons has been sharply reduced. They also said the agreement made it “very likely that any possible future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a clandestine program, would be detected promptly.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed the agreement — a signature achievement of his predecessor — describing it as “a terrible deal” and a giveaway to Iran. He also has said that he believes Iran is violating the accord, an assertion that has been contradicted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitor that polices Iran’s compliance. The accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, severely limited Iran’s nuclear activities in return for ending or easing many sanctions that were hurting the Iranian economy. "

384,"President Trump clearly inherited an economy on the upswing, according to the 2016 Census report, with income, health coverage and poverty levels having all improved in the past two years. The question is whether his administration and the Republican-controlled Congress will sustain the momentum, or even reverse it. The Census report, released on Tuesday, showed median income, adjusted for inflation, grew by 3.2 percent from 2015 to 2016, to $59,039, as employers added jobs and hours and even, in some cases, gave raises. At the same time, the poverty rate decreased by 0.8 percentage points, or 2.5 million people, to 12.7 percent. Both measures are now at or near their prerecession levels in 2007, a hard-fought recovery. On health care, the data show that the ranks of the uninsured fell last year by 900,000 people, to an all-time low of 8.8 percent of the population. The decline is a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The 32 states and District of Columbia that participate in the A.C.A.’s expansion of Medicaid for low-income families had larger declines in their uninsured populations than states that do not participate. Massachusetts, for example, a pioneer in broad coverage, has the lowest uninsured rate in the nation, 2.5 percent, while Texas, which rejected Medicaid expansion, has the highest, 16.6 percent. The data also show the success of federal safety-net programs. If not for tax credits for low-income workers, an additional 8.2 million people would have been classified as poor last year. Similarly, food stamps and low-income housing aid lifted 3.6 million and 3.1 million people, respectively, out of poverty last year. "
385,"America faces two serious national security threats today that look wildly different but have one core feature in common — they both have a low probability of happening, but, if they did happen, they could have devastating consequences for our whole country and the world. One of these threats is called North Korea. If the reckless leader of North Korea is able to launch an arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles that strike the U.S. mainland, the impact on America will be incalculable. And even though the odds of that happening are low — it would be an act of suicide by the North Korean dynasty — President Trump is ready to spend billions on antimissile systems, warships, cyberdefenses, air power and war games to defuse and deter this North Korean threat. And if we prepare for a North Korean nuclear attack and it never happens, we will be left with some improved weaponry that we might be able to use in other theaters, like fighter jets, ships and missiles — but nothing particularly productive for our economy or job creation. The other low-probability, high-impact threat is climate change fueled by increased human-caused carbon emissions. The truth is, if you simply trace the steady increase in costly extreme weather events — wildfires, floods, droughts and climate-related human migrations — the odds of human-driven global warming having a devastating impact on our planet are not low probability but high probability. But let’s assume for a minute that because climate change is a complex process — which we do not fully understand — climate change is a low-probability, high-impact event just like a North Korean nuclear strike. What is the Trump team doing when confronted with this similar threat? "
386,"The range of problems facing the United States abroad is daunting: a volatile Middle East, an unpredictable, mischievous Russia, a truly menacing North Korea. To say nothing of destabilizing global challenges like the mass migration of desperate refugees, and climate change. President Trump’s “America First” approach, which calls for disengagement from old alliances and responsibilities, is a dodge, not an answer. What’s needed is a robust foreign policy led by a reinvigorated State Department that right now is suffering from presidential neglect, poor leadership and an absence of professional firepower in pivotal positions. Two people who understand the urgency of helping the department recover from the damages inflicted by Mr. Trump are Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Leading members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, they have sought to rally their colleagues around a bipartisan spending bill for 2018 that would strengthen the department and replenish important foreign aid programs. Last week, the two won  unanimous committee approval for a $51 billion bill for the State Department and foreign aid, about $11 billion more than the administration requested. While the total is less than what Congress allocated for 2017, and less than necessary given the international challenges, it’s nowhere near the 30 percent cut that Mr. Trump; his budget chief, Mick Mulvaney; and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had absurdly insisted was imperative. As interesting as the bipartisan vote was the Republican-led committee’s report, which pulled no punches in blistering Mr. Trump and his aides for proposing a budget in May that amounted to an “apparent doctrine of retreat” from the world. “The lessons learned since September 11, 2001, include the reality that defense alone does not provide for American strength and resolve abroad,” the report said. “Battlefield technology and firepower cannot replace diplomacy and development.” That argument strikes at the heart of Mr. Trump’s approach, which favors warlike rhetoric and a reliance on the Pentagon as the primary levers of American power, while negotiation and diplomacy are given short shrift. At more than $600 billion annually, the military budget accounts for almost 19 percent of the federal budget, and Mr. Trump would add billions more for additional Navy ships and nuclear weapons. The State Department and its foreign aid programs account for 1 percent of the overall budget. "
387,"Last week Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, announced that the Trump White House would be revising the Obama administration guidelines for how colleges and universities adjudicate accusations of sexual assault. There were protests outside her speech and spittle-flecked rants on Twitter, but overall the reaction felt relatively muted, at least by the standards of reactions to anything Trump-related or DeVos-driven. Perhaps this was because enough people read The Atlantic, which chose last week to run a three-part series by Emily Yoffe on the sexual-assault policies in question. The series demonstrated exhaustively what anyone paying close attention already knew: The legal and administrative response to campus rape over the past five years has been a kind of judicial and bureaucratic madness, a cautionary tale about how swiftly moral outrage and political pressure can lead to kangaroo courts and star chambers, in which bias and bad science create an unshakable presumption of guilt for the accused. It’s also a cautionary tale with specific implications for cultural liberalism, because it demonstrates how easily an ideology founded on the pursuit of perfect personal freedom can end up generating a new kind of police state, how quickly the rule of pleasure gives way to the rule of secret tribunals and Title IX administrators (of which Harvard, Yoffe notes in passing, now has 55 on staff), and how making libertinism safe for consenting semi-adults requires the evacuation of due process. Rape and sexual assault are age-old problems. But the particular problem on college campuses these days is a relatively new one. For ideological reasons, the modern liberal campus rejects all the old ways in which a large population of hormonal young people once would have had their impulses channeled and restrained — single-sex dorms, “parietal” rules for male-female contact late at night, a general code emphasizing sexual restraint. Meanwhile for commercial reasons as well as liberationist ones, many colleges compete for students (especially the well-heeled, full-tuition-paying sort) by winkingly promising them not just a lack of adult supervision but a culture of constant partying, an outright bacchanal.

389,"In 1918 the Peruvian poet César Vallejo completed the collection of poems “Los Heraldos Negros,” known in English as “The Black Riders,” “The Black Messengers” or “The Black Heralds,” depending on the translator. “There are blows in life so powerful, I can’t answer” is a literal translation of the first line of the title poem. In the original Spanish, the line is “Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes. … Yo no sé.” As with the title, there has been some disagreement around how to translate “yo no sé.” “I don’t know,” “I can’t say” and “I can’t answer” are just three possibilities. Each translator has to confront Vallejo’s lacunas for the ungraspable experience of having to bear unbearable acts of power. I’ve thought about this poem often over the past year as I have encountered many who feel they, too, cannot translate the horror of what is happening in America. They are shocked, and they are speechless. They don’t have the words; they can’t say; they can’t answer. How could this happen? Their disbelief is followed by “We won’t go back.” “History is not the past,” James Baldwin said. “It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history.” These are words that should be repeated every day. The horror we seem to only now be noticing is an effect of our country’s longstanding commitment to white supremacy. But I am unclear about when we ever lived without its effects. Was there ever a moment when the persecution of nonwhite Americans wasn’t the norm? As is so often the case, I wondered what I wasn’t seeing. Didn’t America elect a presidential candidate with white-nationalist sympathies? The same man who appeared reluctant to denounce a former grand wizard of the K.K.K. when that man supported him? Yet for many people, it was the alt-right’s march in Charlottesville and President Donald Trump’s initial refusal to condemn those marchers that became the truly untranslatable moment. This confused me. I reached out to a friend, the theorist Lauren Berlant, to ask whether I was misunderstanding what I felt to be an everyday kind of condition, even as others described it as unnamable terror. The K.K.K., white supremacists and the alt-right were being referred to as if they beamed down into our democracy, I said to Lauren. She replied that certain groups are now considered the source of white supremacy rather than its amplification. It’s true that our president’s refusal to become “presidential,” as the pundits are fond of saying, is amplifying what is, but what is — whatever the tweets, whatever his state of mind, whatever his ultimate agenda — remains what was. Some Americans want to believe that unconscionable behavior — like marching in the name of racial hatred or plowing a car into a crowd of civilians — is an ungraspable blow to all Americans. But there’s nothing new about any of this. Heather Heyer was killed in an action meant to express the violent intent and threat of the messengers walking the streets of Charlottesville with lit tiki torches in hand — much like lynchings across our history. Attempts to whitewash white supremacy have been the de facto policy in this country. Do we really need to go over the history? It feels as if we do. Americans, of all races, have accepted the erasure of our history and the muddying of events. But if our executive branch has no interest in distancing itself from white supremacy, it could be because our government has been in support of a similar white-nationalist agenda since before the K.K.K.’s formation, in 1865. Even as former Confederate soldiers terrorized newly freed African-Americans, the Black Codes were passed. These laws, which did everything from restricting the jobs black people could hold to limiting where they could live, structurally and institutionally supported the K.K.K.’s efforts to cripple African-Americans attempts to just live. White supremacists reinstated themselves in American life, expanding from the South to the Midwest and then on to the West; by 1925 the Klan had as many as four million members, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and, in some states, “considerable political power.” In “The History of White People,” Nell Irvin Painter notes that “in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 police and sheriff’s deputies joined Klansmen in a pogrom against African-Americans, destroying homes, businesses and lives in an attack hardly mourned as an assault on Americans.” What was once known as “Black Wall Street” was erased from the landscape after bombings from the air and people being machine-gunned down in the streets. Later, Jim Crow laws only reinforced the agenda of the earlier Black Codes. And when those laws were struck down, each administration in the second half of the 20th century (including Bill Clinton’s) bolstered a false equivalence among drugs, criminality and blackness that reinstated a Jim Crow agenda through mass incarceration. The terror against people of color, especially African- and Native Americans, has always centralized whiteness in defense of itself in its persecution of the other. "

391,"The Trump administration and the sheriff in Portland, Ore., agree on this much: The crimes were hideous and preventable. But they are fiercely blaming each other for allowing them to happen. The case has stirred up a tempest because the man accused of crawling through the bedroom window of a 65-year-old woman, tying her up and raping her is an illegal immigrant, Sergio Jose Martinez, who has been deported to Mexico 20 times and has been arrested 10 times this year. Under political fire for releasing Mr. Martinez after his most recent stint in jail, the sheriff declared that President Trump’s immigration agency was at fault for failing to provide a legal basis for holding him longer, while the White House blamed the sheriff for letting him go. Cases like that of Mr. Martinez around the country are inciting outrage, amplified by an administration that is eager to expel undocumented immigrants. In a recent speech in Miami that made national headlines, Attorney General Jeff Sessions described the case and several others like it in graphic detail, and said that releasing potentially deportable immigrants like Mr. Martinez when their jail terms were over does “far broader damage to the country than many understand.” “At its root,” he added, “it is a rejection of our immigration laws.” The political jockeying is rooted in a vexing constitutional disconnect between criminal justice and immigration enforcement, which is a matter of civil, not criminal, law. Questions about the legality of trying to connect the two may become one of the most significant legal challenges to the Trump administration’s immigration policy, experts say. "
392,"O
ne morning in January 2016, Martin Steltner showed up at his office in the state courthouse building in western Berlin. Steltner, who has served for more than a dozen years as the spokesman for the Berlin state prosecutor, resembles a detective out of classic crime fiction: crisp suit, wavy gray hair and a gallows humor that comes with having seen it all. There was the 2009 case of the therapist who mistakenly killed two patients in an Ecstasy-infused session gone wrong. The Great Poker Heist of 2010, in which masked men stormed a celebrity-studded poker tournament with machetes and made off with a quarter-million dollars. The 2012 episode involving the Canadian porn star who killed and ate his boyfriend and then sent the leftovers home in the mail. Steltner embraced the oddball aspect of his job; he kept a picture of Elvis Presley on the wall of his office. But even Steltner found the phone calls he received that morning confounding. They came from police officers from towns far outside Berlin, who reported that protests were erupting, seemingly out of nowhere, on their streets. “They are demonstrating — ‘Save our children,’ ‘No attacks from immigrants on our children’ and some things like that,” Steltner told me when I met him in Berlin recently. The police were calling Steltner because this was ostensibly his office’s fault. The protesters were angry over the Berlin prosecutor’s supposed refusal to indict three Arab migrants who, they said, raped a 13-year-old girl from Berlin’s tight-knit Russian-German community. Steltner, who would certainly have been informed if such a case had come up for prosecution, had heard nothing of it. He called the Berlin Police Department, which informed him that a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had indeed gone missing a week before. When she resurfaced a day later, she told her parents that three “Southern-looking men” — by which she meant Arab migrants — had yanked her off the street and taken her to a rundown apartment, where they beat and raped her. But when the police interviewed the girl, whose name was Lisa, she changed her story. She had left home, it turned out, because she had gotten in trouble at school. Afraid of how her parents would react, she went to stay with a 19-year-old male friend. The kidnapping and gang rape, she admitted, never happened. By then, however, the girl’s initial story was taking on a life of its own within the Russian-German community through word of mouth and Facebook — enough so that the police felt compelled to put out a statement debunking it. Then, over the weekend, Channel One, a Russian state-controlled news station with a large following among Russian-Germans, who watch it on YouTube and its website, ran a report presenting Lisa’s story as an example of the unchecked dangers Middle Eastern refugees posed to German citizens. Angela Merkel, it strongly implied, was refusing to address these threats, even as she opened German borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. “According to Lisa’s parents,” the Channel One reporter said, “the police simply refuse to look for criminals.” "

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have revealed some encouraging news: The U.S. appears to be improving its response to disasters. For all the suffering and damage, the storms were less deadly than had been feared, with about 85 killed in Texas and Florida.

395,"Toshiba’s monthslong effort to sell its memory chip business may finally be nearing an end. The Japanese conglomerate said on Wednesday that it had signed a memorandum to accelerate talks to sell its memory chip unit to a group led by Bain Capital. The group, which also includes Apple, Seagate Technology and Dell, bid more than $18 billion for the chip business, The Wall Street Journal reported. A goal, Toshiba says, is to sign a contract this month, but other bidders are still not excluded from talks (Toshiba had also been in discussions with bidders led by the American company Western Digital and Foxconn of Taiwan). The company has been trying to unload its chip business as part of efforts to strengthen its balance sheet after huge losses at Westinghouse, its American nuclear unit, which filed for bankruptcy in March. Efforts to repeal the estate tax and to introduce deductions for state and local levies will face a fight. Senate Democrats have said they would try to block any rewrite of the tax code that included these measures, arguing that they would make a mockery of Republican promises to provide relief for the middle class. And Republicans have to overcome their own disagreements before they can introduce their framework. "
396,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has resumed work at its underground nuclear testing site, defense analysts said, as the country vowed to keep expanding its nuclear arsenal despite the latest United Nations sanctions. The defense analysts also said that the North’s Sept. 3 nuclear test, which Pyongyang said was of a hydrogen bomb, may have been much more powerful than previously estimated. In its first official reaction to the sanctions resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the sanctions would only strengthen the country’s resolve to pursue its nuclear weapons program “at a faster pace without the slightest diversion.” The sanctions resolution, adopted in response to the nuclear test this month, was the ninth passed by the Security Council since North Korea’s first such test in 2006. If enforced, it would deprive North Korea of 30 percent of its annual fuel imports. It also bans imports of textiles from North Korea, stripping the country of another key source of hard currency. But the North, already heavily sanctioned, remained defiant on Wednesday, saying that it would “redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and right to existence” and establish “practical equilibrium with the U.S.” "
397,"THE WORLD OF TOMORROW
By Brendan Mathews
560 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $28 Brendan Mathews’s first novel, “The World of Tomorrow,” is admirably fearless, daring to tread territory staked by no less than E.L. Doctorow’s finest work, the 1985 novel-cum-memoir “World’s Fair.” Mathews’s is a long book, full of back story and digression, which is no knock on it per se; for what is a good novel — or a good life — but a long series of digressions? Unfortunately, Mathews’s work also demonstrates another truism about a novel, which is that writing one is like setting off into a trackless wood. The slightest misreading of your compass can leave you lost in the trees, many miles from where you wanted to go. With commendable ambition, Mathews attempts to combine a serious story with a great lark. “The World of Tomorrow” starts with Francis Dempsey, a redheaded rogue of an Irishman faking his way across the Atlantic in first class as a Scottish lord. It is the summer of 1939, and Francis has recently escaped from a Dublin prison — where he was serving hard time for selling French postcards and pornographic books like “Ulysses” — after he was allowed, under guard, to attend the funeral for his enigmatic schoolteacher father. There, he and his younger brother, Michael (enduring his own incarceration of sorts in a Catholic seminary), are abruptly sprung by a mob of their dad’s old I.R.A. pals, whom they never knew existed. A wild ride ensues across the Irish countryside, to a safe house that turns out to be not so safe. Francis accidentally detonates the explosives inside, leaving him with a small fortune in stolen funds, an addled and deafened Michael and several inconvenient bodies to put as far behind them as possible. Francis — now “Angus” — decides to light out for the States under what he calls “the First-Class Plan,” audaciously traveling in as posh a manner as possible. He appropriates the title of a highland lord from “Macbeth” and explains that he is taking the muddled Michael — now “Malcolm” — to see if a specialist in New York can do anything about his brother’s awful fox-hunting accident. So far, so good. But everything bogs down once the brothers reach Amerikay. Francis’ ostensible goal is finding their older brother Martin, now a jazzman living with his family in the Bronx. They are able to reach him, all right, but for various reasons Francis continues with the First-Class Plan, setting himself and Michael up in a vast suite in the Plaza Hotel. Francis/Angus is still pitching woo to a naïve, comely heiress he flirted with aboard ship, but whom he may now really love, because she is so magnificent a violinist that her playing moves him to tears (beauty and wealth apparently not being what they once were in the old romance department). Then Tommy Cronin, a hard man from the I.R.A., is sent by a mobster chieftain named Gavigan. Francis lets blab about his heiress connection — including his promise to her family that he will introduce them to his “cousin,” the queen of England, when they visit “The World of Tomorrow,” the world’s fair recently opened in Queens. Gavigan decides this is an excellent opportunity to have Francis go all Gavrilo Princip on their Britannic majesties and shoot the king dead. He threatens to execute every Dempsey extant if Francis refuses, and has Cronin put him through a crash course on regicide. "
398,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be little evidence that Iran is actually cheating in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting loopholes in the deal and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be ignoring injunctions on missile launches levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. "
399,"Many Americans, and the American government itself, have expressed shock at the treatment of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The Trump administration has also said it is concerned about persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East. For his part, the president has said he wants to defend the rights of the Castro regime’s opponents in Cuba. Yet all these protestations will be for nothing if, as the deadline approaches for the White House to make its determination about the number of refugees to be admitted next year, the administration decides to decimate the United States refugee resettlement program. At stake are not just the lives of tens of thousands of victims of war and persecution who dream of starting a new life in America; at risk also are American values, the United States’ reputation and American interests around the world. Every year, the president decides a refugee admission number. Since the 1980 Refugee Act, the average annual admissions ceiling under both Republican and Democratic presidents has exceeded 95,000. For the fiscal year 2017, President Barack Obama decided the number should be 110,000, against the backdrop of a global refugee population that numbers some 22.5 million. President Trump’s two “travel ban” executive orders already intended to cut the 2017 number by more than 50 percent. Now a decision is expected on the number for fiscal year 2018. Inside the administration, there is a debate between fact and fiction. The facts are that the vetting for entry to the United States as a refugee is tougher than for any other means of arrival. Not one of the three million refugees to the United States since 1980 has committed a lethal act of terror on American soil. The Cato Institute has calculated that a United States resident has a 1 in 3.64 billion chance of being killed by a refugee. Meanwhile, some 60,000 Iraqis who have supported the American military and diplomatic effort in Iraq — as, for example, interpreters — are waiting to know if the promise of safe passage to the United States is to be honored. "
400,"WASHINGTON — Shortly after learning in May that a special counsel had been appointed to investigate links between his campaign associates and Russia, President Trump berated Attorney General Jeff Sessions in an Oval Office meeting and said he should resign, according to current and former administration officials and others briefed on the matter. The president attributed the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to Mr. Sessions’s decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s Russia investigation — a move Mr. Trump believes was the moment his administration effectively lost control over the inquiry. Accusing Mr. Sessions of “disloyalty,” Mr. Trump unleashed a string of insults on his attorney general. Ashen and emotional, Mr. Sessions told the president he would quit and sent a resignation letter to the White House, according to four people who were told details of the meeting. Mr. Sessions would later tell associates that the demeaning way the president addressed him was the most humiliating experience in decades of public life. The Oval Office meeting, details of which have not previously been reported, shows the intensity of Mr. Trump’s emotions as the Russia investigation gained steam and how he appeared to immediately see Mr. Mueller’s appointment as a looming problem for his administration. It also illustrates the depth of antipathy Mr. Trump has had for Mr. Sessions — one of his earliest campaign supporters — and how the president interprets “disloyalty” within his circle of advisers. Mr. Trump ended up rejecting Mr. Sessions’s May resignation letter after senior members of his administration argued that dismissing the attorney general would only create more problems for a president who had already fired an F.B.I. director and a national security adviser. Mr. Trump once again, in July, told aides he wanted to remove Mr. Sessions, but for a second time didn’t take action. The relationship between the two men has improved marginally since midsummer, as Mr. Sessions has made a public display of hunting for the leakers among the administration’s national security officials. His allies said that despite the humiliation, the attorney general has stayed in the job because he sees a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity as the nation’s top law enforcement official to toughen the country’s immigration policies.

401,"TOKYO — Forty-one years ago, Antonio Inoki, one of Japan’s most popular professional wrestlers, faced off against Muhammad Ali in a bout that critics called a farcical publicity stunt. Last week, some commentators leveled similar criticism at Mr. Inoki, now a 74-year-old member of Japan’s Parliament, as he returned from North Korea, where he said he had visited a zoo, sipped ginseng wine and discussed nuclear diplomacy with high-ranking officials. “He told me Pyongyang will continue its nuclear testing and take it to a higher level unless the global community, especially the U.S., stops applying pressure,” Mr. Inoki told reporters at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, referring to Ri Su-yong, a vice chairman of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Though Mr. Inoki — a flamboyant ex-athlete with a taste for self-promotion — has been in politics for decades, in some ways he is Japan’s equivalent of Dennis Rodman, the former N.B.A. star who has made numerous visits to North Korea. It is a sign of North Korea’s international isolation — and the limited avenues available to understand it, much less influence it — that Mr. Inoki and Mr. Rodman are among the world’s few links to the leadership of Pyongyang’s opaque, authoritarian state. Mr. Inoki’s five-day trip to North Korea this month was his 32nd since 1995, when he participated in a wrestling match in Pyongyang. In an interview in his Parliament offices, Mr. Inoki — sitting near a life-size cutout of himself with a raised fist, an image soon to be used in advertising for Toyota — said his ultimate goal was “to establish peace through sports diplomacy.” "
402,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • North Korea fired a ballistic missile toward the east, its 15th launch this year, in defiance of new U.N. sanctions prompted by the country’s most powerful nuclear test to date. In Japan, alerts were issued on television and via cellphones, warning people to take shelter indoors or underground. Check back for updates on this developing story. Above, a foreign exchange trading company in Tokyo. _____ • President Trump said that he supported legislation that would protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation, confirming an agreement first announced by Democratic leaders.

403,"Mikhail Gorbachev was one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century, and William Taubman’s new biography of him is essential reading for the 21st, as we trace the arc from the fall of the Soviet Union to the rise of Putin’s Russia. Kurt Andersen digs up the roots of alternative facts in American culture (hint: it starts with the Pilgrims) in “Fantasyland”; and Ben Blum investigates a cousin’s inexplicable crime in “Ranger Games.” In fiction, new works by the acclaimed novelists Jesmyn Ward and Claire Messud encompass themes of childhood and loss. And Margaret Wilkerson Sexton makes a luminous debut with her novel set in New Orleans, “A Kind of Freedom.” Radhika Jones
Editorial Director, Books RANGER GAMES: A Story of Soldiers, Family and an Inexplicable Crime, by Ben Blum. (Doubleday, $28.95.) On Aug. 7, 2006, Ben Blum’s cousin Alex, an Army Ranger, drove four fellow soldiers to a bank, which they robbed by gunpoint. When Alex was arrested, he insisted the robbery was simply an elaborate Ranger training exercise. Was it? Our critic Jennifer Senior says “Ranger Games” is “a memorable, novelistic account” about the unlikely bond between two very different cousins, as well as a “fascinating tutorial on the psychology of modern warfare and social coercion.” SING, UNBURIED, SING, by Jesmyn Ward. (Scribner, $26.) Our critic Parul Sehgal writes that Jesmyn Ward’s books “reach for the sweep, force and sense of inevitability of the Greek myths, but as translated to the small, mostly poor, mostly black town in Mississippi where she grew up and where she still lives.” Ward’s latest novel, which carries echoes of Faulkner and of Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” is both timeless and perfectly poised for the moment. It combines aspects of the American road novel and the ghost story with an exploration of the long aftershocks of a hurricane and the opioid epidemic devouring rural America. FANTASYLAND: How America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History, by Kurt Andersen. (Random House, $30.) This romp through American history, from Anne Hutchinson to Donald Trump, contains a powerful message: For centuries the country has nurtured a “promiscuous devotion to the untrue.” Andersen, a host of public radio’s Studio 360, a best-selling novelist and a cultural omnivore, explores the deep roots of American unreason in all its seductive forms. CAREERS FOR WOMEN, by Joanna Scott. (Little, Brown, $26.) This novel’s craftily arranged narrative involves plot twists, publicists and real estate in midcentury New York City. Scott borrows the best aspects of crime fiction (pacing, stakes, excitement) and avoids its worst (gore, stilted dialogue, clumsy foreshadowing). Look for walk-on roles by the urban activist Jane Jacobs, former mayor John Lindsay and the high-wire artist Philippe Petit. BLACK DETROIT: A People’s History of Self-Determination, by Herb Boyd. (Amistad/HarperCollins, $27.99.) In 29 chapters, spanning more than three centuries, Boyd celebrates the black men and women of Detroit who would otherwise remain on history’s margins. We meet breakthrough figures ranging from Detroit’s first black congressman to Michigan’s first African-American obstetrician to the country’s first black auto dealer. There are a lot of reasons to despair about the city’s future. But Boyd remains hopeful, and his song of praise emphasizes Detroiters’ values of optimism and resolve. "
404,"Public servants are supposed to serve the public, not themselves. What part of that equation does Steven Mnuchin not understand? The Trump administration’s Treasury secretary is in hot water again. On Wednesday, ABC News reported that the Treasury Department’s inspector general’s office was looking at his request that a government jet fly him and his new wife on their European honeymoon. The jet costs taxpayers roughly $25,000 an hour to operate. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, is worth more than $300 million. A Treasury spokesman said Mr. Mnuchin made the request, later withdrawn, because he needed the jet’s “secure communications.” Since Mr. Mnuchin is fifth in line of succession should anything happen to the president, this excuse was at least a tad more credible than the one offered for a ride he took with his wife, Louise Linton, last month that is also under official review. That trip was to Kentucky, where the couple could view the solar eclipse in the path of totality. The justification then was that Mr. Mnuchin wanted to speak with Kentuckians about tax reform and he needed to check on the gold at Fort Knox, which is presumably as safe and sound after Mr. Mnuchin’s inspection as it was when he got there. Taxpayers, who are being reimbursed for Ms. Linton’s travel, may never have known about that junket had she not decided to use a photo of herself alighting from the plane to show off her Hermes, Valentino and Tom Ford ensemble on Instagram. She then savaged a woman from Oregon who dared call the move “#deplorable.” As the clothes designers began distancing themselves, Ms. Linton apologized to America — in an interview with a Washington society magazine that ran a photo of her, in a ball gown, on the cover. Mr. Mnuchin comes from a world where rich people get free stuff all the time. Now he is in a different world, one where taxpayers are on the hook. “We’re starting to see a pattern with Steve Mnuchin,” says Walter Shaub, former chief of the Office of Government Ethics, now at the Campaign Legal Center. “This is the tone from the top, that President Trump himself has set: Ethics doesn’t matter, and high positions of public trust come with perks.” "
405,"Kara Walker has had enough. Since her 1994 New York debut, at just 24 years old, at the Drawing Center, she and her artworks have been hailed as “exquisite” “skillful” “ingenious” and “triumphant.” She has won a MacArthur fellowship, was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and has been widely praised as among the most important black artists working today. No pressure or anything. Ms. Walker is, as she writes in the artist statement for her new show at Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in New York, “tired of ‘having a voice’ or worse, ‘being a role model.’ ” She is fed up with “being a featured member of my racial group and/or gender niche.” She also notes that her new work is not “activist” and we shouldn’t expect answers from her: “I roll my eyes, fold my arms and wait.” Well, this is what Ms. Walker rolling her eyes and folding her arms looks like: a 151-by-191-inch work at the show, in sumi ink and collage, titled “Christ’s Entry Into Journalism,” which combines the imagined and the real as well as the past and present. My eye immediately went to the faces of James Brown and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Then I noticed Frederick Douglass giving a Black Power salute while holding the swastika-stamped head of what appears to be Donald Trump — an obvious allusion to the moment, a few months back, when the president seemed to believe Douglass, who died in 1895, was alive. Elsewhere in the illustration, the president’s look-alike makes another appearance. This time he peeks out from between a Klansman’s legs. The Trump-like character wags his tongue while defecating. In another part of the collage, two black girls swing on a trapeze. Look closer and you see the body of a lynched black man hanging on the branch between them. A white woman carries Trayvon Martin’s hoodie-covered head on a tray. A black man is attacked by a police officer in riot gear who holds a turkey leg in one hand and a cellphone in the other. There is a Confederate battle flag. An American flag. And an arm in a Nazi salute. "
406,"As leading Democrats embrace Senator Bernie Sanders’s proposal to vastly expand Medicare to cover all Americans, Republicans are fighting back with familiar critiques of such a single-payer system. Mr. Sanders argued for his “Medicare for all” legislation in an Op-Ed published in The New York Times on Wednesday, while his Republican colleagues dismissed the idea in a news conference. Here’s an assessment of their claims. Mr. Sanders claimed that “the majority of the American people” want Medicare for all, citing an April poll by The Economist/YouGov in which 60 percent of Americans agreed that Medicare should be expanded to cover everyone. But this appears to be the high end of support. A Quinnipiac poll in August reported that 51 percent of respondents said that replacing the current health care system with a Medicare-for-all model was a good idea. “Medicare for all” generally polls more favorably than “single payer.” In a June poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 57 percent of respondents supported Medicare for all, while 53 percent favored a single-payer approach. Other polls about single-payer health care found lower levels of support: 44 percent from Morning Consult/Politico, 44 percent from Rasmussen and 33 percent from the Pew Research Center. Pollsters at AP/NORC did not ask about a specific model in an August survey, but 60 percent of respondents said it was the federal government’s responsibility to provide health care for everyone. "

408,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump came under attack from some of his strongest supporters, who were outraged about his decision to set aside a fight, at least for now, over building a border wall with Mexico as part of a deal with Democrats to protect young, undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump’s second compromise with the top-ranking congressional Democrats in one week raised a question for many Republicans: How much more will his base tolerate? The president also revived his “both sides” claim about the racial violence last month in Charlottesville, Va. _____ "
409,"Wow, Donald Trump is all over the place. On Tuesday he had dinner with a few moderate Democrats and completely retooled his tax policy before dessert. This is the man who is having such a famous fling with the minority leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, that they no longer need identifying. Really, “Chuck and Nancy” are as famous as Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Victoria and Albert. Antony and Cleopatra. But about the tax policy dinner. The Democratic senators described their discussion as so harmonious it sounded … kind of boring. “Very collegial and very businesslike,” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota on a radio interview back home with talk show host Joel Heitkamp. (Yes, they’re siblings. North Dakota is a very small state. Only 750,000 people. Yet as many senators as California or New York. Do you think that’s fair? Never mind, I digress.) Democrats have been demanding that no tax cuts go to the wealthy, and over beef medallions, Trump gave the impression that was exactly what he wanted, too. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia reported that “the president was adamant from the get-go: ‘This is not a tax cut for the rich, and I repeat that, this will not be a tax cut for me or any rich people.’ That kind of started off the conversation and it went pretty good from there.” Now Manchin and Heitkamp are two of the most conservative senators from their party. But still, this seems like an awful lot of agreeing. Trump has spent the last month howling about the need to cut the corporate tax rate in half, and he’s been adamant about getting rid of the estate tax, which is imposed only on inheritances of more than $5 million. Do you think he’s changed his mind? That the Democrats misheard? That the spinach was spiked with hallucinogens? On Wednesday Trump not only ditched his tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy plans, he claimed the rich might take a hit. “If they have to go higher they’ll go higher,” he told a bipartisan congressional group with the adorable name of the Problem Solvers Caucus. This seemed like good news except for the part about the president appearing to be sort of off his rocker. "
410,"When Congress has to pass a joint resolution condemning white supremacy and plunk it on the desk of the “president” — in an effort to force him to sign it and daring him not to — you know that we as a country are beyond the pale. (On Wednesday, the press secretary for the “on many sides” white supremacy sympathizer said: “In terms of whether or not he’ll sign the joint resolution, absolutely. And he looks forward to doing so as soon as he receives it.” Of course, he didn’t really have a choice. A veto would have been the equivalent of burning a cross on the Resolute Desk.) When Donald Trump’s fraudulent voter-fraud commission openly entertains the loony and unworkable idea of further winnowing the voter rolls by forcing potential voters to undergo the federal background check used for gun buyers, you know that this administration is trying every way it can to ax voter access and re-establish Jim Crow poll tests. When Robert Mueller is circling this White House like a hawk preparing to descend on a chicken coop, you know that the stench of corruption emanating from this administration reaches to the heavens. Indeed, on Tuesday, Axios reported this intriguing line: “Republicans close to the White House say every sign by Mueller — from his hiring of Mafia and money-laundering experts to his aggressive pursuit of witnesses and evidence — is that he’s going for the kill.” I often hear from Trump enthusiasts and accommodators that at some point resistance must submit, that the time for outrage is term-limited, that at a point, complete opposition registers as unfair and unpatriotic. "
411,"Republicans — like President Trump, for instance — love to puff up their chests, grasp their lapels and declaim in foghorn voices about their devotion to law and order. And so, on Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, piously declared that the Justice Department should consider whether James Comey had broken the law before and after Trump fired him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “I think if there’s ever a moment where we feel someone’s broken the law, particularly if they’re the head of the F.B.I., I think that’s something that certainly should be looked at,” she said. She was referring to Comey’s exoneration of Hillary Clinton in the email caper, and his admission that he had leaked his own private memo describing conversations with Trump. It couldn’t get clearer than that, right? Not so fast. On a Friday night in August, when Hurricane Harvey was barreling into Texas, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Ariz.a, sheriff who had blatantly violated a court order to stop detaining people because he thought they looked Mexican. It didn’t bother President Law and Order that he undercut the courts’ only power to enforce their orders. His praise of Arpaio as being “very strong” on lawbreaking by border crossers did not mention that the former sheriff fed his victims rotten food in outdoor detention camps where temperatures soared and some prisoners even died. Or that he failed to investigate about 400 sex crimes. Under the Trump formula, Comey should be investigated by the Justice Department — but Michael Flynn, who had to resign in disgrace as national security adviser, should get a pass for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his meetings with the Russian ambassador. On Wednesday, we learned that Democrats in Congress are asking questions about another memory slip by Flynn — failing to disclose a trip he took in 2015 to try to broker a Saudi-Russian deal on nuclear power plants — and that he may have lobbied inside the White House for that deal. "
412,"The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency. In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank’s seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen. Few presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it’s time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity. The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking — often vaguely — about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself. The Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low — and both were low before 2008. Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as “consumer prices” but now have a bigger influence on the economy. Consumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys. Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction. To ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money. In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai. "
413,"In over 45 years of working in global affairs, I’ve observed a simple truth: America’s ability to lead the world depends not just on the example of our power, but on the power of our example. American democracy is rooted in the belief that every man, woman and child has equal rights to freedom and dignity. While the United States is far from perfect, we have never given up the struggle to grow closer to the ideals in our founding documents. The constant American endeavor to live by our values is a great strength that has drawn generations of strivers and dreamers to the United States, enriching our population. Around the world, other nations follow our lead because they know that America does not simply protect its own interests, but tries to advance the aspirations of all. This has stood as the foundation of American foreign policy throughout my political career — until recently. Around the world, including in the United States, we are seeing the resurgence of a worldview that is closed off and clannish. President Trump keeps longstanding allies such as Germany at arm’s length, while expressing admiration for autocrats like Vladimir V. Putin who thwart democratic institutions. "
414,"WASHINGTON — President Trump thrust himself back into the racial storms of Charlottesville on Thursday, repeating his charge that those who resisted the neo-Nazis and white supremacists were as much to blame as the alt-right crowds who marched on the Virginia college town. Mr. Trump was characterizing his side of a conversation on Wednesday with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, during which Mr. Scott, the Senate’s only black Republican, confronted the president on his claim that “both sides” were responsible for the violence that followed a torchlight protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. “Especially in light of the advent of Antifa, if you look at what’s going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the anti-fascist activists who clashed with the neo-Nazis and white supremacists. “Now because of what’s happened since then, with Antifa, you look at really what’s happened since Charlottesville — a lot of people are saying — in fact, a lot of people have actually written, ‘Gee, Trump might have a point,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Air Force One. “I said, ‘You’ve got some very bad people on the other side,’ which is true.” It was the latest shift in Mr. Trump’s constantly evolving statements about Charlottesville. He has alternately condemned the hate groups and drawn a moral equivalence between them and the counterprotesters. On Thursday night, he signed a nonbinding congressional resolution urging him to condemn groups like white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan. But earlier in the day, Mr. Trump reverted to the unapologetic stance he took in a news conference last month at Trump Tower. Despite that, Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Scott had a “great conversation.” He described Mr. Scott as a longstanding friend whom he supported early in his career. "
415,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Hurries a Tax Overhaul Not Yet Written” (front page, Sept. 14): President Trump is using the tragedies of multiple hurricanes hitting the United States as an excuse to rush through Congress his plan to reform the country’s income tax code. Attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of people to circumvent the normal process of careful and systematic analysis of the impacts of making major changes to the tax code can only mean that his proposals would fail to stand up to the detailed scrutiny that normally accompanies such legislation. More important, unless President Trump releases all of his tax returns — which, during the campaign, he promised to do after the election — we can never know how much he and his family personally benefit from his proposals. Given that he has repeatedly used the office of the presidency for personal aggrandizement (doubling the membership fees at Mar-a-Lago, hosting foreign leaders at Trump hotels), we can only believe that his plan is less a “Make America Great Again” plan than a “Make the Trump Family Ever Richer” plan. ROBERT CHECCHIO, DUNELLEN, N.J. To the Editor: Re “When the Rich Said No to Getting Richer,” by David Leonhardt (column, Sept. 5): Thank you, Mr. Leonhardt, for reminding us that after World War II the highest income category was taxed at 91 percent. Taxes then paid for war expenses and the Interstate highway system. Today, governments are unable to adequately fund law enforcement or education or fix those highways, among other needs, while some multimillionaires, although in the maximum 39.6 percent tax bracket, actually pay an effective tax rate lower than their secretaries do. In the same way, some corporations ostensibly taxed at 35 percent actually pay a far lower rate or even no taxes after tax credits and deductions. It would be interesting to know how many companies are using contractors to pay their employees a stagnating wage and keep them in dead-end jobs instead of appreciating them as loyal employees and helping them to further their education and goals, as reflected in the Sept. 3 Sunday Business article contrasting two employers, “The Great American Janitor Test.” There is a better way than that being pursued by those who do not see the corrosive effect of the values of many of today’s “leaders.” "
416,"NAPLES, Fla. — President Trump traveled to Florida on Thursday to take part in what has quickly become a familiar tableau for him: the windbreaker-clad commander in chief, surveying hurricane devastation, bucking up local officials, and alighting from his helicopter to distribute food and handshakes. This time, it was Naples, the Gulf Coast town of multimillion-dollar seafront villas and inland mobile-home parks that was torn asunder by Hurricane Irma. Mr. Trump stopped at one of the latter, where an excavator was removing the twisted remains of a mobile home. “Don’t forget to take one,” the president said to a friendly crowd as he stood behind a silver tin of hoagies, part of a staging area with food and water for resident and rescue workers. “Here’s a nice one!” Mr. Trump arrived in Naples after he was briefed in nearby Fort Myers on the recovery operation by federal emergency management and Florida officials, including Senator Marco Rubio, Gov. Rick Scott, and Pam Bondi, the state attorney general. It was Mr. Trump’s third visit to storm-ravaged parts of the United States in the past few weeks after two major hurricanes, and he again praised the federal government’s performance. “We’re doing a good job in Florida,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Air Force One. “We’re going to see some of the folks and make sure they’re happy,” he said in Fort Myers, acknowledging that many had lost their homes in the destruction. "
417,"MEXICO CITY — Favorable views of the United States have sharply declined among Mexicans, reaching the lowest point in 15 years amid deep disapproval of President Trump and his policies toward Mexico, according to a survey released on Thursday. Nearly two-thirds of Mexicans now have a negative opinion of their northern neighbor, more than double the proportion of two years ago, the study, by the Pew Research Center, found. Of the 37 countries surveyed by Pew, Mexico had the largest drop in favorability toward the United States. The negative views coincide with a dismal perception of Mr. Trump and his signature campaign promises. Only 5 percent of Mexicans are confident that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in world affairs, his lowest rating in any country, and 94 percent oppose his plan to build a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States. Mr. Trump has also cracked down on undocumented immigrants, many of whom are Mexican, and threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The jump in unfavorable views comes after years of warming perceptions of the United States among Mexicans as relations have deepened between the two countries. Economic ties have strengthened under Nafta, tourism from the United States has soared in Mexico, and millions of Mexicans have family connections in the United States after decades of immigration. But the 65 percent of Mexicans with unfavorable views of the United States in the new survey represent the highest share since Pew began surveying the country in 2002. It also flips the numbers on their head: In 2015, 66 percent of Mexicans had a generally positive view of the United States. The latest survey was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 1,000 Mexicans from March 2 to April 10. Mexicans still have a favorable view of the economic relationship, with 55 percent saying that ties with the United States are good for their country, although that proportion has declined 15 points from 2013. Mexicans’ views of Nafta are similarly favorable, with three in five seeing the accord as a good thing for their country. The negative attitudes toward the United States do not appear to affect Mexicans’ desire to live and work there. More than half of those with an unfavorable opinion of the United States, 54 percent, said that life was better for those who move there. One-third of Mexicans said they would move to the United States if given the opportunity, a proportion that has changed little since 2009. But a smaller share, 13 percent, said they were willing to work or live in the United States without authorization, down from 20 percent two years ago. The survey also found a generally grim mood among Mexicans, with 85 percent dissatisfied with the way things are going in their country. Among their most pressing concerns, the study found, are political corruption, drug-related violence and crime. "
418,"Young Americans have been moving left and leaving the G.O.P. in recent years, but a successful Democratic coalition built on the backs of liberal youth is far from a sure thing, especially in the short term. The party’s problem is straightforward: getting them to actually go to the polls. Politicians know which part of the electorate still butters their bread — and there’s no avocado on it. Those aged 18 to 29 vote at far lower rates than older groups, decreasing their electoral power. But there are at least some signs that their participation levels will improve. And if an increasingly left-leaning voting bloc does become more politically active, there are huge potential gains for the Democratic Party. The obvious positive news for Democrats is reflected in the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (C.C.E.S.), a survey of 64,000 adults. Fifty-four percent of American adults younger than 30 identified as Democrat or leaning-Democrat in 2016 — that’s six percentage points higher than among the rest of the public. Young people also call themselves “very liberal” or “liberal” more often than Americans older than 30, by five and seven percentage points. Roughly 60 percent of this group reported voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to the C.C.E.S. (This is higher than the 55 percent reported in exit polls after the election.) This may warm Democrats’ hearts, but it’s still a far cry from the hyper-left youth vote some like to think exists. President Trump won the white youth vote last year, after all. A significant part of the Democratic lean among the young can be simply explained by their increased diversity — but not all of it. The youngest voters have been leaning Democratic since 2004. That doesn’t mean they have the same party loyalty of older left-of-center generations. They’re more likely to register as independent. "

420,"“We could let it die quietly, but we’re going to kill it loudly.” That’s the message President Trump wanted to send in blocking a Chinese-backed bid for Lattice Semiconductor, according to Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The White House said it prevented the acquisition of the American chip maker to preserve the integrity of the semiconductor industry, raising questions about the buyer’s close ties to Beijing. The investment group making the bid included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by government-backed entities, the White House said. Gao Feng, a spokesman for China’s commerce ministry, said that countries should not use security reviews as a way to push protectionism. What you need to know: • China has been especially interested in computer chips as part of its push to become a dominant force in cutting-edge industries. • Lattice doesn’t currently sell equipment to the American military. But it has in the past, meaning that some of its chips may still be in use, The Financial Times reports. "
421,"WASHINGTON — An unexpected meeting of the minds between President Trump and Democratic leaders on Thursday made real a possible deal in Congress to pair enhanced border security with legislation to protect young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. One day after Mr. Trump hosted Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi for dinner at the White House, the president said he could support legislation to protect the young immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation if it were accompanied by a “massive” border security upgrade. Acceding to a key Democratic demand, Mr. Trump said such a package did not need to have funding for a border wall. It was the second time this month that a tentative agreement announced by Democrats left Republican leaders in Congress scrambling to adjust a legislative agenda that appears increasingly set by the party out of power in the House, the Senate and the White House. “We’re working on a plan for DACA,” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to protections for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as he prepared to leave the White House for Florida. He added, “The wall will come later.” And Republican leaders at least sounded open to pursuing it. “We’re not going to bring a solution to the floor that does not have the support of President Trump,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin told reporters. But if Mr. Trump does support an immigration package that includes “security and enforcement,” he said, so will “a majority of our members, because our members support President Trump.” But he also made his frustration clear. “The president understands he has to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution,” Mr. Ryan said.

422,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) John Chiang, California’s bespectacled treasurer, is a finance man. His two decades in public office have been all taxes, budgets, bonds and pensions. It’s a resume that Mr. Chiang, a Democrat, hopes will persuade voters that he is the governor California needs as it wrestles with a housing crisis and gaping income equality. He’ll need to outshine two bold-name rivals in the 2018 race: Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, and Antonio Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles. Mr. Chiang, 55, grew up in a suburb of Chicago, the son of immigrants from Taiwan. He studied finance at the University of South Florida and law at Georgetown University, before relocating to the Los Angeles area in 1987, where he lives today. Since then, he has climbed methodically up the ranks of state politics, from political staffer to tax official to controller to treasurer. Still, Mr. Chiang is not widely known. (On that note, it’s pronounced Chung). To remedy that he embarked this summer, camper in tow, on a yearlong tour of all 58 California counties. "
423,"President Trump will hold a conference call on Friday morning with Jewish leaders ahead of the High Holy Days, moving ahead with a standard White House event that several rabbinical groups have vowed to boycott. “In commemoration of the Jewish High Holy Days, President Donald J. Trump would like to invite you to a conference call where he will send well wishes for the upcoming holidays and discuss his administration’s progress on issues of interest to the Jewish community,” a brief email to invitees said. “We hope that you will accept our invitation to join this exciting call as the Jewish people welcome 5778 and reflect on the past year,” the email said. The tradition of the conference call had been nonpartisan in previous years ahead of the holidays of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur. But late in August, four coalitions of rabbis said they would boycott the call, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s equivocating response to the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va. Issues related to the Jewish community have been problematic for the president throughout his presidency. A statement from the White House on Holocaust Remembrance Day made no mention of the millions of Jews who were killed, instead focusing on “all” who suffered. And the president’s statement that there were “very fine people” among the white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville prompted an outcry. It was not immediately clear how many groups were invited to participate on the conference call. Still, some people thought the president deserved praise for going ahead with it. “It is important that President Trump is holding this outreach call with Jewish leaders and rabbis ahead of Rosh Hashana,” said Nathan Diament, the executive director for public policy at the Orthodox Union. “It is a testament to the American ideal of religious diversity and it is meaningful that the president is continuing this tradition started by President Obama,” he said. Graham Roth, a spokesman for the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said the group’s position has not changed. “Reform rabbis, along with Reconstructionist and Conservative rabbis, decided to forgo hosting the annual High Holiday call with the president this year,” he said in an email. “This was not a decision made lightly, but the president’s lack of moral leadership in the wake of Charlottesville made it necessary.” "
424,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Bernie Sanders’s biggest ally in his push for single-payer health insurance may well be the Republican Party. Yes, Republicans criticized and mocked the “Medicare for all” bill that Sanders released yesterday, and I doubt any Congressional Republicans will support the bill in the foreseeable future. But I do think they are unwittingly helping his cause. There are two main alternatives to an expansion of government-provided health insurance. One is to argue that it’s fine if millions of Americans go without insurance. I don’t see many politicians willing to make this case affirmatively (even those who vote for bills that would take insurance away). The second alternative is to strengthen private insurance markets, so that they’re covering more people and holding costs. Yet the Trump administration and many other Republicans — both governors and members of Congress — are now doing the opposite. They’re sabotaging the private insurance markets created by Obamacare. If those markets fail, it will leave many Americans who don’t get insurance through their job without coverage. The weaker private markets become, the more political momentum government-provided insurance will have. Some Democrats will push for a gradual expansion of Medicaid and Medicare. Others, like Sanders and his growing list of allies, will push for an entirely new system. I don’t expect them to succeed anytime soon, but the debate over health care has moved much further to the left in recent years than I expected to see. And the Republican Party is largely responsible. "
425,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Trump confirms backing for “Dreamers” law. President Trump said this morning that he supported legislation that would protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation, confirming an agreement with Democratic leaders. Mr. Trump’s comments contradicted his earlier Twitter posts, in which he said no deal had been made. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi said protections for the young immigrants were not dependent on funding for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico — though Mr. Trump will continue to push for its construction. Separately, Mr. Trump urged Congress to “move fast” on passing a tax code. • Irma’s effects. Three days after the hurricane, some of the most vulnerable people in Florida were dying — not because of wind or floods, but because of what seemed to be an electrical failure. Eight people died in a sweltering  nursing home. "
426,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. The former White House press secretary Sean Spicer broke his post-administration silence on Wednesday, joining Jimmy Kimmel for an interview. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Spicer didn’t exactly forswear his loyalty to President Trump. Mr. Spicer refused to back away from his old claims that members of the traditional news media are often untruthful, even after Mr. Kimmel asked: “Do you think that is a dangerous thing, to delegitimize the press for America?” But when Mr. Kimmel asked whether the president’s constant tweeting had ever worn his patience thin, Mr. Spicer couldn’t help but laugh a little. Mr. Kimmel rolled a tape of Melissa McCarthy’s famous impression of Mr. Spicer on “Saturday Night Live” and asked about Mr. Trump’s response to it. Some reporters have been trying to figure out why Mr. Trump is making deals with Senate Democrats all of a sudden. Some are reporting that he and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have struck up a warm relationship. Samantha Bee is not surprised. Ms. Bee also pointed out that Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has been insisting that Americans should not discuss the possibility that climate change is responsible for recent bouts of extreme weather. "
427,"UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. — Eleven years after parting ways, seemingly forever, the “Will & Grace” gang — same cast, same writers, same studio audience warm-up guy — reunited on the NBCUniversal lot here in mid-August. As they started work on 29 new episodes, Sean Hayes, returning to his role as the overly dramatic Jack, belted out a song from “Dreamgirls.” Megan Mullally, who plays Karen, did a little dance and shouted, “Sass is in the house!” But not everyone was doing Rockette kicks. Ruminating on a sofa in the middle of Stage 22 were Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, the creators of “Will & Grace.” They had already celebrated their show’s revival and were now fretting about the evolved culture, in particular the emphasis on identity politics and the way TV shows are now picked apart on social media. How would their sometimes sharp-edged sitcom, which returns to NBC on Sept. 28, go over in the Age of Rage? “That really is the big question,” Mr. Mutchnick said, crossing his arms. “Will & Grace” pushed well past the broadcast network comfort zone when it arrived with a finger snap in 1998. The show’s framework was familiar — “I Love Lucy,” with twists — but its focus on gay characters was not. Being gay on TV was considered so taboo that “Will & Grace” writers waited until the second season to risk including a (modest) same-sex kiss. Now, however, with the legalization of gay marriage and “Transparent” and gay characters even popping up on the Disney Channel, the question is not whether “Will & Grace” is too inclusive — too ahead of the culture — but whether it is inclusive enough. At a time when Hollywood is under intense pressure to avoid stereotypes and to promote diversity from every possible angle, “Will & Grace” — once seen as the epitome of diversity on television — could actually find itself assailed for being behind the curve. It’s about four privileged white people. The characters, in particular the plain-spoken and politically incorrect Karen, occasionally crack racially tinged jokes. Although the lovably uptight gay character at the center of the show, Will, played by Eric McCormack, is best friends with Grace, played by Debra Messing, he sometimes makes quips that could come across as misogynistic in today’s climate. In rehearsal for the third episode, writers had Will joking, “It’s all in the book ‘Men Are From Mars, Who Cares Where Women Come From.’” "
428,"For years, climate change activists have faced a wrenching dilemma: how to persuade people to care about a grave but seemingly far-off problem and win their support for policies that might pinch them immediately in utility bills and at the pump. But that calculus may be changing at a time when climatic chaos feels like a daily event rather than an airy abstraction, and storms powered by warming ocean waters wreak havoc on the mainland United States. Americans have spent weeks riveted by television footage of wrecked neighborhoods, displaced families, flattened Caribbean islands and submerged cities from Houston to Jacksonville. “The conversation is shifting,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “Because even if you don’t believe liberals, even if you don’t believe scientists, you can believe your own eyes.” Despite consensus among scientists, not everyone is convinced that terrifying weather means climate change is an urgent threat. There is virtually no prospect of large-scale federal action on the issue in the near future, and President Trump has made a top priority of unraveling the Obama administration’s environmental policies, including the Paris climate accord. Republicans, who control the White House and Congress, remain broadly skeptical of climate science and rely heavily on the electoral support of oil- and coal-producing states. But an array of political leaders — including some members of Mr. Trump’s party, along with emboldened Democrats and environmental activists — see the underlying dynamics of climate politics bending, as drastic weather events throw up practical challenges for red and blue states alike. Mr. Schatz, one of the Democrats’ most assertive spokesmen on global warming, said there were already “pockets of opportunity” to work with Republicans on measures to reinforce coastlines and support solar- and wind-energy production, though not on more ambitious policies. “We can get a fair amount of bipartisanship if we talk about severe weather and resiliency,” Mr. Schatz said. “For some people, it’s just about the phrase ‘climate change’ being too politically loaded.” "
429,"In the Trump era, Republicans have been revising their views on right and wrong. In 2011, the Public Religion Research Institute asked voters if White evangelical Protestants were the least forgiving. Sixty-one percent said such a politician could not “behave ethically,” twice the 30 percent who felt that such a politician could manage it. Every other religious group was less judgmental. Catholics, 49 no, 42, yes; white mainline Protestants: 44 percent no, 38 percent yes; the religiously unaffiliated, 26 no, 63 yes. Are the moral convictions of white evangelical Protestants writ in stone? Apparently not. Five years later, in October, 2016, P.R.R.I. asked the same question. The percentage of white evangelical Protestants who said that a politician who commits an immoral act in their personal life could still behave ethically shot up from 30 to 72 percent. The percentage saying such a politician could not serve ethically plunged from 63 to 20 percent. “In a head-spinning reversal,” Robert P. Jones, the C.E.O. of P.R.R.I., wrote in the July 2017 issue of The Atlantic, What happened in the interim? The answer is obvious: the advent of Donald Trump. There is more to this phenomenon than evangelical hypocrisy. Many Republican voters, including self-identified strong conservatives, are ready and willing to shift to the left if they’re told that that’s the direction Trump is moving. "
430,"The bunny almost was broiled. In the most notorious scene of the 1987 thriller “Fatal Attraction,” the spurned Alex (Glenn Close) terrorizes her ex-lover Dan (Michael Douglas) by boiling the family pet on the stove. “Initially, I had her grilling the bunny,” the screenwriter James Dearden said in a recent telephone interview. “But I thought that was too grotesque. So we boiled the bunny instead.” The result remained fairly gory. “The stench was unbearable,” the film’s director, Adrian Lyne, recalled of shooting the scene with a rabbit purchased from a butcher. “It permeated the whole house.” Three decades after it became an Oscar-nominated cause célèbre and grossed $320 million worldwide, “Fatal Attraction” continues to pervade the culture. “Bunny boiler” has become synonymous with a female stalker, and a “Saturday Night Live” sketch last season depicted the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway cooking a CNN anchor’s rabbit. Thirty years after the film’s Sept. 18, 1987, release, I spoke with the cast and filmmakers about the movie and its surprising aftermath. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.  The producer Stanley R. Jaffe saw a short, “Diversion,” written and directed by Mr. Dearden, about an unfaithful husband whose lover phones his wife. Mr. Jaffe took it to another producer, Sherry Lansing, who thought it had feature potential. But no one in Hollywood would buy it, especially with Michael Douglas as the lead. SHERRY LANSING “Diversion” would not leave my mind. I had my own experience when I was rejected [by a man], and I felt like he took my soul. The film got rejected twice by every studio. They would say, “A guy who cheats on his wife for absolutely no reason!” Michael hadn’t done “Wall Street.” He had done the “Romancing the Stone” films and “The Streets of San Francisco” on TV, but he wasn’t big enough to get a movie made with a script they didn’t like. "
431,"There’s an old saying, “hard cases make bad law.” Perhaps a corollary should be “easy cases make good law.” In the realm of insider trading, Mathew Martoma seems an especially easy case. Mr. Martoma is the former SAC Capital portfolio manager who was convicted of the biggest insider-trading offense in history, a series of trades based on confidential information he coaxed from Dr. Sidney Gilman, an eminent neurologist at the University of Michigan who was overseeing tests of a promising drug for Alzheimer’s disease. It was a medication that some speculated would be the biggest drug of all time. After Mr. Martoma learned from Dr. Gilman that the trials had been largely a failure, SAC was able to trade on the still-confidential information, generating profits and avoiding losses totaling $275 million. Mr. Martoma earned a $9.3 million bonus for his efforts. Dr. Gilman testified against Mr. Martoma at trial. Despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, Mr. Martoma has never acknowledged any wrongdoing or shown any remorse. His steadfast refusal to cooperate with the government meant criminal charges were never brought against Steven A. Cohen, SAC’s founder, who remains one of the world’s richest men and who is now back in business at his new operation, Point72 Asset Management. (Insider trading wasn’t Mr. Martoma’s first occasion of impropriety. He was expelled from Harvard Law School after it discovered that he had altered his transcripts to get a prestigious judicial clerkship, and then lied about it. He later enrolled at Stanford Business School, which revoked his M.B.A. degree after learning about the incidents at Harvard.) Given the circumstances of the case, it was no surprise when Mr. Martoma was convicted in 2014 and sentenced to nine years in prison. "
432,"WASHINGTON — President Trump came under withering attack on Thursday from some of his strongest supporters, who were outraged and unforgiving about his decision to set aside, for now, a fight over building the border wall he has long promised as part of a deal with Democrats on legislation to protect young, undocumented immigrants. The tentative arrangement, which the president hashed out over dinner on Wednesday night at the White House with the top-ranking congressional Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, set off accusations of betrayal and renewed nagging doubts about whether Mr. Trump was in jeopardy of alienating some of his most ardent backers on the right. No promise was more central to his campaign than building the border wall. And no constituency was more passionate in defending Mr. Trump’s pledge than the conservatives who believed he would be uncompromising in his approach toward illegal immigration. The condemnation was swift and came from many different conservative corners: members of his own party in Congress, his most steadfast boosters on talk radio and the grass roots. “At this point, who doesn’t want Trump impeached?” said the conservative writer Ann Coulter as she took to Twitter to excoriate the president. “If we’re not getting a wall, I’d prefer President Pence,” added Ms. Coulter, who met recently with the president in the Oval Office and warned him of the perils of not keeping his word on immigration, and most notably the wall.

434,"THE CRISIS OF MULTICULTURALISM IN EUROPE
A History
By Rita Chin
363 pp. Princeton University Press. $35. THE STRANGE DEATH OF EUROPE
Immigration, Identity, Islam
By Douglas Murray
343 pp. Bloomsbury. $26 In the mid-1890s, the German sociologist Max Weber warned against “the continual swarm” of cheap Polish laborers arriving in Germany. According to him, a “free market policy, including open borders in the east, is the worst possible policy at this point.” And not just for economic reasons. The likely integration of these aliens would threaten the “social unification of the nation, which has been split apart by modern economic development.” For Weber, a German nationalist, the “influx of Poles” was “far more dangerous from a cultural viewpoint” than even of Chinese “coolies.” Compared with Weber’s rhetoric about Germany’s “struggle for existence” and his strictures against Catholics and Jews as well as Poles and Chinese, there is nothing overtly racist about the denunciations Rita Chin quotes in “The Crisis of Multiculturalism in Europe” by opponents of multiculturalism — which for them is shorthand for the nonwhite laborers Europe expediently imported after World War II to reconstruct its shattered economy. The political scientist Samuel Huntington’s comment that “multiculturalism is in its essence anti-European civilization” — approvingly cited by Douglas Murray in “The Strange Death of Europe” — also seems coded in comparison. But as demagogues across Europe and America rant against immigration and promise to build a strong and unified national community through exclusion, it is hard not to feel déjà vu. Racial nationalism was commonplace in the late 19th century, the radically disruptive first phase of economic globalization. Hierarchies of race, ethnicity and religion were imposed on non-Western peoples as Europeans scrambled for territories and resources abroad, followed enviously by Americans. Exclusion was also central to their frantic effort to build political communities at home. Old bonds and solidarities had frayed in societies split apart, as Weber wrote, by modern economic development. Many of the aggrieved became eager to recreate and purify the social body, and to preserve “our” identity against people stigmatized as the “other” through their names, skin color or religious practices. Mass immigration to Western Europe and America, which peaked in the late 19th century, heightened the fantasy of a lost communal wholeness. So did unregulated flows of refugees: Pogroms in Russia sent thousands of Jewish survivors to Western Europe. (Weber’s warnings against the Polish “swarm” reflected a then widespread anxiety about Ostjuden.) Virulent anti-Semites flourished in Austria-Hungary, Germany and France as the 19th century ended, while lynchings of blacks by white mobs in the United States became more common. The United States in the 1880s had pioneered racialized immigration policy, passing laws aimed at keeping Asians out. The Jim Crow laws that institutionalized segregation in the 1890s were accompanied by a mass hysteria in the United States against immigrants. Fears of degeneration haunted even powerful white men like Theodore Roosevelt. In 1905, amid widespread paranoia about the Yellow Peril, he warned of “race suicide,” exhorting white people to strengthen themselves against their rising nonwhite rivals. "
435,"NEWARK — The Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor opened his post-Labor Day blitz accusing his Republican opponent of abdicating her moral leadership. The Republican challenger retorted with accusations of race baiting. They were the type of hyperbolic accusations often thrown around in a nail-biting, nasty political campaign with such vitriolic attacks feeding a frenetic news cycle hungry for daily conflict and a riled electorate packing town hall meetings and rallies. This is not that kind of race. Despite an election that will mark the end of the tumultuous tenure of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and the fact that it is only one of two statewide elections this year, the campaign has failed to whet the appetite of voters. Philip D. Murphy, the Democrat, is leading the Republican, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, by 25 percentage points in a poll by Quinnipiac University released this week. Much like this year’s primary elections for governor in June, in which turnout hovered around 13 percent of the state’s nearly 5.8 million registered voters, the general election to replace Mr. Christie is being met with similar apathy. About four in 10 voters do not know who either Mr. Murphy or Ms. Guadagno are, according to another recent poll from Rutgers University. “It’s a stealth election,” said Maurice Carroll, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll. “They’re campaigning like crazy but nobody pays attention.” "
436,"I had only two or three questions for Jon Hamm. I wanted to know if fame had rattled him. I wanted to know if, more than two years after the “Mad Men” finale, he had plotted out a second act worthy of his talent. I wanted to know if he still wanted to be a star. We were supposed to meet at the edge of Central Park at 11 a.m. and take a walk. Then came the rain. So we switched the location to Pearl Studios, a suite of rehearsal rooms in Midtown where actors and dancers audition for Broadway shows, touring companies and cruise-ship work. I texted to say I would pick up coffee. How did he like his? “Black!” he texted back. At Cafe Grumpy on West 39th Street I picked up two black coffees, extra-large. They were nearly lawsuit-hot. The walk in the rain to Pearl Studios seemed long. A few minutes past 11 came another text from Mr. Hamm, whose politeness may owe something to his Missouri upbringing: “I’m one very congested crosstown block away. Sorry!!” If you still picture Don Draper when you think of Mr. Hamm, it may strike you as odd to see him emerge from a Nissan NV200 yellow cab, which has a boxy look very much at odds with the elegant midcentury universe of “Mad Men.” He was wearing a white linen dress shirt with the two top buttons undone, khakis and white sneakers with black laces. A Timex Blackjack Watch and a St. Louis Cardinals cap with a vintage logo completed the look. He accepted his coffee with a thank-you and took my hand in a meaty paw. Since completing his work on the show that made him famous, Mr. Hamm has gone through changes in his personal life while trying to get a movie career going. In 2015, he spent a month in treatment for alcohol addiction at a rehab facility. Some months after that, he and his partner of 18 years, the writer, director and actor Jennifer Westfeldt, announced that they had broken up. "
437,"Good morning. The New York Times is providing full free digital access to European readers through Sunday. Here’s what you need to know: • Jean-Claude Juncker, above, the president of the European Commission, laid out plans to simplify how the European Union is run. In perhaps the boldest proposal in his annual address to the European Parliament, Mr. Juncker suggested streamlining the bloc’s leadership — an idea that could in theory eliminate his own job. European leaders were largely lukewarm or silent on Mr. Juncker’s idea of combining the presidencies of the European Commission and the European Council, which would require their unanimous support. "
438,"Before there were the Dreamers, there were undocumented children occupying seats in the public school classrooms of America. And before there was Kris Kobach, or Jeff Sessions, or Donald Trump, or other exploiters of the nativist strain that runs just below the surface of the national psyche, there was Texas. In 1975, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to deny enrollment to children not “legally admitted” to the United States. A district that chose to retain such children would forfeit a proportionate share of its state funding, a bargain none was likely to accept. Lawsuits followed, and on June 15, 1982, by a vote of 5 to 4, the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional. “By denying these children a basic education,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote for the majority, “we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institutions, and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our nation.” Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote for the four dissenters. The case was Plyler v. Doe. Thirty-five years is a long time, and no one on today’s court was among those who struggled with the case for more than six months after the December 1981 argument. For politicians whose priority is kicking noncitizens out of the country, the decision — which acknowledged that the children might be deportable but assumed that many would not be deported — is beside the point. After all, the prospect that the current motivated and patriotic generation of young immigrants might contribute “in even the smallest way” to the country’s future is irrelevant to Trump supporters who, led by Attorney General Sessions, cheered the termination of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has enabled more than 800,000 of these young people to stay in school and begin careers. Plyler v. Doe may be irrelevant in a strictly legal sense, but there are strong reasons to resurrect its memory and ponder it today. At the simplest level, it’s clear that during the current anti-immigrant spasm, at least several states would have thrown undocumented children out of school but for Plyler. For example, Alabama’s H.B. 56, enacted in 2011, requires school districts to collect data on the citizenship status of each child; while the law couldn’t go further, it has driven a number of undocumented children out of school and their families out of the state. The case reached the Supreme Court during President Ronald Reagan’s first year in office. It presented the new administration with an acute dilemma and leaves us with a fascinating back story, one with obvious resonance with the Trump administration’s vigorous effort to undo the Obama administration’s legal legacy. "
439,"“The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” PRESIDENT TRUMP, in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly. "
440,"The United Nations isn’t the venue one would expect for threatening war. Yet that’s what President Trump did in his first address to the General Assembly. Mr. Trump’s performance had echoes of President George W. Bush’s infamous “axis of evil” demonizing of Iran, North Korea and Iraq in 2002. This time, Iraq was spared, having disappeared from Mr. Trump’s enemies list. Iran came across as “reckless,” savage and not to be trusted despite an Obama-era agreement to halt Iran’s nuclear weapons program. North Korea was even more clearly in the president’s cross hairs. He warned that he would “totally destroy North Korea” to defend the United States and its allies, and he again disparaged North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man.” He said Mr. Kim was on a “suicide mission for himself and for his regime.” In all this fury, before a world body whose main purpose is the peaceful resolution of disputes, there was hardly a hint of compromise or interest in negotiations. It’s a telling contrast to President Barack Obama’s approach to many of the same problems in the same setting in 2009. Mr. Obama warned the General Assembly that “North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope” and must be “held accountable” if “they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability.” But he also said he respected “their rights as members of the community of nations” and was “committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations.” Like Mr. Obama, other presidents have used this setting to talk sternly to adversaries and exhort the world body to do more to confront international challenges. Mr. Trump’s dark tone and focus seemed a significant deviation, not least his relentlessly bellicose approach to North Korea. “No one,” he said, “has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.” Iran fared little better under Mr. Trump’s withering assessment. “It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime, one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room,” he said of the Shiite-led government in Tehran. He called the 2015 Iran nuclear deal “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into” and gave a clear signal that he means to back out of it, despite strong evidence that Iran is complying with the terms. "
441,"In the midst of the general abnormality of Donald Trump’s presidency, the speedy and frictionless rehabilitation of Sean Spicer in recent days was curiously predictable. In the past week, the once-disgraced White House press secretary has made a sudden and jolly re-emergence: an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” a fellowship at Harvard and, at the Emmy Awards, a self-parody of his demonstrably false claim that Trump’s inaugural crowds were bigger than Barack Obama’s. “This will be the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period — both in person and around the world,” Spicer insisted in a perfect sendup of his most famous lie. Laughter ensued. Nicely played, Spicey: The first thing they teach in flack school is that self-deprecation is key to any image rehab. And so is the earnest concession of remorse, which Spicer dispatched a few hours later, after the after-parties (when asked by The Times this week if he regretted criticizing reporters who accurately reported the inaugural crowd size, he replied, “Of course I do, absolutely”), pivoting away from the defiance shtick he previously served up to Trump’s base (“I have no regrets,” Spicer told Sean Hannity after quitting his job in July). You could, of course, make yourself dizzy with the quadruple back flip of parody, self-parody, self-self-parody and meta-parody at work here. Is this an instance of the New Normal Trump merging with the Old Normal Swamp to form an even more breathtaking Mega-Swamp? Regardless, Spicer’s breezy rematriculation into polite society has had a scripted quality to it — as has the immediate backlash from the left, journalists and various unamused sectors of Twitter railing against the “normalizing” forces of Kimmel, Harvard and all those Spicey-swarming selfie-seekers at the Emmys. Nonetheless, Spicer’s trajectory is more nuanced than some of the more burlesque examples of Trump-derived celebrity (to wit: Anthony Scaramucci, who, Buzzfeed reported over the weekend, might be considering a run for president. Because of course the Mooch might run for president). Spicer held the White House’s so-called podium job — a high-pressure duty that carries a certain gravitas and profile, especially after President Bill Clinton’s spokesman Mike McCurry began allowing cameras into the daily White House briefings (a decision he later said he regretted). The explosion of cable-news coverage, and with it the advent of partisan celebrity and remaking of politics as entertainment, has pretty much guaranteed lucrative post-White House employment for podium alumni. There are talking-head slots, book contracts and paid speaking gigs — provided, that is, that the press secretaries stay on the job for a respectable period of time and don’t embarrass themselves too badly. That’s where Spicer has become a special case. Even when he held the job, speculation abounded about what might await him when he tried to “monetize his public service,” Swampese for cashing out. Would the same rules apply to someone who broke so many tacit rules? Would someone who did so many things deemed beyond the pale enjoy a seamless return to the pale? And would the same rich pastry tray of potential next acts be laid out for a guy who was caught in so many lies, who once asserted out of nowhere that Hitler never used chemical weapons, who was serially humiliated by his boss and subjected to an evisceration for the ages by Melissa McCarthy on “Saturday Night Live”? But Spicer, for all his professional sins, achieved something far more pertinent to the current environment: In the space of barely half a year, he became the most famous White House press secretary in history, hands down. After a while, the celebrity itself becomes the thing. Spicer’s embattled narrative became its own subplot in the greater Trump reality show. How long could he last? How much could he take? How low would he go? People tuned in to watch his briefings in record numbers. "
442,"WASHINGTON — Eleven governors, including five Republicans and a pivotal Alaskan independent, urged the Senate on Tuesday to reject a last-ditch push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. But Republican leaders pressed toward a showdown vote. And they choked off separate bipartisan efforts to shore up health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act, hoping to give Republican senators no alternative but to vote for repeal. The latest repeal bill, drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, would undo much of the Affordable Care Act and send tens of billions of federal dollars to the states with vast discretion over how to spend the money. This is the choice for America, Mr. Graham said on Tuesday: “Socialism or federalism when it comes to your health care.” Yet some governors, the supposed beneficiaries of that federalism, were decidedly cool to the proposal. New Hampshire’s Republican governor, Chris Sununu, had criticized the proposal on Monday. But it was the opposition of Alaska’s governor, Bill Walker, that might prove most important. He increased pressure on Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, to cast what could be a deciding vote to kill the repeal effort, just as she voted against the last repeal bill in July. Republican leaders appeared determined to thwart any alternative ahead of a possible showdown vote next week. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, announced Tuesday that he and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, would not come forward with the “limited, bipartisan plan to stabilize 2018 premiums” in the individual health insurance market that they had been working toward.

443,"Jeffrey Mezger, the chief executive of KB Home, one of the country’s largest homebuilders, was captured on audio Saturday night yelling at his neighbor, the comedian Kathy Griffin, using a series of sexist and homophobic slurs. The string of crude comments prompted an immediate backlash against Mr. Mezger, whose company is the sixth-largest publicly traded homebuilder in the country, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Criticism quickly followed the publication of Mr. Mezger’s recorded rant on Tuesday. Suze Orman, the former CNBC host, expressed disgust at the idea of buying a property from KB Home. “You really want to buy a home from this man?” she wrote on Twitter. “Beyond Disgusting!” The episode was apparently the culmination of a series of disputes involving Mr. Mezger, Ms. Griffin and Ms. Griffin’s boyfriend, Randy Bick, who are neighbors in an exclusive gated community in the upscale Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles. The couple called the police on Saturday night to complain of noise coming from Mr. Mezger’s backyard, according to HuffPost, which published the recording. Mr. Mezger’s tirade, which was recorded by security cameras at Ms. Griffin’s home, began once officers arrived. "
444,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, abandoning a key fiscal doctrine, agreed on Tuesday to move forward on a budget that would add to the federal deficit in order to pave the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years. The Republican lawmakers, under mounting pressure to score a legislative win on taxes, say a tax cut of this magnitude will stimulate economic growth enough to offset any deficit impact. Yet critics say a deficit-financed tax cut is at odds with longstanding Republican calls for fiscal discipline, including that tax cuts not add to the ballooning federal deficit. The federal debt topped $20 trillion earlier this month and is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who considers himself a strict deficit hawk, said he remains deeply concerned about enacting tax cuts that add to the deficit. But he suggested that Republicans may not solely rely on traditional estimates of a bill’s costs. Republicans have recently voiced concern that some estimates, including those from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office, undervalue the effect of economic growth. In announcing the agreement, Mr. Corker insisted that he was not casting away his concern about the debt. “My support will be contingent on a final package that generates significant economic growth and does not worsen, but hopefully improves our fiscal situation,” Mr. Corker said of the tax plan.

446,"For more than a decade, the Clinton Global Initiative was the star-studded marquee attraction during the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, a place where heads of state, celebrities, billionaire philanthropists and business people mingled, made deals and gave away millions, sometimes billions, of dollars. But after Bill and Hillary Clinton announced the end of their signature conference during last year’s presidential campaign, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and billionaire, has stepped unto the breach. On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg will host a reorganized and rebranded Bloomberg Global Business Forum at the Plaza Hotel, drawing a high-powered crowd and speakers from Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, to President Emmanuel Macron of France. In a symbolic passing of the guard, Mr. Clinton will be the first speaker on the day’s agenda almost exactly a year after he urged attendees “you have to keep this alive” in a farewell address at the last Clinton Global Initiative. “He doesn’t just happen to be the first speaker,” said Kevin Sheekey, one of Mr. Bloomberg’s top advisers and a key organizer of the event. “There is a bit of a handoff.” A generational baton-passing this is not. Mr. Clinton is 71. Mr. Bloomberg is 75. But the event will still represent a marked shift. The festivities around the Clinton Global Initiative, which ran from 2005 through 2016, were fueled by the star power of one past president and a potential future one. The Clintons raised millions to underwrite the event, sometimes stirring accusations of pay-to-play along the way. Mr. Bloomberg is paying for the forum himself through his philanthropy. "
447,"Joyce Matz, a publicist who tenaciously represented civic groups seeking to preserve New York City landmarks like St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church, Lever House and the Town Hall, and to fend off developers like Donald J. Trump, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92. The cause was a stroke, her daughter Suzanne said. Ms. Matz, whose passion for architecture began decades ago with a magazine article she read about the precarious condition of Venice, devoted herself to preservationist causes big and small. Less than two years ago, she was pushing her walker over jagged East Harlem sidewalks as she accompanied a reporter on a tour of Our Lady Queen of Angels Roman Catholic Church on East 113th Street, which the Archdiocese of New York had closed in 2007 and which she was still seeking to spare from demolition. Its fate remains uncertain. In the 1980s, Ms. Matz was chairwoman of the landmarks committee of Community Board 5, which encompasses much of Midtown Manhattan. But she exercised even more influence as a spokeswoman for coalitions, often led by others, to prevent the demolition of a favorite building that had historic value or provided affordable housing, and to wring an extra amenity for a neighborhood from property owners who sought approval for a proposed office building or residential development. “Witty and charming, plus an indefatigable fighter for neighborhoods, Joyce knew everyone,” Andrew Scott Dolkart, a professor of historic preservation at Columbia University, wrote in an email, “and used her knowledge and connections to fight for what she believed.” Jennifer Raab, a former chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and now the president of Hunter College, called Ms. Matz “a persistent watchdog with a laser focus on New York City’s architectural gems.” "

Here’s what you need to know: • “If the righteous many don’t confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph.” In a bellicose speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, referred to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man,” denounced the Iran nuclear agreement and promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East. He thanked Russia and China for supporting recent U.N. sanctions on North Korea, but also indirectly criticized them, calling it “an outrage” that “some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world.” Here are the highlights of the opening day of speeches. Leaders from Japan and Myanmar speak today; South Korea, Russia, China and Indonesia tomorrow; Australia on Friday; and the Philippines and Singapore on Saturday. _____ "
451,"Last September, Patrik Hermansson, a 25-year-old graduate student from Sweden, went undercover in the world of the extreme right. Posing as a student writing a thesis about the suppression of right-wing speech, he traveled from London to New York to Charlottesville, Va. — and into the heart of a dangerous movement that is experiencing a profound rejuvenation. Mr. Hermansson, who was sent undercover by the British anti-racist watchdog group Hope Not Hate, spent months insinuating himself into the alt-right, using his Swedish nationality (many neo-Nazis are obsessed with Sweden because of its “Nordic” heritage) as a way in. It wasn’t always easy. “You want to punch them in the face,” he told me of the people he met undercover. “You want to scream and do whatever — leave. But you can’t do any of those things. You have to sit and smile.” What he learned while undercover is one part of a shocking, comprehensive new report from Hope Not Hate that sheds light on the strange landscape of the alt-right, the much discussed, little understood and largely anonymous far-right movement that exists mostly online and that has come to national attention in part because of its support for Donald Trump. As a result of the growing influence of the far-right social-media ecosystem, once-moribund hate groups in both the United States and Europe — groups that mostly existed long before “alt-right” entered the vernacular — are enjoying a striking uptick in recruitment. This latest wave of potential members is young — teenage and 20-something men (they’re mostly men) appear to be exhibiting interest in far-right ideas in numbers that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. These young men are being radicalized largely through the work of a popular group of new far-right internet personalities whose videos, blog posts and tweets have been consistently nudging the boundaries of acceptable conversation to the right — one of the explicit goals of racist extremists everywhere. And while “globalist” may be one of the alt-right’s favorite slurs, Hope Not Hate conclusively shows that the alt-right is itself now a global movement with regular interaction among far-right figures from Scotland to Sweden to Seattle.

452,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to prop up the American economy after the 2008 financial crisis, is finally ready to take away the crutches. The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will gradually reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of United States Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, a move that would amount to a vote of confidence that the economy’s slow-but-steady growth is likely to continue. The Fed, concerned about the reaction in financial markets, has tried to eliminate any suspense by publishing a detailed schedule and promising to move very slowly. But just as the Fed’s bond purchases after the 2008 crisis were unprecedented, the retreat will again take the reserve banking system into uncharted territory. No one can be certain what will happen. “What the Fed is going to do this week will not surprise anyone,” said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities. “And the models predict a slow and smooth adjustment. But there is always a risk of more volatility.” Two large and related questions also remain unanswered. The Fed has not said how large it would like its balance sheet to be, so there is no finish line for the retreat. Also, there is a good chance the Fed’s current leadership will not complete the journey. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, ends a four-year term in early February, and President Trump has not announced whether he plans to nominate her for a second term. The Fed responded to the crisis that began a decade ago by cutting its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero, and by vacuuming up huge quantities of bonds. Both measures were designed to revive economic activity by reducing borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to car loans. "
453,"Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, has been far from silent since being ousted from his job in March. He is writing a book, regularly muses on politics and legal matters to his 438,000 followers on Twitter, and just started a podcast. (First episode: “That Time President Trump Fired Me.”) Now the media-savvy former federal prosecutor is leaping into a new realm: cable news. CNN has signed Mr. Bharara as a senior legal analyst, meaning he will be a frequent presence on the network’s programming, the network said on Wednesday. The arrangement allows Mr. Bharara — already a fixture in political and media circles in New York — to expand his audience into millions of living rooms. And CNN will offer a national forum for Mr. Bharara’s at-times blistering critiques of the Trump administration on a network that — the president’s criticism of it notwithstanding — is regarded as less partisan than cable competitors like Fox News and MSNBC. Rumors that Mr. Bharara may be considering a political career have also persisted, and his decision to take a role at CNN is likely to reignite speculation about his plans. He is not the only Trump critic whom CNN is adding to its lineup: Walter M. Shaub Jr., who resigned as director of the Office of Government Ethics in July and has called the Trump administration’s approach to ethics “close to a laughingstock,” is also joining as a contributor, the network said. The appointments were first reported by Politico. Mr. Bharara is no stranger to television, and his appearances in recent months seemed intended to showcase his versatility on the air. In June, he sat with George Stephanopoulos to offer a sober assessment of the Trump administration for ABC’s Sunday morning show “This Week.” Later in the month, he appeared on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” for an extended segment with the show’s wisecracking correspondent Hasan Minhaj.

454,"Karen Leibowitz and Anthony Myint opened the Perennial in San Francisco last year with a clear mission in mind: Run an environmentally friendly restaurant with a minimal carbon footprint, and inspire other restaurateurs to do the same. As President Trump has questioned the existence of climate change, Ms. Leibowitz and Mr. Myint have emerged as activists, at the forefront of a growing movement of chefs who not only recognize and measure the impact of their industry on the planet, but also look for new ways to undo the damage. Mr. Myint and Ms. Leibowitz, who are married, have been immersed for the last few years in the research that directs every decision at the restaurant, like choosing the kitchen’s energy-efficient equipment and its raw ingredients, many of which are grown in ways that can regenerate the soil. Mr. Myint has filled in when needed as a line cook, but he will take over the kitchen at the end of September when the chef, Chris Kiyuna, leaves. Mr. Kiyuna said he plans to take a short break from the industry. Beginning on Oct. 1, Mr. Myint will share the role of chef with Michael Andreatta, who cooked at Commonwealth, a restaurant co-owned by Mr. Myint that donates a portion of its monthly revenue to local nonprofits. The Perennial will continue to promote sustainability through composting and using perennial grains and grass-fed beef. But the menu will change. "

456,"WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, spent tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars to fly on private jets to attend routine public events instead of taking cheaper commercial airliners because he has an “incredibly demanding schedule,” his spokeswoman said Wednesday. Mr. Price, a physician and former Republican congressman from Georgia, chartered five work-related flights last week alone. In all, the private flights cost the federal government as much as $60,000, according to a report by Politico, citing internal department documents. The secretary has advocated cost-cutting at his agency while acting as a top Trump administration surrogate for urging the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. His predecessors often traveled by commercial flights or on trains, at a fraction of the cost. Mr. Price’s travels included a flight to a Maine resort, for a health care conference, and a short day trip to the Philadelphia area that would typically cost under $500 by rail or commercial airliner. “With an incredibly demanding schedule full of 13-plus-hour days, every effort is being made to maximize Secretary Price’s ability to travel outside of Washington to meet with the American people,” the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, Charmaine Yoest, wrote in a statement emailed to reporters. “The travel department continues to check every possible source for travel needs, including commercial, but commercial travel is not always feasible,” she wrote. Mr. Price’s travel was reviewed by legal counsel and was approved to accommodate his tight schedule, she added. Democrats pointed out that previous secretaries flew on commercial airlines, even while dealing with grueling travel schedules, including to generate public support for passage of the Affordable Care Act under the Obama administration, or adoption of prescription drug benefits under former President George W. Bush. Several Democrats called for the Health and Human Services Department’s inspector general to investigate Mr. Price’s actions. In a letter on Wednesday to the inspector general, Daniel R. Levinson, five senior Democrats in the House and Senate noted that federal regulations generally allow travel on government aircraft — and chartered flights — only when it is “the most cost-effective mode” of transportation available. That was not the case with Mr. Price’s flights, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said separately. “There were regular, scheduled flights to these locations at the times he was traveling,” said Mr. Blumenthal, a former state attorney general. “His predecessors flew commercial, and he certainly seems no busier than they were, and certainly no more deserving of special treatment.” “I think these practices are potentially improper and perhaps illegal and should be investigated by the inspector general,” Mr. Blumenthal said. "
457,"If, as a public official, your best solution to a complicated problem is to build a wall, the odds are pretty good you’ll eventually smack into one. A wall was the thousand-mile backdrop to Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. But as we’ve seen over the past few weeks, with the president declaring and then undeclaring his intention to end the DACA program, the realities of immigration reform are complicated. They correspond little to the anxieties of the public imagination. Realities seldom do. DACA protects roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and have lived here continuously since June 15, 2007. Were they to be deported, many would go back to countries they have never really known as home. Ernesto and Raúl Flores, the identical-twin protagonists of Lauren Markham’s “The Far Away Brothers: Two Young Migrants and the Making of an American Life,” are not covered by DACA. They arrived in this country too late, in 2013. Technically, they did have a home to go back to, because their parents still lived in El Salvador. But danger had driven the boys away. Their town, like all of El Salvador, was bursting with gangs. They were so desperate to escape that they made the journey to the United States on their own. (Markham has changed their names to protect them.) “In the Northern Triangle — Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — a ‘better life,’ for many, means a life where they are not afraid of being killed,” Markham explains. In 2013, 93 percent of unaccompanied minors in the United States — or “unaccompanied alien children,” in the chilly parlance of the law — came from those three countries. “The Far Away Brothers” is impeccably timed, intimately reported and beautifully expressed. Markham brings people and places to rumbling life; she has that rare ability to recreate elusive, subjective experiences — whether they’re scenes she never witnessed or her characters’ interior psychological states — without taking undue liberties. In many ways, her book is reminiscent of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc’s “Random Family.” It’s about teenagers who raise themselves. They pine for support. They’re traumatized in ways they can barely articulate. "
458,"UNITED NATIONS — President Trump’s bombastic attacks on Iran over the nuclear deal may have created an unanticipated outcome: sympathy for the Iranian government. Disarmament advocates and other critics of Mr. Trump’s approach to Iran say that while his threats to renounce the accord may sit well with conservative allies, they also risk damaging the credibility of the United States. Some say the contrast between Mr. Trump’s belligerent-sounding General Assembly speech on Tuesday, and the more measured address by President Hassan Rouhani of Iran on Wednesday, had helped give Iran an unexpected edge: the image of reasonableness in the face of an adversary’s angry ranting. “The bombast makes Trump look like a predator, circling,” said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington who has followed the ups and downs of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. “That creates sympathy for Iran among the international community,” Mr. Kupchan said. “It’s especially dangerous because Iran is very skilled at playing the victim, aggrieved by foreign powers for decades.” Mr. Trump, he said, “is playing against a pro here in dealing with it.” The International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear-monitoring arm of the United Nations, has repeatedly found Iran in compliance with the agreement, which eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for its verifiable guarantees of peaceful nuclear work. "
459,"WASHINGTON — Nearly all of President Trump’s top national security officials have been the target of his ire, whether it was privately dressing down his attorney general, publicly disagreeing with his top diplomat or musing about exiling his national security adviser to Afghanistan. But not Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Eight months into the job, Mr. Mattis has exhibited a political deftness that has eluded other members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet. None has managed to steer a path so different from the president’s without incurring his wrath and while deflecting attention over apparent or genuine splits. Where Mr. Trump threatened in a bombastic United Nations speech on Tuesday to “destroy” North Korea, Mr. Mattis emphasized that the issue should be resolved “through diplomatic means.” On Mr. Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military, Mr. Mattis has said little publicly but put the question on ice by announcing a monthslong study of it. And one day after his boss brandished the word “sovereignty” in that United Nations address, Mr. Mattis spoke repeatedly of the need for the United States to consult its partners. “Nations with allies thrive, and those without allies decline — it’s that simple,” Mr. Mattis told airmen assembled before him at a conference outside Washington on Wednesday. “We must be willing to do more than to listen to our allies. We must be willing to be persuaded by them.” He added, pointedly, “Not all the good ideas come from the nation with the most aircraft carriers.” All of this has earned him not so much as a stray tweet from the president. "
460,"Before the Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn pledged to spend $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin, the company made a similar promise in Brazil. At a news conference in Brazil, Foxconn officials unveiled plans to invest billions of dollars and build one of the world’s biggest manufacturing hubs in the state of São Paulo. The government had high expectations that the project would yield 100,000 jobs. Six years later, Brazil is still waiting for most of those jobs to materialize. “The area where Foxconn said it would build a plant is totally abandoned,” said Guilherme Gazzola, the mayor of Itu, one of the cities that hoped to benefit from the project. “They haven’t even expressed an interest in meeting us.” Foxconn’s experience in Brazil and other parts of the world illustrates how difficult it has been for it to replicate its enormously successful Chinese manufacturing model elsewhere. In China, Foxconn has built vast factories backed by large government subsidies. Its operations — assembling iPhones for Apple, Kindles for Amazon and PlayStations for Sony — employ legions of young assembly-line workers who often toil 60 hours a week for about $2.50 an hour. Labor protests in China are rare, or quashed swiftly. "
461,"Pakistan’s new leader, stung by President Trump’s threat to crack down on his country for harboring terrorists, insisted on Wednesday that Pakistani military forces had uprooted all the sanctuaries used by Islamic extremists along its rugged frontier with Afghanistan. “We have regained control of the area,” the prime minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, said in an interview with The New York Times. “There are no sanctuaries anymore. There are none at all. I can categorically state that.” The prime minister’s blanket denial of Pakistan’s role as a safe haven could augur a turbulent period in its relations with the United States. The success of Mr. Trump’s new strategy for Afghanistan depends on Pakistan playing a more constructive role by depriving militants of the ability to plot and carry out attacks from across the Pakistani border. “This is a new context,” said President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, in a separate interview with The Times. “It provides a new context for Pakistan to seize the opportunity for engagement.” If the Pakistanis did not do more, he said, “there will be consequences.” But Mr. Abbasi’s claim, during his first visit to the United Nations General Assembly, suggested a familiar chasm between how Pakistani and American officials view Pakistan’s responsibility for destabilizing Afghanistan. He also denied that Pakistan possesses tactical nuclear weapons — a statement that runs counter to American intelligence assessments. In the closing days of the Obama administration, the United States negotiated with Mr. Abbasi’s predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, to try to persuade Pakistan not to deploy these weapons, which American officials said are designed for use on the battlefield against an invading Indian army, and were therefore more at risk of falling into the wrong hands.

462,"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Read the latest with Thursday’s live updates on Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to make a direct hit on Puerto Rico in almost a century, ravaged the island on Wednesday, knocking out all electricity, deluging towns with flashfloods and mudslides and compounding the already considerable pain of residents here. Less than two weeks ago, Hurricane Irma dealt the island a glancing blow, killing at least three people and leaving nearly 70 percent of households without power. This storm, which made landfall at 6 a.m. as a Category 4 hurricane, took out the island’s entire power grid, and only added to the woes of a commonwealth that has been groaning under the weight of an extended debt and bankruptcy crisis. Beyond the immediate damage from winds up to 155 miles per hour, continuous rain flooded coastal communities as well as neighborhoods in the central, mountainous areas of the island, which is full of rivers and streams. One person was reported dead, though the power failure has largely cut off communication with some of the worst-hit areas. Residents woke Wednesday to the clamor of strengthening wind gusts, with the memory of Hurricane Irma still fresh. By afternoon, the whole island had lost electricity. “There has been nothing like this,” said Ramón Lopez, a military veteran who was holding back tears outside his neighborhood in Guaynabo, on the northern coast near San Juan, the capital. “It was the fury. It didn’t stop.” "
463,"WASHINGTON — The health insurance industry, after cautiously watching Republican health care efforts for months, came out forcefully on Wednesday against the Senate’s latest bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, suggesting that its state-by-state block grants could create health care chaos in the short term and a Balkanized, uncertain insurance market. In the face of the industry opposition, Senate Republican leaders nevertheless said they would push for a showdown vote next week on the legislation, drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. That puts Republican senators in a squeeze, especially those whose states would lose money under a complicated formula in the bill. Generally, it would shift federal funds away from states that have been successful in expanding coverage to states where Republican leaders refused to expand Medicaid or encourage enrollment. Republican senators from Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Ohio and West Virginia will all have to decide whether to heed the pleas of consumers who like the current health law — or yield to the will of Republican leaders, donors and voters who demand an end to the Affordable Care Act. That has put the spotlight not only on the three Republicans who killed the repeal drive in July — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine — but also on those who have been reluctantly supportive, such as Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Rob Portman of Ohio. Senate Republicans are already under pressure from 11 governors — including five fellow Republicans and a pivotal Alaskan independent — who this week urged the Senate to reject the last-ditch repeal effort.

Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump made a bellicose debut speech at the United Nations, threatening to “totally destroy” North Korea and referring to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man.” He called the Iran nuclear deal “an embarrassment,” promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East and said the U.S. was prepared to confront Venezuela’s authoritarian government. (Here’s the video.) Our White House correspondent noted a dissonance between Mr. Trump’s vision of renewed sovereignty of the nation state and his threats to act aggressively against some countries. _____ "

The death toll in the Mexican earthquake rose to more than 200, including at least 30 children who died in a school collapse in the capital. It’s expected to climb higher. There was heartbreak, but also moments of joy, at the school as desperate parents searched for their children. There and elsewhere, neighbors rushed to heavily damaged areas to help. Above, a scene in Mexico City. This video shows the terrifying moments as the earth shook, and the aftermath. We mapped the damage and explained why Mexico has so many earthquakes.

466,"President Trump is seeking to revisit the nuclear agreement with Iran to toughen its provisions rather than scrap it right away as he has threatened, enlisting allies to pressure Tehran to return to the negotiating table, administration officials said Wednesday. Mr. Trump, who denounced the agreement in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly this week as an “embarrassment to the United States,” wants to expand on it by extending its time frame and imposing new limits on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles. Although European officials strongly back the current deal, some signaled openness to negotiating a separate follow-up agreement. The maneuvering suggested a possible path forward for Mr. Trump short of abandoning the accord, but it remains uncertain whether he can reach consensus with the European allies, much less with Russia and China, the deal’s other patrons. Iran on Wednesday ruled out revisiting the agreement as President Hassan Rouhani declared it a “closed issue” and warned that if the United States pulled out, Iran might resume uranium enrichment. “We see today the Americans are seeking an excuse to break this agreement,” Mr. Rouhani said at a news conference after his own speech to the General Assembly. For that reason, he said, negotiating with “an American government that tramples on a legal agreement would be a waste of time.” The accord, reached in 2015, required Iran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Under United States law, Mr. Trump has until Oct. 15 to certify whether Iran is complying and the deal remains vital to America’s national security. While he has done so twice since taking office, he has signaled that he will refuse to do so again. That by itself would not abrogate the deal, but would give Congress 60 days to reimpose sanctions on Iran, an action that would mean an end to the agreement, at least for the United States. Mr. Trump may see decertification, or the threat of it, as leverage to press Iran and the other powers to restart talks. He could offer to certify for another 90 days if other parties agreed to explore new negotiations. "
467,"When Penny Mae Cormani died in Utah, her family sang Mormon hymns — “Be Still My Soul” — and lowered her small coffin into the earth. The latest victim of a drug epidemic that is now taking 60,000 lives a year, Penny was just 1. Increasingly, parents and the police are encountering toddlers and young children unconscious or dead after consuming an adult’s opioids. At the children’s hospital in Dayton, Ohio, accidental ingestions have more than doubled, to some 200 intoxications a year, with tiny bodies found laced by drugs like fentanyl. In Milwaukee, eight children have died of opioid poisoning since late 2015, all from legal substances like methadone and oxycodone. In Salt Lake City, one emergency doctor recently revived four overdosing toddlers in a night, a phenomenon she called both new and alarming. “It’s a cancer,” said Mauria Leydsman, Penny’s grandmother, of the nation’s opioid problem, “with tendrils that are going everywhere.” While these deaths represent a small fraction of the epidemic’s toll, they are an indication of how deeply the American addiction crisis has cut. And communities from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains and beyond are feeling its effects at all ages. In August, in the latest sign of the direness of the situation, President Trump said he would declare the opioid crisis a national emergency, a move that could allow cities and states to access federal disaster relief funds. "
468,"President Trump is now fully engaged in two nuclear confrontations, one with Iran over a nuclear accord he finds an “embarrassment” and the other with North Korea that is forcing the Pentagon to contemplate for the first time in decades what a resumption of the Korean War might look like. The dynamics of those cases are entirely different, but they are also oddly interdependent. If Mr. Trump makes good on his threat to pull out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, how will he then convince the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that America will honor the commitment to integrate North Korea into the world community if only it disarms — the demand Mr. Trump made from the podium of the United Nations. The fiercest defenders of the Iran deal argue that Mr. Trump’s team has not thought about how his threats to Tehran resonate 4,000 miles away in Pyongyang, especially since Iran has held up its end of the agreement. “If the president pulls back on the Iran deal, given Iranian compliance” with its terms, said Wendy R. Sherman, the chief negotiator of the accord, “it will make diplomacy on North Korea almost impossible because U.S. credibility will be shot.” Presumably, the United States would have to make some concessions to North Korea in return for limits on its nuclear program. But why negotiate with the United States if this president or the next one can just throw out any agreement? Mr. Trump’s aides see the problem and in an entirely different way. The lesson that the North Koreans would take away from the Iran deal, they say, is that the United States can be rolled. The Iran deal is not a permanent solution to the Iranian nuclear problem, they argue, but just a temporary fix. After 15 years, many of the limits on the production of nuclear material will be lifted, even if inspection requirements remain. "
469,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The San Francisco Bay Area is often trotted out as the worst example of the state’s housing crisis — understandably. By national standards, rents and home prices there are astronomical. But the pain in California is widespread. According to a new poll from U.C. Berkeley, a majority of residents in every major region of the state — including the Central Valley and other parts of Northern California — have considered moving as a result of housing pressures. “It’s spread across the state pretty evenly,” said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies Poll. The survey was based on interviews with 1,200 California voters in August and September. All told, roughly 56 percent of California respondents in the poll said rising housing costs had led them to consider moving. In the Central Valley, the figure was 52 percent, equivalent to the Bay Area. "
470,"BERLIN — Compared with Donald Trump’s victory, the Brexit vote or even Marine Le Pen’s presidential bid in France, the results of Germany’s Sept. 24 election will be reassuringly boring. Chancellor Angela Merkel looks poised to continue her 12-year tenure. In the latest polls, her center-right Christian Democratic Union party leads with some 36 percent of the vote — far ahead of its closest challenger, the Social Democrats. The biggest shock is likely to be when Alternative for Germany becomes the first ultranationalist party to enter Germany’s Parliament since the 1950s. This is troubling enough. Alternative for Germany is a party of racists, climate-change deniers and demagogues who believe that Germany should stop atoning for its Nazi past. Its politicians have used slogans like “Germany for the Germans”; one of the party’s posters says: “Burqas? We like bikinis!” With the party getting 8 percent to 12 percent support in polls, the German far right appears far more contained than its counterparts in neighboring Austria, Poland and France. However, to see the full threat of the far right in this election one must look beyond the poll numbers. Germany’s entire political landscape has shifted rightward. Since its founding in 2013, Alternative for Germany has managed to enter 13 of 16 state parliaments. Every major party has lost votes to it. In the state election of Baden-Württemberg in 2016, for example, Alternative for Germany took 190,000 votes from the Christian Democrats, while in Saxony-Anhalt 10 percent of its support came from the left-wing party Die Linke (the Left). Even as Germany has seen a sizable drop in voter turnout in recent decades, the far-right party has managed to mobilize a huge number of previous nonvoters. In an attempt to contain the party, the government and leading opposition parties have appealed to anti-immigrant sentiment, allowing Alternative for Germany’s ideology to insidiously shape German politics and media. This swing was on full display in a televised debate earlier this month when Ms. Merkel faced Martin Schultz, who leads the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, in a televised debate. More than a third of the discussion was dedicated to immigration — more specifically to the problems with it. "
471,"“You are a member of the K.K.K.,” the fifth-grade homework assignment read. “Why do you think your treatment of African-Americans is justified?” The work sheet, given on Thursday as part of a lesson on the Reconstruction period, caused an outcry after one student’s uncle, Tremain Cooper, posted a photo of the assignment on Facebook. “This is my little 10-year-old nephew’s homework assignment today,” he wrote. “He’s home crying right now.” Mr. Cooper identified the teacher as Kerri Roberts of Oak Pointe Elementary School in Irmo, S.C., a suburb of Columbia, and added, “How can she ask a 5th grader to justify the actions of the KKK???” Reached by phone, Ms. Roberts’s husband said she was unavailable and was “not going to comment on anything.” "
472,"SYDNEY, Australia — The first group of refugees from Australia’s offshore detention centers is expected to leave for the United States “in the coming weeks,” Australia’s prime minister announced Wednesday. In a video shared on social media, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull thanked President Trump for honoring a deal reached by the Obama administration, which Mr. Trump had criticized, in which the United States agreed to accept hundreds of refugees from the centers, one on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and one on Nauru, an island nation to the east. “Around 50 refugees from P.N.G. and Nauru will be accepted in this first group, and they’ll be notified in coming days,” Mr. Turnbull said on Wednesday. “Vetting and processing by the United States will continue, and further decisions by U.S. authorities in respect of others are expected in due course.” An official with the State Department confirmed that 54 approved refugees would be notified in the coming days and travel to the United States in the coming weeks. Little is known about the group, but the official said that the refugees were similar in makeup to other groups that country admits for resettlement. Asylum seekers who tried to reach Australia by boat were sent to the detention centers while their refugee claims were considered. Many have been waiting for years, often in harsh conditions. Australia has been harshly criticized for its offshore detention program, which has cost its government billions of dollars. The Australian government has committed to closing the Manus detention center by Oct. 31, after Papua New Guinea’s Supreme Court found it to be unlawful, but it has said that its Nauru center would remain open indefinitely. The United Nations has repeatedly condemned Australia’s detention program, labeling it “dire and untenable.” "
473,"SEOUL, South Korea — When President Moon Jae-in of South Korea sits down with President Trump and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in New York on Thursday, he will be meeting two of his strongest allies in pressuring North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. But Mr. Moon will also find himself a bit of the odd man out. As the three leaders prepared for their trilateral summit meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting this week, the White House has struck an increasingly bellicose tone toward North Korea. Mr. Trump, addressing the General Assembly on Tuesday, said the United States would “totally destroy North Korea” if necessary. On Wednesday, Mr. Abe defended the Trump administration’s approach, telling the General Assembly that for North Korea, “dialogue was the best means of deceiving us and buying time.” Like Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe, Mr. Moon strongly advocates imposing sanctions and pressure on North Korea. But unlike them, he has repeatedly and categorically ruled out military action. “President Moon appears isolated from the other two,” said Lee Won-deog, an expert on Korean-Japan relations at Kookmin University in Seoul. “There is a suspicion that Prime Minister Abe is using his close personal chemistry with President Trump to help shape the American leader’s views on South Korea.” During his presidential campaign, Mr. Moon promised to seek dialogue with North Korea, insisting that sanctions alone would not persuade it to give up its nuclear missile program. "
474,"Updated, 9:27 a.m. Good morning on this watery Wednesday. Hurricane Jose weakened to a tropical storm this morning, but it could still bring rain during the morning commute and whip up strong winds during the day. New York City was spared a direct hit by Jose, but the storm flooded areas from New Jersey to Long Island. With more extreme weather events predicted for New York City and the surrounding area, flood insurance might be on your mind. We spoke to Emily Rogan, the chief operating officer for United Policyholders, an advocacy group that helps disaster survivors navigate the insurance claim process, about the basics of buying a flood insurance policy. Who needs flood insurance? Homeowners who live in high-risk areas with federally backed mortgages are required to buy flood insurance. For renters in high-risk areas, or if you know your apartment has flooded in the past, you should consider buying insurance, Ms. Rogan said. (One exception: Apartments below street level are almost never covered by flood insurance for renters.) For homeowners and renters who live outside the high-risk areas, it can be a low-cost expense. You can see if your home is in a flood zone and get an insurance estimate here. "

476,"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Read the latest with Thursday’s live updates on Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico with a one-two punch of high winds and driving rain before beginning its deliberate march toward the Dominican Republic. Early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said the storm had regained “major hurricane status,” upgrading it to Category 3. The center said at 2 a.m. that Maria’s maximum sustained winds had risen to almost 115 miles per hour, and that the storm could get stronger still over the next day or so. It was expected to pass offshore of the Dominican Republic’s northeastern coast early Thursday, before moving near the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday night and Friday. Maria had weakened to Category 2 after taking “quite a hit” from the high mountains of Puerto Rico, where at least one death had been reported. Officials expected the strong winds and storm surge flooding in Puerto Rico to subside by early Thursday, and they canceled its hurricane warning. Heavy rain, however, was expected to continue. In the meantime, the countries already battered by Maria were scrambling on Wednesday to recover. And weather officials said “catastrophic” flash flooding was still occurring on Puerto Rico as of 8 p.m. Wednesday. Electricity was knocked out across all of the island, a spokeswoman for the Puerto Rico State Agency for Emergency and Disaster Management said, and officials said it could take months to fully restore power. The authorities warned weary residents not to let down their guard, because flash flooding and mudslides could prove more deadly than the initial winds from the storm. "

478,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Four months ago, Senator Bill Cassidy went on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and expressed his commitment to a health care bill that would cover all infants, regardless of their ability to pay. Mr. Cassidy called this “the Jimmy Kimmel test.” Now he is leading the effort to pass a bill that does not seem to meet this standard. Mr. Kimmel spent a full seven minutes excoriating Mr. Cassidy, of Louisiana, accusing him of going back on his word. Mr. Kimmel ended by asking Mr. Cassidy to stop referring to the Jimmy Kimmel test, unless he addressed certain key points that Mr. Cassidy had emphasized in his own public statements: coverage for all, no discrimination against patients based on pre-existing conditions, lower premiums and a ban on lifetime coverage caps. Late-night hosts reacted to President Trump’s aggressive speech at the United Nations with a mix of bafflement and amusement. Trevor Noah pointed out the section of Mr. Trump’s speech in which he encouraged the governments of United Nations countries to look after their own interests before those of the rest of the world. “If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations,” Mr. Trump had said. "
479,"Nuclear weapons were the focus as global leaders addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, a day after President Trump vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies. Leaders from around the globe began adding their signatures to a treaty that bans nuclear weapons, although the world’s nine nuclear-armed countries declined to sign it and denounced it as dangerously naïve. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, responding to Mr. Trump’s denunciation of the Iran nuclear deal as “an embarrassment,” defended the agreement in his own remarks to the General Assembly on Wednesday. Mr. Rouhani said the agreement could be “a new model for global interactions.” • Sign up for the Morning Briefing for United Nations news and a regular look at what you need to know to begin your day. Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top foreign official, who led a 90-minute meeting on Wednesday of the parties that negotiated the Iran nuclear agreement, said bluntly afterward that everyone in the room, including the United States, had agreed that Iran was complying with its obligations. She warned of the risks of reopening negotiations, as some Trump administration officials have suggested. She did not answer a question about whether the United States was committed to staying in the accord. "

Sohrab Ahmari in Commentary: Establishment Republicans should rejoice at the president’s speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, writes Mr. Ahmari, and “give credit where it is due.” According to him, the address marks a “return to the G.O.P.’s postwar foreign-policy traditions” and a shedding of the “pinched, narrow nationalism” of hyper-nationalists like the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen or Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist.

He compares the president’s confrontational talk with President George W.

481,"President Trump had international affairs on his mind Tuesday morning. In his speech before the United Nations, he threatened to “totally destroy North Korea.” He lambasted the Iran nuclear deal. And he proclaimed that parts of the world “are going to hell.” But by late Tuesday night, Mr. Trump was focused on other things. He pulled out his iPhone to deliver a 139-character tweet for world consumption: “I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night — the worst ever,” Mr. Trump began. It was really only a matter of time before the president chimed in on the Emmy Awards. Politics dominated the event on Sunday night — both in the types of shows that won and the topic of the host Stephen Colbert’s opening monologue and the winners’ speeches. Mr. Trump has expressed his displeasure with Emmys in years past, calling them rigged and dishonest. And the first minutes of Sunday’s broadcast seemed almost designed to goad the president to respond. Mr. Colbert noted that Mr. Trump was once part of Hollywood. “And we all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump,” Mr. Colbert said in his monologue. “Because he was nominated multiple times for ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ but he never won. Why didn’t you give him an Emmy? I tell you this. If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn’t have run for president. So in a way this is all your fault.” Mr. Colbert added soon after: “What really matters to Donald Trump is ratings. You’ve got to have the big numbers. And I certainly hope we achieved that tonight.” And then in the first surprise of the night, Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, rolled onto the stage behind a lectern like the one immortalized by Melissa McCarthy in her portrayal of him on “Saturday Night Live.” “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” said Mr. Spicer, mocking his similar pronouncement in January about the crowd size at Mr. Trump’s presidential inauguration. It turned out that Mr. Spicer was wrong on both occasions. The Emmys on Sunday were watched by 11.4 million people, according to Nielsen data — about the same as last year, which was the lowest ever. Mr. Trump never won an Emmy for his reality television show, but he got close on Sunday. The actor Alec Baldwin won for his impersonation of the president on “Saturday Night Live.” “I suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,” Mr. Baldwin said. "
482,"To the Editor: Re “Heralding ‘America First’ in Combative U.N. Speech, Trump Airs List of Threats” (front page, Sept. 20): President Trump’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday was self-centered and dangerous for world peace. Under the cover of some beautiful oratory, it was an open attempt to drift the United Nations from the broader avenues of global values to the dark alleys of nationalism. It was heartbreaking to see that our president not only expressed his narrow views but also encouraged others to follow his path. He mentioned the sufferings of Americans caused by the recent hurricanes but did not bother to express any sympathy to the people of Mexico, India, Nepal and Bangladesh who have been facing death and destruction by nature on a much larger scale. There is a lesson for the proponents of “All Lives Matter” in this. He damaged the credibility of the United States government by threatening to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal. How will leaders of the world trust us if they think that every new president will break international agreements? President Trump failed to realize that he was on the global stage addressing the whole world and not appeasing his base in Arizona or Ohio. NASEEM KHAN, LELAND, N.C. To the Editor: Are we Americans suffering from battered nation or Stockholm syndrome? Have we become so inured to the boorish, bombastic blather (with apologies to William Safire), the outright lies and the utter foolishness emanating from President Trump that we shrug off his “crush the loser terrorists” and “Rocket Man” (North Korea’s leader) speech before the United Nations? Oh, that wasn’t too bad, we say, almost relieved; he’s been much worse. We’re like hostages looking for a glimmer of hope. Is this what we are reduced to, accepting buffoonery and childish name-calling from our president as the new norm? How long will this national embarrassment continue? JOHN M. DEDERER
STRATFORD, CONN. To the Editor: It is hard to imagine a more long-suffering, powerless people than the citizens of North Korea. Now, in response to aggression by Kim Jong-un, President Trump is threatening to “totally destroy” that country, with the enormous loss of life such an action would entail. Is this not mass murder of innocent civilians, most of whom would like nothing better than to be free of the appalling regime that rules them? ROBERT W. WALLACE

483,"Anthony D. Weiner, the disgraced former Democratic congressman, has asked not to serve any prison time for his conviction in a sexting case. But his request for probation was “simply inadequate,” federal prosecutors said on Wednesday, adding that “his crime deserves time in prison.” In a sentencing memo, the government asked a judge to give Mr. Weiner, 53, a prison term of 21 to 27 months in a case that enmeshed him in an F.B.I. investigation of Hillary Clinton last year before the presidential election. Mr. Weiner, who is to be sentenced on Monday, could receive up to 10 years in prison on one count of transferring obscene material to a minor, a 15-year-old girl with whom he exchanged lewd texts over several months in early 2016. In asking for leniency, Mr. Weiner’s lawyers argued that although his conduct was inexcusable, he had been remorseful and made “remarkable progress” in therapy over the past year. But the office of Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a memorandum to Judge Denise L. Cote that although Mr. Weiner’s “self-destructive path from United States congressman to felon is indisputably sad, his crime is serious and his demonstrated need for deterrence is real.” In Mr. Weiner’s plea agreement, prosecutors had said a sentence within the range of 21 to 27 months would be “fair and appropriate.” "
484,"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has asked the White House for documents about some of President Trump’s most scrutinized actions since taking office, including the firing of his national security adviser and F.B.I. director, according to White House officials. Mr. Mueller is also interested in an Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump had with Russian officials in which he said the dismissal of the F.B.I. director had relieved “great pressure” on him. The document requests provide the most details to date about the breadth of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, and show that several aspects of his inquiry are focused squarely on Mr. Trump’s behavior in the White House. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s office sent a document to the White House that detailed 13 areas in which investigators are seeking information. Since then, administration lawyers have been scouring White House emails and asking officials whether they have other documents or notes that may pertain to Mr. Mueller’s requests. One of the requests is about a meeting Mr. Trump had in May with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, was fired. That day, Mr. Trump met with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak, along with other Russian officials. The New York Times reported that in the meeting Mr. Trump had said that firing Mr. Comey relieved “great pressure” on him. "
485,"The latest Republican stab at overhauling the Affordable Care Act manages to be both more timid and more sweeping than previous efforts to replace Obamacare. Known as Graham-Cassidy, it was written by a quartet of Republican senators led by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. In the timid sense, the proposal would keep much more of Obamacare’s taxes and spending in place than previous Republican plans this year. Yet Graham-Cassidy makes more sweeping changes by turning money currently used on insurance subsidies and the Medicaid expansion into block grants to states. This change would give states more flexibility to design their own health care systems. The prospects for Graham-Cassidy remain in doubt, but the battle over whether states or the federal government should have more control over health care policy will remain no matter what happens in the coming weeks. There is a strong case for a system that takes a less Washington-centric approach to health care and turns more decisions over to the states. Commentators often bemoan how divided the nation is, pointing to our bitter elections and the toxic nature of political discourse. But the current level of partisan and regional polarization is a natural consequence of a political system that cedes so much power to the federal government. When distant lawmakers and unelected bureaucrats are in a position to make decisions that have enormous implications for the entire nation, the stakes of any decision become much higher. This is especially true when it comes to health care policy, which has the most personal and life-altering effects on individuals and their families. A more flexible system would give states latitude to pursue health care programs that are a better fit for their populations’ ideological sensibilities. And there are practical reasons to think of health care as a state-based issue: Every one has its own demographics, health challenges and other unique characteristics. For instance, median household income is much higher in New Hampshire than in Arkansas; heart disease and obesity are much bigger problems in Mississippi than in Colorado; the opioid epidemic is much worse in West Virginia than in Nebraska. Relatively sparsely populated areas struggle with the closings of rural hospitals, leaving large geographic areas underserved, while urban areas have a high concentration of large hospitals, many of which struggle with overcrowding. "
486,"BEIJING — On the morning he disappeared, the activist Lee Ming-cheh crossed from Macau into mainland China to meet with democracy advocates. It was 177 days later when he reappeared in public, standing in the dock of a courtroom in central China last week, confessing to a conspiracy to subvert the Communist Party by circulating criticism on social media. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Lee’s detainment remain murky, but what has made the case stand out from the many that the Chinese government brings against its critics is that Mr. Lee is not a citizen of China, but rather of Taiwan, the self-governing island over which Beijing claims sovereignty. The proceedings against Mr. Lee, who is expected to be sentenced as soon as this week, punctuated what critics have warned are China’s brazen efforts to extend the reach of its security forces to stifle what it perceives as threats to its power emanating from overseas. In recent months alone, China has sought the extradition of ethnic Uighur students studying overseas in Egypt and carried out the cinematic seizure of a billionaire from a Hong Kong hotel in violation of an agreement that allows the former British colony to run its own affairs. The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, now appears to be a material witness in another politically tinged investigation against the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda. China abruptly surfaced charges of rape against yet another billionaire, Guo Wengui, after he sought political asylum in the United States, where he has been making sensational accusations about the Communist Party’s leadership. Mr. Guo’s case could become a major test for the Trump administration’s relations with Beijing at a time of tensions over North Korea and trade. "
487,"WASHINGTON — As President Trump’s voter integrity commission looks under rocks for possible voter malfeasance, its members might want to examine a presidential nominee awaiting confirmation by the Senate Finance Committee. Documents indicate that Jeffrey Gerrish, the president’s pick to be a deputy United States Trade Representative, moved from Virginia to Maryland last year, but opted in November to vote in the more competitive state of Virginia than his bright blue new home. The Senate Finance Committee, which has been considering Mr. Gerrish’s nomination, was briefed on the matter on Tuesday, including the fact that Mr. Gerrish had almost certainly voted illegally, according to three Democratic congressional aides familiar with the briefing. Public records back up that notion. Given Mr. Trump’s intense focus on alleged widespread voter fraud in last year’s election — the president has claimed that millions of people voted illegally, without evidence — Democrats are likely to pounce on the misstep to try to sink Mr. Gerrish’s nomination. Julia Lawless, a spokeswoman for the committee’s chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said she could not comment on Mr. Gerrish’s voting history, but that the committee would continue to examine his record. “Mr. Gerrish is continuing to undergo the same bipartisan vetting process that every nominee before the Senate Finance Committee does,” Ms. Lawless said. “Given that this process is still underway, we are unable to discuss specific details in his file.” "
488,"Just days before President Trump was scheduled to make his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly, the former secretary general, Kofi Annan, described the world as a “messy place” where people’s disaffection with their governments had influenced recent elections and would now lead to “divisions at the U.N.” In the recent past, he said, world leaders “worked with each other” and realized that cross-border cooperation was the only way to solve crises. “But today, we have lots of little men in high places, and they don’t always seem to understand the risks we are all in.” “All that we need is one miscalculation,” he cautioned, “and all bets are off.” Mr. Annan made his remarks during a question-and-answer session at the Presidential Palace in Athens. The session was part of the Athens Democracy Forum, which was convened by The New York Times for the fifth year. The forum, which gathers world leaders to discuss international affairs, was endorsed by United Nations Secretary General António Guterres. Mr. Annan, who was secretary general from 1997 to 2005, recalled the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. “Suddenly, with the end of the Cold War, the U.N. could do what it was set up to do, without one country vetoing the other,” he said. “Today, we seem to be back to where we were in ’89.” The effectiveness of global institutions became a subject of debate following two decisive votes in 2016. One was Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union 43 years after joining what was then known as the European Economic Community. The other was the election of President Trump, who in December described the United Nations as “just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.” He has been critical of the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for being costly and ineffective. "
489,"WASHINGTON — When Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, introduced Chuck Schumer to members of her caucus this month, she warmed up the room with a well-worn joke about her Senate counterpart: “You know they say the most dangerous place in Washington is between Chuck and a camera.” Mr. Schumer’s love of the spotlight aside, it has been behind the scenes where “Chuck and Nancy,” as President Trump calls them, have forged what may be the most surprisingly potent partnership in Mr. Trump’s Washington. In a city where they hold no formal reins of power, the two are helping to set the agenda on Capitol Hill. They cut a fiscal deal with Mr. Trump, then reached a tentative agreement to protect young immigrants in the country illegally from deportation. Now they face a tougher test: Killing the latest Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and persuading the mercurial president to work with them to shore up shaky health insurance markets. “This is really a stinkeroo,” Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday, referring to the repeal measure drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. “I hope that when this is defeated, and hopefully that will be soon, the president will agree to going forward in a bipartisan way.” It will not be easy. Mr. Trump is pressing Congress to adopt the health care legislation, which would cut deeply into Medicaid and dismantle the programs and prescriptions of the Affordable Care Act. "
490,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Rescuers in Mexico searched desperately for a second day for survivors of a powerful earthquake that toppled dozens of buildings in the capital alone. The death toll of more than 200 is expected to rise. An army of volunteers is helping in the relief effort. At least 30 children were crushed in one school. “I can’t bear this, I can’t,” wept a man at the site. Here’s a map of the damage and pictures of the destruction. We also explain why two huge earthquakes hit Mexico just 12 days apart. _____ "
491,"WASHINGTON — In the months since President Trump declared that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate deal, 14 state governors have vowed to continue upholding the agreement and press ahead with policies to fight global warming. But a key question has always lingered: How much can these states really do on climate by themselves, without help from the federal government? Now some numbers are emerging. On Wednesday, three governors in the United States Climate Alliance — Jerry Brown of California, Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, and Jay Inslee of Washington — unveiled a new study by the research firm Rhodium Group that said the 14 alliance states were on pace to meet their share of the Obama administration’s pledge under the Paris accord, thanks in part to local mandates on renewable energy and electric vehicles. “Together, we are a political and economic force, and we will drive the change that needs to happen nationwide,” Mr. Brown said at a news conference in New York, held as world leaders were gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. President Barack Obama had pledged that United States greenhouse gas emissions would fall 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. While President Trump has disavowed this goal, the new analysis found that collective emissions in the 14 alliance states are on pace to drop 24 to 29 percent, based on policies already on the books. "
492,"WASHINGTON — Last month, Facebook and Google came out forcefully against a bill that would hold companies accountable for hosting sex trafficking on their websites. They said that while they worked hard to combat sex trafficking, changing the law “jeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet” that have been crucial to innovation for decades. By this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds. The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country’s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election. The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service. “There is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill. "
493,"WASHINGTON — Paul J. Manafort, the former campaign chairman for President Trump who is at the center of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, is working for allies of the leader of Iraq’s Kurdish region to help administer and promote a referendum on Kurdish independence from Iraq. The United States opposes the referendum, but Mr. Manafort has carved out a long and lucrative career advising foreign clients whose interests have occasionally diverged from American foreign policy. And he has continued soliciting international business even as his past international work has become a focus of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump and his associates, including possible collusion between them to influence the presidential election. In fact, the work for the Kurdish group appears to have been initiated this summer around the time that federal authorities working for Mr. Mueller raided Mr. Manafort’s home in Virginia and informed him that they planned to indict him. While the Kurdish referendum, scheduled for Monday, would not immediately trigger independence, the American government and the international community have expressed serious concerns about it. They fear that, if it passes overwhelmingly, as expected, it could further destabilize Iraq, damage the coalition fighting the Islamic State, and potentially spark violence in disputed areas. In a statement on Wednesday, the State Department urged Kurdish leaders “to accept the alternative, which is a serious and sustained dialogue with the central government, facilitated by the United States and United Nations, and other partners.” The Iraqi Kurdish leader, Massoud Barzani, and his allies, who are the driving force behind the referendum, hope it will put their semiautonomous oil-rich region on a path toward full independence, which they contend is their right. Independence could also allow the Kurdistan Regional Government, for which Mr. Barzani serves as president, to have uncontested control over its lucrative oil exports. "
494,"Leaders from around the world have descended on New York for United Nations meetings, fancy parties, ringing speeches about helping the poor — and a big dose of hypocrisy. And — finally! — this is one area where President Trump has shown global leadership. If there were an award for United Nations chutzpah, the competition would be tough, but the medal might go to Trump for warning that if necessary, “we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” There were gasps in the hall: A forum for peace was used to threaten to annihilate a nation of 25 million people. There also was Trump’s praise for American humanitarian aid to Yemen. Patting oneself on the back is often oafish, but in this case it was also offensive. Yemen needs aid because the U.S. is helping Saudi Arabia starve and bomb Yemeni civilians, creating what the U.N. says is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. In other words, we are helping to create the very disaster that we’re boasting about alleviating. It was also sad to see Trump repeatedly plug “sovereignty,” which tends to be the favored word of governments like Russia (even as it invades Ukraine and interferes in the U.S. election) and China (as it supports corrupt autocrats from Zimbabwe to Myanmar). Speaking of Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi skipped the U.N. meeting, after being feted last year, because it’s awkward to be a Nobel Peace Prize winner who defends a brutal campaign of murder, rape and pillage. Many Muslim leaders in attendance, like Recep Tayyip Erdogan, did highlight the plight of the Rohingya suffering an ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. If only they were as interested in their own political prisoners! Meanwhile, world leaders usually ignore places that don’t fit their narratives. Everybody pretty much shrugged at South Sudan and Burundi, both teetering on the edge of genocide; at Congo, where we’re headed for civil strife as the president attempts to cling to power; and at the “four famines”: in Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan. To Trump’s credit, he expressed concern Wednesday about South Sudan and Congo and said he would dispatch U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to the region to see what can be done; let’s hope his administration provides desperately needed leadership. "
495,"WASHINGTON — As the two negotiators who initiated the secret talks that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, we are intimately familiar with the deal’s strengths, its inevitable imperfections and the wider challenge posed by Iran. In an ideal world, we would have erased Iran’s knowledge of the nuclear fuel cycle, eliminated its missile arsenal, stopped its dangerous use of proxies across the region, and transformed it into a less disruptive regional power. But we don’t live in an ideal world. Diplomacy requires difficult compromises. And the nuclear deal achieved the best of the available alternatives. It cuts off Iran’s pathways to a bomb, sharply constrains its nuclear program for a long time, and provides for unprecedentedly strict monitoring and verification. Diplomacy avoided another war in the Middle East and averted the kind of crisis we now face with North Korea. But today, after two years of repeated affirmations of Iran’s compliance by our intelligence community and the International Atomic Energy Agency, American policy is at a fork in the road. The smart way to proceed would be to keep the world’s powers united and the burden of proof on Iran. That means working with partners on relentless enforcement; enhancing sanctions that punish Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior, including its missile program and sponsorship of terrorism; working closely with Arab partners to deter Iran’s meddling in their internal affairs; and making plain our concerns with Iran’s domestic human rights abuses. It means using the diplomatic channel we opened with Iran, after 35 years without such contact, to avoid inadvertent escalation. And it means making it clear that after some restrictions in the deal expire, the United States and the world will still not allow Iran to advance its nuclear program in threatening ways. Then there’s the foolish way — which the Trump administration seems perpetually tempted to pursue. President Trump has already declared his hostility to the agreement. On Wednesday, he said he had reached a decision about the future of the deal, without saying what it was. "
496,"Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee violated their supposedly sacrosanct principles of fiscal hawkishness this week, by saying that it would be just fine with them to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years in order to cut taxes. They justify this hypocrisy by asserting what has been disproved time and again — that tax cuts spur the economy and compensate for any lost revenue. In fact, these cuts could hurt the very people they purport to help — small-business owners, middle-class professionals and working-class Americans. While even initial details of the tax plan are not expected before next week, deep corporate tax cuts have been a Republican priority for some time. Much of the discussion of that has revolved around the top rate, now 35 percent. President Trump has called for lowering it to 15 percent, while his economic aides and House Republicans favor a top rate around 25 percent. But the rate cut on corporate profits is only part of the plan. A centerpiece of proposals made in the past by Mr. Trump and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, has been to tax so-called pass-through income at the same rate as corporate profits. Currently, such income passes through businesses — including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships — onto the owners’ personal income tax returns, where it is taxed at rates of up to 39.6 percent. Instead, the Republicans would tax it at the new corporate rate of 15 or 25 percent. "

498,"EDEN, Utah — One morning last month a group of roughly 60 people, including doctors, C.E.O.s and internet entrepreneurs, gathered under a big white dome to hear the mission statement of their host, a 45-year-old man named Jamie Wheal. As he paced back and forth in front of an altar bearing shiny Buddha heads, Mr. Wheal talked about the perils of information overload in our content-rich era. “A literate person in the European Middle Ages,” he said, “consumed the same amount of content in their entire lives as we do reading a single edition of the Sunday New York Times.” Sinewy and tanned from a life of outdoor pursuits, Mr. Wheal was offering attendees the chance to “upgrade” their nervous systems to meet this incontrovertible information overload. How? With “flow.” But what is flow? First popularized decades ago by the Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow is an elusive state cultivated by artists, athletes and others, that of being so absorbed in what they’re doing that they lose track of time and thought, finding themselves guided rather by instinct and intuition. It has also been referred to as the Zone — not to be confused with the diet of the same name — or just “being in the moment.” And for those who have experienced it, there is no denying its magic. Dr. Csikszentmihalyi, who turns 83 this month, is a deeply philosophical academic formerly of the University of Chicago (now at Claremont Graduate University) and still publishing. In 2004 he gave a Ted Talk that has been viewed over four million times. "
499,"Donald Trump’s visit to the United Nations has resurrected the question of whether we’d be better off with Mike Pence. We haven’t mulled that one for a while. Lately, Trump’s stupendous instability has actually been looking like a plus. There he was, telling Democrats that he didn’t want to cut taxes on the rich. Trying to find a way to save the Dreamers, having apparently forgotten that he was the one who put them all in jeopardy of deportation. If Pence were president we wouldn’t be able to live in hopes of the next flip-flop. The Republican Congress would be marching through its agenda behind a committed conservative who, you may remember, forced so many Planned Parenthood clinics to close when he was governor of Indiana that it triggered an H.I.V. epidemic. Better insane than sorry. Then came the U.N. speech, and the reminder that the one big plus on Pence’s scorecard is that he seems less likely to get the planet blown up. You’ve heard about the big moment, when the president threatened to “totally destroy North Korea,” adding, “Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.” Trump, who has a history of giving opponents insulting nicknames, loves calling Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, “Rocket Man.” Nikki Haley, our U.N. ambassador, argued that the president’s speech was a diplomatic win because “every other international community” has now started calling Kim “Rocket Man,” too. "
500,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s foreign minister likened President Trump to a “dog barking,” ridiculing the American leader for threatening to “totally destroy” his country if it persists in its nuclear and missile threats. “Back home, we have a saying: The dog barks, but the caravan continues,” Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told reporters in New York on Wednesday when he was asked about Mr. Trump’s comment. “If he thought he could scare us with the noise of a dog barking, well, he should be daydreaming.” Mr. Ri arrived in New York on Wednesday to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where Mr. Trump gave a speech on Tuesday in which he called North Korea a “band of criminals” and its leader, Kim Jong-un, a “Rocket Man” on “a suicide mission.” “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,” Mr. Trump said. When asked about Mr. Trump’s Rocket Man comment, Mr. Ri said: “I am sorry for his aides.” Mr. Ri was scheduled to speak at the General Assembly on Friday. Other than Mr. Ri’s remarks, there has been no reaction from the North Korean government or Mr. Kim. But on Thursday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported that Mr. Kim had been visiting orchards. "
501,"In the latest installment of our video series that goes inside the private working worlds of designers, the consultant Hervé Pierre, the former creative director of Carolina Herrera who as the designer of Melania Trump’s inaugural gown shot to fame in January, reveals how he ended up as the first lady’s stylist, where he shops and whether he will start his own label. This interview has been edited and condensed. Where are we? In my apartment, which is also where I work. I live in Madison Square Park in New York, on 26th Street. I’ve been in this apartment for a bit over 10 years now. When I moved to New York from Paris to work for Oscar de la Renta, I was 29 years old and lived in Greenwich Village, and I wanted to create an environment that reminded me of the French world I had left. I brought the moldings and panels with me when I moved here. I didn’t have a very specific plan for how to decorate. It’s like when you go to the flea market looking for a teapot and come back with a frame. Where do you actually work? In this little corner in my bedroom. It has a great view because I see the Flatiron building, and it puts me in a good mood to sketch. What was the most important thing you learned before you went out on your own? When you work with a woman, it’s not about the clothes. It’s about the way a person is living: the way she eats, the way she organizes, her flowers. Now I ask a question every time I put an idea on paper: Where is this woman going? If you don’t have a purpose, it’s just an idea on paper and the dress means nothing. Can you give me an example? Years ago, when I was at Balmain in Paris, we were doing a dress for the queen of Jordan, I think. She didn’t want her left arm to move, because she just needed to do “How do you do, how do you do” with her right hand. And she didn’t need to sit either. It was a little strange, but O.K. You have to respect the lifestyle of the customer you’re dressing. You left Carolina Herrera last year after 15 years. How did you feel? I was a little scared in the beginning because when you work in a big environment, you are protected in a way. I was on one side of the gate, the golden gate, and suddenly I was in the wild. But a big corporate environment can be difficult, specifically with the number of collections. I was a bit burned out. If you don’t travel, if you have 200 samples to make in the next three months, when do you get inspired? How does it work for your own sanity? "
502,"Read the latest on Hurricane Maria with Friday’s live updates. Puerto Rico remained in the throes of chaos and devastation Thursday as the remnants of Hurricane Maria continued to dump rain on the island — up to three feet in some areas. Flash flood warnings persisted, according to the National Hurricane Center, with “catastrophic” flooding “especially in areas of mountainous terrain.” The strikingly powerful storm had rendered an estimated 3.4 million people without power, and with the territory’s energy grid all but destroyed, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló predicted a long period of recovery. Anxious relatives in the mainland United States and elsewhere took to social media in an effort to find news of their loved ones. Late Thursday, the mayor of Toa Baja, a town in northern Puerto Rico, told The New York Times that eight people had drowned there after flooding. That brought to at least 10 the number who have died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, a toll that is expected to climb. Puerto Rico faces numerous obstacles as it begins to emerge from the storm: the weight of an extended debt and bankruptcy crisis; a recovery process begun after Irma, which killed at least three people and left nearly 70 percent of households without power; the difficulty of getting to an island far from the mainland; and the strain on relief efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other groups already spread thin in the wake of several recent storms. “Irma gave us a break, but Maria destroyed us,” said Edwin Serrano, a construction worker in Old San Juan. "
503,"In a matter of weeks, President Trump has twice struck deals with Democrats in Congress that have left many of his supporters flummoxed. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, warned him on Twitter that if the media reports were true, his “base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair.” He added, “No promise is credible.” But the informal DACA agreement with Democrats is unlikely to be the move that splinters his re-election coalition. Partnering with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on this immigration issue may make him look more like a Democrat, but DACA is broadly popular, and according to data on opinions of leaders in both parties, it also brings him a lot closer to most Republican elites. In 2014, long before Mr. Trump emerged as a candidate, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, an independent, nonpartisan research group, conducted two parallel surveys. One was done among regular Americans, and the other was conducted among foreign policy leaders in government, think tanks, news media, academia and similar groups. The surveys reveal two patterns that are relevant both to Mr. Trump’s rise in the Republican Party and his recent willingness to work with Democrats. The main conclusion from the Chicago Council data is simple: On many issues, including illegal immigration, globalization and trade, Republicans in the population are more conservative than Republican elites. Republican voters were roughly 40 points more likely than Republican elites to believe that controlling illegal immigration should be a top priority of American foreign policy (61 percent to 20 percent). They were less likely to support the resettlement of Syrian refuges to the United States (27 percent to 71 percent). And they were more likely to believe that immigrants and refuges entering the United States are a critical threat to the nation (55 percent to 16 percent). Similar differences exist on issues of trade, globalization and Social Security. "
504,"Farmers planted a new kind of seed on 25 million acres of soybean and cotton fields this year. Developed by Monsanto, the seeds, genetically modified to be resistant to a weed killer called dicamba, are one of the biggest product releases in the company’s history. But the seeds and the weed killer have turned some farmers — often customers of Monsanto, which sells both — against the company and alarmed regulators. Farmers who have not bought the expensive new seeds, which started to appear last year, are joining lawsuits, claiming that their crops have been damaged by dicamba that drifted onto their farms. Arkansas announced a 120-day ban of the weed killer this summer, and it is considering barring its use next year after mid-April. Missouri briefly barred its sale in July. And the Environmental Protection Agency, not known for its aggressiveness under President Trump, is weighing its own action. “I’m a fan of Monsanto. I’ve bought a lot of their products,” said Brad Williams, a Missouri farmer. “I can’t wrap my mind around the fact that there would be some kind of evil nefarious plot to put a defective product out there intentionally.” Yet he has been dismayed both by damage to his soybean crops, which were within a wide area of farmland harmed by dicamba, and by the impact even to trees on his property. Leaves, he said, were “so deformed you couldn’t even really identify the differences between them.” The dispute comes as American agriculture sits at a crossroads. Genetically modified crops were introduced in the mid-1990s. They made it possible to spray weed killers — chiefly Monsanto’s Roundup — on plants after they emerged from the ground, ridding fields of weeds while leaving crops undamaged. "
505,"KABUL, Afghanistan — The police chief of a volatile Afghanistan district was killed by a roadside bomb on Thursday, officials said, just two weeks after taking over for his predecessor, who was killed in the same manner. It was the third such killing of a security chief in the district — Jaghatu, in southeastern Afghanistan — in about a month, underscoring the continuing high casualties Afghan forces are suffering in defending against a resurgent Taliban. Their predecessor was killed in a Taliban ambush. Although Afghan security forces have denied the Taliban major victories in recent months, bloody local skirmishes continue, and military officials say the country’s forces are engaged in fighting in 20 of the country’s 34 provinces. The government does not release official casualty tallies of its forces, but senior officials say this year’s figures have matched, and at times exceeded, the record numbers for 2016, when about 6,300 members of Afghan forces were killed and close to 12,500 were wounded. The Jaghatu District police chief, Mera Jan Jafari, was killed by a roadside bomb while traveling to the Mohmand Pass area to set up a checkpoint, said Mohammed Arif Noori, a spokesman for the governor of Ghazni Province, where Jaghatu is located. “This is a concern for us, and we will investigate what is the reason that Taliban can easily kill a commander,” Mr. Noori said. “We have heard that some people help the Taliban, but that isn’t proved yet.” "
506,"Last week, a Silicon Valley startup called Bodega instigated an internet meltdown after a Fast Company profile made the company’s intentions clear. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you,” said Paul McDonald, a co-founder, who used to work at Google. The outrage made moral sense. “Bodega” is name that’s asking for trouble, especially with people who frequent them. The outrage is also easy. Where’s the upset over the effect other, bigger companies – like Amazon, whose latest major acquisition, Whole Foods, has slashed prices – might actually have on bodegas? Being mad at Amazon is harder when it’s mixed up in so much of your life. We discuss the dilemma. We also get into the horror at the movies (“It,” “Mother!”) and on TV (“American Horror Story: Cult”), and how it meets up with our times in surprising and hilarious ways — especially Darren Aronofsky’s “Mother!” with Jennifer Lawerence and Javier Bardem.

507,"I watch as Dame Judi Dench eats her chilled corn soup with saffron and sips Champagne. At 82, she is just as elegant as you would imagine, with silver hair, ice-blue eyes and crisp diction. She’s 5-foot-1, but her reputation is towering. Ms. Dench is one of the greatest British actresses — a star alum of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Sally Bowles in the London production of “Cabaret” and an Oscar winner for her eight-minute turn as Queen Elizabeth I in “Shakespeare in Love.” She died in James Bond’s arms, as the murdered spymaster M. And she has portrayed so many queens on stage and screen that when she plays a duchess, it seems like a demotion. So what to talk about with this regal creature? Well, what else? Lingerie, tattoos, rap music, younger men, sex and her hobby of embroidering cushions with raunchy sayings. This dame, as it turns out, is full of mischief. Ms. Dench got an Oscar nomination 20 years ago for playing Victoria in “Mrs. Brown,” the saga of how the queen grew close to a younger man, a servant who doted on her after her beloved Albert died, outraging her household. Now she is back in Oscar contention for “Victoria & Abdul,” the saga of how the queen grew close to another younger man, also a servant who doted on her after the other one died, again outraging her household.

508,"To the Editor: “In Africa, a Glimpse of Hope for Beating H.I.V.,” by Tina Rosenberg (Fixes column, nytimes.com, Sept. 19), rightly notes that President Trump’s proposed budget cuts to global health assistance would have subverted gains to end the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic. Though Mr. Trump’s proposal to reduce funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, by $1 billion was rejected by both the House and the Senate appropriations committees, the administration’s version of the global gag rule — which is a dramatic expansion of previous iterations — remains in effect. Research by Fordham University shows that the global gag rule drastically curtailed community-based H.I.V. testing and condom distribution programs. This is why President George W. Bush explicitly exempted Pepfar funding from the policy. Mr. Trump’s decision to include Pepfar and expand the global gag rule’s reach underscores this administration’s gross incompetence when it comes to global health. Now is not the time to stymie efforts to control the spread of an epidemic that knows no borders. Legislation like the Global HER Act is a critical step to making sure that progress toward ending AIDS is not reversed.

With a Vow to Resist Tax Provisions for Rich” (news article, Sept. 13): Among the many recent head-spinning statements issued from the Trump administration regarding tax reform, a comment by Gary Cohn, the chief White House economic adviser, about the estate tax stands out for its cavalier insensitivity. “Only morons pay the estate tax,” Mr. Cohn is quoted as having told a group of Senate Democrats this year. If this reflects Mr. Cohn’s sentiment and that of the Trump administration in general, what message does it send to the public? That such taxpayers are mentally deficient fools? I personally know a number of people who have willingly paid this tax, and I can assure Mr. Cohn and others that they are neither suckers nor morons, but have done so with a far larger sense of social responsibility and of the common good than most members of our current administration demonstrate. MICHAEL C. STEINER, CINCINNATI "
510,"When Jimmy Kimmel dropped the humor and began a relentless campaign against the latest effort from Senate Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it was — at the very least — an uncommon moment for him. While Mr. Kimmel often discusses politics on his show, it is not his main focus and he has rarely — if ever — taken such a serious tone to advocate for or against a single piece of legislation. In the Trump era, late-night hosts speaking out against President Trump are common. Leaving out the jokes, however, is not. There have been other instances since the advent of late-night television where comedians have substituted political seriousness for punch lines — or combined the two. While these are rare, they can often create powerful moments of television. Or, when comics get involved directly in politics, sometimes it can flop. Just ask Bill Maher. Here are some examples from over the years. No late-night host has fought as vigorously or passionately for a piece of legislation as Jon Stewart, the former host of “The Daily Show,” did on behalf of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The bill was to provide health care for emergency medical workers who were sickened in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It was passed in 2011, partially because of Mr. Stewart’s relentless lobbying. "
511,"WASHINGTON — Under growing pressure from Congress and the public to reveal more about the spread of covert Russian propaganda on Facebook, the company said on Thursday that it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to congressional committees investigating the Kremlin’s influence operation during the 2016 presidential campaign. “I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said during an appearance on Facebook Live, the company’s video service. He added that he did not want anyone “to use our tools to undermine democracy.” “That’s not what we stand for,” he said. The announcement that Facebook would share the ads with the Senate and House intelligence committees came after the social network spent two weeks on the defensive. The company faced calls for greater transparency about 470 Russia-linked accounts — in which fictional people posed as American activists — which were taken down after they had promoted inflammatory messages on divisive issues. Facebook had previously angered congressional staff by showing only a sample of the ads, some of which attacked Hillary Clinton or praised Donald J. Trump. Facebook’s admission on Sept. 6 that Russian agents covertly bought ads on the site during last year’s campaign has brought intense scrutiny on the social network and on Twitter, entangling both companies in the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Both companies have turned over detailed data to Mr. Mueller. The disclosure of the ads also raised the possibility of future regulation of political advertising on social media platforms. This week, congressional Democrats asked the Federal Election Commission to advise on ways to prevent illicit foreign influence on American elections via social media, including possible new laws or regulations. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, denied on Friday that Russia had been involved in any way. The Kremlin, he said, does not even know how to put advertisements on Facebook, adding, “We have never done it, and the Russian side has never been involved in this.” "

513,"If there’s a better angel of President Trump’s nature, a doubtful proposition, then President Emmanuel Macron of France is determined to summon it through a mixture of Gallic logic and alpha-male charm. In a wide-ranging conversation in English with a handful of journalists in New York, Macron said that with the Paris climate accord as with the Iran nuclear agreement, “What I want to convince him is that the solution is not to break what we have.” Trump has said he’ll withdraw from the Paris deal unless it can be renegotiated, but no concrete steps have been taken for the United States to quit. The president has also been implacably hostile to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, although it has slashed Iran’s enrichment program under strict international monitoring and stopped the country well short of North Korea’s nuclear-weapon status. Trump keeps hinting he’ll tear up what he’s called “the worst deal ever.” Macron, who described his relationship with Trump as “extremely direct,” said he wants to show the president “that he puts himself in deadlock because on these different issues, what’s his alternative? He doesn’t have any. On climate, even on Iran, there is no alternative. So we have to rebuild some multilateralism where your president finds his place.” That’s a tough assignment in that Trump has not yet met a multilateral organization he doesn’t disparage, embraces an America-first ideology, and loves the idea of “sovereignty” so much he referred to it more than 20 times in his United Nations speech this week. But Macron, who upended France’s political landscape in the space of a year, is not one to be daunted by near impossible challenges. Descending from the Jupiter-like heights that have marked the early months of his presidency (an attempt to reignite French pride through the Gaullist majesty of his office), Macron was frank and chatty as he outlined his ideas to cajole Trump from self-defeating rage toward productive reason — a thankless task in which the French upstart should have the world’s full backing. With Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at odds, and the initial American-British love fest fraying over wild Trump outbursts, Macron is probably the last best hope for America’s allies to restrain the apocalyptic side of Trump’s nature. There’s chemistry in the relationship. Of course, if he fails, the risk for the French president is that he will be seen as Trump’s lackey. "
514,"To the Editor: Re “Tough Talk but Little Action on Opioid Epidemic” (news article, Sept. 11): It’s tragic that the Trump administration continues to stall on seriously addressing our nationwide opioid epidemic. More than 20 million Americans and their families living with an addiction need treatment and recovery support services now. Public policy pathways already exist. In addition to the recent interim report from the White House Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, we have the dozens of realistic recommendations in the 2016 Surgeon General’s Report, “Facing Addiction in America.” Both reports document evidence-based strategies for reducing and reversing this epidemic. You cite statements from Trump administration officials that they are trying to decide how to proceed. An immediate action they could take would be to fully fund and fast-track the funds for the 21st Century Cures Act. This would provide vital funds for halfway houses and recovery residences that enable people in recovery to maintain the behaviors and knowledge they learned in treatment. DON MATHIS, HAVRE DE GRACE, MD. The writer is president of Addiction Connections Resource. To the Editor: Four years ago in Baltimore, applicants for methadone maintenance, the “gold standard” of opioid dependency treatment, were offered an alternative to being returned to the streets to continue their deadly illicit drug use while awaiting entry to one of the oversubscribed “comprehensive” programs: They could receive “interim” treatment with medication only. The results, published in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, were essentially the same as those of patients entering comprehensive service programs directly. This outcome paralleled the one two decades earlier at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, reported in The American Journal of Public Health: “Interim methadone maintenance can reduce heroin use among those awaiting entry into comprehensive treatment.” "
515,"Jimmy Kimmel, the talk show host who has become the unlikely face of opposition to Senate Republicans’ latest health care push, insisted he had done his homework. Mr. Kimmel spent a second straight night arguing against the proposal on Wednesday. Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a co-sponsor of the bill, responded by telling news outlets that “Jimmy doesn’t understand.” Earlier this year, the men seemed to be on the same page. Mr. Cassidy had appeared amicably on the program in May after Mr. Kimmel told an emotional story about his infant son’s heart condition. In an appearance a week earlier on CNN, Mr. Cassidy had coined the “Jimmy Kimmel test” when he was asked about insurance companies capping their payouts to customers. “As you present that, I ask: Does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?” he said. “Would a child born with a congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in that first year of life? I want it to pass the Jimmy Kimmel test.” But in recent days, Mr. Kimmel argued that the bill Mr. Cassidy had co-sponsored fell short. A review of the factual statements in Mr. Kimmel’s Wednesday night monologue suggests he has a strong grasp on the proposal, though there are nits to pick. The Congressional Budget Office has not provided a score of the bill yet, but three groups have recently released estimates. Mr. Kimmel cited the highest of the three, which comes from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Avalere Health, a Washington-based consulting firm, estimated the states would lose $215 billion federal funding through 2026. The Kaiser Family Foundation released a lower figure Thursday morning: $160 billion. "
516,"LONDON — Brash headlines. Hyper-opinionated columnists. Celebrity mania. Unabashed appeals to those who feel excluded. Sound familiar? These themes perfectly reflect the media climate of our time, but they also define the portrait of a young Rupert Murdoch in James Graham’s “Ink,” which is at the Duke of York’s Theater in the West End, after a successful run at the Almeida Theater. Directed by Rupert Goold and starring Bertie Carvel and Richard Coyle, “Ink” chronicles the 1969 takeover of the moribund Sun newspaper by Rupert Murdoch, then a rising Australian media mogul. Together with Larry Lamb, who he hired as the editor, Mr. Murdoch proceeded to reinvent the mass-market tabloid and to change the media and politics here in a way that still resounds today. (The Sun, still going strong, is one of the tabloids thought to have strongly influenced Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.) How much could Mr. Murdoch, who is a close friend of Donald Trump, and who controls the Fox News Channel, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, have foreseen the consequences of those early decisions? What motivated him? What does it mean for “Ink” to be seen in Britain now? Mr. Graham, the author of several recently successful plays (“This House,” “Privacy”), and Mr. Carvel, best-known for playing the villainous Miss Trunchbull in “Matilda,” sat down a few days before the West End premiere to discuss these questions and more. This is an edited version of the conversation. What made you want to write a play about the rise of the tabloids? Was it prompted by the polemics around Brexit? JAMES GRAHAM I began writing it at the beginning of 2016, but even before Brexit and Trump’s election, I was interested in the way our news discourse was changing online and through social media. The more aggressive populist language of journalism there made me think about the aggressive populist tone that started with The Sun. "
517,"For decades, Republicans have dreamed of taking some of the vast sums the federal government spends on health care entitlements and handing the money over to states to use as they saw best. Now, in an 11th-hour effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the party has come up with a way to repackage the funding for the law it loathes into a trillion-dollar pot of state grants. The plan is at the core of the bill that Senate Republican leaders have vowed to bring to a vote next week. It was initially seen as a long-shot effort by Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. But for all its ad hoc, last-minute feel, it has evolved into the most far-reaching repeal proposal of all. It dismantles the Medicaid expansion and the system of subsidies to help people afford insurance. It gives the states the right to waive many of the consumer protections under President Obama’s landmark health law. And it removes the guaranteed safety net that has insured the country’s poorest citizens for more than half a century. “This is by far the most radical of any of the Republican health care bills that have been debated this year,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. “And the reason for that is that this would be the biggest devolution of federal money and responsibility to the states for anything, ever.” The White House and Senate leaders are now in an intensive final push to repeal the Affordable Care Act by September 30. After that, under Senate rules, they will need 60 votes, which they acknowledge is an impossibility. Senator Graham said in a statement on Thursday that the legislation was gaining “momentum and support” because it would send “money and power back to the states, and closer to patients, to deliver quality health care.” "
518,"Iran’s foreign minister rejected on Thursday any new negotiation with the United States over extending the length or conditions of the 2015 nuclear accord, saying that Iran would talk about changing the accord only if every concession it made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. In an interview, the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that would mean Iran would retake possession of the stockpile of nuclear fuel it shipped to Russia when the accord took effect. “Are you prepared to return to us 10 tons of enriched uranium?,” Mr. Zarif said of the relinquished stockpile — one of Iran’s biggest concessions — about 98 percent of the country’s nuclear fuel holdings. Under the agreement, Iran retains an amount of enriched uranium too small to make a single atomic weapon. Mr. Zarif, who was educated in the United States, spoke with reporters, columnists and editorial writers for The New York Times, a day after he conferred privately with counterparts from the six countries that negotiated the deal with Iran — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York. It was the first time Mr. Zarif had met with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has said the United States wants to “revisit” what he described as flaws in the accord even as he acknowledged Iran is abiding by its terms. "

520,"WASHINGTON — Five years ago, Paul Manafort arranged for a prominent New York-based law firm to draft a report that was used by allies of his client, Viktor Yanukovych, the Russia-aligned president of Ukraine, to justify the jailing of a political rival. And now the report is coming back to haunt it. The Justice Department, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation, recently asked the firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, for information and documents related to its work on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych’s government, which crumbled after he fled to Russia under pressure. The request comes at a time when Mr. Manafort, his work for Mr. Yanukovych’s party and for Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the handling of payments for that work have become focal points in the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and connections between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates. It’s unclear if the Justice Department’s request to Skadden, as the firm is known, is part of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. But the interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants. Mr. Manafort played a central role in the effort to shield Mr. Yanukovych from international condemnation, according to consultants involved in the effort. He devised the strategy and recruited lobbyists, lawyers and public relations consultants from across the political spectrum, but left the day-to-day implementation of the campaign to others. Skadden’s report was one element of that strategy. Its conclusions provided a counterpoint to international critics who said that Mr. Yanukovych’s government had prosecuted and convicted the former Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, on corruption charges in 2011 for political reasons and without sufficient evidence. "
521,"When the Trump administration unveils new details of its tax plan, promised for next week, one group of taxpayers will be under the microscope: the rich. That’s because they take advantage of so many tax breaks that few, if any, pay the top rate of 39.6 percent. Eliminating at least some of those breaks would make it possible to reduce tax rates for the highest earners (and everyone else) while raising the same or even more in total revenue. Doing so would reduce rates while broadening the base, and simplify the tax code while making it fairer — goals that nearly all economists from across the political spectrum say they support. The administration, too, seems to have embraced such an approach. “The rich will not be gaining at all,” President Trump said last week. So who are the rich? Based on comprehensive data now available from the Internal Revenue Service, it’s possible to pinpoint who pays what based on their percentile of adjusted gross income. The top 1 percent seems a fair representation of the rich. This group — about 1.4 million taxpayers — reported adjusted gross incomes of over $466,000 in 2014, the most recent year for which the data is available. The top 1 percent paid a total of $542.6 billion in federal tax, or an astounding 39.5 percent of the total income tax. If you want to take a more expansive view of rich, the top 10 percent (who earn upward of $133,000) pay 71 percent of the total tax. "
522,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump widened U.S. sanctions against trade with North Korea and presented a united front against its nuclear program with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “The brutal North Korean regime does not respect its own citizens or the sovereignty of other nations,” Mr. Trump said at their lunch, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. He also hailed a “very bold move” by China’s central bank to limit dealings with North Korea. The North’s foreign minister compared Mr. Trump’s warnings at the U.N. this week to “the noise of a dog barking.” Australia has its turn today at the U.N podium, and India, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia address the assembly on Saturday.

523,"The case of a  baker in Colorado who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple has been added to the Supreme Court’s docket for this fall, but thousands of New York Times readers have already weighed in on the debate, which centered on the protections of free speech. The baker, Jack Phillips, said that supplying the cake to the couple, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, would violate his Christian faith and his right to express himself. The couple says that freedom of speech does not give Mr. Phillips the right to discriminate against same-sex couples. The article received over 4,500 comments on nytimes.com and The New York Times’s Facebook post. Here is a selection of responses, which have been edited for length and clarity. I’m gay myself but in this situation, I’m actually finding myself siding more with the baker than the gay couple. The baker stated that he would create other types of cakes for gay people or any people — just not wedding cakes. It clarifies he’s not broadly discriminating against gay people. I think the politics of nondiscrimination have gone too far and are being too often used now to bully people. Yes, in an ideal world, this baker would have his eyes opened and would not allow religion to narrow him in this way. But I think we are going too far with the state trying to force people to be completely without prejudice. — Oakbranch, California Let’s be real about this. The baker is not being asked to do anything that violates his religion, unless his religion prohibits the baking, decorating and selling of cakes. What the baker is doing is attempting to impose his religious beliefs on others. This is simple intolerance, and he is breaking the law which prohibits discrimination. Any sane judiciary would see this and make short work of it. — Robert Anderson, Ellicott City, Md. "

YouTube and the Rebels Remaking Media
By Robert Kyncl with Maany Peyvan
272 pp. Harper Business. $29.99 It’s not easy to write a relevant book about internet culture. By the time it hits the press, the online story has already changed. The narrative has outpaced the publishing schedule for “Streampunks: YouTube and the Rebels Remaking Media,” a book about YouTube video makers written by the company’s chief business officer, Robert Kyncl (with assistance from the Google speechwriter Maany Peyvan). Kyncl’s account is suffused with Obama-age technocratic optimism, but we’re in the Trump era now. Many of the “rebels” disrupting the mainstream media these days aren’t exactly humming Kumbaya. “Streampunks” tells the story of a multicultural cast of video creators who have outsmarted the media’s white, male gatekeepers to build the next wave of television, enlightening and empowering viewers with their intimate, straight-to-the-camera dispatches. When Kyncl writes that YouTube “can show you the breadth of humanity that you may not see outside your window every day,” he is actually referring to a narrow swath of human testimonies — ones that teach viewers to embrace their nerdiness; or help them understand the experiences of people with physical disabilities; or bring together L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers; or advocate for women’s empowerment in the Middle East. He writes brightly of YouTube “broadening society’s horizons” and creating a “global media melting pot.” But YouTube can just as easily connect lonely racists as it does isolated queer kids, or accelerate regressive values as quickly as progressive ones. It’s now more obvious than ever that YouTube, like other social networks, has been leveraged by a network of overwhelmingly white, male far-right nativists and chauvinists who use its innovative communication tools to spread messages of terror and domination. In a choice typical of the book’s scope, Kyncl writes glowingly about Vice Media’s chief executive and co-founder Shane Smith, and his mission to remake television news for internet natives ; many of Vice’s raw, on-the-ground videos were hosted on YouTube before they graduated to HBO. Kyncl mentions that Smith started Vice with a Canadian friend named Gavin McInnes, but doesn’t note where McInnes ended up: He’s been making online news videos, too, for far-right sites, and he’s used his media perch to spearhead a crew of “pro-Western” men he calls the Proud Boys.

525,"On a sunny September morning in the Bronx, Vincent and Robert Gardino were out searching for the dead. Strolling among the tombstones in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, the brothers were not the least bit morbid, excitedly trading stories and barbs. “Come over here!” Vincent shouted, his voice bouncing off the monuments. “I want to show you someone.” Below him was the grave of Vito Marcantonio, a protégé of Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. Marcantonio died of a heart attack in 1954 after walking up the City Hall subway steps while collecting signatures for a Congressional run. “He was a lefty during the McCarthy era,” Vincent said. “When he died, Cardinal Spellman prohibited him from having a Catholic funeral.” Finding the graves of the famous and not so famous — like Marcantonio, once well known but now obscure — was always the Gardinos’ hobby. Part treasure hunt, part Who’s Who in America, it has now become their part-time job. The Gardinos are developing a television show for PBS called “Grave Trippers,” visiting cemeteries not just in New York but all over the country. Like Click and Clack of “Car Talk,” the Gardino brothers have an easy rapport. Instead of engines, their topic is the life fully lived but sometimes forgotten. At Woodlawn, they visited LaGuardia himself, but also his first wife, Thea, who died of tuberculosis, and their baby, Fioretta. “They died within months of one another in 1921,” said Vincent, touching the tombstone, covered in a green copper plate with a haunting etching of a mother reaching her arms out to an approaching toddler.

526,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. After Jimmy Kimmel excoriated Senator Bill Cassidy on Tuesday for proposing a health care bill that would leave many children with caps on their insurance coverage, he was met with a strong backlash from conservative politicians and pundits. Mr. Kimmel didn’t back down on Wednesday, leading “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” with a fierce response. Mr. Kimmel singled out one Fox News personality in particular for a dressing-down: Brian Kilmeade, who lamented on Wednesday that “Hollywood elites like comedian Jimmy Kimmel” were “pushing their politics on the rest of the country.” Mr. Kimmel said he’d met Mr. Kilmeade, whom he described as behaving “like a little boy meeting Batman.” On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah took issue with the way the media is covering Mr. Cassidy’s health care proposal. He reminded viewers that when Republicans tried to pass a health care bill earlier this summer, it was called a “last-ditch” effort — and that the same language is being used now. Stephen Colbert suggested some more metaphorical language. President Trump misspoke at the United Nations on Wednesday when addressing a conference of African leaders. The hosts were ready to roast.

Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation, has asked for documents from the White House, suggesting that parts of the inquiry are focused squarely on President Trump’s actions since taking office. In the spotlight: the firing of Michael Flynn, the national security adviser; the dismissal of the F.B.I. director James Comey; and Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Mr. Mueller has also asked for internal communications about former campaign officials, including Paul Manafort. That hasn’t stopped Mr. Manafort from getting new work — he’s helping with a referendum on Kurdish independence from Iraq, which the U.S. opposes. • A race against time.

Seismologists say California is due for a major earthquake within the next few decades. One nightmare scenario predicts roughly 1,800 people killed. Some steps have been taken to prepare. After the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes, billions of dollars were spent to fortify structures across the state. But more than a decade after development began on an earthquake early warning system, the project is still years away from full implementation.

529,"After months of clashes with the security forces, street demonstrations in Venezuela have calmed down, but the economic and political crisis is far from over. The fraudulently elected National Assembly is drafting a new Constitution that will subordinate the judicial system and legislative bodies to the executive branch. The result will be a new dictatorship in Latin America — the first in decades. Having grabbed virtually total power to govern at will, President Nicolás Maduro has wasted no time in jailing political opponents, resorting to torture and repression against students, and silencing the remaining critical news media outlets. Despite a humanitarian disaster leading his country’s citizens to lose on average up to 10 percent of their weight, to be told to eat pet rabbits and to flee abroad by the hundreds of thousands, Hugo Chávez’s successor refuses to step down. Other countries in the region and the internal opposition must intensify their efforts to find a way out of the chaos. Talks in the Dominican Republic between officials from Mr. Maduro’s government and its opponents will not succeed by themselves. On Monday, President Trump hosted a dinner for the presidents of Brazil, Colombia and Panama and the vice president of Argentina at which they agreed to continue working together to resolve Venezuela’s problems. They might achieve something, but only if another country is brought into the equation: Cuba. Given Mr. Trump’s animosity toward the Cuban regime in his United Nations speech on Tuesday, when he said Washington will not lift sanctions on Havana until it makes reforms, it may seem an unlikely partnership. But both countries have real incentives to work together: Only the Cubans can ease Mr. Maduro and his henchmen from power, and only United States’ investment, tourism, trade and good will can allow Cuba to solve its serious economic problems. If Raúl Castro joins in, a deal could be struck, now or when the crisis takes another bad turn. Mr. Maduro refuses to step down. While the government has scheduled regional elections for mid-October, Mr. Maduro is unwilling to call a presidential election next year, because he knows he will lose. International pressure on Venezuela has increased. Latin American countries have made powerful statements against the regime, and the United States has imposed sanctions; the European Union may soon impose economic and visa sanctions. "
530,"LOS ANGELES — I guess there’s a God. During one of the meanest passages in American national politics within living memory, we’re getting a huge, historically corrective, morale-raising cultural event, one that lasts four months and hits on many of the major social topics of the day: racism, sexism, aggressive nationalism. True, the hugeness of the thing is a problem, and the contents are uneven. But it’s a gift, worth a trip to puzzle over and savor. And if the timing is right, that’s semi-accidental. The event, called “Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA,” is the latest of three successive multi-venue extravaganzas in and around this city, spaced several years apart, and bankrolled by the Getty Foundation. The first was an overview of art in Southern California from 1945 to 1980; the second was devoted to architecture and design. The current edition is more tightly focused: on the long, mutually formative cultural exchange between Latin America and the Los Angeles region, considered through exhibitions at some 70 institutions, large and small. The theme is inherently loaded. Latin American art has had shamefully little museum attention in a county that is, statistically, nearly 40 percent Spanish-speaking. So “LA/LA” is definitely a catch-up gesture. And when research began on the project several years ago, few participants could have anticipated the anti-immigrant, and specifically anti-Mexican sentiment of the next administration, summed up by the recent suspension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by President Trump and in the persistently circulated “Build the Wall” meme of the election campaign. One “LA/LA” exhibition, “The U.S.-Mexico Border: Place, Imagination, and Possibility,” at the Craft and Folk Art Museum, directly addresses the subject of a fraught boundary. Some of the work in the show is too soft and cute, but a few pieces obviously mean business. In a 1978 print by Rupert Garcia (reprinted in 2011), three thick strands of barbed wire silhouetted against a red ground frame the words “Cesen Deportación.” A 1988 poster by David Avalos, Louis Hock and Elizabeth Sisco combines a triptych of images of brown-skinned hands cleaning a dinner plate, and others handcuffed, with the words: “Welcome to America’s Finest Tourist Plantation.” "

From The New York Times’s Daisuke Wakabayashi: Here’s the take of Ars Technica’s Ron Amadeo, one of the top smartphone reviewers around: The Deal Makers • On Google’s side: Lazard and the law firms Cleary Gottlieb and Lee & Li • On HTC’s team: Evercore and the law firms Gibson Dunn and Tsar & Tsai Flashback Google was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later. Some analysts were relieved when Google sold off Motorola Mobility, according to The Times: (DealBook’s Michael J. de la Merced argued at the time of the Lenovo deal that Google didn’t lose as much money as the headline figures suggest.) Standard & Poor’s move, which cut China’s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999. The outlook on China was changed to stable from negative. "
532,"AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Wetex Kang, a Malay-Chinese immigrant beekeeper, may be the first Asian candidate to represent the Maori Party of New Zealand, but at times he sounds more like a certain American president. “I think we can make this country great again,” he said last month while driving through the electoral district of Botany in Auckland. That phrasing is intentional — Mr. Kang says he admires President Trump’s brash ability to grab attention. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Kang is a political newcomer who at times says exactly what he is thinking. And Mr. Kang calls himself a “semi-self-made millionaire” who believes the country should be run like a business. But when it comes to policy, his vision of national greatness sounds decidedly different: “I’m standing for a true voice for immigrants. I stand for bridging the inequality in this country, and helping the tangata whenua realize their true potential,” Mr. Kang, 44, said, using the Maori word for the original inhabitants of New Zealand. For the Maori Party, Mr. Kang’s candidacy for a seat in the House of Representatives, which will be put to a vote on Saturday, is an attempt to see if the party can attract the support of a group outside New Zealand’s mostly white political establishment: the Chinese community. Mr. Kang is campaigning on a platform that promises to address concerns over racial discrimination and tightening immigration policies. And backed by a famous but controversial activist in the Maori nationalism movement, Tame Iti, Mr. Kang’s campaign could be the beginning of a partnership between some of the country’s oldest and newest ethnic communities. While that alliance may sound unusual, Marama Fox, a co-leader of the Maori Party, which was formed in 2004 to represent indigenous interests, said that its endorsement of Mr. Kang made sense because of a widely shared genealogy.

First, health care: Here’s a giveway about how bad the new Senate health care bill is: Bill Cassidy, one of its authors, keeps trying to sell it by telling untruths. “The relatively new phenomenon of just ‘up is down’ lying about your bill’s impacts is jarring,” says Loren Adler of the USC-Brookings-Schaeffer Initiative on Health Policy. Most egregiously, Cassidy is claiming that the bill would not ultimately deprive sick people of health insurance. That’s false, as NPR calmly explained when Cassidy said otherwise. In fact, the bill — known as Graham-Cassidy — would free states to remove insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Without those protections, insurers could price such people out of the market. If you get cancer (or even have a family history of it) or your child is born with a birth defect — among many, many other health issues — you could find yourself unable to buy insurance. Without insurance, you could be denied crucial treatments. In a tangible way, Graham-Cassidy would harm millions of Americans. "
534,"LARCHMONT, N.Y. — After the presidential election in November, residents here staged an impromptu vigil. Nine days after the inauguration, more met at a local church to form a grass-roots political action group. Postcard-writing events were organized; another one, a “No Democrat Left Behind” postcard party, will be held later this month at The Voracious Reader, a children’s bookstore. In this picture-book village on Long Island Sound, where owners of the generously proportioned Tudors and Dutch Colonials have long been overwhelmingly Democratic, a sense of political immediacy has clearly taken hold. But whether this energy filters down to local races remains to be seen. In November, voters in Westchester County will choose a county executive. Dismayed by Washington and the direction of the Republican Party, many Democrats say they are ready for change. And yet, even in a county where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1, only two Democratic county executives have led Westchester since the 1930s. The story is the same in Nassau County, where Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans and yet the Democratic hopeful for county executive, Laura Curran, is also seeking to become the third Democrat to hold that position in 80 years. With Election Day less than two months away, and both county executive posts up for grabs, Democrats are hoping to capitalize on the growing antagonism to President Trump among progressive voters. “I’ve gotten active politically in just the past year — this is new for me,” said Farah Kathwari, a mother of two from Larchmont, who founded the liberal group #OurFlag after Mr. Trump’s election. “But I think everything starts locally and works its way up. Donald Trump is not president in a vacuum.” "
535,"By now, President Trump’s sense of humor has been pretty well discussed. Either he doesn’t have one, or it’s subtle — like a group of especially awkward 12-year-old boys yucking it up in the cafeteria. A minute on Google produces an encyclopedia of moments when we have been assured Trump was “only joking.” Some prime examples include Sean Spicer saying Trump was joshing when he urged the Kremlin to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails during the campaign. Then there was the painful moment when his spokesperson, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “I believe he was making a joke,” after Trump suggested that police officers slam prisoners’ heads into the door jambs of their cars. Happily, Hope Hicks, Trump’s communications aide, put all our doubts to rest when she gave The Washington Post a formal statement saying that the president “is brilliant with a great sense of humor.” The “joking” dodge, of course, falls into the category of language tics that actually mean the opposite (“Did you actually pay someone for that haircut? Only kidding!” or “With all due respect, I think your ideas are terrible.”) It’s also worth pointing out that the wacky sense of fun among Trump and his supporters is selective. When Kellyanne Conway fulminated about a “nut job” spreading “vile” ideas that could “easily inflame lunatics who wish to bring harm,” she was talking about Johnny Depp’s very bad assassination joke, but not Trump retweeting a GIF showing him hitting Hillary Clinton in the back with a golf ball. "
536,"President Trump ordered a widening of American sanctions on North Korea on Thursday to further choke off its trade with the outside world, in what some experts described as perhaps the most sweeping set of punitive economic measures enacted by the United States in many years. A new executive order signed by Mr. Trump aimed to cut North Korea out of the international banking system while targeting its major industries and shipping. The move suggested that for now, at least, the president was still committed to applying economic pressure rather than military action, despite his vow this week to “totally destroy North Korea” if the United States were forced to defend itself or its allies. “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and nuclear development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world, and it is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal, rogue regime,” Mr. Trump said as he hosted President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan for lunch in New York. “The brutal North Korean regime does not respect its own citizens or the sovereignty of other nations.” The action came amid news reports that China’s central bank had instructed the country’s banks not to do new business with North Korea and to wind down old loans, in keeping with United Nations sanctions. As North Korea’s dominant economic partner, China holds the most sway with Pyongyang, but it remained unclear if its latest action would be enforced enough to have any real impact. For all of the headline-grabbing pugnacity of Mr. Trump’s United Nations speech earlier this week, in which he mocked North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man” on a “suicide mission,” the president made it clear on Thursday that he was still open to negotiations. Asked by a reporter whether dialogue was still possible, he said, “Why not?” Mr. Kim, however, signaled no such openness. In a statement, he denounced Mr. Trump as a “rogue and gangster fond of playing with fire” and said that rather than deter him, Mr. Trump’s speech had convinced him that “the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last.” He vowed retribution: “I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.” "
537,"Jeffrey Mezger, chief executive of the homebuilder KB Home, will take a 25 percent cut to his year-end bonus as a result of his sexist and homophobic outburst against his neighbor, the comedian Kathy Griffin, the company said Thursday. Any similar incidents in the future, the company also said, would result in Mr. Mezger’s dismissal. Mr. Mezger was recorded on Saturday by security cameras at Ms. Griffin’s home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles shouting profanities and derogatory comments at Ms. Griffin and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, after they had called the police to complain about noise from Mr. Mezger’s backyard. The audio recording, published by HuffPost, provoked an immediate backlash on social media. KB Home, one of the largest homebuilders in the country, said that its board decided to reduce Mr. Mezger’s bonus, which he would receive at the end of its 2017 fiscal year in November. The value of the bonus, which KB Home called an annual cash incentive payment, is unclear. Last year, Mr. Mezger earned nearly $9 million in total compensation, making him the fifth-highest-paid chief executive among publicly traded homebuilding companies in the United States, according to Builder magazine. The board also said that it had told Mr. Mezger “if in the future there is any similar incident, he will be dismissed.” In a statement, the board said that Mr. Mezger has been a “very effective” executive and a “great leader” who has “always conducted himself in a professional manner.” “Mr. Mezger has the full and complete confidence of the board,” the statement said. “However, Mr. Mezger’s recent behavior in his personal dealings with a neighbor is unacceptable and a negative reflection on KB Home.” Engaging in problematic activity has forced several chief executives from their jobs. ■ Brian J. Dunn of Best Buy had a relationship with an employee (2012) ■ Matt Harrigan of PacketSled ranted on social media on election night about killing President-elect Trump (2016) ■ Scott Thompson of Yahoo was found to have padded his résumé (2012) ■ Kenneth Melani of Highmark got into a fight with the husband of his then-girlfriend, who was also an employee (2012) ■ Brendan Eich of Mozilla donated $1,000 in support of a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriage, causing outrage in Silicon Valley (2014) ■ Klaus Kleinfeld of Arconic wrote to a hedge fund manager without the board’s knowledge (2017). Mr. Mezger’s outburst stemmed from a strained relationship with Ms. Griffin and Mr. Bick, who live in the same upscale gated community. In the audio Mr. Mezger referred to Ms. Griffin using a crude reference to the female anatomy and a disparaging term for lesbians. He also mocked her shaved head, which was a gesture of support for her sister Joyce, who died of cancer last week. Soon after the audio was published, the former CNBC host Suze Orman called Mr. Mezger’s actions “disgraceful.” “You really want to buy a home from this man? Beyond disgusting,” Ms. Orman wrote on Twitter. "
538,"“As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first,” President Trump said. "
539,"President Trump’s inaugural committee, under fire for a delay in donating its remaining funds to charity, plans to give $3 million to three organizations involved in hurricane rescue efforts, officials said on Tuesday. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., chairman of the private Presidential Inaugural Committee, said the money will be divided equally among three groups — the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical group. All three groups are involved in relief efforts after a string of hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf Coast, Florida and the Caribbean. “The surplus of these privately donated funds will be put to great substantive use for relief victims throughout the heartbreaking regions of America impacted by the recent catastrophic disasters,” Mr. Barrack said in an email. “The committee will continue to curate worthwhile causes and make further contributions that serve America’s agenda and will conclude in accordance with its charter in the next few months,” he added. The committee raised $107 million for the inauguration, a record amount, accepting corporate individual donations in amounts up to $1 million. It remains unclear how much money the committee still has, and officials declined to say. They said they anticipated additional costs before winding down the committee. A spokeswoman for Melania Trump, the first lady, has said that some of the leftover funds have been used for renovations to the White House and Naval Observatory, home of the vice president. Mr. Barrack said the charities were involved in “disasters across America’s geographic palate.” "
540,"SAN DIEGO — On a dusty patch of land surrounded by a chain-link fence near the border here, workers this week began shoveling ground for a large-scale prototype for a border wall with Mexico. The eight different models of President Trump’s promised wall will range from 18 to 30 feet tall. Four will be made of concrete and four will use “other materials.” They are being built in a carefully protected area not far from a field, where, decades ago, Mexican migrants once openly gathered before crossing into the United States illegally. But in many ways a preview for a wall, and what it can and cannot accomplish, has been here for nearly two decades. Stretching roughly 20 miles along the southern edge of California and into the Pacific Ocean are two layers of steel and concrete, the toughest barrier in the country. The state has long been at the center of the debate over how to stop illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America. Now, the rest of the country is once again turning to the region that has long grappled with border security to see what the future of enforcement might look like. And despite California’s role as the epicenter for opposition to Mr. Trump, the administration apparently never considered placing the models of a would-be wall anywhere else. "
541,"Across the country N.F.L. players knelt or linked arms during the national anthem in a widespread demonstration against President Trump, who criticized athletes on Twitter and in a speech last weekend. In over 6,000 comments on the website of The New York Times and 4,600 more on The Times’s Facebook page, readers shared their reactions to the dramatic demonstrations. Some expressed pride over the display of free expression while others said that players only succeeded in disrespecting the American flag. Here is a selection of the thousands of comments we received, which have been edited for length and clarity. “I teach high school. Much to my students’ amazement, I have always explained that there could be no greater honor for the men and women who have given their lives for this country than not to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or the national anthem. I explain that they died precisely so that we would have that choice, not so that we may become automatons who stand and sit on cue.” As a three-tour combat vet of Iraq, I stand with these players to protest if they desire to do so. For those who oppose these N.F.L. players, I respect your right to do so. I served to protect all Americans not just the ones I agreed with. "
542,"WASHINGTON — The tax plan that the Trump administration outlined on Wednesday is a potentially huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans. It would not directly benefit the bottom third of the population. As for the middle class, the benefits appear to be modest. The administration and its congressional allies are proposing to sharply reduce taxation of business income, primarily benefiting the small share of the population that owns the vast majority of corporate equity. President Trump said on Wednesday that the cuts would increase investment and spur growth, creating broader prosperity. But experts say the upside is limited, not least because the economy is already expanding. The plan would also benefit Mr. Trump and other affluent Americans by eliminating the estate tax, which affects just a few thousand uber-wealthy families each year, and the alternative minimum tax, a safety net designed to prevent tax avoidance. The precise impact on Mr. Trump cannot be ascertained because the president refuses to release his tax returns, but the few snippets of returns that have become public show one thing clearly: The alternative minimum tax has been unkind to Mr. Trump. In 2005, it forced him to pay $31 million in additional taxes. Mr. Trump has also pledged repeatedly that the plan would reduce the taxes paid by middle-class families, but he has not provided enough details to evaluate that claim. While some households would probably get tax cuts, others could end up paying more. The plan would not benefit lower-income households that do not pay federal income taxes. The president is not proposing measures like a reduction in payroll taxes, which are paid by a much larger share of workers, nor an increase in the earned-income tax credit, which would expand wage support for the working poor. "
543,"The sidewalks of Sunset Park, in Brooklyn, were overflowing with bottled water and boxes of donations on Tuesday, most bound for Puerto Rico, others to Mexico. At an East Harlem fund-raiser, Puerto Rican poets shouted their verses above the thunderous roar of the Metro-North Railroad trains. New York is in aid-overdrive after hurricanes and earthquakes struck the homelands of two of its largest Spanish-speaking populations, Puerto Rico and Mexico. As the devastation of Puerto Rico, in particular, has become clear, and amid criticism of the Trump administration for what some say is a slow response to the island’s crisis, anxious New Yorkers have been stepping up. “I’ve been a community organizer for 20 years and I can tell you, the outpouring of support is overwhelming. It brought the community together in a way I have not experienced,” said Eddie Santiago, 53, who was loading boxes of supplies in Sunset Park. For those with family members in Puerto Rico, he added, “this allows us to keep our sanity and our spirits high.” Christina Torres, 32, wearing a Puerto Rican flag bandanna tied around a belt loop, has not been able to reach her 63-year-old mother in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria hit more than a week ago. Her mother has diabetes and asthma. “I’m all worked up, but this is my healing process,” Ms. Torres said as she packed cereal boxes to send over. The enthusiastic response has united Haitian activists, Colombian singers, Puerto Rican salsa bands, Chinese warehouse owners, New York police officers, Jennifer Lopez, a local Lions Club, a mosque and a Mexican entertainment mogul, to name a few. Planned New York fund-raisers include a rodeo, a 5K running race and a night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "
544,"In devising any complicated plan, there will be some knotty issues when it is tempting to offer vague promises of fixes that come later. The new Republican tax plan includes just such language, about a provision that wealthier Americans might find tempting to abuse. “The framework contemplates that the committees will adopt measures to prevent the recharacterization of personal income into business income to prevent wealthy individuals from avoiding the top personal tax rate,” says the tax reform blueprint presented on Wednesday by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration. It is an important asterisk to one of the core elements of the plan: a desire to tax income of “pass-through” businesses such as partnerships at a rate of only 25 percent. Currently, such income is taxed at the owners’ individual income tax rate, which is as high as 39.6 percent (and would fall to 35 percent in the Republican plan). The Republicans want the pass-through businesses to have a tax rate more in line with that of big, C-class corporations (which they are proposing to tax at 20 percent). But that vague language about the framework contemplating committees adopting measures shows that a fundamental question about this change remains unanswered. Namely, how do you reduce the rate on these pass-through businesses without also creating a wide-open lane for wealthy Americans to drastically reduce what they owe the government? The premise of having lower rates for businesses than individuals is to encourage investment and hiring, and achieve higher economic growth. The problem arises because there is often a fuzzy line between what constitutes “business income” and “labor income.” "
545,"The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience. Bassey Etim, our community editor, has responded to readers who questioned our policies governing which New York Times articles  are opened for comments: Why didn’t The Times’s community desk allow comments on a Sept. 23 article about men who believe the push for gender equality in technology has gone too far? The answer, I’m afraid, is rather dull: Our moderation resources are limited on weekends, which means fewer stories are opened for comment. And given the volume of news over the weekend — including President Trump’s continued criticism of N.F.L. players who are protesting the United States criminal justice system, and the declining fortunes of the Republican health care bill — many worthy news items had to forgo comments. Declining to host these discussions on nytimes.com is a difficult decision, but our research has consistently shown that Times readers prefer our moderated comments spaces. (Yes, most of our comments are still moderated by hand.) By weeding out trolling, abuse and off-topic content, we hope to create a space where everyone, no matter what their background or political beliefs, can feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. That said, we are continually working to expand our moderation capacity. But we won’t do so at the expense of abandoning our ideal of high-quality comments sections. "
546,"On the evening of Sept. 14, a man who looked an awful lot like Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president of the United States, boarded Air Canada Jazz Flight AC 8889 in Vancouver, British Columbia. He made his way down the aisle of the Bombardier CRJ 900, found his seat, 17A, in the economy cabin, then settled in for the 923-mile flight to his final destination, Whitehorse, in Canada’s Yukon Territory. He was carrying a camouflage backpack, but he checked some other luggage at the beginning of his journey, two cities earlier, at New York’s LaGuardia Airport. That luggage consisted of a high-end hunting bow and a duffel bag. Hunting bows are dangerous weapons, and when you travel from the United States to Canada with a bow, you are supposed to retrieve it and whatever other luggage you are traveling with at your initial port of entry, then escort it through customs for inspection before continuing your journey. He had entered Canada in Toronto but failed to retrieve his bow and duffel bag there, which is why, a half-hour after his flight arrived in Whitehorse, when most of the other passengers had long since gotten their things and gone on their way, he was still milling around the baggage carousel, looking increasingly forlorn, as it appeared his luggage was not going to show up. I was supposed to be on that same flight from Vancouver to Whitehorse — I spend a lot of time in the Yukon and keep an apartment there — but I’d missed a connection, so I was still in Vancouver when a Whitehorse friend who happened to be at the airport that night called to let me know about an unexpected visitor. “Are you sure it’s him?” “Yes.” “What’s he wearing?” “I don’t know … outdoorsy gear. Gore-Tex. Khakis and boots. Baseball cap.” “Is he with anyone?” “Yeah … older guy, squat and short. And a young kid, maybe early 20s. Southern accents.” “Are they Secret Service?” She didn’t think they were. They didn’t fit the template, physically or behaviorally. The kid, for one thing, was really young and acted it. He just seemed super psyched to be there, she said. Also, no earpieces. I asked her to look around again, to try to spot the agents, because I figured if it was him, they had to be there somewhere. As far as I knew, the president’s immediate family all had Secret Service protection, at all times. "
547,"OTTAWA — While President Trump has reserved his harshest words on trade for Mexico and China, Canada, one of America’s closest allies, has emerged as a major pressure point on trade, with the countries’ leaders trading barbs over lumber, dairy products, airplanes, and even magazine paper. In the latest move, the Trump administration imposed a huge tariff on a new aircraft made by Montreal’s Bombardier to compensate for what it deemed unfair subsidies by Canadian governments. The focus on Canada reflects the complexities that Mr. Trump faces in remaking the global rules of trade. He has threatened punitive tariffs on imported goods and vowed to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. He has promised to level the playing field with China and Mexico. But aggressively targeting China could disrupt the global supply chain, raising costs for American manufacturers. It could also inflame geopolitical tensions at a time when Washington needs Beijing’s help in dealing with North Korea. Relations with Mexico are already beleaguered over clashes on immigration, while taking on trade often means taking on exports from plants owned by American corporations. "
548,"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has aggressively pushed to dismantle regulations and downsize the organization, is threatening to reach outside his agency and undermine the Justice Department’s work enforcing antipollution laws, documents and interviews show. Under Mr. Pruitt, the E.P.A. has quietly said it may cut off a major funding source for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. Its lawyers handle litigation on behalf of the E.P.A.’s Superfund program seeking to force polluters to pay for cleaning up sites they left contaminated with hazardous waste. The E.P.A. reimburses the Justice Department for that work, paying more than $20 million annually in recent years, or enough for 115 full-time employees, budget documents show. But Mr. Pruitt has signaled that he wants to end those payments, potentially carving a major hole in the division’s budget, in a little-noticed line in the E.P.A.’s budget proposal in the spring. No decision will be made until Congress passes an E.P.A. budget for the fiscal year that begins in October, officials at both agencies said, although the payments were created by the executive branch, not Congress, so Mr. Pruitt may be able to act on his own. Congress hopes to pass a spending plan before a stopgap measure expires in mid-December. Mr. Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma with strong ties to the fossil fuel industry who frequently sued the E.P.A. before President Trump placed him in charge of it, has made no secret of his ambition to unwind its regulations and shrink its work force to curtail what he sees as federal overreach in protecting the environment and public health. The prospect of Mr. Pruitt expanding his efforts to the Justice Department has raised worries among employees in the Environment and Natural Resources Division about potential layoffs or furloughs and significant reductions in their work to fight pollution in the nation’s waterways, soil and air. Because they would continue to be responsible for pursuing Superfund cases, cutbacks would likely be spread across the division’s workload, which also includes suing oil companies, power plants and other corporations when they violate such antipollution laws as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act. "
549,"The first general election debate in the race for New York City mayor just got more crowded, if not more colorful, as organizers announced on Wednesday that Bo Dietl, the bombastic and frequently profane former police detective running on his own political line, will join Mayor Bill de Blasio and his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis. Mr. Dietl met the threshold of having raised and spent $500,000 so far, set by the city’s Campaign Finance Board, and received word from one of the debate’s media sponsors, Spectrum NY1, that he had been invited to the Oct. 10 debate. “I’m not going to be Wild Man Bo,” he said in a telephone interview, speaking from a senior center on Staten Island. “I’m going to be a gentleman with specific facts. I’ve got real numbers that I’m going to push.” The inclusion of Mr. Dietl, who had been a supporter of President Trump before his botched attempt to run as a Democrat in the mayoral primary left him without a party registration, could redound to the benefit of Mr. de Blasio. Any splitting of the right-of-center vote could make it hard for Ms. Malliotakis, an assemblywoman from Staten Island, and Mr. Dietl to overcome the mayor’s strong Democratic registration advantage. Voters drawn to the forceful anti-de Blasio rhetoric of Ms. Malliotakis may find themselves lured by Mr. Dietl’s pugilistic and occasionally impolitic delivery of the same message. He is running without major party backing on a “Dump the Mayor” line. A spokeswoman for Charter Communications, which owns NY1, said that “while Dietl is not enrolled in the campaign finance program, we have decided to invite him based on his showing in a recent poll and his regular presence on the campaign trail.” "
550,"WASHINGTON — Unwilling to accept defeat, President Trump insisted on Wednesday that Republicans “have the votes” to dismantle much of the Affordable Care Act, and he predicted that the Senate would vote on legislation to do that in the first three months of next year. In the meantime, he said, he intends to negotiate with Democrats on a bipartisan health care bill and issue a “very major executive order,” probably next week. Under the order, Mr. Trump said, “people can go out, cross state lines, do lots of things and buy their own health care.” Millions of people could benefit, he said. Mr. Trump’s seemingly contradictory comments to journalists mystified members of both parties in both houses of Congress. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, laughed when asked about Mr. Trump’s assertion that the votes were there for health care. “I’d like to know where they are,” Mr. Thune said. “He must be using a different calculator than the rest of us.” In the space of 10 minutes, the president said seven times that “we have the votes” on health care. But that appeared to be based on some erroneous or optimistic assumptions: That Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, was in the hospital and unavailable to vote, and that other Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were ready to vote yes. "
551,"SAN FRANCISCO — President Trump took aim at Facebook on Wednesday, calling the social network “anti-Trump.” But the social network insists it is pro-democracy and pro-truth — and the German election shows it. The president’s post on Twitter added to the pressure that Facebook has been under, facing accusations of partisanship from both sides of the political aisle. The social network has been accused of spreading fake news that influenced the outcome of the presidential election last year, and more recently, it acknowledged that Russians used fake accounts and Facebook ads to push divisive issues during the campaign. “Trump says Facebook is against him,” Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, said in a post addressing Mr. Trump’s tweet. “Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like.” The accusations have left Facebook with something to prove: that it is ready for the next election. “Every day I work to bring people together and build a community for everyone,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “We hope to give all people a voice and create a platform for all ideas.” Mr. Zuckerberg expressed regret for initially appearing dismissive of his company’s potential effects on the 2016 election, saying that the topic was “too important.” But he also repeated a point he has made many times — that Facebook’s broader impact, “from giving people a voice to enabling candidates to communicate directly to helping millions of people vote,” had a much greater effect on the election than that of misinformation on the platform. "
552,"Eight years after the Great Recession officially ended, the fruits of economic growth are finally spreading to low-wage workers, racial and ethnic minorities and other groups that were largely left out of the early stages of the recovery. But in a pattern that has become familiar in recent decades, the biggest gains continued to flow to the richest Americans. The typical American family had a net worth of $97,300 in 2016, up 16 percent from 2013 after adjusting for inflation, according to data released by the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday. The gains were broad-based, cutting across racial, educational and economic categories — a significant shift from the years immediately after the recession, when both income and wealth continued to decline for many families. But despite the gains, wealth also become more concentrated: • The richest 1 percent of households controlled 38.6 percent of total wealth in 2016, up from 36.3 percent in 2013. • The bottom 90 percent of households controlled 22.8 percent of all wealth. Inequality could grow even starker under the tax plan unveiled Wednesday by President Trump and congressional Republicans. That plan would sharply reduce taxes on corporations and certain forms of business income, as well as eliminate the estate tax, which falls on only the wealthiest households. Mr. Trump has said his plan would not reduce taxes on the rich over all, but most independent experts are skeptical of that claim. "
553,"SAN FRANCISCO — After a weekend when Americans took to social media to debate President Trump’s admonishment of N.F.L. players who do not stand for the national anthem, a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the issue with hashtags such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee. As Twitter prepared to brief staff members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, researchers from a public policy group have been following hundreds of accounts to track the continuing Russian operations to influence social media discourse and foment division in the United States. For three weeks, a harsh spotlight has been trained on Facebook over its disclosure that Russians used fake pages and ads, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign. But there is evidence that Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian influence campaign last year. In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using “bot” accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers. Twitter has struggled for years to rein in the fake accounts overrunning its platform. Unlike Facebook, the service does not require its users to provide their real name (or at least a facsimile of one) and allows automated accounts — arguing that they are a useful tool for tasks such as customer service. Beyond those restrictions, there is also an online black market for services that can allow for the creation of large numbers of Twitter bots, which can be controlled by a single person while still being difficult to distinguish from real accounts. Since last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts — human users and suspected bots alike — they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem. "
554,"President Trump and Republican leaders released their long-awaited tax plan on Wednesday, offering several misleading and false claims to bolster their framework for the overhaul. Here’s an assessment. The lack of details in the plan make it difficult to estimate how the cuts would be distributed across income levels, but Mr. Trump and the wealthy would “almost certainly benefit,” said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center. The Republican framework would eliminate the “death tax,” which applies to estates valued over $5.49 million in 2017. Mr. Trump has an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion. He might not personally see a tax break from the repeal, Mr. Williams said, because “he’ll be dead. But his heirs will.” The new plan also would repeal the alternative minimum tax, a parallel system of taxation that currently ensures that those who take deductions and try to exploit loopholes pay a minimum amount; it largely impacts people making between $200,000 and $1 million. Without this tax, Mr. Trump would have paid $31 million less in taxes in 2005, according to his tax return that year, which was disclosed on the “Rachel Maddow Show” in March. Reducing the top marginal income tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent would also benefit the wealthy, though the plan does not specify which income levels it would affect. Mr. Trump accurately said that the plan gives Congress leeway to raise the top rate. Scott Greenberg, of the conservative Tax Foundation, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about who would benefit more, given the scant level of specificity released. But he said “clearly some elements” of the plan would reduce the tax liability of high-income households. "
555,"After months of secret negotiations, the Trump administration and congressional leaders have come up with a tax plan — sort of. What they have really come up with is a wish list of tax cuts for the wealthy, with lots of “we’ll get back to you on that” promises where the details are supposed to be. This much is clear: The tax “framework” published by Republican leaders on Wednesday would greatly increase the federal deficit, would not turbocharge economic growth and could leave many middle-class families worse off by ending deductions they rely on. It would do little or nothing to improve the lot of the working class, a group President Trump says he is fighting for. It would instead provide a windfall to hedge fund managers, corporate executives, real estate developers and other members of the 1 percent. And can it be just a happy coincidence that Mr. Trump and his family would benefit “bigly” from this plan? On income taxes, the framework calls for reducing the top tax bracket to 35 percent, from 39.6 percent, which would benefit people earning $418,400 a year or more. It would also raise the rate for people in the lowest bracket to 12 percent, from 10 percent. Republicans say they will offset that particular burden by roughly doubling the standard deduction to $24,000 for a couple ($12,000 for a single person). In addition, the proposal would eliminate most itemized deductions except mortgage interest and charitable donations. This could greatly hurt middle-class families in New York, California and other states with high local and state taxes that the families will no longer be allowed to deduct from federal taxes. Under the guise of helping small businesses thrive and thereby creating jobs, the Republicans propose to lower the tax rates paid by people who earn money through private equity firms, partnerships, limited liability companies and other businesses — the very entities that Mr. Trump earns much of his income from. The framework would tax such so-called pass-through income at 25 percent, rather than at ordinary income tax rates. But here’s a depressing truth: The administration’s claims to the contrary, the plan would not help most small businesses, since they already pay less than 25 percent because their incomes put them in lower tax brackets. It would help millionaires, with the 400 richest households saving an average of $5.5 million, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Republicans want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which is primarily paid by upper-income families with lots of deductions. This tax accounted for a vast majority of the income tax Mr. Trump paid in 2005, according to a leaked copy of his return. And the framework would do away with the estate tax, which applies to estates larger than $5.49 million for an individual. Just 0.2 percent of the people who die every year owe the tax, and eliminating it would cost the government $269 billion over a decade. "
556,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • A remote textile plant in North Korea’s east may be secretly producing UDMH, the specialized fuel that has enabled country’s long-range missile launches. The plant is in Hamhung, which Kim Jong-un visited in 2013, above. The new finding comes from American researchers who used satellite imagery, a technical analysis of the fuel’s production methods, information from a North Korean official who defected, and a set of obscure North Korean technical documents. If true, it may be too late for outside curbs on North Korea’s missile program. _____ • The U.S. commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, left, lamented the “lopsided” trade relationship with China, after wrapping up his own meetings with top officials in Beijing ahead of a U.S. trade mission.

557,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Let’s talk taxes. President Trump unveiled a plan that would cut individual and corporate rates, amounting to the most sweeping tax overhaul in decades. “This is a revolutionary change,” Mr. Trump told supporters in Indianapolis. Here’s the video of his speech and the full proposal. Democrats jeered it as a boon for the rich. Our reporters are analyzing the plan. _____ 2. “Every Republican senator had better get prepared for a challenge from the far right.” That was Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader, after the defeat of Luther Strange in an Alabama primary last night. "
558,"MOBILE, Ala. — Senator Mitch McConnell and his minions wasted some $10 million — and President Trump squandered more of his shrinking political capital — trying to tell Alabama Republicans whom to choose as their nominee for the Senate. When their placeman, the temporary incumbent Luther Strange, lost by more than nine percentage points on Tuesday to Roy Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, their ham-handed interventions were exposed as flagrant political malpractice. It’s a familiar pattern. When Republican Party committees or groups backed by Mitch McConnell tried to dictate choices to Republican voters in Florida in 2010, they got Marco Rubio instead; in Texas in 2012, it was Ted Cruz; in Nebraska in 2014, it was Ben Sasse. Voters in Alabama, like their predecessors, told the Washington bully-boys to stuff it. State parties can choose their own nominees, thank you very much, without orders from a Republican politburo. Mr. Strange was never the front-runner. Smart Alabama analysts had rated Mr. Moore the likely winner from the day qualifying for this special election closed. Local considerations and reputations, not Washington’s feuds, set the parameters. But the McConnell gang’s activities, especially their mendacious and noxious substance and character, made it more likely rather than less that Mr. Moore would emerge as the nominee. The more they polluted the airwaves and local mailboxes with nasty, ludicrous attacks on Mr. Moore (my house received nearly 20 glossy, redundant and tone-deaf mailers in a single week), the more Alabamians were both disgusted by their vile tenor and reminded that Mr. Strange was the choice of the Washington insiders they despise. Alabamians found it insulting to be told by Washingtonians that they should vote for Mr. Strange over Mr. Moore because the latter was “a career politician.” Note to Washington: Southerners don’t see judges as politicians, especially when the judge in question twice relinquished his seat not for money but for what many cultural conservatives call principle. Further note: Voters damn sure think that the “career politician” gibe is hypocritical when it is employed on behalf of a longtime Washington lobbyist who was running his fourth political race since 2006.

559,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from our Los Angeles bureau chief, Adam Nagourney. It has long been one of the lesser-known facts about the life of Barack Obama. For all the talk about the former president and his Ivy alma maters — Columbia University and Harvard Law School — he actually spent the first two years of his higher education life, from 1979 to 1981, attending Occidental College in Los Angeles. For Occidental, or Oxy as it is known, Mr. Obama has long been its little-known claim to fame. That may be about to change for this 2,000-student private liberal arts college founded in 1887. Occidental is announcing on Wednesday the creation of the Barack Obama Scholars Program, a $40 million endowment intended to cover the $70,000 annual tab of tuition and board for 20 students a year. It will be aimed at providing four-year scholarships to veterans, community college transfers and those who are the first in their family to go to college. “My years at Occidental College sparked my interest in social and political causes, and filled me with the idea that my voice could make a difference,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. He said he hoped this program would “train the next generation of leaders and active citizens, and fill them with the conviction that they too can change the world.” "
560,"ARENYS DE MUNT, Spain — As Spain’s government tries almost everything it can to stop an independence referendum Sunday in the restive northeastern region of Catalonia, the standoff is escalating into a constitutional crisis emblematic of the larger forces tearing at European unity. With the support of the Spanish judiciary, Madrid has shut down websites and advertising campaigns that have promoted the vote. It has raided the offices of companies that would print the paper ballots. It has sent in thousands of police officers from outside the region, threatening to block polling stations. Last week, a dozen regional government officials were detained. Spain’s attorney general has warned that scores more could be arrested and prosecuted, including even the leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont. “We are witnessing the worst democratic regression since the death of Franco,” Mr. Puigdemont said in an interview, referring to Gen. Francisco Franco, the dictator whose death in 1975 opened the way for Spanish democracy. “What is happening in Catalonia is very serious.” Indeed, Catalonia’s standoff has steadily, if quietly, ratcheted up this year as world attention largely focused elsewhere, with pivotal elections taking place in critical European Union states, most recently last Sunday  in Germany. Those elections presented big tests of the bloc’s cohesion. The dispute over Catalonia instead presents a test of the cohesion of a member state itself. And it points to ominous storm clouds in other independent-minded regions, from Scotland to northern Italy. "
561,"After enthusiastically endorsing an Alabama senator’s campaign for re-election, President Trump distanced himself on Tuesday night from the candidate’s loss in the most Trumpian way possible: He deleted his supportive tweets. Hours after Senator Luther Strange, a Republican from Alabama, lost in Tuesday’s primary runoff, Mr. Trump excised at least three favorable Twitter posts, including one sent Tuesday morning. In that tweet, posted as the polls in Alabama opened, the president boasted that Mr. Strange “has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement.” Mr. Strange, who was appointed to the Senate early this year after Jeff Sessions vacated his seat to become attorney general under Mr. Trump, conceded on Tuesday night to Roy S. Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court justice whose candidacy was opposed by leading establishment Republicans. The deleted tweets were archived by ProPublica, a nonprofit journalism website, but are no longer public on Twitter, feeding into an intriguing legal debate about whether Mr. Trump is breaking the law when he expunges his tweets. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited Alabama on Friday to attend a rally for Mr. Strange. The closely watched campaign was seen by many as a barometer of Mr. Trump’s political sway. Mr. Strange was the first candidate endorsed by the president to lose an election since Mr. Trump took office. Around the same time the president was deleting tweets about Mr. Strange, he also deleted a tweet congratulating Mr. Moore on his victory. He later reposted that message, and early Wednesday he tweeted about speaking with Mr. Moore by telephone. "
562,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Late-night hosts heaped scorn on President Trump on Tuesday for what they called his slowness in addressing the fallout from Hurricane Maria. A week after the storm slammed Puerto Rico, Mr. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would go there to survey the damage. But Conan O’Brien says that with all Mr. Trump’s recent focus on N.F.L. protests, we can’t be sure he will. Seth Meyers was particularly upset that Mr. Trump chose Monday to remind his Twitter followers that Puerto Rico is in debt to Wall Street banks. "
563,"JARABULUS, Syria — Since 2011, the civil war in Syria has killed more than 470,000 people, mostly civilians. Millions of people have been displaced, and nearly five million Syrians have fled, creating the biggest refugee crisis since World War II. By far the greatest burden of receiving Syria’s refugees has fallen not on the United States or on Europe, but on Syria’s neighbors: Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Together, these countries are hosting most of the five million Syrians. Each is coping with huge challenges, with different degrees of success. In my visits to those three countries, I‘ve been struck by how much more dignity has been accorded to Syrian refugees in Turkey than in Jordan, and especially in Lebanon. Lebanon, with a population of six million, has long given refuge to Palestinians. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, some 450,000 Palestinian refugees are registered in Lebanon, most of them in camps. Even third-generation Palestinians born in Lebanon retain refugee status and live in refugee camps without a pathway to citizenship — almost 70 years after their ancestors arrived. Lebanese law even excludes refugees from most jobs. To this refugee population, Lebanon has now added an estimated 1.5 million Syrians. Many live in plastic tents in crowded camps with scarce access to clean water, surviving on aid from nongovernmental organizations. Because the Lebanese government doesn’t want the Syrians to become permanent residents as the Palestinians have, the camps are not officially recognized or managed by the United Nations. Resentment toward Syrian refugees has reached alarming levels. With elections next year, some Lebanese politicians are promising to deport the refugees once the war in Syria has been fought to a standstill. For the time being, Syrians receive charity, not dignity. Over the last 10 months, I visited several of these camps. In a camp in the Bekaa Valley, I met 12-year-old Nour and her sister, Aya, outside a bakery. As I stopped to buy sweets to celebrate the end of Ramadan, I asked Nour about her family. She told me that she and Aya had lost everyone. She now lives with her only remaining relative — an impoverished elderly aunt who has five children of her own. Nour hasn’t been to school since the outbreak of the war. In Lebanon, she spends her days in the street with her sister, begging. Nour and Aya are among thousands of Syrian children who have to roam the streets selling napkins, candies and bottled water. Others work on farms to support themselves and what is left of their families. "
564,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “This is like in war.” Those were the words of an emergency doctor in Puerto Rico, where hospitals have been crippled by flooding, damage and fuel shortages since Hurricane Maria battered the island. The airport has become a place of concentrated anxiety and long waits. Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland are relying on strangers to contact relatives back home, and millions across the Caribbean remain without power or clean water. Here’s how you can help. President Trump will visit Puerto Rico and the storm-ravaged Virgin Islands next week. He called his administration’s response to recent hurricanes “great,” “amazing” and “tremendous.” • Obamacare overhaul is dead, again. “We haven’t given up on changing the American health care system,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said on Tuesday, adding, “We are not going to be able to do that this week.” "
565,"Today, President Trump and Congress will officially make a tax overhaul their big priority. The president will begin laying out at least some details in a speech in Indiana. Here’s what would affect corporate America, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal: • The corporate tax rate would drop to 20 percent, from 35 percent. • A 25 percent tax on “pass-through” businesses. • A one-time low tax for companies repatriating offshore profits, followed by a lower tax on overseas profits going forward. But some analysts said they did not expect more just yet. From The Journal: And Politico’s Nancy Cook and Ben White report on worries among lawmakers and administration officials about what the president will say: Republicans will need to tread carefully. From a new poll by The Washington Post and ABC News: • More than seven in 10 adults felt the current system favors the wealthy. • About 65 percent of Americans said large corporations pay too little in taxes. • About 45 percent favored lowering taxes for businesses, while 48 opposed such a change. The Timeline • Both the House and the Senate need to approve the budget for the 2018 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. "
566,"Over the weekend, Aleta Clark, an anti-violence activist in Chicago, walked into two police stations and asked the officers inside to kneel with her for a photo. In the first station, the officers said no. In the second station, on Chicago’s South Side, they said yes. “That Moment when you walk into the police station and ask the Men of Color are they Against Police Brutality and Racism & they say Yes...” Ms. Clark wrote on Instagram. “Then you ask them if they support Colin Kapernick... and they also say yes... then you ask them to Kneel.!” By Tuesday morning, the photo was on the front page of The Chicago Sun-Times, and the officers were penalized for violating Chicago Police Department rules. Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for the department, said the officers — whom he would not name — had been reprimanded and given “retraining on applicable policies concerning conduct while on duty and in uniform.” Rule 42 in the department’s conduct guide prohibits uniformed officers from “participating in any partisan political campaign or activity.” In television interview clips that she posted on Instagram, Ms. Clark praised the officers for kneeling despite the risk to their jobs. "
567,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Insurgents fired dozens of rockets at the international airport in Kabul and near the American Embassy on Wednesday as the top leaders of the Pentagon and NATO met with the Afghan president. There was no physical threat to the president, Ashraf Ghani, or his guests, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, the first high-profile visitors to the presidential palace since the Trump administration announced a new Afghanistan strategy a month ago. But the rocket attack forced the airport to close temporarily, highlighted the country’s fragile security and demonstrated the insurgency’s reach in even the most fortified areas of the capital. Both the Taliban and the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said the group had sought to target the aircraft that brought Mr. Mattis to Kabul. It was not immediately clear if Mr. Mattis’s aircraft — or any other aircraft — had been hit. Reports of aircraft damage were denied by both the Afghan Air Force and American military officials. “There has been an attack, our special forces are dealing with it,” Mr. Ghani said at a news conference. “This attacking civilian targets is a sign of weakness, not strength.” "
568,"WASHINGTON — Has the Trump administration’s response to Hurricane Maria’s devastation in Puerto Rico been slower and stingier than for earlier storms in Florida and Texas? As hundreds of thousands of people on the island continue to struggle, critics have barraged the administration with complaints, and the administration has pushed back. Early Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security used a conference call with reporters to address one of the sorest points: a decision not to waive a little-known shipping law called the Jones Act for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the way the department had for areas affected by two previous storms. The law requires that all goods shipped from one American port to another be carried on American-registered ships with American crews. During Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the department waived the Jones Act’s restrictions so that foreign tankers could carry oil from the Gulf of Mexico to refineries on the East Coast, making up for pipelines that had been damaged by the storms. Waiving the law now would allow foreign cargo ships to carry supplies to the devastated islands from the American mainland. But Homeland Security officials defended their decision not to do so, saying on Wednesday that there were enough American ships to do the job and that the law’s restrictions should be set aside only when national security is at stake. Maria was the third major hurricane to confront the administration in a month. All three flooded towns and cities; knocked out power, cellphone coverage and water supplies; and wrecked houses and farms, businesses and infrastructure over wide areas. Some lawmakers have accused President Trump of failing to respond adequately to the crisis in Puerto Rico, saying that he spent this past weekend focused on football players kneeling during the national anthem instead. But an analysis of Mr. Trump’s actions paints a more complicated picture. White House statements show that Mr. Trump approved major disaster declarations and ordered federal aid for the states of Texas and Florida, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico equally quickly — in each case, on the day the hurricane made landfall. "
569,"MELBOURNE, Australia — With more and more N.F.L. players kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police killings of African-Americans, a familiar cry has resurfaced: Politics has no place in sport. But of course, politics has an unmistakable place in sporting history, and there is perhaps no more obvious example than the 1968 Olympics, when two African-American medalists raised their fists, eliciting outrage not just at the Americans but also at the Australian standing with them at the podium. Peter Norman, the Australian runner, knew in advance what the two other athletes — Tommie Smith and John Carlos — would be doing, and he was ostracized in Australia for years. Ray Weinberg, his coach, now says that watching the way Colin Kaepernick has been similarly pushed aside shows the lessons of tolerance and respect for dissent have yet to be learned. “I would suggest to you that they haven’t been learned at all,” Mr. Weinberg said in an interview on Wednesday. ”I don’t have a simple answer to it.” Australian athletes are paying close attention to the fierce conflict that Donald Trump has stirred up by repeatedly criticizing football players taking a knee and denying N.B.A. champions an invitation to the White House. Though the two countries’ histories are very different, they note, there are enough similarities when it comes to race and the backlash against protest for the situation in the United States to reignite this country’s own debate about sport, race and protest.

Alabama: President Trump traveled to Alabama on Friday to implore Republicans there to vote for incumbent Senator Luther Strange in Tuesday’s primary. They didn’t listen to the president. Roy Moore, a proud bigot, won instead. If you think I’m being too harsh in describing him that way, read his own words. He has argued that homosexuality should be illegal, Muslims should be barred from serving in Congress, 9/11 may have been divine retribution and Barack Obama wasn’t born here. Moore is even Trumpier than Trump. He is also likely to become Alabama’s next United States senator. Democratic wins: Meanwhile, the Democrats got good news in Florida, flipping a Republican seat in the State Senate. They also won a New Hampshire State House seat in a district Trump won handily last year. As I’ve mentioned before, the special election results since Trump’s inauguration have been excellent for Democrats. Tuesday’s winner in Florida, Annette Taddeo, was a victim of Russian dirty tricks in the 2016 campaign and told her story to my colleague Michael Barbaro in a podcast last year. Devastation: It is home to 3.4 million American citizens, more than Iowa or Nevada and more than Alaska, Vermont and the Dakotas combined. It is Puerto Rico, and the situation there is desperate. Hundreds of thousands of people lack electricity and drinking water, as a result of damage from Hurricane Maria. "
571,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Patricia Constantine thought hard about whether to use an image of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, in her entry to this year’s ArtPrize contest. The mixed-media painting depicts Ms. Constantine as a carnival freak suffering for the perceived misdeeds of Ms. DeVos and President Trump. But Ms. DeVos isn’t just your everyday target in Michigan: She and her family provide major financial support to the ArtPrize awards that might honor the very works that skewer her. “Am I going to back off because the DeVos family donates a lot of money to the city and her son founded ArtPrize?” Ms. Constantine, a professor of illustration at Ferris State University here. “What would that say to my students?” Her piece is one of more than 1,350 entries by artists from 47 countries in one of the art world’s most peculiar and richest competitions, now in its ninth year. Over a three-week period, this city hosts ArtPrize, which displays entries in public spaces around town and lets viewers choose the winners of half its $500,000 purse. Ms. DeVos’s son Rick conceived the competition and initially financed it. The 2017 competition, which culminates on Oct. 6, brings with it new curiosity and interest — as well as a more politicized flavor — because it is the first of the Trump era and the first since Ms. DeVos became education secretary. “Any artwork put into ArtPrize is going to be about ArtPrize, the DeVoses and Trump,” said Eric Millikin, an artist in Detroit whose entry, “Made of Money,” used a weave of actual dollar bills and digital manipulation to produce portraits of accomplished people who died poor. “I’ve always been conflicted about participating because of the DeVoses, but this year with Betsy DeVos in the federal government, it was a conflict I had to address.” "
572,"INDIANAPOLIS — President Trump on Wednesday began an ambitious push to slash taxes and salvage what remains of his embattled legislative agenda in Congress this year, proposing a politically challenging array of tax cuts for individuals and businesses that would constitute the most sweeping changes to the federal tax code in decades. Mr. Trump, smarting from the latest defeat this week of his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, cast the tax plan as an economic imperative and the fulfillment of a promise to his working-class supporters to deliver benefits in the form of lower taxes, better jobs and higher wages. “This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor and as wages start going up at levels that you haven’t seen in many years,” Mr. Trump told hundreds of supporters in a speech at the Indiana State Fair Grounds. But the president offered no measure of the plan’s cost and scant detail about how working people would benefit from a proposal that has explicit and substantial rewards for wealthy people and corporations, including the elimination of taxes on large inheritances and deep reductions in the rates paid by businesses large and small. After months of secret talks among Republicans, the nine-page proposal produced by the so-called Big Six working group prompts as many questions as it provides answers. Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul — or if it will favor the richest Americans. On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share. "
573,"I went to my first Kansas City Chiefs football game in December 2010, six months after my father, Army Col. John McHugh, had been killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul, Afghanistan. The team sent my newly minted Gold Star family pregame field passes and seats only a few rows behind the team’s bench. When we got to our seats after spending pregame on the field, I knew the national anthem was coming — and I knew how hearing this song would make me feel. (Even today, I still can’t listen to “The Star-Spangled Banner” without crying.) But when we stood to listen to the Eli Young Band, everything went wrong. They got the second verse wrong, and then got it wrong again when they did it over. “Get off the field, you’re drunk!” yelled a woman behind us who sported red-and-yellow face paint and seemed drunk herself. Once the band finally reached the end of the song, instead of singing “home of the brave,” the entire stadium screamed “home of the Chiefs!” They had replaced “brave” — a word that, to me, represented my father, a man who spent 24 years in the military and gave his life for the country — with a mascot. My blood boiled. “They do it at every game,” my boyfriend at the time whispered to me. Like it was no big deal. Just a football thing. The following year, I enrolled for college at Kansas State University, some 130 miles west of Arrowhead Stadium. At my first Wildcat football game in Bill Snyder Family Stadium, as I barely held myself together during the national anthem, the purple clad K-State fans shouted “Chiefs” in place of “brave.” We’re not even at a Chiefs game, I thought. Again, my blood boiled. "
574,"TV’s numerous series revivals usually make at least a gesture toward rationalizing why they need to tell one more story. “Twin Peaks: The Return” had Agent Cooper emerge from the Black Lodge after 25 years. “Gilmore Girls” brought Rory home to Stars Hollow after her grandfather’s death. “Will & Grace,” returning Thursday after eleven years, makes little such pretense. It’s back on TV because somebody at NBC wanted it back on TV. The 2006 no-longer-a-finale ended with Will Truman (Eric McCormack) and his best friend Grace Adler (Debra Messing) married to their respective lovers. Now, they’re not. A flash-forward introduced us to their two adult children meeting. Turns out the kids were never born. Why? The return episode suggests it was all a dream. Or part of it was. Most of it? Whatever. Do you want to watch the show or not? If you do, you’ll find — once you get past the painful first episode — pretty much what you would if you selected any random episode from the series’s eight-season run: a tart, high-strung quip-delivery device. Which is ... fine. The best and worst thing you can say about “Will & Grace” is that it’s the kind of half-hour confection that doesn’t cry out for obsession over narrative continuity. "
575,"We hear it all the time: Americans are more divided than ever, or at least since the Civil War. But the solar eclipse on Aug. 21 brought the United States together in greater numbers than most any national event in recent memory, according to a study released Tuesday by the University of Michigan. It estimated that 88 percent of American adults — about 215 million people — watched the solar eclipse, either in person or electronically. That’s nearly twice the number of people that watched the Super Bowl last year. It’s almost 30 percent more Americans than participated in the presidential election last year. If the eclipse had been a television program, it would have received the most viewers of any in American history; the audience for the cosmic event was almost 18 times as large as that of the “Game of Thrones” finale a week later. “This level of public interest and engagement with a science-oriented event is unparalleled,” said Jon Miller, director of the International Center for the Advancement of Scientific Literacy at the university’s institute for social research, in a statement. The number of viewers represents a greater percentage of Americans than those that brush their teeth daily, and more than double the number that floss daily, according to estimates from a 2014 survey. The study was conducted under a cooperative agreement with NASA. A follow-up survey is planned for October and November to see whether the viewing inspired people to seek out more information about astronomical occurrences. Most adults watched the eclipse, which was the first to be visible in some form coast-to-coast in the United States for nearly a century, with family, friends or co-workers. Though many documented the event using social media, only about 61 million people viewed it electronically, like via live streams, the study found. It suggested that about 70 percent of American adults, 154 million, had actually ventured outside to watch in person as the moon blocked out the sun. The eclipse was viewed by massive crowds in Oregon, Illinois, Kentucky and elsewhere. President Trump, Melania Trump and their son, Barron, watched the scene from the White House balcony in Washington, where President Trump dared to glance at the eclipse without wearing protective glasses. Space has had a uniting effect during turbulent times in America’s past. Even the huge number who witnessed the eclipse paled in comparison with those who tuned in to another lunar event: An estimated 600 million people worldwide watched the first moon landing on July 20, 1969. "
576,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, is not a man who leaves things to chance. But this week, in both policy and politics, Mr. McConnell gambled — and lost big. The defeat of Senator Luther Strange, the Alabama Republican who was defending the Senate seat he was appointed to, coupled with the implosion of the party’s last-ditch attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, marked twin setbacks for Mr. McConnell, who is struggling to govern with an already slim majority. Now, a majority leader celebrated for years as a brilliant tactician looks vulnerable — to dissent within his Senate conference and to insurgents from President Trump’s populist wing of the party, who are looking to storm the Senate in 2018. And if Republicans fail to fulfill their next promise — overhauling the tax code — the consequences will be dire. “We have to deliver on tax reform,” said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, who is a member of the party’s leadership. “I don’t think failure is an option.” The Alabama race, and the unsuccessful repeal effort, have exposed how deeply dissatisfied conservatives are with Mr. McConnell, a taciturn Kentuckian who has been in the Senate since 1985 and has led his conference for the past decade. Even Mr. McConnell’s allies concede that the failure to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s health care law helped fuel the outcome in Alabama. “There is this acute, continued frustration amongst the Republican base at the sluggishness of the Trump agenda in Washington,” said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Mr. McConnell. “That’s not imagined; that’s real.” "
577,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — In “The Mayor,” a new ABC comedy series that premieres on Oct. 3, Brandon Micheal Hall plays Courtney Rose, a struggling rapper who runs for mayor of a small Northern California town in an ill-considered scheme to get the word out about his mixtape. Free publicity, no risk of actually winning — what could go wrong? Of course, Courtney does win, much to everyone’s surprise. Had Mr. Hall ever been in a similar predicament, where he chased after something he figured he had little shot at, and then got it? “I’m actually having that experience right now,” he said. In a Cinderella story that mirrors his character’s, this is Mr. Hall’s first leading role in a series, and by far the biggest role of his young career. The 24-year-old actor had appeared in six episodes on the TBS series “Search Party”; before that, he had appeared in single episodes as a rookie cop (on CBS’s “Unforgettable”), another rookie cop (in the Netflix series “The Characters”) and a delivery guy (on Comedy Central’s “Broad City”). “For ‘Broad City,’ I got to kiss Abbi Jacobson, so that was fun,” he said. Mr. Hall has strong comedic backup on “The Mayor,” most notably Lea Michele (“Glee,” “Scream Queens”) as his chief of staff and Yvette Nicole Brown (“Community”) as his mother. Rounding out the cast are the relative newcomers Marcel Spears and Bernard David Jones, as Courtney’s old pals turned City Hall staffers. “Those are my boys,” Mr. Hall said. “We’re going through this journey together, because it’s new for all of us. We’re like a boy band.” And then there’s Daveed Diggs, the Oakland-based rapper and Tony-winning actor (“Hamilton”), who is writing raps for every episode and coaching Mr. Hall on how to deliver them. (Mr. Diggs is also one of the show’s executive producers, a fact prominently displayed in the show’s trailer.) “What we’re asking Brandon to do is crazy,” Mr. Diggs said. “I recorded 100 songs before I let anybody hear them, but his first recorded songs are going to be out there for the public.” "
578,"WASHINGTON — Tom Price’s fondness for taxpayer-funded private jet trips drew the ire on Wednesday of President Trump, who said he was disappointed in his secretary of health and human services, and would personally examine any financial malfeasance. Mr. Trump, who vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would wring the capital of excess financial waste, publicly voiced his disapproval of Mr. Price for taking dozens of privately chartered flights that crisscrossed the nation to resort areas and conferences, racking up a tab of $400,000. Before departing on a trip to Indiana to pitch his tax rewrite plan, the president, who has not released his tax returns or completely divested himself from his real estate empire, sought to put out the latest ethical fire set by a member of his cabinet. “I was looking into it, and I will look into it. And I will tell you personally, I’m not happy about it,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Price. “I am not happy about it. I’m going to look at it. I am not happy about it, and I let him know it.” According to a senior administration official familiar with Mr. Trump’s thinking, the president’s willingness to ferret out financial wrongdoing is not good news for Mr. Price, a physician and a former Georgia congressman who has been a vocal proponent of cost-cutting within his own agency. Mr. Trump, who is known to dislike appearances of financial waste, is said to be increasingly frustrated with a series of reports published by Politico about Mr. Price’s spending habits. Politico has revealed that Mr. Price has made at least 26 such flights, including trips to Nashville, where his son lives and where Mr. Price owns a condominium, and to St. Simons Island, a Georgia resort area where Mr. Price owns property and recently spoke at a medical conference. Mr. Price also chartered a flight that included travel to Philadelphia from Dulles International Airport in Virginia, a distance of about 130 miles. "
579,"To the Editor: Re “Tyranny of the Minority” (column, Sept. 26): Brava to Michelle Goldberg on her first New York Times column. To protect our democracy, at least three things must happen. First, gerrymandering on partisan-politics grounds must be declared as impermissible as it is on racial and other historically invidious grounds. Second, voter suppression laws must be outlawed. Third, and perhaps the linchpin of the foregoing, we must correct the absurdity of according the same free speech rights to business entities as are vouchsafed to actual human beings. Unfortunately, these issues will have to be battled before the Supreme Court, where, alas, the rich and powerful currently control the spoils of constitutional interpretation. LINDA RABIN HAMMELL
LATHRUP VILLAGE, MICH. To the Editor: Bill Clinton was twice elected president with less than 50 percent of the popular vote, admittedly in three-way races. Did his presidency constitute undemocratic, minority rule? Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 1.5 million votes in the 49 states outside of California. Should California have the power to outweigh a majority in the other 49 states? Mr. Trump carried 30 of 50 states. Would it be more democratic if the winner in only 20 states became president? I’m no Trump supporter, but the arguments in this column don’t amount to much more than liberal whining about the fact that someone the left despises was elected president. Democrats, get your voters out. They probably constitute a majority, but if they can’t be bothered to turn out, what do you expect? "
580,"Roy S. Moore, who won a special Republican primary runoff for an Alabama Senate seat on Tuesday, is a staunch evangelical Christian, and his often-inflammatory political beliefs are informed by his strongly held religious views. He has condemned homosexuality and used offensive language when talking about race, recently referring to Native Americans and Asian-Americans as “reds and yellows.” His insistence on the primacy of religion over American law has twice led him to be taken off the Alabama Supreme Court: once in 2003, for refusing to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from the courthouse, and again in 2016, when he asked state probate judges to disregard a federal ruling on same-sex marriage. Here are some of the ways that Mr. Moore has described his own views in the past. Mr. Moore has long been virulently opposed to gay marriage and has condemned same-sex relations altogether. In a 2002 concurring opinion in a case that granted a lesbian custody of her son, he wrote, “Homosexual behavior is a ground for divorce, an act of sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one’s ability to describe it.” He added that homosexuality could disqualify parents from having the right to custody. “I write specially to state that the homosexual conduct of a parent — conduct involving a sexual relationship between two persons of the same gender — creates a strong presumption of unfitness that alone is sufficient justification for denying that parent custody of his or her own children or prohibiting the adoption of the children of others,” the opinion read. "
581,"ORLANDO, Fla. — The American fast food industry is built on two pillars: cheap hamburgers, and cheap labor. As economists try to understand why wages have stagnated across the country’s economy, they are examining the cheap labor part of the equation closely. A few have zeroed in on an obscure clause buried in many fast-food franchise agreements as a possible contributor to the problem. Some of fast-food’s biggest names, including Burger King, Carl’s Jr., Pizza Hut and, until recently, McDonald’s, prohibited franchisees from hiring workers away from one another, preventing, for example, one Pizza Hut from hiring employees from another. The restrictions do not appear in a contract that employees sign, or even see. They are typically included in a paragraph buried in lengthy contracts that owners of fast-food outlets sign with corporate headquarters. Yet the provisions can keep employees tied to one spot, unable to switch jobs or negotiate higher pay. A lack of worker mobility has long been viewed as contributing to wage stagnation because switching jobs is one of the most reliable ways to get a raise. Defenders of the practice argue that the restaurants spend time and money training workers and want to protect their investment. But two lawsuits, filed this year against McDonald’s and Carl’s Jr.’s parent company, CKE Restaurants Holdings, contend that such no-hire rules violate antitrust and labor laws. "
582,"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico discussed the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and the needs of island residents with a reporter from The New York Times on Tuesday. Here are his remarks, edited for length and clarity. Q. What keeps you up at night? A. The safety of the people of Puerto Rico. I haven’t slept much. It’s been very intense, but I am committed to making sure that during this emergency period we have our people safe, we can make sure they are alive, getting food and water. After we stabilize the situation, we can think about how to rebuild Puerto Rico. Q. What’s your biggest worry? A. Here’s my worry: the perception that this is just, for lack of a better term, this was a regular hurricane impact. This is a major catastrophic event here. Puerto Rico, within the span of two weeks, received two Category 4-5 hurricanes. That has never happened anywhere. The devastation has been enormous. Q. Have you spoken to President Trump? A. I have spoken to him at least five times. A few hours ago, I was in the Situation Room briefing him. He has been acting proactively. He issued two pre-landfall emergency declarations for Puerto Rico. That had never been done before. He declared Puerto Rico a disaster area practically while the storm was still hitting Puerto Rico. Q. What do you tell him? The phones are down; the lines are around the streets and back; hospitals are closed. Where do you begin to tell him what you need? A. There are several priorities. The health care situation, making sure we have hospitals running, making sure we have situational awareness of those hospitals. "
583,"The N.F.L. has been loud lately. Its sponsors, not so much. The debate over players’ kneeling during the national anthem — simmering since last year, when the San Francisco 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick knelt to protest police brutality against African-Americans — boiled over last week when, during a speech in Alabama, President Trump declared that players like Mr. Kaepernick ought to be fired. Far from discouraging the protests, Mr. Trump’s remarks galvanized them, and on Sunday, players nationwide knelt or locked arms in a show of solidarity against the president. In one of his signature Twitter outbursts, Mr. Trump called on football fans to boycott the N.F.L. It is hard to say whether the fans are on board, but the league’s sponsors evidently are not. Few of them have commented on the protests at all — perhaps reflecting a calculation that this is a controversy best kept out of — and what response they have given has consisted, for the most part, of bland statements. Here’s a roundup of advertisers’ reactions, most of which come from public statements made by the companies. Anheuser-Busch and Bose spoke with Yahoo Finance. NIKE: “Nike supports athletes and their right to freedom of expression on issues that are of great importance to our society.” ANHEUSER-BUSCH: “At Anheuser-Busch we have a long heritage of supporting the institutions and values that have made America so strong. That includes our armed forces and the national anthem as well as diversity, equality and freedom of speech. We proudly employ over 1,100 military veterans and we work every day to create an inclusive environment for all of our employees. Because only together can we achieve our dream of bringing people together for a better world.” BOSE: “Bose was founded in the United States, and our world headquarters is in Massachusetts, where it’s been for over 50 years. It’s now surrounded by several other Bose facilities — and at all of them, at all times, we proudly fly the American flag. It’s a symbol of our great country which protects the freedom for every person to express their views. We respect that freedom, whether we agree with those views or not.” FORD: “We respect individuals’ rights to express their views, even if they are not ones we share.” HYUNDAI: “We stand for and respect individuals’ freedoms to express their First Amendment rights in any peaceful manner in which they choose. We also stand for inclusion, freedom and all that represents those values.” UNDER ARMOUR: The company “stands for the flag and by our athletes for free speech, expression and a unified America.” The N.F.L.’s other sponsors include Barclays, Bridgestone, Campbell’s, Castrol, Dannon, DMI, Extreme Networks, FedEx, Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Marriott, Mars, Microsoft, Nationwide, News America, Papa John’s, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, Quaker, USAA, Verizon and Visa.

584,"Paul Horner, a writer who trolled the nation with his fabricated news stories and claimed that he was responsible for Donald J. Trump’s election victory, died last week. The cause was a suspected drug overdose, the authorities in Arizona said Wednesday. Mr. Horner, 38, was found dead in his bed in Laveen, Ariz., on Sept. 18, according to Mark Casey, a Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office spokesman. His family said he had been known to abuse prescription drugs, Mr. Casey said, and “evidence at the scene suggested this could be an accidental overdose.” There were no signs of foul play. Mr. Horner’s fraudulent articles could be found on Facebook, various news domains that he created, and in years past, on the fake news website National Report. Even his byline was fake. He often went by the name Jimmy Rustling, as he did on this story, in which he claimed protesters were getting paid $3,500 to disrupt Trump rallies. That article, which was tweeted out by Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, now has a taunting disclaimer at the top that says the story isn’t real: “I personally went to two Donald Trump rallies and I can say with 100% certainty that NONE of the protesters were getting paid,” the statement says. “This story I wrote is mocking all of you sheep who think protesters are getting paid.” "
585,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Republicans are confronting an insurrection on the right that is angry enough to imperil their grip on Congress, and senior party strategists have concluded that the conservative base now loathes its leaders in Washington the same way it detested President Barack Obama. The defeat of Senator Luther Strange, Republican of Alabama, in a primary election on Tuesday night appears to have ushered in a season of savage nomination fights and activist-led attacks on party leaders, especially on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Despite enjoying the strong backing of President Trump, Mr. Strange lost by a wide margin to Roy Moore, a firebrand religious activist and former judge, who denounced Mr. Strange as a puppet of the Senate leader. Mr. Strange’s demise, senior party strategists and conservative activists said Wednesday, makes it likelier that Republican incumbents in the House and Senate will face serious primary challenges in 2018, fueled by anger at the party’s apparent ineptitude at wielding power in Washington. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist and a vehement antagonist of the party establishment, said on Tuesday night that he intends to target Republican senators in Mississippi, Arizona and Nevada for defeat. And that rebellion could spread. Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader, was blunt: “Every Republican senator had better get prepared for a challenge from the far right.” If nothing else, divisive intraparty battles could cost party donors tens of millions of dollars and weaken Republicans’ position in a year when Democrats were already poised to make gains, at least in the House. They could also reshape the party’s agenda, driving it further in the direction of Mr. Trump’s strain of nationalism rather than the more conventional, business-oriented agenda espoused by Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Republicans increasingly worry that their base’s contempt for Mr. McConnell is more potent than its love for Mr. Trump. Mr. McConnell could be an anchor around incumbents in the same fashion as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is routinely used to undermine Democratic candidates. The loudest applause Mr. Moore received during an election-eve rally came when he declared, “Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced.” "
586,"BRIGHTON, England — Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, told supporters on Wednesday that their brand of left-wing politics had brought them to “the threshold of power,” as he ended an annual conference that consolidated his grip over the party and marked another stage in his journey from fringe politician to potential prime minister. In a speech of around 80 minutes, Mr. Corbyn mocked his detractors, including Prime Minister Theresa May, and criticized President Trump, winning frequent applause from party members who have been buoyed by Labour’s performance in elections in June, which exceeded most expectations and deprived Mrs. May and her Conservative Party of a parliamentary majority. The four-day meeting, in the seaside city of Brighton, underscored Labour’s shift to the left, focused in large part around Mr. Corbyn, who was once seen by many in his party as an electoral liability. In some respects a British version of Bernie Sanders, Mr. Corbyn, 68, has championed an agenda that includes nationalizing utilities, abolishing university tuition fees and increasing taxes for the wealthy and for corporations. Mrs. May built her election campaign around the assumption that, with his left-wing platform, Mr. Corbyn was unelectable, but many voters saw Mr. Corbyn as personable and authentic, compared with wooden performances from the prime minister. A member of Parliament since 1983, he spent years as a backbencher before winning a once-improbable bid for leadership of the party after Labour lost a general election in 2015. On Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn mocked Mrs. May’s campaign claims that she provided “strong and stable” leadership and that voting for Labour would usher in a “coalition of chaos.” "
587,"To the Editor: Re “The Abbie Hoffman of the Right,” by David Brooks (column, Sept. 26): Calling the late Abbie Hoffman a buffoon and comparing him to President Trump sullies the reputation of a 1960s activist who was a leader of a youth movement that changed the course of American history. Yes, Mr. Hoffman was a master of “political theater,” but he was no buffoon. Mr. Hoffman took to the streets of a divided America, risking life and limb in opposition to the Vietnam War, racism and police brutality. He lived a simple, self-sacrificial life and faced trumped-up charges as a member of the Chicago Eight. What risks for his beliefs has President Trump taken? PATRICK O’NEILL, GARNER, N.C. "
588,"LONDON — This week’s Labour Party conference, an annual gathering and one of the landmark events of the British political calendar, had an unexpected attendee: a bodyguard. He was not there to protect Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s leftist leader, or any of the party’s grandees. Instead he guarded Laura Kuenssberg, the political editor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. As one of Britain’s leading political journalists, with a reputation for asking tough questions, and as a woman, Ms. Kuenssberg has long been the target of vitriolic abuse and threats of violence. But the sight of her being shadowed by a guard, and the realization that her employers must now deem those threats credible enough to warrant giving her protection, has shocked some members of the British commentariat. “It is so profoundly depressing,” said Jenni Russell, a prominent columnist and former BBC editor who also attended the conference. “The graphic level of threats to women is quite extraordinary and it’s one of the worst things to have happened in recent British public life.” Multiple journalists have seen Ms. Kuenssberg with a guard this week, although she and the BBC both declined to comment, or to confirm or deny the news. Others spoke of how her experience was part of an international trend in which public discourse has become more venomous, and trust in mainstream journalists has eroded. Her case has some parallels with the intimidation of journalists at rallies during President Trump’s election campaign, in particular of Katy Tur, an NBC correspondent who was protected by a Secret Service agent as she left a rally in 2015 at which the future president had singled her out for criticism. "
589,"I believe Valerie Plame, the former C.I.A. operative and fading liberal celebrity, when she says she missed the anti-Semitic “undercurrents” in an article she called “provocative, but thoughtful.” I believe her when she says she “zeroed in on the neocon criticism” but missed the article’s more prejudicial elements. The article was titled “America’s Jews Are Driving America’s Wars.” It uses variants of the word “Jew” 22 times. The word “neocons” appears only twice. I believe Plame is telling the truth when she says the subtlety was lost on her. I believed Donald Trump when he insisted last year there was nothing amiss with him tweeting the image of a six-pointed star superimposed over a pile of $100 bills alongside a picture of Hillary Clinton and the caption “Most corrupt candidate ever!” I believe him when he said it was a sheriff’s star, not a Star of David. I did not believe white supremacist David Duke when he said there was “no way” it was a sheriff’s star. What does David Duke know about dog whistles anyway? I believe the national council of the American Studies Association was taking an “ethical stance” when it voted unanimously in 2013 for an academic boycott of Israeli institutions. I find nothing askance in the association never previously boycotting the institutions of any other country. I believe the group’s then-president, Curtis Marez, made a valid argument that Israel was targeted because “one has to start somewhere.” I believe the A.S.A. will one day get around to boycotting the academic institutions of China for its occupation of Tibet, or of Russia for its occupation of Ukraine, or of India for its alleged occupation of Kashmir. I believe there’s nothing discriminatory in singling out the Jewish state for behavior the A.S.A. accepts from other states. "
590,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Restrictions on North Korea are expanding. China is closing joint ventures and ordering North Korean companies to leave by January. South Korea is strengthening pre-emptive strike, defense and retaliatory capabilities. (Above, President Moon Jae-in at an Armed Forces Day ceremony on Thursday.) And Malaysia barred its citizens from traveling to the country, complicating an Asian Cup soccer match set for next Thursday in Pyongyang. The story of two North Korean spies arrested in Ukraine in 2011 shows the extent to which Pyongyang has scoured the world for missile technology. _____ "
591,"Luis Rivera-Pérez was a baby-faced 18-year-old recruit when he left his home in San Juan in 1951 to fight in Korea with the 65th Infantry Regiment, a storied Puerto Rican unit known as the Borinqueneers. He aged quickly in combat, venturing out on night patrols where they used flamethrowers to incinerate enemy troops hidden in caves. In one battle, they slogged up a hillside for a bayonet assault, only to be pinned down by relentless gunfire. “It was a massacre,” said Mr. Rivera-Pérez, 84. “There were so many wounded and dead.” He was among a group of Borinqueneers — a name rooted in the island’s past — who were pinned down again this week, this time in a hotel in a drab industrial corner near Kennedy International Airport in Queens. They were en route to Puerto Rico from South Korea, where they had been honored by its government for their military service, when Hurricane Maria devastated their island home, leaving them stranded with little word from relatives and friends. Just as scarce was encouragement from President Trump, their commander in chief, who has been faulted by many for spending more time attacking football players exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest than addressing the mounting humanitarian crisis. They were flabbergasted when the president’s first substantive remarks about the tragedy was how the island “sadly” had to deal with the $73 billion debt it owes hedge funds and banks. They felt it was an insult to them — American citizens by act of Congress and birth — who felt they had already paid a steep price in blood and youth decades ago. Indeed, this fighting force — lauded by no less than Gen. Douglas MacArthur — has seen action from World War I through Korea, and was among the last of the segregated military unit to be disbanded. Their bravery and sacrifice is chronicled in citations, medals and etched on headstones and remembered in street names and on postage stamps. On their recent South Korea trip, strangers stopped them on the street to offer thanks and gratitude. “The Koreans respect and love us more than our own people in the United States,” lamented Victor Santiago Latimer, 87, another veteran still living with emotional and physical wounds from the conflict. “The president should be a man with a bigger heart and take care of things. Right now he says we have to pay the debt. What does he mean? That we owe and get nothing in return? Every day the U.S. takes away from what we have. We’re not a state, but we’re part of the U.S., but he is not interested in that. When we went to war, the Puerto Ricans were hand in hand with the U.S. We defended the nation. We were with you. Why are we not treated well?” That last question has been asked by generations of Puerto Ricans, from those living on an island whose fate rests with Congress, to those who came to New York and endured prejudice and indifference from their fellow citizens as they worked hard at blue-collar jobs. More recently, the island’s fiscal crisis has sparked a new exodus, including many professionals, to outposts like Orlando, Fla. "
592,"By any measure, Tahseen Chowdhury is no ordinary 17-year-old. He is president of the student government at Stuyvesant High School, among New York City’s most selective public schools, and leads the student advisory council for the borough of Manhattan. He even helped found two companies: an event photography business and a firm that teaches students computer programming and engineering. It stands to reason that Mr. Chowdhury, a senior, would cast the widest possible net when applying to college. But he is confining his search to New York — and not because he needs to stay close to family in East Elmhurst, Queens. Rather, Mr. Chowdhury, a Democrat, is mounting a campaign for the State Senate, and wants to be within striking distance of the State Capitol in Albany. With the State Legislature in session from January to June, Mr. Chowdhury envisions an unusual schedule of alternating semesters, one that would spread his college career over eight years. “If I win, I would take the spring semesters off to be in Albany and then go to college in the fall,” he said. “I will have to choose a college that will work with that schedule.” Mr. Chowdhury’s campaign is hardly unique. Across the New York region, and indeed the country, young people are turning their attention to politics, motivated in part by the election of President Trump. From mayoral races to state legislative campaigns, teenagers and others who are too young to vote are canvassing neighborhoods and learning the intricacies of electoral politics. Some are running for office themselves. The trend is heartening to academics and observers of public service like Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz. Dr. Benjamin said he has long detected a distinct lack of interest in elective office in young people, even those otherwise active in environmental advocacy and identity politics. "
593,"Oakland, Calif. — Young migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador come to this country fleeing violence and lives that are often dictated by savage gangs. It’s expensive to get here. They often arrive with thousands of dollars of high-interest debt and little or no English skills. And they face an administration that insists that they are gangsters bringing bloodshed and gang warfare to American cities. In fact, these young people are often fleeing gangs. And the challenges they face in the United States make them particularly vulnerable for recruitment into the same violent gangs they left home to escape. “They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful quiet neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields,” President Trump said of the members of MS-13, a transnational gang composed largely of Central American youth; its activity has been growing in recent years, both in the United States and in Central America. A few weeks ago, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told law enforcement officers that these young, undocumented immigrants were “wolves in sheep’s clothing.” I work at Oakland International High School in Oakland, Calif. It is a public school with a population made up entirely of recently arrived immigrant students. Today, over 25 percent are unaccompanied minors — young people who crossed into the United States without papers or parents — who have been released from immigration custody and placed in deportation proceedings to await their day in court. Since we opened 10 years ago, our students’ gang involvement has markedly decreased. This is because we have gotten better at what we were meant to do, namely: provide programs that teach skills, offer support services that reduce barriers to coming to school, and foster a sense of community. We offer what the gangs offer, but better. I had one student who came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor from Honduras. His mother left him when he was little, and he never knew his father. He lived with his grandmother until she died. He was just 13. For two years he lived alone in her house, selling water bottles on the street on behalf of a neighboring family. Sometimes they invited him over for dinner; other times they didn’t. He told me that he saw this life in Honduras as a dead end. He crossed into Guatemala, rode on top of trains through Mexico, hiding what little money he had pressed against the inside of his cheek, and swam across the Rio Grande. He was apprehended at the border, placed into a youth detention center, and sent to live with his aunt in Oakland, pending his deportation hearing. He enrolled at Oakland International but, after a couple of weeks, his attendance waned. Soon he stopped coming altogether. "
594,"BARCELONA — A mayor from the Spanish hinterland, Carles Puigdemont was a relative unknown until thrust into the leadership of Catalonia last year. He was a compromise choice to break a deadlock among separatist parties. It was “a last-minute and accidental arrival through the back door,” Mr. Puigdemont recalled in an interview this week at the Gothic palace of his regional government in Barcelona. Now, as Catalonia attempts to hold an independence referendum on Sunday, Mr. Puigdemont, 54, sits at the heart of a constitutional crisis for Spain, an insurgent in the eyes of Madrid. If the vote goes on, as he says it will, Mr. Puigdemont (pronounced POOTCH-da-mon) could be barred from politics and go to prison for misusing public money to hold a referendum that Spanish courts have ordered suspended. The prospect seems to leave him unbothered. Mr. Puigdemont may be an accidental leader, but he is a purposeful proponent that Catalonia — prosperous and distinct in culture, history and language — should be independent. A former journalist, with a Beatles mop-top haircut, he was already calling for separation from Spain on the streets of Barcelona in the early 1980s, when secessionism was a marginal movement in Catalonia. "
595,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security will soon begin collecting social media data from all immigrants entering the United States, part of what agency officials call an effort to more effectively screen those coming to the country but privacy advocates see as an unnecessary intrusion that would do little to protect national security. The department will begin collecting the information on Oct. 18, the same day the Trump administration’s new travel ban on citizens of seven countries and restrictions on those from two others are set to take effect. Green card holders and naturalized citizens will also have their social media information collected, with the data becoming part of their immigration file. It was unclear whether the monitoring would take place only in the application process or could continue afterward. The department published the new requirement in the Federal Register last week, saying it would collect “social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results,” which would be included in an applicant’s immigration file. It said the data would come from “publicly available information obtained from the internet, public records, public institutions, interviewees, commercial data providers.” The data collection has alarmed privacy groups and lawyers, who expressed concerns on about how the department would use the information. Advocates say they also worry that the monitoring could suck in information on American citizens who communicate over social media with immigrants. “This would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the free speech that’s expressed every day on social media,” Faiz Shakir, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “This collect-it-all approach is ineffective to protect national security and is one more example of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda.” "
596,"On a gray day in late January — four days after President Trump’s inauguration and three days after the Women’s March — I received a call from the newly constituted office of Ivanka Trump. I was invited to the White House to discuss a computer-science education initiative she was spearheading. She wanted the organization I founded, Girls Who Code, to join. Despite my deep personal opposition to many of the positions President Trump had already expressed, I was prepared, in the interest of furthering our mission, to collaborate with his new administration the way we had with the Obama administration. Three days later, the president signed Executive Order 13769, which indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States and blocked citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entry for 90 days, keeping the “Muslim Ban” promise Trump made on the campaign trail. I immediately thought of the many young immigrants — including Syrian refugees — who participate in Girls Who Code, which is dedicated to educating, empowering, and equipping girls with the skills and resources to pursue opportunities in technology and engineering. I thought of the girls wearing hijabs in our after-school clubs, many of them from families with roots in the seven countries Mr. Trump had singled out. I thought of the Islamophobia many of them have faced. By putting anti-Muslim stereotypes and bigotry into policy, the president of the United States, I worried, had just painted a target on their backs. If I agreed to work with his administration, how could I look these girls in the eye? And what good would it do to advance my organization’s educational mission if I offered implicit support to an administration that didn’t see these girls and members of their families as fully American — let alone as the leaders we hope they will become? I declined Ms. Trump’s invitation. This week, President Trump directed the Education Department to commit at least $200 million toward computer science education. Several corporate and nonprofit partners were on hand at a Detroit event to celebrate the occasion. Girls Who Code was not. While I have great respect for the partners participating in this program, many of whom support the work of Girls Who Code, I do not believe this initiative — nor any partnership with this White House — can reverse the harm this administration has already done in attempting to legitimize intolerance. Indeed, collaborating with this administration, on any issue, emboldens it only further. "
597,"WASHINGTON — Republicans’ release of a sweeping plan to rewrite the tax code has set off a scramble among Washington lobbyists and trade groups to protect valuable tax breaks and other long-ingrained provisions. The plan’s scant details make it hard to know what, exactly, is on the chopping block. But within hours of the plan’s unveiling on Wednesday, flash points emerged over measures that supporters said could hurt the housing market, raise borrowing costs and increase the tax burden on families in high-tax states. The response put Trump administration officials on the defensive as they embark on a campaign to sell the plan. “The lobbyists shouldn’t have input, but the people in Congress should have input, and we’ll be working with them closely as we turn this into a bill and get it to the president to sign this year,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Fox Business Network on Thursday. Opposition from the real estate industry was swift and vocal, with trade groups strongly criticizing elements of the plan that they say will make home-buying less attractive and weaken the housing market. While the plan specifically calls for preserving the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents are warning that a proposal to double the standard deduction will make taxpayers less likely to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage deduction. The deduction is a key incentive for people to buy homes, since it reduces their taxable income by the amount of interest paid on a mortgage. Real estate agents worry that doubling the standard deduction may provide a richer tax break than itemizing and claiming the mortgage deduction. "
598,"To the Editor: Re “Sweeping Trump Tax Plan Vague on Details and Cost” (front page, Sept. 28): You write of the Trump tax plan, “Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul — or if it will favor the richest Americans.” Oh, please! The plan includes a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans — from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. The plan abolishes the estate tax completely. The plan creates a top tax rate of 25 percent for “pass-through businesses” like partnerships and sole proprietorships. Sounds like a huge tax cut for the very wealthy! The plan has no mention of carried interest, the famous loophole that lets wealthy hedge fund managers pay much lower taxes than salaried workers. WILLIAM BLANCHARD
CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: Re “The Republican Tax Boondoggle” (editorial, Sept. 28): The Republican deficit hawks who shrieked so loudly whenever President Barack Obama proposed desperately needed infrastructure spending have mutated into fantasy elephants with wings. Suddenly with a Republican president in office and in desperate need of something their party can tout as a major legislative achievement, they are blithely untroubled by the danger of an exploding federal deficit. Once again Republicans are touting the fable of supply-side economics, where greatly increased growth magically makes expanding deficits vanish. No matter that as far back as Reaganomics or as recently as in Kansas it just doesn’t actually work. And rather than employing deficit spending for emergency repairs to our dangerously decaying infrastructure, the benefits of Trumponomics appear to disproportionally go to the president and others already well off.

PRINCETON JUNCTION, N.J. To the Editor: “Trump to Call for Slashing Taxes, but Leave Details to Congress” (front page, Sept. 27) reports that the plan “slightly” increases the bottom rate to 12 percent from 10 percent. A 20 percent increase is difficult to appreciate as slight, especially since people at the bottom have to scrape for every cent to get by. Perhaps The Times should interview a truly poor individual to provide insights about impacts on our least fortunate fellow citizens. TOM MARTINSON

599,"PARIS — President Trump has rarely been accused of running a surplus in predictability. As his administration this week imposed punitive tariffs on a Canadian airplane manufacturer, it exacerbated confusion over where Mr. Trump might venture next in his zeal to redraw the terms of American commerce with the world. Trade experts strained to find evidence of a cohesive strategy, noting that Mr. Trump has sparred over trade with a sometimes bewildering array of nations. He has frequently trained his wrath on China and Mexico, accusing them of stealing American jobs. He has attacked Germany for its exporting prowess. He has threatened to blow up a trade deal with South Korea. Few could have foreseen that a primary target of Mr. Trump’s actions would be a stalwart ally, Canada. “He has not had a discernible trade policy from the beginning,” said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “I don’t think there’s a theory that unites the various decisions of his administration’s trade policies, other than things that make a news splash.” For global companies seeking to divine the new rules of the Trump era, ambiguity has become a seemingly permanent state of affairs.

601,"Another day, another rant from Donald Trump. This time, the president took aim at Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who spent the majority of last season sitting or kneeling during the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality and racial injustice. Trump’s remarks — that the owners of football teams should fire anyone who followed suit — prompted a nationwide demonstration the following Sunday from players and team owners who knelt or linked arms. We talk about the language used by the president and his supporters and their expectations of black entertainers and athletes. We also investigate the history of the national anthem.

602,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — The first public whiff of the drama came two years ago, with a surprise divorce filing by the governor’s wife of more than 50 years. A surreptitious, salacious recording surfaced months later. Then, this past April, Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama, a Republican, resigned under the threat of impeachment over his relationship with a close aide. It was only this week, though, that Alabama’s in-house sex scandal made its mark on national politics, convulsing the Republican Party and shutting down the Senate career of Luther Strange, a former state attorney general who many here once believed would become a Capitol Hill fixture. Instead, Mr. Strange may be little more than a historical footnote, his tenure derailed, in part, because he accepted Mr. Bentley’s appointment to an open Senate seat while he oversaw an investigation into the governor’s office. Although some of Mr. Strange’s defeat in Tuesday’s Republican primary runoff, at the hands of the evangelical jurist Roy S. Moore, can be traced to frustration and fury about the machinations of Washington, the senator struggled mightily to move beyond unproven suspicions that he and Mr. Bentley had cut some kind of corrupt deal. “The Bentley controversy shook the people of Alabama at their very core,” said Angi Stalnaker, who managed one of Mr. Bentley’s campaigns for governor. “All of our corruption up until now had been our own private family embarrassment,” she said. “Unfortunately for Senator Strange, he had a timing issue: He was tangentially involved in a controversy that was the one where Alabamians finally said, ‘Enough.’” Mr. Moore, who brandished a revolver during a rally on Monday, was never able to show off a smoking gun tying Mr. Strange’s appointment to a bargain to slow or stop the investigation that contributed to Mr. Bentley’s downfall.

604,"WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Black Caucus pressured Facebook this week to seriously examine how the site allowed Russian operatives to use advertising to target Black Lives Matter and sow racial divisions ahead of last year’s election. In a letter Tuesday to the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, Representative Robin Kelly, Democrat of Illinois, wrote that Russian-backed Facebook pages promoted “incendiary anti-immigrant rallies, targeted the Black Lives Matter movement and focused attentions on critical election swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan.” Russian groups backed by the country’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, paid Facebook to influence voters last year by “purchasing ads designed to inflame and exploit racial, political and economic rifts in the U.S.,” Ms. Kelly wrote. Ms. Kelly’s letter follows weeks of criticism of Facebook over its disclosure that Russians used fake pages and advertisements, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign. The company had long denied that Russians had exploited its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6. Now, Ms. Kelly said, she wants insight into how Facebook examines prospective advertisers, how it vets ads placed by foreign authorities and the “true cost and scope of Russia advertisements placed during the 2016 election cycle.” "
605,"A lower tax rate for corporations. Reduced taxes for partnerships like law firms. An easy way to bring overseas profits back to the United States without being taxed. Corporate America had a long wish list when it came to tax reform, and on Wednesday, President Trump gave companies just about everything they wanted. “This is much more than I think anyone could have hoped for,” said Robert Willens, an independent corporate tax expert. “I’ve never seen something like this. Taken together, this is the most dramatic and beneficial group of corporate tax reform suggestions we’ve ever had.” The list of those who stand to benefit from the proposed tax plan, which Mr. Trump promoted on Wednesday during a speech in Indianapolis, is long. Individual earners, small businesses, law firms, hedge funds, manufacturers and multinational corporations could all see dramatic tax cuts. There is no certainty that the main points in the White House plan will become law. Congress must now turn the nine-page proposal into a passable piece of legislation. But business leaders were nonetheless quick to applaud the broad outlines of the proposal, claiming that tax cuts they would spur new investment and grow the economy. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, called the plan “an encouraging step forward in our shared goal of a tax system that delivers higher economic growth, job creation and wages that our country desperately needs.” "
606,"To the Editor: Re “Frantic Efforts for the Ailing in Puerto Rico” (front page, Sept. 27): The governor of Puerto Rico and the mayor of San Juan could not be more clear about the gravity of the disaster that’s befallen their island. The efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coast Guard, the National Guard and other branches of local, state and the federal government are substantial and impressive. However, this nearly unprecedented crisis needs something more, because hundreds if not thousands of American citizens’ lives are at risk. President Trump should immediately appoint someone of the stature of his chief of staff, John Kelly; his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster; or a former general like David Petraeus or Ray Odierno to lead the effort. Otherwise people will die because of a lack of adequate leadership. ANDREW ROSENZWEIG
WHITE PLAINS To the Editor: It is unacceptable that Puerto Rico, a United States territory, is not receiving the same humanitarian aid and attention from the government as states on the mainland hit by recent storms. After Hurricane Harvey in Houston, President Trump and the government were quick to respond and provide aid. The president took much longer to address Puerto Rico — tweeting on Monday that it is in “deep trouble,” which I’m sure the people there are very aware of, and not visiting until this coming Tuesday. This is yet another injustice the people of Puerto Rico have to face as the United States treats them as second-class citizens. Without the right to vote in federal elections, they are left powerless, and the effects of this lack of voice and power are apparent in the government’s reaction to this catastrophe. Puerto Rico deserves and needs representation in the United States government, although it is a tragedy that it took such an event to bring attention to this. AMANDA BUTCHER, DIABLO, CALIF. The writer is a high school senior. "
607,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will seek to reconsider an Obama-era blueprint for protecting the greater sage grouse, a move that could lead to new mineral leasing, grazing and other commercial activities across the quirky bird’s Western habitat. The Interior Department intends this week to publish a formal notice of intent to amend 98 sage grouse habitat management plans across 10 states, according to multiple agency and state officials who have been briefed on the effort. Those plans, completed in 2015, were adopted after a decade of negotiations among conservationists, sportsmen and extraction industries as well as federal, state, local and tribal authorities. The elaborate compromise was designed to keep the sage grouse off the endangered species list, which would have required much greater restrictions on activities within the bird’s broad range. The sage grouse, which looks like a chesty chicken but struts like a spiky-tailed peacock, is renowned for its elaborate mating dance. The agency’s decision is not entirely unexpected. Earlier this year, Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, ordered a review of the sage grouse plans, in part to determine whether they were hindering energy production. A task force recommended changes that could loosen protections for the bird. "
608,"PARIS — Broken gargoyles and fallen balustrades replaced by plastic pipes and wooden planks. Flying buttresses darkened by pollution and eroded by rainwater. Pinnacles propped up by beams and held together with straps. Little of that deterioration is immediately visible to the millions of awe-struck tourists who visit the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris every year, many of them too busy admiring the intricately sculpted front to notice the wear and tear. But on a recent afternoon, André Finot, the cathedral’s spokesman, pointed out the decay. One patch of limestone crumbled at a finger’s touch. “Everywhere the stone is eroded, and the more the wind blows, the more all of these little pieces keep falling,” said Mr. Finot, gingerly stepping over fallen chunks of stone on the cathedral’s rooftop walkway. “It’s spinning out of control everywhere.” This is not the first time — nor will it be the last — that the cathedral, a jewel of medieval Gothic architecture, has required an extensive makeover. But experts say Notre-Dame, although not at risk of sudden collapse, has reached a tipping point — and an expensive one at that. "
609,"OTTAWA — Six weeks into the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the thorniest issues surrounding the pact remain unresolved. The United States, Canada and Mexico wrapped up the third round of trade talks in Ottawa on Wednesday, and negotiators from all sides said they are working nights and weekends to bring the deal to a close. But most also freely admitted that the most difficult part of negotiations is yet to come. That includes putting to paper, for the first time, some of the most sweeping changes the Trump administration wants to the trade agreement. Trade negotiations are typically opaque. The text being worked on is classified in the United States, and no team wants to weaken their position by giving away too much information to their opposition. But public statements at the close of the third round of talks this week offer new insight into progress on some of the main goals for the Trump administration’s renegotiation of Nafta. Much of what negotiators want to do is simply update Nafta, the bulk of which was written a quarter century ago. That includes setting new regulations on digital trade and telecommunications, updating the customs process that carries goods over borders, and making sure regulations among the countries are in step. This work has been relatively easy, because many of the updates can be drawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP is a trade deal negotiated by the United States and 11 other countries under the Obama administration, including Mexico and Canada. President Trump heavily criticized the TPP and withdrew the United States from the pact, essentially putting it into cold storage. "
610,"“We’re off our meds,” Henry Dunbar, the protagonist of Edward St. Aubyn’s modern retelling of Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” whispers in the novel’s arresting opening sentence. “We’re off our meds/ we’re off our heads,” Peter Walker — a stand-in for Lear’s fool — sings back giddily in response. In “Dunbar,” Mr. St. Aubyn’s reimagining of the tragedy, Lear is an 80-year-old Canadian corporate titan whose global media empire and legacy are under threat from his rapacious daughters, Megan and Abigail. The pair have him drugged and committed to a sanitarium in rural England as they plot to take over his empire. Meanwhile, Dunbar, blinded by pride, greed and paranoia, has alienated those most loyal to him, including Florence, his third daughter, who attempts to rescue him and foil her sisters’s plot. After he flees the asylum, with the help of his fellow patient, the unhinged alcoholic comedian Walker, he starts to grasp the depth of his daughters’ treachery, and the magnitude of his own ignorance and arrogance. “Dunbar” is the latest entry in the Hogarth Shakespeare project, which pairs contemporary novelists with Shakespeare’s timeless dramas and has attracted a parade of prominent writers, including Margaret Atwood, Gillian Flynn, Howard Jacobson, Jo Nesbo and Anne Tyler. Plenty of towering literary figures — among them Balzac, Turgenev, and the Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Jane Smiley — have taken inspiration from King Lear. But few writers are as well equipped as Mr. St. Aubyn to tackle the tragedy, a dark, twisted and violent family drama about a megalomaniacal monarch’s dysfunctional relationship with his heirs. He’s covered similar emotional and psychological territory in his Patrick Melrose series, which chronicle the violence and sexual abuse he suffered as a child, his descent into alcoholism and heroin addiction, and his struggles as a husband and parent. He’s so familiar with Lear — he studied the text intensely as a young man — that in conversation, he effortlessly recites from the play verbatim. "
611,"The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would temporarily waive a century-old shipping law for Puerto Rico that officials there said was hindering disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. The waiver of the law, known as the Jones Act, comes as federal and local officials report more supplies trickling onto the increasingly desperate island. But the Trump administration remains under pressure to step up the recovery effort. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced the decision on Twitter on Thursday morning, saying that President Trump had authorized it after a request from Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico. “It is an act of justice. It will allow Puerto Ricans to rebuild and to have a cost of living that really frankly is affordable,” Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, said on CNN on Thursday. "
612,"WASHINGTON — Justice Neil M. Gorsuch addressed a conservative group at the Trump International Hotel on Thursday, drawing protests and criticism for speaking at a venue that is the subject of several lawsuits against the president. In his remarks, Justice Gorsuch called for civility in debates over public controversies. On the one hand, he said, the First Amendment guarantees that “Americans can say pretty much anything they want for more or less any reason they want more or less anytime they want.” “But with every right comes a correlative responsibility,” he said. “And to be worthy of our First Amendment freedoms, we have to all adopt certain civil habits that enable others to enjoy them as well. When it comes to the First Amendment, that means tolerate those who don’t agree with us or those whose ideas upset us, giving others the benefit of the doubt about their motives.” Some experts in legal ethics and many liberal groups questioned the wisdom and prudence of Justice Gorsuch’s decision to speak at the hotel. Several lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of foreign payments to companies controlled by President Trump. “It’s disappointing that Justice Gorsuch agreed to speak at President Trump’s hotel, when Trump’s failure to adequately divest his hotels and other assets creates unconstitutional conflicts of interest that could very well end up before the court,” said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which represents lawmakers suing Mr. Trump. “Justice Gorsuch told the Senate during his confirmation that he was committed to the independence and integrity of the judiciary,” Ms. Wydra said, “but the decision to speak at an event that profits the president sadly falls far short of that standard.” "
613,"Von Miller, a star linebacker for the Denver Broncos, was one of many N.F.L. players who knelt on Sunday during the playing of the national anthem in what became a sweeping and stark show of solidarity against police brutality and a silent admonition of President Trump. But the story this week, involving Miller and a Denver car dealership, offered a window into potential troubles for high-profile athletes and advertisers. It may also be a lesson in the dangers of jumping to conclusions in the age of viral news stories, internet mobs and instant boycotts. It was widely reported that a car dealership had fired Miller over his protest, but the facts turn out to be more complicated. The original TV news report has been retracted. Miller is among the N.F.L.’s highest-paid players and has done commercials for brands as well known as Old Spice. But it was a Denver car dealership that found itself at the center of a contract tussle that vaulted its name overnight into the national sports conversation. "
614,"Otto F. Warmbier, the college student imprisoned in North Korea and returned to the United States in a vegetative state, suffered extensive brain damage following interrupted blood flow and a lack of oxygen, according to the coroner who examined his body. But an external examination and “virtual autopsy” conducted by the coroner’s office in Hamilton County, Ohio, could not determine how his circulation had been cut off. “All we can do is theorize, and we hate to theorize without science backing us up,” Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco, the county coroner, said in an interview Thursday. Mr. Warmbier, 22, an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, was convicted in March 2016 of trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a trip to North Korea and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was flown back to the United States in June in a vegetative state. North Korean officials said Mr. Warmbier’s condition was caused by sleeping pills and botulism, a diagnosis that medical experts doubted. He died six days later at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. His parents requested that a full autopsy not be performed. On Tuesday, during an appearance on the television show “Fox & Friends,” Fred Warmbier said that his son had been “tortured” and described North Korean officials as “terrorists.” "
615,"Roy Moore’s decisive victory over Luther Strange in the Republican Senate primary runoff on Tuesday in Alabama confirms — as I have reported before — that many Republican voters have a strong sense of white identity, that they harbor high levels of racial resentment and that they sometimes exhibit authoritarian leanings. At the same time, that’s not a complete picture. A 2013 study of red and blue America, conducted well before the seismic events of the last two years, sheds additional light on the Republican electorate and provides a more complicated understanding of contemporary conservatism. In “Divided We Stand: Three Psychological Regions of the United States and Their Political, Economic, Social, and Health Correlates,” Peter J. Rentfrow, a reader in the psychology department at the University of Cambridge, along with five co-authors, explores the results of standardized personality tests given to 1.6 million people in the United States from 1999 to 2010. The Rentfrow paper breaks the country into three “psychological regions” and ranks each region on personality dimensions known as the big five traits: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. The most conservative and most Republican of the three psychological regions — which Rentfrow labels “Cluster 1: Friendly and Conventional” — extends across the northern tier of the United States from Montana to Michigan, down through the Midwest to almost all of the South for a total of 26 states. The accompanying map shows the region in shades of purple. "
616,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. The standard by which the Trump tax plan should be judged is the standard that the Trump administration itself has set. “There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said shortly after the election. “My plan is for the working people,” President Trump said yesterday. “I don’t benefit.” None of that is true. It’s the latest disturbing example of politicians telling falsehoods about a proposed policy. Trump has done so repeatedly, and now members of Congress are doing it more often, too. These aren’t mere exaggerations or truth shadings; they are often just lies. “Trump’s tax plan: prioritize cuts for the rich, say he isn’t,” as New York Magazine succinctly puts it. You can read The Times Editorial Board’s analysis — that the plan relies on the discredited notion that tax cuts for the rich help everyone — here. "
617,"It’s been more than a week since I’ve had any word in New York from my 93-year-old father in Puerto Rico. He lives in Coamo, a town in the path of the worst storm to hit the island since 1928. My experience has been shared by millions of Puerto Ricans in the diaspora since Hurricane Maria wreaked its havoc on Sept. 20. The so-called natural disaster wiped out the deteriorating infrastructure of the entire commonwealth, destroying homes and roads, and leaving Puerto Rico without electricity. Estimates are that it will take months to make the grid fully functional again. The loss of communications has meant no news at all from the more remote communities like Coamo, which is also my hometown. This wasn’t just nature’s work. Another type of storm had been pounding the island long before last week. With no real representation in Washington, Puerto Rico has always been subject to the whims of stateside politicians unaccountable to the island’s people. More than half a century ago, tax breaks lured industry from the mainland to Puerto Rico, but in recent decades those advantages were yanked back. That set the stage for vulture hedge funds to swoop into the vacuum, but left hospitals, schools, electrical and communications grids too underfunded and fragile to weather a Category 4 hurricane. The immediate cause of the humanitarian crisis we’re witnessing now was a one-two punch by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. But the seeds for it were sown by a public debt crisis that has made life harder and harder for Puerto Ricans in recent years. The island tried to meet draconian debt payments by making disastrous cuts to public services. Those measures pushed Puerto Ricans out of work and into poverty. By 2015, 46.1 percent of the population was living under the poverty line, including about 60 percent of the island’s children. The governor at the time, Alejandro García Padilla, declared the debt unpayable and began defaulting on debt payments. The cruelly named Promesa law (“promesa” means “promise” in Spanish) passed by Congress last year was supposed to resolve the debt crisis and right Puerto Rico’s economy. But any meaningful recovery for Puerto Rican families remains a distant hope. The commonwealth’s tight budget has made life on the island impossible for hundreds of thousands of families. They migrated to the mainland; in Central Florida, they were arriving daily by the hundreds before hurricane season. Then came Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Immediate needs on the island include search and rescue, getting communications back up and clearing roads to get goods and help to people who need it. Beyond that, though, Puerto Rico needs Congress to help it recover from the devastation wrought by economic strategies that have failed the island for decades. "
618,"One of President Trump’s judicial nominees became something of a hero to religious conservatives after she was grilled at a Senate hearing this month over whether her Roman Catholic faith would influence her decisions on the bench. The nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, a law professor up for an appeals court seat, had raised the issue herself in articles and speeches over the years. The Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee zeroed in on her writings, and in the process prompted accusations that they were engaged in religious bigotry. “The dogma lives loudly within you,” declared Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, in what has become an infamous phrase. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, accused his colleagues of employing an unconstitutional “religious test” for office. Ms. Barrett told the senators that she was a faithful Catholic, and that her religious beliefs would not affect her decisions as an appellate judge. But her membership in a small, tightly knit Christian group called People of Praise never came up at the hearing, and might have led to even more intense questioning. Some of the group’s practices would surprise many faithful Catholics. Members of the group swear a lifelong oath of loyalty, called a covenant, to one another, and are assigned and are accountable to a personal adviser, called a “head” for men and a “handmaid” for women. The group teaches that husbands are the heads of their wives and should take authority over the family. Current and former members say that the heads and handmaids give direction on important decisions, including whom to date or marry, where to live, whether to take a job or buy a home, and how to raise children. "
619,"WASHINGTON — In 2001, when surging budget surpluses fueled hopes of extinguishing the national debt, a pitched battle broke out over President George W. Bush’s proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut. Never mind that the tax cut’s 10-year tab was supposed to leave behind more than $3 trillion in surpluses — Democrats and some Republicans said that the tax cut was just too large. Fast forward to President Trump’s Washington, where the budget deficit for this fiscal year is projected to near $700 billion and the federal debt has topped $20 trillion. A new tax cut is emerging to rival those of the Bush years, and the deficit hawks have hardly peeped. “It’s a great talking point when you have an administration that’s Democrat-led,” said Representative Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of about 150 conservative House members. “It’s a little different now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.” For years, Republican lawmakers lamented the soaring national debt, pressing for spending cuts and clinging to the mantle of fiscal responsibility. But last week, Senate Republicans hammered out a deal to allow for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, betting that supercharged growth will make up for lost revenue, a potentially dubious prospect. The tax plan outlined Wednesday by the White House and Republican leaders in the House and Senate could cost more than $2 trillion over the next decade, according to a preliminary estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan advocacy group. This month, the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate voted to raise the debt limit without doing anything to rein in spending. "
620,"WASHINGTON — President Trump failed again this week to fulfill his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health plan. Now he is taking aim at Mr. Obama’s central environmental legacy, the Clean Power Plan. The administration has made clear its desire to repeal the Obama energy plan. But what would take its place remains a mystery. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected in the coming days to reveal its strategy for reversing the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants across the country. Yet while Mr. Trump has declared the Obama-era plan dead — “Did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone,” he told a cheering crowd in Alabama recently — industry executives say they expect that utilities could still be subject to some restrictions on carbon emissions. “I would be surprised if repeal did not lead to replacement,” said Paul Bailey, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. If the E.P.A. does open the door to a new, weaker set of rules that utilities and others favor, it will most likely touch off a legal battle with environmental groups and pose a bureaucratic challenge to an agency where critical senior positions remain vacant. It could also force the agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has rejected the scientific consensus that human emissions cause climate change, to implicitly acknowledge that greenhouse gases harm human health and that the E.P.A. has an obligation to regulate them. "
621,"WASHINGTON — Bipartisanship took a beating this week. The easy Senate primary victory of the archconservative Roy Moore in Alabama and the announcement by Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee that he would retire represented real steps backward for those who had seen faint signs of a thaw in the partisanship that has gripped Washington for years. Mr. Corker was a deal maker and senior Republican trusted by Democrats as someone they could partner with on tough issues. More important, the win by Mr. Moore, a no-compromise candidate in the vanguard of a series of challengers to sitting Senate Republicans, is likely to push nervous incumbents to the right to try to fend off aggressive attempts to unseat them. In addition, Senator Susan Collins, the centrist Republican usually essential to any across-the-aisle negotiations, is weighing a run for governor back home in Maine and nearing a decision on whether to leave Congress. Those developments, along with announced departures by some moderate House Republicans, hold the potential for a sharp decrease in consensus building — just as bipartisan overtures were emerging on spending, health care and immigration. The defeat of Luther Strange, the appointed senator shellacked by Mr. Moore, has the most significant implications. Mr. Strange was backed by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, as well as Washington’s business lobbying community because he was considered a conventional Republican and a reliable vote when Congress had to perform such fundamental tasks as keeping the government open or raising the debt limit. Mr. Moore would be no such thing. He is much more likely to be in the ranks of unyielding Republicans unwilling to follow leadership, even it means government disruptions and legislative stalemate. He has already demanded the ouster of Mr. McConnell. "
622,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Senator Luther Strange ended up losing to Roy Moore, a twice-ousted Alabama Supreme Court justice with far-right views, in the Republican Senate primary on Tuesday. President Trump had endorsed Mr. Strange, and, unsurprisingly, late-night hosts took that angle. Stephen Colbert pointed to a New York Times report that Mr. Trump was exasperated with the size of his crowd at a rally for Mr. Strange and had wondered aloud whether audience members liked his choice of a pink tie. Mr. Colbert imagined the way that conversation went, impersonating Mr. Trump. Twitter has announced that it’s exploring doubling the number of characters allowed in a single tweet. Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah foresee some downsides. Mr. Meyers delivered a reflective monologue in support of N.F.L. players’ right to protest during the singing of the national anthem. He said he knew that rooting for a sports team means engaging in a kind of fantasy. But he challenged his viewers to see football players as whole people with a point of view worth hearing. "
623,"Last December, Destina Garcia found herself outside a locked front door in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. Somewhere on the other side was an older man who needed her help. She didn’t know yet that he had terminal cancer. She hadn’t met his estranged daughter, the one she would eventually bring north to spend the final days at her father’s side. At that moment, Ms. Garcia was only a few weeks into a brand-new and also very old kind of job, one being modernized to help fix the broken American system of education, training and employment. She had just begun work as an apprentice. President Trump has started a debate about whether it’s possible to vastly expand the number of apprenticeships nationwide without losing the elements that make them work best. Ms. Garcia, who is 30, grew up in the Manhattanville Houses project in West Harlem and had a son at 18. She found entry-level work coding medical records. But she soon ran into a quandary: While most good jobs require some kind of credential, going to college can be expensive and time-consuming. Even if you finish, there’s no guarantee of employment. She picked up certificates as a certified nurse assistant and an emergency medical technician, but neither led to permanent work — perhaps because in those fields, as in most, employers value skills that can be learned only on the job. But how do you get a job without the skills? "

626,"SEOUL, South Korea — The president of South Korea vowed on Thursday to accelerate efforts to strengthen its pre-emptive strike, missile defense and retaliatory capabilities against North Korea, and he renewed his call for the armed forces to become more independent from the United States. In a speech to mark South Korea’s Armed Forces Day, the president, Moon Jae-in, said he would push for the South to move more quickly to retake wartime operational control of its military from its American ally. Since the Korean War in the early 1950s, the terms of the countries’ alliance have called for an American general to command the South’s 650,000-member military should war break out. Mr. Moon and other liberals have campaigned for South Korea to play a greater role in the alliance, and they have long called for the country to resume responsibility for wartime command as soon as it can feasibly do so. But the idea has gotten more public support as remarks by President Trump have led many South Koreans to doubt his commitment to defend their country. Mr. Moon said Thursday that a more self-reliant military could make itself stronger and more feared by North Korea. But he also said the South should strengthen its alliance with Washington. An aide to Mr. Moon said this week that the allies were working on ways to move strategic American military assets into the region more frequently, to help deter North Korea. “The top priority is to secure abilities to counter the North Korean nuclear and missile threats,” Mr. Moon said. Since Mr. Moon took office in May, North Korea has conducted at least nine missile tests. On Sept. 3, the North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. And the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been trading increasingly bellicose threats with Mr. Trump. "
627,"Where does President Trump’s big tax push, unveiled yesterday in Indiana, go from here? What It Means for Corporate America • Owners of pass-through businesses — which include partnerships like law firms — would see their tax rates fall to 25 percent from 39.5 percent. • Private equity could be worried about any cap on deductions for debt interest payments. • Businesses can immediately write off the full costs of capital investments for at least five years, a provision known as full expensing. • From Mr. Trump's speech: “Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again.” • The bottom line, from the FT’s Barney Jopson: The Economic Impact NYT's Julie Hirschfield Davis and Alan Rappeport: WaPo’s Damian Paletta, Mike DeBonis and Carolyn Y. Johnson: Republicans are considering limiting or eliminating deductions for state and local taxes as well. Will It Pass? Vox: “But while Republicans are unified in their goal to cut taxes, there is still debate in the party about how deeply to cut rates and which deductions to get rid of — or whether to offset those changes at all.” "
628,"Yes, Donald Trump has once again used racial hostility to rouse his base and is reveling in the achievement. According to The New York Times, when Trump’s advisers appeared lukewarm about the uproar he created by chastising, in the coarsest of terms, N.F.L. players who chose to quietly kneel to protest racial inequality and police violence, “Mr. Trump responded by telling people that it was a huge hit with his base, making it clear that he did not mind alienating his critics if it meant solidifying his core support.” Every way he is manipulating his majority-white base to oppose a majority-black group of private citizens is disgusting. Trump is disgusting. But I am also infuriated by his framing: that this has nothing to do with race (whenever you hear that, know that the subject at hand must have everything to do with race) and that this is just about patriotism, honoring national ritual, celebrating soldiers, particularly the fallen, and venerating “our flag.” What this misses is that patriotism is particularly fraught for black people in this country because the history of the country’s treatment of them is fraught. It’s not that black people aren’t patriotic; it’s just that patriotism can be a paradox. Many black people see themselves simultaneously as part of America and separate from it, under attack by it, and it has always been thus. "
629,"While the Supreme Court has taken the Trump administration’s travel ban appeal off its calendar, there is something important to remember: Just because a case is moot, as this one appears to be, doesn’t mean that nothing happened. A great deal has happened in the eight months since the newly inaugurated president unleashed his first Muslim travel ban, fulfilling his campaign pledge to impose “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” It was a bizarre and terrifying weekend — terrifying not only for those whose valid travel documents had without notice become worthless but also for the rest of us, plunged suddenly into the shocking new reality of Donald Trump’s America. Blocked by the courts, the first travel ban morphed into the second, and now, on the eve of a scheduled Supreme Court argument, we have travel ban 3.0, with a few fig leaves added. (While it’s true that North Korea, a new country added to the previous all-Muslim list, is not a Muslim country, it’s also true that a grand total of 109 visas were issued last year to North Koreans, and subjecting those individuals to exacting scrutiny, as surely happened, is not likely to have overtaxed our national resources.) Unlike the first ban, issued in the apparent absence of any legal advice, and unlike the second, on which lawyers seemingly functioned while holding their noses and their breath, this one is the product of some smart lawyering. It was clearly designed to address the main statutory flaw that the lower courts found in the earlier versions, which was that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the president lacks unilateral authority to issue a categorical ban on the entry of entire nationalities without a very precise reason. The official explanation of the new order stresses the multidepartmental consultation and the summerlong study of the world’s nations that went into selecting the eight countries to which the new open-ended ban applies. This effort to snatch a case from the arms of a potentially hostile Supreme Court is dramatic but not unprecedented. In November 2005, the George W. Bush administration suddenly announced that it was transferring Jose Padilla, a United States citizen held in military custody, without charges, for more than three years, to the civilian criminal justice system to face charges of aiding terrorism. The reason for the sudden rush? Mr. Padilla’s lawyers had filed a Supreme Court appeal challenging his military confinement, and the government’s response to his petition was due within days. I don’t know the back story, but most likely, lawyers in the solicitor general’s office told the White House that there were no plausible arguments they could offer in defense of Mr. Padilla’s treatment. In any event, the ploy worked; voting 6 to 3, the justices refused to hear Mr. Padilla’s case, which Justice John Paul Stevens had described at an earlier stage as having “at stake nothing less than the essence of a free society.” If the justices find the pending travel ban case to be moot, they will probably take the usual step after a finding of mootness and vacate the lower court decisions that found the second travel ban to be invalid. That means that the opinions of the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits will be wiped off the books, rendered nonexistent, not to be cited in the future. But once again, that doesn’t mean that those rulings didn’t happen. A majority of judges in those two circuits — not the “so-called judges” of President Trump’s fevered imagination, but actual life-tenured, Senate-confirmed federal judges — flexed their muscles and stood up to the president. That’s important. The judicial muscle needs exercise just like any other. Disused, it wastes away. Overused, it leads judges to trample on executive and legislative authority. Did the Appeals Court judges hit the right balance? We won’t get a definitive legal answer, but the answer surely lies not in law but in politics. Ultimately, the judgment on this episode will come not from the courts but from the people. "
630,"Donald Trump has just voted in the Worst Cabinet Member contest. “We’ll see,” he said when asked by reporters if he was going to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. I believe I speak for us all when I say this does not sound like a vote of confidence. Price recently became famous as the guy who enjoys traveling by private charter plane at the taxpayers’ expense. You would think that Trump, who loves his private planes like a family member, would be a little sympathetic to someone’s distaste for commercial travel. But no. “I am not happy about it. I’m going to look at it. I am not happy about it, and I let him know it,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. Now Price is also the guy who is waging a war against birth control that’s cratering teen pregnancy prevention programs. But in this administration you can ruin federal initiatives aimed at avoiding unwanted pregnancy and Donald Trump — no fan of unwanted pregnancy — will completely ignore it. If Price goes down, it will be over his travel bills, which is sort of like Al Capone going to jail for tax evasion. Price claimed that a majority of the private charters he’d taken “were for the opioid crisis or the hurricanes.” No indication of whether it was a weather disaster or drug emergency that took him to the Aspen Ideas Festival in June. Still not quite as bad as attempting to cut $6 billion from next year’s National Institutes of Health research. But I say, go with what you can get. Tom Price is terrible and whatever sends him out of government is fine. Do you think he’s the Worst Cabinet Member? There’s so much competition. Consider Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who attempted to get rebellious House members to support Trump’s budget deal with the Democrats by asking them to do it “for me.” Apparently Mnuchin had no idea that Republican lawmakers’ affection for him was about on par with their feelings for special work sessions over holiday weekends.

632,"BANGALORE, India — IBM dominated the early decades of computing with inventions like the mainframe and the floppy disk. Its offices and factories, stretching from upstate New York to Silicon Valley, were hubs of American innovation long before Microsoft or Google came along. But over the last decade, IBM has shifted its center of gravity halfway around the world to India, making it a high-tech example of the globalization trends that the Trump administration has railed against. Today, the company employs 130,000 people in India — about one-third of its total work force, and more than in any other country. Their work spans the entire gamut of IBM’s businesses, from managing the computing needs of global giants like AT&T and Shell to performing cutting-edge research in fields like visual search, artificial intelligence and computer vision for self-driving cars. One team is even working with the producers of Sesame Street to teach vocabulary to kindergartners in Atlanta. “IBM India, in the truest sense, is a microcosm of the IBM company,” Vanitha Narayanan, chairman of the company’s Indian operations, said in an interview at IBM’s main campus in Bangalore, where the office towers are named after American golf courses like Peachtree and Pebble Beach. The work in India has been vital to keeping down costs at IBM, which has posted 21 consecutive quarters of revenue declines as it has struggled to refashion its main business of supplying tech services to corporations and governments.

635,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Thursday to step up its assistance to Puerto Rico more than a week after Hurricane Maria, appointing a three-star general to coordinate with agencies and vowing to give the island all it needed as aides tried to stave off comparisons to the response to Hurricane Katrina more than a decade ago. But on Puerto Rico, the desperation and frustration only grew. Shelters ran out of supplies and residents lined up all night to purchase ice and fuel, only to walk away with a bag of cold water or just a few gallons of gas. Others complained of an absence of basics like tarps for roofs and the continuing lack of running water. Officials still struggled to get supplies out of port to be distributed across an island of 3.4 million people where there is no electricity and scant phone service. Hospitals ran low on diesel for generators. The island has become a landscape of long lines and growing impatience with the pace of the response to what Puerto Rico’s governor called the “greatest catastrophe” in its modern history. Lawmakers and local officials alike called on President Trump to place the military in charge and to send more troops, aircraft and ships. “With all the needs there are, we go out every day to the streets and are face to face with the people — you don’t see a single government agency,” said Elizabeth Perez, a police officer in Ponce, P.R., who recently visited poor neighborhoods in her district and found people living in dire conditions. The White House continued to insist that the administration was doing all that it could. A century-old shipping law was temporarily waived after officials in Puerto Rico said it was hindering disaster relief efforts. About 7,200 troops are on the island, as are about 2,800 federal relief workers, the White House said. And the Pentagon announced that a new, higher-ranking military commander, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan of the Army, would work with federal aid agencies on the response. "
636,"WASHINGTON — A key senator investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election sharply criticized Twitter on Thursday for failing to aggressively investigate the Russian misuse of its platform after the company said it had largely limited its own inquiry to accounts linked to fraudulent profiles already identified by Facebook. The senator, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Twitter’s briefing for congressional investigators “very disappointing,” and accused company officials of ignoring extensive evidence of nefarious Russian activity. The company’s presentation “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered,” Mr. Warner said, adding, “Their response was frankly inadequate on every level.” After a closed-door briefing for the Senate and House intelligence committees, Twitter said that it had found about 200 accounts that appeared to be linked to the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election — a small fraction of the number found by outside researchers. It said it identified the accounts by looking for links to 470 fraudulent Facebook profiles and pages that had already been identified by Facebook investigators. The creators of the Facebook pages posed as American activists to spread disinformation and sow discord during the election season. Twitter identified only 22 accounts on its platform that were directly tied to the Russian Facebook pages and then discovered another 179 accounts that were “related or linked” to the Facebook accounts. None were registered on the site as advertisers, the company said. "
637,"WASHINGTON — After being rebuked by President Trump for racking up at least $400,000 in travel on chartered flights, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said on Thursday that he would pay back taxpayers for his part of the bill and stop flying on private jets. But that does not mean his job is safe. Mr. Trump has grown incensed by Mr. Price’s liberal renting of expensive planes, which he views as undercutting his drain-the-swamp campaign message, according to several administration officials with direct knowledge of the president’s thinking. Through intermediaries and the media, Mr. Trump has let it be known that offering reimbursement as repentance was no guarantee that Mr. Price would keep his job. On Thursday, Mr. Price tried anyway. “I look forward to gaining, regaining the trust that the American people, some of the American people, may have lost in the activities that I took,” Mr. Price said in an appearance on “Special Report with Bret Baier” on Fox News. Mr. Price called Mr. Trump “a remarkable leader,” and said the president had expressed displeasure to him “very clearly.” With his job on the line, Mr. Price, a physician and former Georgia congressman, spent much of the day posing for photo ops — receiving his flu shot and attending a panel on the opioid crisis with first lady Melania Trump. In a statement, he expressed “regret” over the cost to taxpayers and said he would write a personal check to the Treasury to cover his expenses: “The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.” "

Jerry Brown is said to have considered the question. According to a report in Bloomberg, he asked a state regulator about a plan by China to phase out sales of fossil-fuel vehicles. “I’ve gotten messages from the governor asking, ‘Why haven’t we done something already?’” said Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board. “The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California.” The remarks have thrilled environmentalists who see tailpipe pollution — accounting for about a third of total greenhouse gas emissions — as a bane to both air quality and the climate. “It’s an important conversation to have and we’re glad it’s starting to get some traction,” said Gina Coplon-Newfield, who heads the Sierra Club’s clean transportation unit. For now, conversation is all it appears to be. A spokesman for the air resources board, Dave Clegern, declined to say whether officials were serious about a ban. "
639,"The Seattle Symphony enjoyed a string of artistic successes under the musical leadership of the French conductor Ludovic Morlot, so when he announced last spring that he would step down after the 2018-19 season, there was widespread curiosity about who would succeed him. The orchestra formed an 11-member search committee, but in the end they did not need to look far: The orchestra announced Tuesday that its next music director would be the charismatic Danish conductor Thomas Dausgaard, who has been its principal guest conductor since 2014. Mr. Dausgaard, 54, who is also the chief conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the Swedish Chamber Orchestra, will become music director in Seattle in 2019. In a statement he praised the orchestra’s “generosity, team spirit, devotion and abandon.” The orchestra has become known for interesting work. It commissioned and presented the premiere of “Become Ocean,” by John Luther Adams, which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize, and this spring plans to produce the premiere of its sequel, “Become Desert.” The orchestra has released a number of well-received recordings. And earlier this year it responded to one of President Trump’s travel ban proposals by giving a free concert called “Music Beyond Borders” highlighting works from the targeted countries. Mr. Dausgaard has been an audience favorite in Seattle. A critic for The Seattle Times wrote last spring that: “In 40 years of reviewing concerts for The Seattle Times, I have never seen a guest maestro more warmly received by the audiences.” Simon Woods, the orchestra’s president and chief executive, said in a statement that Mr. Dausgaard’s journey from principal guest conductor to music director was “a kind of organic artistic progression that is rare and treasurable.” "

641,"Good morning on this mild Wednesday. New York continues to mourn the victims of the attack in Las Vegas, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. A vigil was held at New York University on Monday, and another at Brooklyn Borough Hall last night, for those killed in Las Vegas and other victims of gun violence. As more details emerge about the Las Vegas shooting and the gunman who carried it out, we wanted to know how gun laws in our city and state compare to those in Nevada, and other areas of the country. “New York State, as a whole, has stronger gun safety laws than the rest of the country,” said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “It’s also one of a handful of states that allows cities to have their own gun laws.” How do New York’s gun laws differ from other states? In New York, you must obtain a permit and pass a rigorous background check for all gun purchases. In most states, buying a gun from a private seller — in a classified ad or online — does not require a permit or passing a background check, Mr. Skaggs said. In New York, even if you meet the requirements to purchase a gun, law enforcement may still deny you. Also, if your gun is lost or stolen, you are required to report it to the police. What are the state’s rules for owning assault weapons? Under the 2013 Safe Act, passed after the 2012 mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School, New York prohibits the purchase or possession of large-capacity magazines and assault-style weapons (unless you owned the gun before January 2013). Other semiautomatic weapons, in which the trigger must be pulled to fire each bullet, are legal in New York, but you cannot legally purchase a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds. In Nevada, and much of the country, Mr. Skaggs said, magazine capacities are not regulated. "
642,"In the more than seven months since he became administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt has been on a reckless mission to dismantle public health safeguards and environmental protections. Mr. Pruitt’s E.P.A. wants to postpone or roll back dozens of rules that save lives and provide clean air and water, including efforts by the Obama administration to combat climate change and to protect rivers and streams from pollution. Last week brought more bad news: Mr. Pruitt is proposing to end a decades-long agreement with the Justice Department that funds the E.P.A.’s lawsuits against polluters responsible for creating hazardous waste sites. Neither Congress nor the courts will have the final say. The decision rests with the Trump administration. Since the Reagan administration, the E.P.A. has reimbursed the Justice Department for the cost of suing companies as part of the Superfund hazardous waste site cleanup program. In communities like the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Times Beach, Mo., the Justice Department sued polluters to force them to pay the cost of relocating residents. More recently, the E.P.A. covered the upfront costs of suing the W. R. Grace chemical conglomerate in the small town of Libby, Mont., where hundreds have died from asbestos poisoning, and compelling General Electric to clean up decades of PCB pollution that ravaged the Hudson River. But in its budget proposal, the E.P.A. said it no longer intended to reimburse the Justice Department for Superfund litigation costs. These lawsuits are expensive, with Justice Department lawyers doing battle, often for years, with the largest law firms in America. But the return on the agency’s investment is substantial. The Justice Department recovers hundreds of millions of dollars every year in cleanup costs to replenish the Superfund program’s coffers, which enables the E.P.A. to conduct more hazardous waste cleanups, including emergency responses to chemical releases like those that occurred after Hurricane Harvey. For the Environment and Natural Resources Division at the Justice Department, which represents the E.P.A. and other federal agencies in court, funding from the E.P.A. is essential. In its budget proposal for 2018, the Justice Department indicated that it expected to receive approximately $25 million from the E.P.A., enough to pay for 69 lawyers as well as support staff, nearly 20 percent of the division.

643,"It’s time to talk about taking away guns — not everyone’s guns and not all of them, but a whole lot. I know I am inviting enormous vitriol with that sentence, but it has to be said. Every time the nation suffers an act of terrorism on our soil like the one on Sunday in Las Vegas, we have the same fruitless debate in which opponents of sensible gun regulation hide behind the Second Amendment and supporters of gun control dance around it. In the aftermath of murder sprees, politicians, columnists and other prominent people suggest perfectly sensible reforms in hopes of reducing the lethality of these horrors or the ease with which they are mounted. On Monday, Hillary Clinton talked about the lunacy of allowing easy access to silencers. She wondered if the bloodletting might have been even worse if the killer had dampened the sound of his shots. Following the usual pattern, opponents of gun control attacked her for her “ignorance” about the technology of firearms and what silencers really do or don’t do. Following another well-worn trail, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said it was just not the right time to talk about gun laws. (In the same way, I suppose, that football games are not the right time to talk about institutionalized racism.) "
644,"After Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the presidential election, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they want her to retire. But they don’t say from what. We’ve never been quite sure what to do with our also-rans. William Howard Taft, having been defeated by Woodrow Wilson in 1912, became the 10th chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, which as fallback plans go is not half bad. On the other hand, after Horace Greeley lost to Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, he checked into an asylum. Greeley died on Nov. 29, just 24 days after his loss, before the Electoral College votes had even been counted. The cause of death was listed as “brain fever.” Assuming that Mrs. Clinton is neither appointed to the Supreme Court nor succumbs to brain fever, what is it that we want from her? What do we want from anyone who has sought our affections and failed? Our presidential also-rans are like a democracy’s version of a crazy ex-boyfriend, or -husband (or -girlfriend or -wife). In some instances, you hope that you can continue a civil relationship, for the good of the children. Other times, your best option is a restraining order. This situation didn’t begin with Mrs. Clinton, of course. To get a sense of perspective, you could do worse than to spend an afternoon at 105 Main Street, in Norton, Kan., which is not only the site of the First State Bank but also the They Also Ran Gallery, a collection of paintings and photographs of 61 people who have sought the presidency and lost. Founded by the banker William Walter Rouse in 1965, the gallery is one of at least two very interesting places in Norton, the other being a medium-security prison where, according to its website, inmates train and groom shelter dogs. "
645,"Before reading the article: Closely and carefully examine the matrix pictured, or a larger version here, that shows the results of a survey asking social scientists, lawyers and public health officials, as well as a representative sample of the American electorate, how effective each of 29 policies would be in reducing firearm homicide deaths, regardless of political feasibility or cost. What do you notice about the upper-right corner of the matrix? Where on the matrix can you find the policies deemed both effective and popular, and what specific policies fall there? Which policies are much less effective and less popular with both the experts and the public? What questions do you have after examining the matrix? Why? Now, read the article, “How to Prevent Gun Deaths? Where Experts and the Public Agree,” and answer the following questions: 1. What popular measures in the survey were supported by more than 85 percent of registered voters, according to the article? What least popular idea was still favored by nearly 50 percent? 2. What did Daniel Webster, a professor and director of the Johns Hopkins center for gun policy and research, say about the controversial topic of guns and the surprise result from the polls conducted? 3. What does President Trump support in terms of gun rights, according to the article? What do the matrix and polling results show about the concealed carry bill as an idea for reducing gun homicides? Is it effective? Popular? 4. How does the article’s matrix on mass shootings compare with the matrix on firearm homicide deaths, above? 5. What measures are supported by academics opposed to gun control? 6. What measures are supported by law enforcement professionals? 7. What strategies for increased safety were not included in the survey, according to the article? 8. Study the list at the end of the article that gives a ranking for effectiveness and a percentage of public support for each suggested policy. What can you determine about the relationship between effectiveness of a suggested policy and its percentage of public support? Why did you answer the way you did? Finally, tell us more about what you think: Do you agree with any of the measures in the article that are proposed to prevent gun deaths in the United States? If so, which ones, and why? Do you have any ideas of your own that you think might work to prevent gun deaths, either in general or specifically; for example, with mass shootings, gang-related homicides or other types of gun deaths? If so, what are your ideas, and why do you think they might work? For more student opinion on guns and gun control, see the Learning Network’s Civil Conversation Challenge.

646,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico on Tuesday was packed with awkward moments that seemingly begged for the late-night treatment. Mr. Trump groused about having to address the fallout from Hurricane Maria, saying, “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack.” Touring the storm’s wreckage, he told a hurricane victim to “have a good time.” He casually tossed emergency rolls of paper towels into a crowd, as if shooting a basketball. Jim Jefferies, host of the new “Jim Jefferies Show” on Comedy Central, was particularly outraged by the comment about the budget. Stephen Colbert was taken aback by the “have a good time” line. And Mr. Colbert bristled at the way Mr. Trump described the storm during an address to Puerto Rican journalists: “Your weather is second to none, but every once in a while you get hit,” Mr. Trump said. “And you really got hit, there’s no question about it.” Jimmy Fallon summed up the visit with a one-liner. The more news we get about the man who killed 58 victims and himself in Las Vegas on Sunday, the less he sounds like any known mass gunman before him. He was reportedly a multimillionaire with no criminal record. "
647,"LAS VEGAS — Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Thursday’s live updates. In her first public statement since the Las Vegas massacre, the gunman’s girlfriend said Wednesday that he had sent her on a trip to the Philippines and wired her money there, but that she did not know he was planning to harm anyone. The statement from the woman, Marilou Danley, which was read by her lawyer, Matthew Lombard, came after Ms. Danley went to the Los Angeles offices of the F.B.I. for questioning, according to a law enforcement official. It was released as the authorities sought her insight into what prompted a man with no evident criminal history to become a mass murderer. She stressed that she returned to the United States voluntarily, “because I know that the F.B.I. and the Las Vegas police department wanted to talk to me, and I wanted to talk to them.” • The authorities found evidence that the gunman, Stephen Paddock, planned to escape after the shooting and survive, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said at a news conference on Wednesday evening. • The bureau is trying to reconstruct Mr. Paddock’s actions, including finding and interviewing “everyone and anyone who crossed his path in recent weeks,” Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I., said at a cybersecurity conference in Boston. "
648,"You’ve been moderating “Meet the Press” for just over three years. Do you think your job is the same today as it was, say, 10 months ago? What the audience expects hasn’t changed. People come to us for the same reasons: to be educated and informed. My biggest change is that I feel the need to reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians. The wall has always been there, but sometimes there have been too many holes in it. One legitimate criticism of the political press over the last two decades has been the appearance of coziness between people in the media and the political elite. It’s a lot easier for me, say, as a sports fan to accept a personal fandom, whereas in politics, I’m not going to tell anybody whom I vote for, not even my kids, who ask me all the time, because their friends ask them. O.K., but you did vote for someone. You have opinions. Is that the same as being biased? No. I don’t advocate — that’s the big difference. Now, that said, we’re all human beings. We’re born with original bias. By our very nature, we’re subjective. It’s not as if you can eradicate bias out of anything, but it’s about fairness. You’ve also said that character isn’t ideology. In politics, 90 percent of the disagreements are about policy or ideological point of view. Some people will believe they fit into a “right and wrong” paradigm, but a lot of times political disagreements don’t. I’m held to a standard of decency in my job. I think there’s nothing wrong with doing the same to politicians. If someone is a bad character, what is your role as a journalist? You just point it out. At the end of the day, it’s still up to the voter, not me. Do you think you did a good job covering the events of 2016? I’m going to give you a Donald Rumsfeld answer: You cover the campaign that’s in front of you. You don’t get to cover the campaign you want. There are always lessons to be learned, and look, it’ll impact what happens next. Someday, we’ll say that somebody would’ve never been elected had 2016 not happened, right? Barack Obama might not have become president if Hillary Clinton had run in 2004. If Katherine Harris didn’t ever run for secretary of state in 1998, and the Democrat ends up winning that race against a scandal-ridden Republican incumbent at the time, whom Harris beat in the primary, so the Democrats control the certification process in Florida in 2000 — who knows what happens? That’s what I love about politics: that butterfly effect. We don’t try to erase a result; we just move on from it and build from it. "
649,"Uber’s relationships with cities tend to begin or end in war. Smaller markets experience the company as a powerful invading force — often a welcome one. The company’s model easily outclasses and undercuts provincial competitors, conscripting local cabbies and enlisting new drivers. Flimsy taxi regulations backed by weak municipal governments are quickly overwhelmed by the multibillion-dollar company and its armies of lawyers and lobbyists and their briefcases full of case studies and legislative suggestions. But in larger markets with bigger taxi companies, municipal governments bristle at the company’s deep, evident disdain for their authority — and they’re capable of striking back. Last month, in a sudden show of force, London told Uber that its license to operate in the city wouldn’t be renewed. The city’s transit authority cited a number of reasons for its actions: Uber’s approach to reporting crimes; its background-check policies; its aggressive attempts to thwart regulators; general appeals to “public safety” and “corporate responsibility.” “While Uber has revolutionized the way people move in cities around the world, it’s equally true that we’ve got things wrong along the way,” Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, wrote in a public letter. But this performance of contrition came on the heels of the company’s first effort at retaliation. It had already mobilized its drivers and users, starting a petition accusing the city of having “given in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice,” of threatening the livelihoods of tens of thousands of its workers and of depriving millions of customers. The effort quickly garnered more than 800,000 signatures. London’s threat to Uber is clearly existential: Being shut out of one of its largest markets is terrible for business and sets a dangerous precedent for the company as it tries to expand around the globe. But governments similarly perceive, in Uber, a broader challenge to their legitimacy. Uber doesn’t so much do business in cities as unilaterally install itself as infrastructure. Its incompatibilities with local regulations or national employment law are presented as neither features nor bugs but as evidence of evolution and progress. It identifies, vets and credentials drivers. It fields complaints and arbitrates disputes, exercising authority over those it deems bad actors. It lets riders rate drivers and vice versa, creating a sort of customer-service-centric accountability. Because Uber purports to be self-regulating, its users and drivers share in the company’s feeling that outside interference is unwelcome and even unnatural. It now has a constituency, hundreds of thousands strong, angry with their government on behalf of a corporation. The same week Uber was given notice in London, Mark Zuckerberg sat down in front of a camera in Menlo Park, Calif. His desaturated earth-tone palette was matched color for color by his office in the background, as if to provide camouflage. Indeed, it was easy to miss the sheer range and strangeness of what he was there to say. “I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,” he said. “The integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world.” "
650,"Hollywood, Calif. — Sarah Silverman, during the first test run of her new political variety show, “I Love You, America,” introduced a nude couple in the front row. Next was a generic white male host behind a desk to her right, a familiar face, she said pointedly, for audiences to look to when things get uncomfortable. But they weren’t the most surprising supporting players on this studio set, which looked like a cross between a roadside diner and an upscale thrift store. That may have been a Trump voter, part of a group of ordinary people interviewed by Ms. Silverman, a liberal comedian who spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year. Asked about his support for the president, he explained that Mr. Trump had fewer scandals than Hillary Clinton. Ms. Silverman cringed and the crowd murmured, anticipating a sharp comeback. Instead, she smiled politely and moved on. Is this really Sarah Silverman? “You’ve never changed someone’s mind by arguing,” she said the next day, sitting on a couch in her office watching footage from the show, which will have its premiere on Hulu on Oct. 12. “Or facts. Facts don’t change people’s minds, as crazy as that sounds.” Gesticulating across from an American flag mounted above her desk, Ms. Silverman said there are enough comedians on television, sure of their rightness, explaining why their opponents are wrong. “I am interested in hearing about people’s feelings, and as corny and hippie-granola as it sounds, it is the root of everything,” she said. Ms. Silverman, 46, one of the greatest stand-up comics of her generation, pioneered a swaggeringly feminine brand of raunchy, button-pushing humor that paved the way for comics like Amy Schumer and Ali Wong. In recent years, she has pivoted from this style, embracing a more earnestly engaged voice. With this new show she moves even further away, risking alienating her fans and experimenting with the limits of political comedy in the Trump era. In this increasingly divisive moment, is there an audience for a comedy show that aims for common ground? "
651,"President Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico risks compounding the damage caused by Hurricane Maria. His vow on Tuesday to wipe out the United States commonwealth’s huge debts sent its bond prices plunging on Wednesday. The island’s devastation may well necessitate a fresh restructuring, but that won’t address urgent issues. The White House needs to provide money and supplies, not distraction. The president spent a few hours touring the island on Tuesday, tossing rolls of paper towels to locals and praising what he said was the “great job” being done by federal emergency teams and military commanders. Roughly two-thirds of grocery stores and gasoline stations have reopened and power was restored earlier this week to the business district of the capital, San Juan. Most of the island’s hospitals, though, rely on intermittent deliveries of diesel to power generators — so they are still in the dark. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced shortly after the president left that the death toll had more than doubled, to 34. It will take months, if not years, to rebuild damaged roads, the power grid, homes and other infrastructure. The catastrophe-modeling firm AIR Worldwide has estimated insured losses of anywhere between $40 billion and $85 billion. Given the scale of the task, it seems likely bondholders will ultimately face an even bigger haircut than they were bracing for. In May, Puerto Rico initiated a form of bankruptcy to restructure its more than $70 billion of debt. The commonwealth’s general obligation bonds due in 2035 were trading around 57 cents on the dollar before Hurricane Maria struck, declining to some 45 cents on Tuesday. Mr. Trump’s comments provoked a surge in sell orders that wiped an additional 25 percent off the price on Wednesday, according to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s electronic quotation service. Driving away investors won’t help Puerto Rico’s recovery effort. Mr. Trump doesn’t even have the authority to abrogate debts, something the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, seemed to recognize Wednesday when he said the president’s comments shouldn’t be taken literally. Even if the president wants to help negotiate a more generous restructuring for the island, that process is a slow, painstaking one. That’s the opposite of what the territory and its 3.5 million people need most. "
652,"The Trump administration on Wednesday walked back the president’s apparent vow to wipe out Puerto Rico’s debt, suggesting that the island would have to solve its own fiscal woes despite the catastrophic damage it has endured from two powerful hurricanes. “I wouldn’t take it word for word with that,” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on CNN in reference to President Trump’s suggestion that the United States might clear Puerto Rico’s debt. Mr. Mulvaney said that the administration would be focusing its efforts on helping Puerto Rico rebuild from storm damage but that the commonwealth would continue to proceed through the debt restructuring process it was undertaking before the storm. “Puerto Rico is going to have to figure out how to fix the errors that it’s made for the last generation on its own finances,” Mr. Mulvaney said. A person with knowledge of the plans to assist Puerto Rico said the president had wanted creditors to grasp the scope of the destruction, and to realize that immediate priorities had to change. The person said that there was now an urgent need for cash on the island, and that Congress could address some of it by loosening the restrictions on programs for housing, health and infrastructure construction that various federal agencies had offered. The funds would be used on the island and not flow through to the creditors, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the debt situation was still being revised. "
653,"Michael Grimm, who is trying to win back his old House seat after serving time in federal prison, secured a notable new supporter on Wednesday: Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, who has sought to bolster the candidacies of populist outsiders since leaving the White House. The two met at Mr. Bannon’s Capitol Hill townhouse on Wednesday afternoon, three days after Mr. Grimm announced he was challenging Representative Dan Donovan of Staten Island for the Republican nomination in New York City’s last G.O.P.-held congressional seat. “We’re joining the Bannon portfolio of Republican challengers to anti-Trump Republican congressmen,” said Michael Caputo, a Grimm adviser who also served as an adviser to Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Andy Surabian, a political strategist who works closely with Mr. Bannon and who was at Wednesday’s meeting, said, “Steve likes the fact that Grimm is a straight-talking, fire-breathing, conservative populist.” Chris Grant, a New York Republican political strategist who Mr. Caputo said will serve as Mr. Grimm’s general consultant, also attended the strategy session. “We agreed to cooperate through this campaign,” Mr. Caputo said. “What exactly that means will unfold in the weeks ahead.” Mr. Grimm and Mr. Bannon posed for a photo — Mr. Grimm in a blue suit and Mr. Bannon in his familiar layers of button-down shirts — before they parted ways. “Game on!” Mr. Grimm wrote on Twitter, posting the picture. From the start, Mr. Grimm has tried to frame his comeback bid around the idea that he would be a stronger ally to President Trump in Congress than Mr. Donovan, a former district attorney who took office in a special election after Mr. Grimm pleaded guilty to felony tax fraud. Mr. Grimm served seven months in prison. “Our president needs help draining the swamp,” Mr. Grimm shouted at his announcement on Sunday. At another point he said, “Let’s hear it for our president, Donald J. Trump.” Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for Mr. Donovan, called Wednesday “a bad day for swamp-draining.” “Michael Grimm had one of the most liberal voting records when he was in Congress on issues like immigration, trade and gun control. These are issues that Steve Bannon has talked extensively about and Michael Grimm’s record is actually completely counter to him on that.” Mr. Bannon has sought to aggressively insert himself into the congressional political landscape since exiting the White House, most notably campaigning against Mr. Trump’s choice in a Senate special election. Mr. Bannon backed Roy Moore, an outspoken social conservative, who beat the candidate that Mr. Trump had endorsed, Luther Strange. "

655,"WASHINGTON — Legislation to rescue the Children’s Health Insurance Program sailed through a Senate committee on Wednesday, but touched off a partisan conflict in the House, diminishing hopes that the popular program would be quickly refinanced. Funding for the program expired on Sunday, and state officials said they would soon start notifying families that children could lose coverage if Congress did not provide additional money. It was impossible to say when Congress might pass a bill and send it to President Trump. By voice vote, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill on Wednesday that would provide more than $100 billion over five years for the program, which insures nearly nine million children. The committee chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, hailed the bill as “a prime example of what government can accomplish when both parties work together.” Mr. Hatch wrote the bill with the senior Democrat on the committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon, just as Mr. Hatch helped create the program in 1997 with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. But in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, lawmakers brawled Wednesday over a similar bill to provide money for the children’s health program. Democrats strongly support the program, but complained that Republicans would take money from Medicare and the Affordable Care Act to offset the cost. The House committee eventually approved the bill, by a vote of 28 to 23, with all of the opposition coming from Democrats. "
656,"WASHINGTON — Three United States Army Special Forces were killed and two were wounded on Wednesday in an ambush in Niger while on a training mission with troops from that nation in northwestern Africa, American military officials said. “We can confirm reports that a joint U.S. and Nigerien patrol came under hostile fire in southwest Niger,” Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Falvo, a spokesman for the United States Africa Command in Stuttgart, Germany, said in an email. All five American soldiers were Green Berets, said two United States military officials. The attack took place 120 miles north of Niamey, the capital of Niger, near the border with Mali, where militants with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, an affiliate of Al Qaeda, have conducted cross-border raids. Niger’s troops were also believed to have suffered casualties, but details were not immediately known. The deaths represent the first American casualties under hostile fire in a mission in which United States Special Forces have provided training and security assistance to the Nigerien armed forces, including support for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. A Special Forces soldier died in a vehicle accident in Niger in February. One of the military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss continuing military operations, said American forces were rushing to the scene of the ambush, presumably to evacuate American and Nigerien casualties, and possibly to hunt down the attackers. President Trump was briefed on the deaths of the Green Berets, said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "
657,"WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Wednesday to approve $29 billion in additional hurricane relief and debt forgiveness, seeking to help Puerto Rico and other battered areas and to shore up the troubled federal program that provides flood insurance to homes and small businesses. The request came nearly a month after lawmakers approved a first installment of $15 billion in disaster relief, taking action after Hurricane Harvey caused devastation in Texas and while Hurricane Irma was heading toward Florida. Many more billions of dollars in aid requests are likely to come as Puerto Rico and other areas assess the damage from this year’s hurricanes. The latest request seeks $12.8 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stay current with the nearly $200 million a day the agency is spending on recovery work. It also asks for lawmakers to wipe out $16 billion in debt that the National Flood Insurance Program owes to the Treasury and has no immediate way to repay. Under the White House proposal, premiums for flood insurance would rise, at least for homeowners who could afford to pay more, while private insurers would be encouraged to start writing their own flood insurance. In addition, the White House is also seeking $577 million in response to wildfires that have been prevalent this year in Western states, and is calling for efforts to limit the cost and devastation of wildfires. “With two more months of hurricane season remaining and wildfires continuing to burn in the West, we must act expeditiously to ensure that communities have the assistance they need, when they need it,” wrote President Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in a letter to congressional leaders on Wednesday. "
658,"Pettiness, such pettiness, in this noxious swamp of maybe-morons. “I’m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters on Wednesday, declining to refute an NBC report that he had privately called President Trump a “moron” this year. “This is what I don’t understand about Washington. Again, I’m not from this place. But the places I come from, we don’t deal with that kind of petty nonsense.” There was no immediate estimate available for the collective pettiness of Texas, where Mr. Tillerson was raised, nor of the oil industry, where he spent his career until Mr. Trump summoned him to the pettiness hub along the Potomac. But for a certain class of Washington denizen, Mr. Tillerson’s slight opened a new front in the nation’s forever-war against the reputation of its capital. The thrashing of Washington culture by voters, nonvoters, members of Congress — that much is a sacred rite. A sitting secretary of state, at odds with his president and blaming the city’s trifling instincts for stoking tensions, is another matter. “It’s profoundly paradoxical,” said Rick Tyler, a longtime Republican strategist who served as communications director for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas during last year’s Republican presidential primary race. “His boss is the most petty person ever to come to Washington.” Barney Frank, the retired longtime Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, marveled at how wholly a sitting government in Washington had embraced a view of Washington villainy. "
659,"The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., last week returned a five-year-old campaign contribution from President Trump’s personal lawyer after journalists raised questions about Mr. Vance’s 2012 decision to end a criminal investigation into fraud allegations against Mr. Trump and his children, a spokesman for Mr. Vance’s campaign said. The investigation had delved into allegations that Mr. Trump’s eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Jr., had lied to buyers of units at the Trump SoHo, a 46-story luxury condominium-hotel in Lower Manhattan, about how many apartments had been sold, painting a rosy picture of sales at the struggling project. The buyers sued the Trumps and their partners in the project, and in late 2010 the Manhattan district attorney’s office started looking into whether laws had been broken. Mr. Vance, a Democrat, said on Wednesday his decision to drop the investigation in August 2012 had nothing to do with donations the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, made to his campaign. He said he had determined after two years of investigation that his office could not prove a crime had been committed. “The idea for me that I would make a case decision for $5,000, or $50,000 or $100,000, is ludicrous, because it’s so much more important for me to have the work of this office be perceived as fair and unbiased and not for sale,” he said in an interview. “None of the decisions revolved around campaign contributions at all, or anything other than my assessment that this was not a case the office should prosecute, on the merits.” One of the contributions, for $25,000, was returned in May 2012, just before Mr. Kasowitz met with Mr. Vance and two senior prosecutors to argue the Trumps had done nothing illegal. Mr. Vance ended the investigation three months later. The second contribution, for $32,000, came five months after Mr. Vance made his decision. That contribution was returned last week, after journalists made inquiries about it. Mr. Kasowitz’s role in the case, and the contributions to Vance’s campaign, were first reported in a joint article by The New Yorker, ProPublica and WNYC. "
660,"As Canadian lawmakers took up legislation on Wednesday that would bar businesses from dealing with foreigners who have committed human rights abuses, a nonprofit group called the Russian Congress of Canada pushed hard against the measure. The lawmakers say the effort was part of a broader lobbying campaign orchestrated by Russia against such laws, including one in the United States. Canadian human rights advocates say they were also singled out. The pro-Russia group denies any connection to the Kremlin, but lawmakers say the push fits a pattern of Moscow-backed interference in the West. And they say that the lobbying campaign, which began in 2014 and grew with attacks last spring on Canada’s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, highlights the dangers of Russian meddling in Canada. Nonetheless, the bill passed unanimously in Parliament on Wednesday evening. It allows Canada to sanction, freeze assets or deny entry to foreigners from any country that has violated human rights or engaged in corruption. “Everybody realizes that some organizations are being used as a proxy for Putin,” James Bezan, a conservative member of Parliament and a supporter of the bill said. “These groups are trying to disrupt and discredit this legislation in Canada and democracy within our own borders.” The legislation, informally known as the Sergei Magnitsky Law, is named for a lawyer who died in a Russian prison under mysterious circumstances after exposing one of the biggest government corruption scandals during President Vladimir V. Putin’s time in power. "
661,"Jill Bialosky, a prolific poet and essayist who is a top editor at W. W. Norton & Company, is facing accusations that passages in her new memoir, “Poetry Will Save Your Life,” are plagiarized. In a review posted online Wednesday in The Tourniquet Review, a literary journal, the critic William Logan claimed that Ms. Bialosky had “plagiarized numerous passages from Wikipedia and the websites of the Academy of American Poets and the Poetry Foundation.” He offered direct comparisons between the language used in her memoir and the language found on other websites, and in one instance, in another author’s book. “My rule is, check basic facts when finishing a review,” Mr. Logan wrote in an email on Wednesday. “Take nothing on trust.” “The similarity of language made my heart sink,” he said, after he first noticed an overlap between her passage about Robert Louis Stevenson and what appears on the Academy of American Poets’ website. The academy’s page says: “Born on November 13, 1850, in Edinburgh, Scotland, Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson came from a long line of prominent lighthouse engineers. During his boyhood, he spent holidays with his maternal grandfather … Prone to illness, Stevenson spent many of his early winters in bed, entertained only by … love of reading, especially William Shakespeare … and ‘The Arabian Nights.’” Ms. Bialosky wrote: “Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on November 13, 1850. He came from a family of lighthouse engineers. During his boyhood he was prone to illness and spent many of his childhood winters in bed, entertained by reading Shakespeare and The Arabian Nights.” "

he cottages where we stayed last weekend in the Blue Mountains are well known for attracting friendly kangaroos. But in the parking lot, there were also signs warning us not to feed them. So what were we to do when we saw a family, who appeared to be immigrants or tourists from India based on their accents, tossing slices of white bread to the hopping herd? My 7-year-old daughter, a roo lover supreme, wanted to tell them to stop, but my wife and I found ourselves resisting. “No, no,” we told her as she ran toward them, “leave them be.” Was that the right call? Or were we shirking our civic duty? For a nation settled by convicts, Australians can be sticklers for the rules. I think of this every time I see people waiting for the “walk” sign at crosswalks where cars are nowhere to be seen, or when I interact with officials in Canberra or civil servants in New South Wales, who tend to insist that the way they do things is the only way they could ever be done, ever, anywhere. Isn’t this also one of the lessons of “The Castle”? The idea that Australians who try to follow the rules are meant to be honored? "
663,"Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Thursday’s live updates. A familiar pattern often emerges as the authorities investigate a mass shooting: speculation in online forums that one person couldn’t have possibly committed this act alone. Law enforcement officials have stated multiple times that, at this point, they believe that Stephen Paddock, who killed at least 58 and himself and wounded hundreds on Sunday night in Las Vegas, was the only gunman. (Still, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Wednesday that “it was troublesome that he was able to move this much gear into the hotel unassisted.”) Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department explicitly addressed the issue on Monday night: “I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory or that rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock.” Similar rumor mongering has emerged in the wake of previous mass shootings. The morning after a gunman opened fire at a nightclub in Orlando, the police dispelled the rumor that he had accomplices. Some falsely believe the Sandy Hook shooting was staged and seized upon a mysterious “man in the woods” as proof of an additional conspirator. The man was searching for his daughter, a student at the elementary school. In fact, mass shootings have historically been solo acts, with some exceptions like Columbine and San Bernardino. After Sunday’s shooting on an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, several readers have written to The New York Times inquiring about the viral claim that there was a second gunman or additional gunmen. "
664,"I don’t know how to break it to Idris Elba. So I just say it. “Is Kate Winslet really the woman you want to be stuck with when disaster strikes in freezing weather? You do know that she didn’t move over to make room on that door and Leo slipped into the icy Atlantic?” The British actor laughs. He is sitting atop the New York skyline in a dining room at the Mandarin Oriental. “Kate Winslet is surprisingly resilient to almost anything,” he says. “I mean, she is a bruiser. Tough. As. Nails. And if we were ever to fall off a real mountain, her and I, we would survive because she’s not like a slouch in any shape or form.” And, to be fair, Ms. Winslet did hoist Richard Branson’s mother down some stairs after a lightning bolt in a hurricane sparked a fire that engulfed the Branson holiday home on Necker Island, where she and her children were staying in 2011. That was when she met her husband, Mr. Branson’s nephew, a.k.a. Ned Rocknroll, when he rushed into the burning house with a headlamp. “She was just like, ‘That guy’s for me,”’ Mr. Elba says. The actor is starring with Ms. Winslet in the “The Mountain Between Us,” based on a novel about strangers who struggle, snuggle and eat roasted mountain lion in the frigid Utah wilderness after their small plane crashes. Mr. Elba often plays opposite very strong women, and he says that’s fine with him. His Ghana-born “Mum” is so into tough love, he says, that at his 45th birthday party recently, she turned her cheek away when he went to kiss her. Mr. Elba also portrays the New York lawyer who defends Molly Bloom, the audacious poker madam to the stars played by a fiery Jessica Chastain in the Aaron Sorkin movie, “Molly’s Game,” out Nov. 22. And the actor created one of the most memorable romances in TV history in the popular BBC series “Luther,” when his London homicide detective in the big tweed overcoat, known by his deputies as “his satanic majesty,” gets in an erotic and psychopathic entanglement with a latter-day Lizzie Borden, played with film-noir panache by the flame-haired Ruth Wilson.

666,"A year ago, the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Bob Dylan, shocking folks all over the world — most notably, Bob Dylan. In its announcement, the Nobel Prize committee compared the singer-songwriter to the ancient Greek poets, Homer and Sappho, even though he probably more closely identified with the 1960s bluegrass poets, Homer and Jethro. For the next two weeks, Dylan said nothing in public, while the committee fretted and old school writers of paragraphs fumed. Irvine Welsh, author of “Trainspotting,” called it “an ill-conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies.” (Prediction: Welsh never wins a Nobel Prize.) Eventually, Dylan broke silence, thanked everybody and apologized for the confusion, saying the award simply had left him “speechless.” A Nobel Laureate, speechless? That’s not supposed to happen. During his year as a Nobel laureate, he didn’t write a new memoir or release an album of new songs. He didn’t scream at President Trump or even save a rain forest. (Those jobs await Madonna’s Nobel.) Instead, Dylan seemed trapped beneath an avalanche of unsolicited prestige. For decades, he’d been going about his business, writing songs and playing them, and then — boom! — he’s suddenly a big Nobel literary cheese. The times, they certainly a-changed. "
667,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Every year, low-income Californians leave an estimated $2 billion on the table. The pot of unclaimed money is known as the earned income tax credit. And Californians have access to it twice over — through programs offered by both the state and federal governments. The payments, often amounting to thousands of dollars, can make the difference between living above or below the poverty line, supporters say. Yet one recent survey found that fewer than one in five eligible Californians had ever heard of the state program. “We have a lot of work to do,” said Joe Sanberg, whose group CalEITC4Me was formed to spread awareness about the credit.

668,"LAS VEGAS — President Trump comforted the victims of Sunday’s deadly mass shooting and paid tribute to those who tended to them, taking up on Wednesday a harrowing duty of the modern presidency that has nevertheless become numbing in its regularity. After touring the wreckage of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico a day earlier, a somber Mr. Trump headed to Las Vegas, where 58 people were slain by an assailant raining bullets into a crowded country music festival from the blown-out window of his hotel room high above them. “What I saw today is just an incredible tribute to professionalism, and what they have done is incredible. And you never want to see it again,” Mr. Trump said, after spending about an hour talking to patients in the trauma center of a Las Vegas hospital that received 100 people in the hours after the shooting. “We met patients that were absolutely, terribly wounded,” the president added. “And the doctors, the nurses, all of the people at the hospital, have done a job that is indescribable.” In a four-hour visit to this bereaved city, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania, also toured the operations center of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which coordinated the response to the shooting. On one wall hung a poster with an aerial view of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where the gunman perched, and the site of the music festival below it. “This is a rough time,” Mr. Trump told the assembled police officers, some of whom had risked gunfire to direct the concertgoers toward safety. “But if you didn’t get up there so quickly, it could have been worse — a lot worse.” "
669,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Ta-Nehisi Coates has criticized my column on kneeling athletes, and several readers also made a version of his point, in emails. I wanted to offer a few thoughts in response. First, I appreciate Coates’s prefacing his critique with kind words about most of my work, and the feeling is mutual. If you’ve heard his name but haven’t yet read any of his articles or his books, you should remedy that. Here is part of what he said, on an episode of Pod Save America, edited slightly for brevity (and here’s an Atlantic article in which he expanded the argument): David Leonhardt’s column “points out Martin Luther King, John Lewis, March on Washington, boycotts, etc., and how the civil rights movement presumably successfully appealed to America by pointing out the things that bring us together. And this is contrasted with N.F.L. players who are kneeling today in the movement inaugurated by [Colin] Kaepernick. “And David says, ‘While I’m in sympathy with these players, they need to look at the past and learn that it’s possible to appeal to the masses of Americans, that you can get Americans on your side if you can find something that bridges the gap, that brings us all together. And kneeling doesn’t do that.’ “And he shows some polling data to show that. I read that, and I almost threw my computer across the room. Because in fact there is polling data about what Americans thought of Martin Luther King, and the Freedom Riders, and the March on Washington. It wasn’t a high opinion at all.” "
670,"While the citizens of Puerto Rico persevere through the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the island’s creditors are engaged in a very different recovery effort. At the very moment when the island needs relief, those creditors are trying to increase the value of their debt holdings. Few things could be more damaging to Puerto Rico’s ability to rebuild. President Trump, who visited Puerto Rico on Tuesday, has said in tweets that the island’s debts “sadly must be dealt with.” That is true — but not by enhancing creditors’ returns. Instead, the island’s crushing debt should be reduced to the maximum extent through the legal framework established by Congress last year. Mr. Trump himself now seems to agree with that idea, without offering details. “They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we’re going to have to wipe that out,” he said in an interview on Fox News Tuesday. “You’re going to say goodbye to that, I don’t know if it’s Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that.” Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico was already enduring a debt crisis. The commonwealth had accumulated more than $70 billion in debt, paying interest rates as high as 8.5 percent. The public pension funds were depleted, and Medicaid money allotted from the Affordable Care Act had nearly run out. Gross national product had dropped by 15 percent since 2006, and the population had shrunk by more than 10 percent. Unlike municipalities such as Detroit, Puerto Rico did not have the right to declare bankruptcy and seek relief under Chapter 9 of bankruptcy law. So in June 2016, Congress passed Promesa (“promise”), a tough, bipartisan compromise that provided a comprehensive restructuring authority and independent oversight to temporarily oversee the island’s tangled finances. While imperfect, Promesa offered a powerful tool to reduce the island’s debt. "
671,"[Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] The Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine produced one very hot summer. Through August, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recorded between 1,000 and 1,500 nightly cease-fire violations, a large majority committed by Russian-led forces. Ukrainian soldiers and civilians continue to be killed or injured on a daily basis. While the attacks have tailed off since Labor Day, Moscow this month teed up a huge military exercise in western Russia, Belarus and Kaliningrad that stoked fears of an even broader assault. Since invading Ukraine three and a half years ago, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has mastered the tactical rheostat, turning up the heat at will, then cooling things down when the United States and Europe push back. In this way, he hopes to keep Ukraine permanently destabilized, fueling domestic discontent at Kiev’s inability to end the occupation, buying time to buy back the influence Russia lost by invading and bullying Ukraine into a Russian sphere of influence. President Trump’s pro-Putin predilections make him the least likely answer to Ukraine’s predicament. Yet his administration is quietly fashioning a policy that just could break the ice — if Mr. Trump agrees. It starts with a united front among Mr. Trump’s senior advisers — Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster. They see Russia’s occupation of eastern Ukraine for what it is: a gross violation of the most basic norms of international conduct that the United States helped establish after World War II. It is not acceptable for one country to change the borders of another by force. It is not O.K. for one sovereignty to dictate to another which countries or organizations it may associate with. It is not all right for Russia to decide Ukraine’s future. Mr. Trump’s team rightly believes that if the United States fails to stand against the abuse of these principles, the international order America built will be weakened. The administration enlisted a smart, seasoned diplomat, Kurt Volker, to run point on its Ukraine policy. He succeeds Victoria Nuland, whose dogged diplomacy gave the Kremlin fits. Hiring Mr. Volker at the same time the State Department is busy firing virtually every other special envoy sends a message to Moscow that Washington remains focused on ending the occupation, not ignoring it. So does the administration’s commitment to maintain the tough sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia and painstakingly tended to keep Europe on board. Those sanctions, coupled with sharply lower oil prices, have cost Russia dearly — including by denying it the sophisticated technology it needs to exploit increasingly hard-to-reach energy reserves. The Trump administration told Moscow sanctions will stay in place as long as Russia stays in Eastern Ukraine. "
672,"WASHINGTON — Long-simmering tension within President Trump’s national security team spilled into public view on Wednesday as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson took the extraordinary step of calling a news conference to affirm his support for Mr. Trump, despite what associates describe as his deep frustration with the president and talk of resignation. Mr. Tillerson praised Mr. Trump but did not deny a report that he once referred to the president as a “moron.” Mr. Trump welcomed Mr. Tillerson’s statement of support and declared “total confidence” in his secretary of state. If Mr. Tillerson had hoped to douse questions about how long he would stay, he instead further fueled a debate about his future. Although he insisted he had never considered resigning, several people close to Mr. Tillerson said he has had to be talked out of drafting a letter of resignation on more than one occasion by his closest allies, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff. And they said he has regularly expressed astonishment at how little Mr. Trump understands the basics of foreign policy. A former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson has never found his place as a subordinate to the hard-charging, unpredictable president. He has bristled at being undercut, as he was over the weekend when Mr. Trump publicly said Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time” by trying to open talks with North Korea. At the same time, Mr. Tillerson has alienated lawmakers, foreign policy veterans and the news media while demoralizing the State Department, and critics inside and outside the White House consider his troubles self-inflicted. The president initially viewed Mr. Tillerson as a granite-jawed cabinet secretary who fit Mr. Trump’s requirement that top advisers look as if they came out of “central casting,” as he has put it. Mr. Trump regularly boasted about hiring the head of the world’s largest corporation — and in the presence of a profoundly uncomfortable Mr. Tillerson, whom the president for months referred to as “Mr. Exxon.” But the deliberate, slow-talking oil executive has little personal chemistry with the quick-talking, impulsive Mr. Trump. Mr. Tillerson has avoided expressing his pique to the president. But aides and Trump associates who have been in the room with them said Mr. Tillerson’s body language, eye rolling and terse expressions left little doubt that he disapproves of Mr. Trump’s approach. "
673,"Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Wednesday made a statement from the Treaty Room of the State Department reiterating his support of President Trump. The following is a transcript of that statement, as prepared by The New York Times. For more coverage of his statement, read here » TILLERSON: Good morning. There are some news reports this morning that I want to address. First, my commitment to the success of our president and our country is as strong as it was the day I accepted his offer to serve as secretary of state. President Trump’s America-first agenda has given voice to millions who felt completely abandoned by the political status quo and who felt their interests came second to those of other countries. President Trump’s foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think is achievable on behalf of our country. We’re finding new ways to govern that deliver new victories. Our job is now to achieve results on behalf of America. We are doing that. We’ve created international unity around our peaceful pressure campaign around North Korea, including influencing China to exert unprecedented economic influence on North Korea. At the Riyadh summit, the president rallied Muslim-majority nations to assume new responsibilities for stopping terrorism. NATO members are now contributing more to shared security. And our approach to South Asia and specifically Afghanistan means building upon our relationships with India and Pakistan to stamp out terrorism and support the Afghan government in providing security for their own people. And ISIS’s fraudulent caliphate in Iraq and Syria is on the brink of being completely extinguished, thanks to an aggressive new strategy led by the president. "
674,"Before Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and before Hurricane Irma sideswiped the island less than two weeks earlier, the U.S. territory was already struggling to recover from an 11-year economic recession and overwhelming public debt. Now with no electricity and undrinkable water on much of the island, along with a loss of 80 percent of crop value, the island faces a humanitarian crisis. In this lesson, we help students to learn more about current events in Puerto Rico using New York Times reporting and videos. In the Warm Up, we start with two brief videos and a quick quiz. Then, we provide a menu of activities to help students learn more about the island — and find ways to help. _________ If students haven’t yet seen images of the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean, they might have a hard time appreciating the intensity of these tropical storms and the havoc they wreaked on communities. Start the lesson by having students watch this two-minute video showing Hurricane Maria and its effects in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands. After watching, ask students what they noticed during the video. What questions do they have? Next, have them watch another short video, below — this one less than one minute long — of residents in the hard-hit mountain town of Utuado sending video messages to their loved ones off the island. What is their reaction? "
675,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Wednesday that relations with America had “become hostage to the internal political situation in the U.S.,” but that his country had “many friends” in the United States who can help improve relations between the two nations when the political tensions in America settle down. “Certain forces use the Russian-American ties to solve internal political problems in the U.S.,” Mr. Putin said at a high-profile energy development forum in Moscow. “We are patiently waiting until this process in the internal political life in America will end.” Ties between Moscow and Washington have ebbed and flowed since President Trump took office, despite Russian lawmakers’ Champagne toast after election night in hopes that Mr. Trump would make significant moves in Russia’s favor. Speaking on Wednesday about his personal relationship with Mr. Trump, Mr. Putin said that there was basically “none.” “We have met only once, and spoke on the phone several times on several issues that are of mutual interest,” Mr. Putin said. The two leaders met in July in Hamburg, Germany, at a Group of 20 summit meeting, at which they had a long official conversation and also a shorter private one. “I believe that such a person like Mr. Trump, with his character, will never be hostage to someone’s interests,” the Russian president said, in a conference hall full of representatives of major international energy companies and organizations Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin’s leadership style. Many in Russia had hoped that Mr. Trump would lift the sanctions imposed by the United States over Moscow’s decision to annex Crimea and destabilize Ukraine, and that he would give Russia a free hand to act in the former Soviet republics. None of that has been realized, however. Instead, relations between the two countries have sunk even deeper as further revelations have surfaced about Russia’s meddling in the United States presidential election campaign. Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, has sharply criticized Russia over Crimea. Kurt Volker, a supporter of sanctions against Moscow, was appointed as the United States’ special representative to Ukraine. Still, Mr. Putin expressed optimism about the future of Russia’s relationship with the United States. “We have many friends in America who want to develop ties with us,” he said at the forum. “We support ties with them irrespective of the current political situation.” "
676,"WASHINGTON — The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee delivered a stark warning on Wednesday to political candidates: Expect Russian operatives to remain active and determined to again try to sow chaos in elections next month and next year. At a rare news conference, Senators Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the committee’s chairman, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and its vice chairman, broadly endorsed the conclusions of American spy agencies that said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a campaign of hacking and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. “The Russian intelligence service is determined — clever — and I recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously,” Mr. Burr said. “You can’t walk away from this and believe that Russia’s not currently active,” he added. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Mr. Putin initially wanted to hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, but later tried to explicitly help Donald J. Trump’s insurgent campaign. The senators said they have reached no conclusion on whether anyone around Mr. Trump was part of that effort. “The issue of collusion is still open,” Mr. Burr said. The news conference was the most extensive since the committee began its investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election early this year and the first time the senators have detailed so fully the trajectory of their secretive investigation and their sense of the stakes. Both men come from swing states where the presidential campaign was fought aggressively. That appeared to have made an impression. “There needs to be a more aggressive whole-of-government approach in terms of protecting our electoral system,” Mr. Warner said. “Remember, to make a change even in a national election doesn’t require penetration into 50 states.” "
677,"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Puerto Rico’s official death toll from Hurricane Maria more than doubled from 16 to 34 two weeks after the storm as a result of a full accounting intended to add up the piecemeal reports from around the island, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said Wednesday. Governor Rosselló said at a news briefing Wednesday that he had commissioned the accounting to add up the reports slow to arrive from devastated hospitals and local medical agencies. The new tally may still not be complete, but it offers the clearest picture yet of the death toll and how people died during and after Maria, he said. Nineteen people were killed directly by the storm — by drowning, being buried in mudslides, struck by falling objects or otherwise, Governor Rosselló said. He said the others had died indirectly — from a heart attack or suicide, or because they languished without oxygen or necessary medical care as hospitals floundered without power and patients were cut off from care. “We were not able to aggregate this complete set of data before,” Governor Rosselló said. “We were getting little bits of certified data, but after yesterday’s effort, we have a more complete picture of what has occurred in terms of direct deaths due to the storm and indirect as well.” Hector Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s secretary of public safety, indicated that there were “three to five” deaths that were still being studied to verify whether they were hurricane-related. “I don’t think this will be the final number,” Mr. Pesquera said. “And we’ve never said it will be.” "
678,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will repeal the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s effort to fight climate change, and will ask the public to recommend ways it could be replaced, according to an internal Environmental Protection Agency document. The draft proposal represents the administration’s first substantive step toward rolling back the plan, which was designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, after months of presidential tweets and condemnations of Mr. Obama’s efforts to reduce climate-warming pollution. But it also lays the groundwork for new, presumably weaker, regulations by asking for the public and industry to offer ideas for a replacement. The E.P.A. document, “October 2017 Tiering List,” lays out coming policy issues of high priority for the agency’s office of air and radiation, which oversees air pollution policies. “The agency is issuing a proposal to repeal the rule,” the document states. It says the agency will issue a formal notice of its intention to develop a new rule “similarly intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric utility generating units and to solicit information for the agency to consider in developing such a rule.” "
679,"“Hello, thank you for coming,” the shy 20-something Russian man said haltingly to 10 of us at Mazeish restaurant on the Lower East Side. We had each paid $65 to attend Displaced Dinners, a charity series hosted by the restaurant to help refugees set up their lives in America. These refugees — such as the Russian man — speak at, and sometimes cook, the Displaced Dinner meals, keeping the proceeds minus the cost of the food. His eyes betraying slight anxiety and emotional tumult, the Russian man proceeded to unspool his narrative of bureaucratic struggle and sweat-soaked nights. He traced the circuitous path by which he’d been arrested at an anti-Putin rally in Moscow two years ago and now, living in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, is seeking political asylum. The guests peppered him with questions: What were the conditions of the prison like? Have you changed your name? Are you scared? As I tucked into my food, I thought, “This will definitely be the most nuanced Yelp review I’ll ever write.” The United States accepted at least 84,994 refugees from 78 countries last year. The Trump administration plans to reduce these numbers, but it still seems important to discuss how best to treat those refugees who make it to these shores. What should we keep in mind when interacting with them? If you start chatting with your Ethiopian cabdriver, it can be rude to ask a lot of questions about Addis Ababa or the Great Rift Valley — he probably wants to be perceived as American, not Ethiopian.

681,"A Canadian-Iranian accountant who helped advise Iran’s negotiation team in talks that led to the 2015 nuclear agreement with the United States and other big powers has been sentenced to five years in prison for spying. News of the conviction and sentence, reported on Wednesday by Iran’s state-run Tasnim News Agency, did not identify the defendant by name, describing him only as a “spy who had infiltrated the team.” But after news of the arrest first emerged in August 2016, Iranian lawmakers critical of the nuclear agreement identified the defendant as Abdolrasoul Dorri Esfahani, a dual citizen of Canada and Iran. Mr. Esfahani was an adviser to Iran’s central bank and was believed to have helped the country’s nuclear negotiators bargain for the sanctions relief contained in the 2015 nuclear agreement. Canadian news reports have described Mr. Esfahani as an accountant involved in financial aspects of the agreement, which ended or eased many sanctions in return for Iran’s reduced nuclear fuel enrichment and verifiable pledges of peaceful atomic energy use. He was further described in some press accounts as a former diplomat at The Hague who had worked on resolving property disputes between the United States and Iran that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution and the break in relations between the two countries.

683,"My wife is a doctor, and her work schedule has long led me to wear a blackout mask while I sleep. Even still, I wake up every morning before dawn whether I want to or not. I take a moment to despair at my inability to return to sleep, then I reach for my iPad to check the news. On Monday, that news told me that Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young had been awarded the Nobel Prize for their studies of circadian rhythms. It was exactly those rhythms that pulled me out of dreamland. An inescapable feature of this planet is its cycles of day and night, and all life has become attuned to them. Our bodies have an internal clock that primes us for activity during hours when it is light and rest when it is dark. Remarkably, this clock doesn’t exist in just our brains. Almost every cell in our bodies — in our guts, livers and fat — shows an intrinsic rhythm when closely examined. Collectively, our cells’ rhythms affect not only waking and sleeping, but also blood pressure, body temperature and the ability to digest food and resist infection. Circadian rhythms are synchronized by daylight but, surprisingly, run independent of it. This is why jet lag occurs when you experience light cues that are at odds with your cellular biological clock. Drs. Hall, Rosbash and Young have been honored for uncovering the molecular pathways that control the circadian cycle. In particular, they identified a molecule (called “period”) that drives the biological clock. Its levels rise during nighttime to allow rest, and then decay during the day to spur activity. Period isn’t exclusive to human bodies. It functions in all animals, governing the morning crowing of the rooster and the evening songs of crickets. Evolution long ago invented an elegant way to coordinate life’s activity with daylight, and scientists have discovered it. "

685,"Austin, Tex. — Since the establishment of the Guantánamo Bay military commissions over 15 years ago, the dominant legal question has been whether they may try individuals charged with ordinary domestic criminal offenses that are not recognized as international war crimes. After years of conflicting decisions, that question has finally reached the Supreme Court, which will decide on Thursday whether to consider the issue in its current term. The case involves a Yemeni prisoner at Guantánamo, Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al-Bahlul, who was convicted by a military commission in 2008 of conspiracy to commit war crimes. While this is a crime under domestic law, it is not recognized as a war crime by international law. Hence the constitutional question: Does a military commission’s assumption of federal court jurisdiction over domestic crimes violate the Constitution, which reserves the “trial of all crimes” to the judiciary? The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld Mr. Bahlul’s conviction last year. But Judge Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, said the question in play should be decided because “other cases in the pipeline require a clear answer.” He’s absolutely right. Settling this question would go a long way toward settling the structural legitimacy of the Guantánamo tribunals. The justices should take heed and grant certiorari. (Disclosure: I have filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to take Mr. Bahlul’s case.) Although the United States had occasionally used military commissions to try enemy soldiers before the Sept. 11 attacks, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of such trials only in areas under military occupation or in cases in which the offenses were international war crimes. Because military occupation presupposes the absence of a functioning, civilian government, military tribunals are the only option. And as for international war crimes, the Supreme Court concluded during World War II that such offenses committed by enemy belligerents fell outside of the Constitution’s jury-trial protections — which otherwise require that all serious crimes be tried in civilian court. The principal innovation (and one of the central controversies) of the post-Sept. 11 military trials at Guantánamo has been to extend the reach of military commissions to purely domestic criminal offenses, especially conspiracy and “providing material support to terrorism.” The government has been unable to tie almost any of the Guantánamo detainees — most of whom were, at most, low-level Qaeda fighters — to specific international war crimes. But rather than simply hold the detainees in military detention or try them in civilian court, the government has used the secrecy-laden criminal proceedings at Guantánamo to push the constitutional envelope. Each of the eight convictions obtained by the commissions to date has included at least one purely domestic criminal charge, and five turned exclusively on such offenses. And each of the three cases pending at Guantánamo, including the trial of five men accused of being the masterminds of the Sept. 11 attacks, includes charges unsupported by the Supreme Court’s pre-Sept. 11 precedents.

686,"After even the most vicious of hurricanes, most Americans find there are comforts they can fall back on, however minuscule. They probably have a job to go to. Their cellphone can make calls. And even if they have no electricity, there is someplace a reasonable drive away that does — a friend’s or relative’s home, a restaurant that serves a hot meal. But if you are one of the residents of the American islands in the Caribbean, getting your life to resemble anything close to normal can take many months, if not longer. I lived on St. Thomas 15 years ago. When I was barely out of college, I accepted a job as a reporter for The Virgin Islands Daily News without even knowing where the place was on a map — the kind of rash decision that 22-year-olds are excellent at making. But my two years there were formative. And I developed an appreciation for the people and their culture, which in many ways resembled their status as a United States territory: technically American but uniquely Caribbean. When I returned there last week to report on the aftermath of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, I was immediately reminded of their many disadvantages. On a good day, the power often goes out. There were many evenings I would be sitting in the newsroom or watching television at my beachfront one-bedroom and everything would suddenly go dark. Like many people there, I bought a battery-powered alarm clock after waking up one morning to discover I had overslept because there had been a power failure in the middle of the night. The power grid, which like Puerto Rico’s has been neglected for decades, is especially vulnerable to storms. Now it is now mostly flattened, its wires lying across roads or tangled in trees, its poles snapped in half, its transformers sitting in puddles of stagnant floodwater. It will take months to fully restore. "
687,"Today, European Union regulators stepped up their tax campaign against American tech giants in a big way. • Europe’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said she would take Ireland to court over its failure to collect huge back tax bills from Apple. • Regulators ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros ($293 million) in unpaid taxes from Amazon. James Kanter, NYT: The context • Last year, Ireland was ordered to claim $15.2 billion in back taxes from Apple. • Luxembourg is already under scrutiny for its tax regime. In 2015, the country faced orders to claw back €30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit. The bigger picture Rochelle Toplensky, FT: Erasing the territory’s $73 billion in obligations would involve major losses for investors. And it isn’t clear whether the president or federal government actually has the power to do it. President Trump said, “I don’t know if it’s Goldman Sachs, but whoever it is, you can wave goodbye to that.” "
688,"Another day, another embarrassing foreign policy circus in the nation’s capital that can only further erode trust in American leadership at home and abroad. At its center is Rex Tillerson, who traded his job as top dog at the oil giant ExxonMobil to become secretary of state, only to find himself substantively and personally undercut by President Trump as recently as Sunday on the issue of Korea, where Mr. Tillerson wanted negotiations as Mr. Trump threatened war. On Wednesday, after NBC News reported that Mr. Tillerson was on the verge of resigning last summer, the secretary quickly called a news conference in which he asserted that he never considered doing so, though he did not personally deny a report that he had grown so disenchanted with the man in the Oval Office that he once called him a “moron” at a Pentagon meeting with the national security team and cabinet officials. Mr. Tillerson was said to be particularly upset by Mr. Trump’s highly politicized speech to the Boy Scouts of America, an organization the secretary once led. Various other Trump officials reportedly urged him to stay on at least until the end of the year, and Vice President Mike Pence counseled him on ways to ease tensions with the president. The conflicts are numerous and mounting. Last week, in Beijing, Mr. Tillerson described efforts to explore contacts with North Korea over the nuclear issue, only to have Mr. Trump scorn the initiative as a waste of time, leaving the impression that he was focused mainly on military options. In June, Mr. Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and other gulf states to ease their blockade of Qatar, only to have Mr. Trump endorse the crackdown. The Trump administration has twice certified that Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear deal that was one of former President Barack Obama’s major diplomatic achievements. Mr. Trump has left little doubt about his contempt for the deal. Domestic issues have also caused a wedge. Mr. Trump reportedly was furious when Mr. Tillerson distanced himself from the president’s disgraceful handling of the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., by saying the “president speaks for himself.” "
689,"Until their father’s personal lawyer intervened, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. were under criminal investigation by Manhattan prosecutors for possibly defrauding buyers of units in the Trump SoHo development, according to an investigation by ProPublica, WNYC and The New Yorker. An email showed the siblings “discussed how to coordinate false information they had given to prospective buyers,” according to the report. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., acknowledged that he dropped the case after a visit from President Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz, who has contributed to Mr. Vance’s political campaign, but said he did so because it was the right thing to do. Perhaps it was, and perhaps the president’s son and daughter did nothing criminal. But the deceptive behavior at the heart of the case would be familiar to anyone who’s observed Mr. Trump’s business career. The hustler is in the White House now, and the young members of the Trump family, with the cloud of suspicion that now constantly surrounds them, are top advisers. It’s recently come to light that Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both top administration officials, have been using at least three different personal email accounts for some government business, in potential violation of federal records acts. Mr. Kushner didn’t reveal his use of private email in a lengthy interview with Senate investigators who are looking into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in undermining the 2016 election. USA Today revealed on Wednesday that shortly after Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating those possible ties, asked for related White House records, the couple rerouted personal email accounts to Trump Organization servers. The White House levied small fines on both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump in late August for filing late updates to their financial disclosures, McClatchy reported this week. Such fines are rare, but this was a second fine for late filing by Mr. Kushner. Mr. Kushner has repeatedly botched legally required disclosures of his business assets, and omitted Russian contacts on his security clearance form, asserting that despite the assistance of a cadre of experienced lawyers, he just can’t seem to get the paperwork right. Some national security experts have said that if he weren’t the president’s son-in-law, Mr. Kushner would have been denied clearance under such circumstances. Since Ms. Trump entered the White House, her apparel brand has benefited or sought to benefit from trademark decisions in China, Japan, Kuwait, Qatar, Panama, Brazil and elsewhere. Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner like to be seen as moderating influences in the chaos of the Trump White House. John Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, appears to recognize that Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump are a drag on a White House already plagued by problems. Let’s also hope that he can persuade the Trump family members to deal more forthrightly with the American public than they did with their investors. "
690,"With their nine-page “framework,” President Trump and congressional Republicans have turned to tax cuts in a bid to get a victory on their policy agenda. Mr. Trump has promised to deliver “the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.” It achieved a rare feat of bipartisan agreement in Washington — worry from the left and the right about the plan’s potential to increase the deficit. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, warned that the plan would deepen the deficit by $5 trillion to $7 trillion. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said, “If I think it adds one penny to the deficit, I’m not going to vote for it.” Are the proposed tax cuts a huge giveaway to the rich? Most definitely. Will they, as advertised, create a booming economy with benefits that trickle down to everyone else? I don’t think so. Mr. Trump’s plan will widen the country’s already dangerous wealth and income gaps, and because the gains go mostly to those at the very top, the tax cuts won’t do much to promote broad-based consumer spending or overall job growth. That’s enough to reject the plan. But it would be unwise to oppose tax cuts, or any other federal legislation, simply because they add to the deficit. Why? Because bigger deficits wouldn’t wreck the nation’s finances. Unfortunately, budgetary effects are the sun around which everything revolves in Washington. Should we invest a trillion dollars in our crumbling infrastructure, offer Medicare for All or pass the biggest tax cut in the country’s history? Propose any of these, and the first question on everyone’s lips will be, “How are you going to pay for it?” The reason is simple: Lawmakers are obsessed with avoiding an increase in the deficit. "
691,"Two of the year’s most highly anticipated books are on this week’s list of recommendations: Jennifer Egan’s follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize-winning “A Visit From the Goon Squad” (2010); and Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “We Were Eight Years in Power,” his first book since “Between the World and Me” made him as close to a household name as public intellectuals get. The rest of the list offers a wide range of subjects, from the poet Eileen Myles’s memoir about life with a beloved dog to Attica Locke’s murder mystery set in Texas to N. K. Jemisin’s conclusion of her award-winning Broken Earth fantasy trilogy. John Williams
Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer MANHATTAN BEACH, by Jennifer Egan. (Scribner, $28.) Egan’s latest novel tells overlapping stories, but is most fundamentally about Anna Kerrigan, a young woman who works at the Brooklyn Naval Yard during World War II. “It’s a dreadnought of a World War II-era historical novel,” our critic Dwight Garner writes, “bristling with armaments yet intimate in tone. It’s an old-fashioned page-turner, tweaked by this witty and sophisticated writer so that you sometimes feel she has retrofitted sleek new engines inside a craft owned for too long by James Jones and Herman Wouk.” WE WERE EIGHT YEARS IN POWER: An American Tragedy, by Ta-Nehisi Coates. (One World, $28.) “We Were Eight Years in Power” is a selection of Coates’s most influential pieces about race in America from The Atlantic, with subjects including Barack and Michelle Obama, Donald J. Trump, reparations and mass incarceration. Newly written brief essays introduce each one. “Most of these pieces force a reckoning with ideas that people, mainly whites, avoid contemplating or reject or insist (sometimes rightly) are more complicated,” our critic Jennifer Senior writes. “Taking in Coates’s essays from start to finish” is “a bracing thing, like drinking a triple scotch, neat.” DIFFICULT WOMEN: A Memoir of Three, by David Plante. (New York Review Books, $16.95.) Plante’s memoir, first published in 1983 and now reissued, is a portrait of three of his friends (or so they believed): the novelist Jean Rhys; the feminist writer Germaine Greer; and Sonia Orwell, George’s widow. “Few writers have betrayed confidences with such uninhibited malice,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “‘Difficult Women’ is creepy, it is cruel, it is morally indefensible — and it is exhilarating. As Dylan Thomas wrote: ‘When one burns one’s bridges, what a very nice fire it makes.’” LITTLE FIRES EVERYWHERE, by Celeste Ng. (Penguin Press, $27.) The magic of Ng’s second novel, which opens with arson and centers on an interracial adoption, lies in its power to implicate every character — and likely many readers — in the innocent delusion that “no one sees race here.” The story’s vast and complex network of moral affiliations — and the nuanced omniscient voice that Ng employs to navigate it — make this novel even more ambitious and accomplished than her 2014 debut, “Everything I Never Told You.” DEFIANCE: The Extraordinary Life of Lady Anne Barnard, by Stephen Taylor. (Norton, $28.95.) Lady Anne Barnard was a Georgian-era London socialite whose legacy included roughly a million words in memoirs, letters, journals, diaries and poems, most of which are unpublished. Over the course of Taylor’s biography, a picture emerges of Anne as a cleareyed yet self-doubting woman determined to live life on her own terms even as she worried about her right to set those terms.

692,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “You have disappointed a lot of Catalans.” That was Carles Puigdemont, the Catalan leader, directly addressing King Felipe VI of Spain in a televised speech. Mr. Puigdemont accused the king of endorsing the “catastrophic” policies of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy instead of offering dialogue with Catalan separatists. Mr. Puigdemont said he wanted a negotiated settlement of the dispute. He made no mention — as he had previously — of plans for a unilateral declaration of independence. _____ • In the U.S., baffled investigators hope that the girlfriend of Stephen Paddock, who killed 58 people and injured hundreds in Las Vegas, can help explain what drove him to become a mass murderer. She returned to the U.S. from the Philippines late Tuesday. (Here is a public statement she made.) "
693,"KINGSTON, N.Y. — The Washington chef José Andrés has spent the past week in Puerto Rico cooking meals in hot-tub-size paella pans for Americans affected by Hurricane Maria. With his team, working out of mobile kitchens, restaurants and food trucks, he’s prepared more than 50,000 meals and counting. But you don’t have to be a famous restaurateur to make a difference through food. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, many Americans have taken to the streets. Some have taken a knee. Others have donated, written, called and boycotted. Me? I’m cooking. I have been an avid home cook for my entire life. I started making Thanksgiving dinner for my family when I was still in middle school. Now, along with voting and volunteering, one of the ways I resist is by cooking for activists here in Kingston, N.Y. I bring lasagnas to phone-banking meetings, roll rice-and-bean burritos for canvassers to eat on the go and drop off corn muffins at protests. I’ve also challenged myself to look closely at what happens around my own table. A few months back, Nicole Taylor, a fellow cookbook author, asked me the last time I invited someone who doesn’t look like me over for a meal. It’s a critical question we should all be asking ourselves, because the most valuable tool in our kitchens isn’t found in any drawer or cupboard: It’s the table. Remember that Derek Black, whose father was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, began to rethink his white nationalist views after being invited to Shabbat dinner by a college classmate. Over the summer, dismayed by the lack of racial diversity in food media, I invited four friends in the industry to my home for a weekend of conversation and organizing. My wife and I were the only white people there. Except to sleep, none of us ever left the kitchen table. That weekend’s endless meal has sustained me in so many ways. Listening to their experiences has helped inform every decision I make as a white cookbook author who has access to platforms such as the one you’re reading. "
694,"Stephen Colbert used a harsh profanity to describe President Trump on Wednesday during an appearance on stage at Michael Moore’s one-man Broadway play, “The Terms of My Surrender.” Mr. Colbert, the host of “The Late Show” on CBS, was one of the special guests whom Mr. Moore regularly invites to take part in the production. As the two men sat in armchairs with a large American flag illuminated in the background, Mr. Moore asked Mr. Colbert at one point, “How do you carry on now?” — a reference to the liberal late-night host’s approach to the Trump presidency. Mr. Moore added, “Your ability to use satire and humor to say the emperor has no clothes is profound every single night.” Laugh through the fear, Mr. Colbert replied. “Trump keeps summoning monsters of abstraction — things that aren’t real — they’re extensions of the ordinary, fears that you have that he plays on,” Mr. Colbert said. “He wants to brush people into a corner where he can shine his feeble, fucking anemic firefly of a soul,” Mr. Colbert continued, inching his two pointer fingers close together. The audience erupted into boisterous applause, and Mr. Moore gave a laugh. Mr. Colbert’s comments came during a conversation that lasted nearly 20 minutes, covering topics from American politics to Catholicism. At one point Mr. Colbert urged Americans not to be afraid in the current political climate, and described comedy as a balm. “When you’re laughing, you’re not afraid, and if you’re not afraid you can think,” he said. Referring to the Trump presidency, he added: “We felt our way into this thing, and we have to think our way out of it.” Mr. Colbert is one of Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics on late-night television, and his remarks about the president regularly trigger conservative ire and, occasionally, controversy. During one joke on his show in May, Mr. Colbert used coarse language to suggest a sexual relationship between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In response, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission said his agency was reviewing complaints about the joke; the commission ultimately took no action. "
695,"Our topic for today is hypocrisy. The scene is — where else? — Congress. This week the House of Representatives voted 237 to 189 to make it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman who has been pregnant more than 20 weeks. Victory for the anti-choice forces. One of whom was apparently very interested in maintaining all options when he thought his own girlfriend was expecting. Meet Tim Murphy, a Republican congressman from the Pittsburgh suburbs who has a doctorate in psychology, and is the co-author of a couple of books with titles like “Overcoming Passive-Aggression.” He’s married but — prodded by information revealed at his lover’s divorce trial — he admits having strayed with another psychologist. Murphy is a co-sponsor of the anti-abortion bill. At about the same time it was passing, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published a note his mistress had texted in January, complaining about the way he kept putting pro-life messages on his Facebook page “when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week. …” Whoops. This is not actually a unique story. There’s a history of lawmakers who are eager to restrict abortions in every case not involving their own personal sex life. Back in the ’90s Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, was targeted by his ex-wife, who claimed he had helped her get an abortion while they were married. It was a particularly embarrassing episode since Barr was so dedicated to the anti-choice movement he once said he’d stop his wife from having an abortion even if she had gotten pregnant via a rape. (This was a different ex-wife from the one who announced Barr had taken her to the abortionist. One of the things the various stars of this story have in common is a certain friskiness.) More recently, Representative Scott DesJarlais, a Tennessee Republican who bragged about his “100 percent pro-life voting record,” was confronted with pesky divorce records that showed he’d encouraged women to have abortions, including his ex-wife and a patient with whom he was having an affair. DesJarlais, a physician, is still in Congress and this week he was right there voting again against other people’s abortion rights. "
696,"Updated, 9:32 a.m. Good morning on this warming Thursday. Subway riders: Have you noticed anything missing from your commute? Like, maybe a seat? On Tuesday, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rolled out redesigned subway cars on the E line, with some of the seats removed. The agency hopes that up to 10 more people will be able to squeeze into each new car — meaning 80 to 100 extra commuters per train — to help reduce overcrowding. In all, 100 cars will lose their seats in the pilot program. The L train and the 42nd Street Shuttle are next in line for the redesign, according to the authority. Yesterday, we waited at the 34th Street station for a few trains to pass before one of the refurbished models, with its navy blue wrapping, pulled into the station. On board, we noticed a faint smell, like that of a freshly opened Band-Aid. Perhaps it came from the ceiling and walls, which were decorated with colorful new wallpaper that gave the car the feel of a preschool playroom. "
697,"Democrats point to a thousand reasons that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election. Here is another. In political circles, it’s common knowledge that in four key states President Trump unexpectedly carried counties that Democratic presidential campaign strategists had failed to recognize as crucial terrain — sparsely populated areas of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In “What I Got Wrong About the Election,” for example, published right after Clinton lost, David Plouffe, who had managed the Obama campaign in 2008, wrote that Plouffe added that this “happened in thousands of counties throughout the country, and it added up quickly.” What Democrats missed was the profound political impact recent immigration trends were having on the more rural parts of the once homogeneous Midwest — that the region had unexpectedly become a flash point in the nation’s partisan immigration wars. In a Brookings essay published last month, John C. Austin, director of the Michigan Economic Center, a local think tank, writes that the region is experiencing a “steady stream of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.” As a result, Austin continues, Austin went on, in an email, to provide more detail about the power of immigration to move white voters into the Trump column: In February 2017, Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and strategist, conducted four postelection focus groups with white voters who had cast ballots for Trump in Macomb County, Michigan, an area he has been studying since 1985. The participants were not Republicans. They were whites without college degrees who identified themselves as independents, as Democratic-leaning independents, or as Democrats who voted for Obama in 2008, 2012 or both. "

699,"WASHINGTON — The reconnaissance patrol was supposed to be a routine training mission along the border between Niger and Mali for the nearly dozen United States Army Special Forces trainers and the Nigerien soldiers with them. The American team leaders told their superiors in seeking approval for the mission that there was a “low risk” of hostile activity in the region 120 miles north of Niamey, Niger’s capital, according to a senior United States military official briefed on the mission planning. Late Wednesday afternoon, that mission proved anything but low risk. The patrol was ambushed by what commanders believe was a heavily armed Qaeda force from Mali, leaving three Americans dead and two others wounded. The combat casualties were the first that the United States has suffered in a widening counterterrorism mission in Niger, in northwest Africa. Pentagon officials expressed shock on Thursday at the deaths during such a routine mission. The brazen daytime attack raised serious questions about how the Special Forces — elite Green Berets who have spent years operating in shadowy combat zones — conduct threat assessments in the country and how their chain of command approves them. Pentagon officials vowed to examine how many Special Forces training missions had been conducted in border areas before Wednesday’s assault — and whether the Americans in Niger had inadvertently settled into a pattern of predictable activities that Qaeda fighters could exploit with deadly consequences. The concerns are particularly acute given that the ambush took place near the village of Tongo Tongo, just inside Niger in a region recently destabilized by cross-border jihadist attacks on the Nigerien army and refugee camps. In mid-June, the Nigerien army mounted an operation in this same northern Tillaberi region to take on the jihadists. "
700,"Mayor Bill de Blasio heads into the first general election debate next week with a commanding lead over his opponents, including the Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday. Sixty-one percent of likely New York City voters favored Mr. de Blasio for re-election, although only 57 percent said he deserved a second term. Ms. Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman who represents areas of Staten Island and southwest Brooklyn, garnered 17 percent in the poll, while Sal F. Albanese, who lost to Mr. de Blasio in the Democratic primary and is running on the Reform Party line, received 8 percent. Bo Dietl, a former police detective who runs a private investigations firm and is running on his own anti-de Blasio line, received 6 percent. A poll by NBC News and the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, also released on Thursday, found similarly wide margins for the mayor. With a fund-raising advantage and strong support from unions and other groups, Mr. de Blasio is gliding toward re-election, even though he has not spent much time on the campaign trail. So far, the mayor has not outlined a robust second-term agenda beyond continuing and expanding initiatives from his first four years, and he has allowed his staff and volunteers to mind his campaign. Mr. de Blasio has instead made himself more visible through mayoral work in communities, including accelerating the pace of town-hall meetings around the city. "
701,"WASHINGTON — A federal watchdog investigating whether the Internal Revenue Service unfairly targeted conservative political groups seeking tax-exempt status said that the agency also scrutinized organizations associated with liberal causes from 2004 to 2013. The findings by the Treasury Department’s inspector general mark the end of a political firestorm that embroiled the I.R.S. in controversy, led to the ouster of its commissioner and prompted accusations the tax collection agency was being used as a political weapon by the Obama administration. The exhaustive report, which examined nine years worth of applications for tax-exempt status, comes after a similar audit in 2013 found that groups with conservative names like “Tea Party,” “patriot” or “9/12” were unfairly targeted for further review. The new report found that the I.R.S. was also inappropriately targeting progressive-leaning groups. While the investigation does not specify the political affiliations of the groups, names that were flagged included the words “Progressive,” “Occupy,” “Green Energy,” and Acorn — the acronym for the now defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration noted that the report makes no characterization of the political leanings of any of the groups. The I.R.S. came under fire for its aggressive questioning of conservative groups in 2013. After a surge in applications for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012, the agency acknowledged that it began singling out terms such as “Tea Party” and “patriot” as a shortcut for determining if organizations were actually engaging in social welfare, which would qualify them for tax-exempt status, or if they might be political organizations.

702,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • U.S. investigators are grappling with the “secret life” of Stephen Paddock, hunting for details of his last 10 years and any clues to his motives in killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds in Las Vegas.

Mr. Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, said after returning from the Philippines that she hadn’t known of his plans. Read her statement. We reconstructed the 14 minutes of chaos unleashed by Mr. Paddock, who used devices known as bump stocks to increase the shooting power of his semiautomatic rifles.

703,"Cubans have long regarded emigrating to the United States as something of a birthright derived from the privations they endured as a result of sanctions that Washington has imposed on Cuba for decades. Last week, for the first time in decades, the United States effectively shut down the immigration pipeline from the island as it sharply reduced its staff at the embassy in Havana in response to mysterious ailments there, leaving in limbo more than 100,000 Cubans, most of whom are seeking to reunite with relatives. The decision to indefinitely suspend visa processing at the embassy — one of the busiest consular posts in the region — could mean that the United States will fail to honor its obligations under a 1994 deal that requires the admission of at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year, current and former American diplomats say. The accord was reached in an effort to stem an exodus by Cubans who took to the seas in rafts by the thousands in the 1990s trying to reach Florida. The halt in visa services comes roughly nine months after Washington ended its “wet foot, dry foot” policy. That policy, which required Cubans caught trying to reach the United States by sea to return home but allowed those who make it onto American soil to stay, had in recent years enabled an additional tens of thousands of Cubans to move to the United States. The sudden suspension of legal pathways for Cubans to settle in the United States could set off a new migration surge, experts in both countries said, particularly if Cuba experiences an economic downturn. "
704,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday ordered the Justice Department to take the position in court cases that transgender people are not protected by a civil rights law that bans workplace discrimination based on sex. The move was the Trump administration’s latest contraction of the Obama-era approach to civil rights enforcement. The dispute centers on how to interpret employment protections based on “sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In December 2014, the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., ordered the Justice Department to view “sex” as encompassing gender identity, extending protections to transgender people. But in a two-page memo to all United States attorneys and other top officials, Mr. Sessions revoked Mr. Holder’s directive. The word “sex” in the statute, Mr. Sessions said, means only “biologically male or female,” so the Civil Rights Act does not ban “discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.” He added that the department “will take that position in all pending and future matters,” except in cases in which a controlling lower-court precedent dictated otherwise, in which case it would reserve the option to revisit the issue on appeal. The policy change comes as the Justice Department is trying to get out of an employment discrimination lawsuit in Oklahoma that it filed alongside a transgender plaintiff, noted David Lopez, a former general counsel to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A judge appointed by President George W. Bush had previously ruled in that lawsuit that the Civil Rights Act does cover gender identity, agreeing with the department’s Obama-era interpretation. Federal appeals courts have reached varying views on whether the Civil Rights Act’s ban on sex discrimination extends to gender identity, but five circuits have ruled that it does, said James D. Esseks, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & HIV Project. "
705,"Ai Weiwei is many things — a restless artist in all media, China’s most prominent dissident, and a compulsive Instagrammer — but he’s a New Yorker, too. He lived here for a decade back in the 1980s and early 1990s. You can tell by the way he casually jaywalks through Greenwich Village without needing to really look at the traffic. “I’m hopelessly in love with this city,” he said as he ambled down Thompson Street recently, stopping at a store with chess pieces in its window and musing on the chess obsession of his idol, Marcel Duchamp. Though now Berlin-based, he has been spending time in New York preparing his Public Art Fund project, “Ai Weiwei: Good Fences Make Good Neighbors,” the most extensive installation that organization has ever mounted. It debuts Oct. 12 with more than 300 artworks throughout five boroughs, anchored by three large sculptures, in Central Park, Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village and Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. In a nod to Duchamp, Mr. Ai said the project uses “the city as a ready-made.” The installations are part of Mr. Ai’s effort to draw attention to the international refugee crisis, the subject of his new documentary, “Human Flow,” which opens in New York and Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, and represents a year and a half of work, during which he traveled to a dozen countries.

706,"On Monday, about 1,000 people, most of them young women, lined up at a New York City theater for a poetry reading by Rupi Kaur. Giant fake sunflowers outside made a safe space for guests to pose for Instagram in their hijabs, baseball caps, pantsuits, combat boots and cocktail dresses. Then on Tuesday came a big and quietly savage profile in The Cut. On Wednesday, The Guardian published an article on the “inevitable backlash” against her. What a week! Ms. Kaur, who is 25 and Punjabi-Canadian, is used to the ups and downs. In the three years since her blockbuster “Milk and Honey” was first self-published and later picked up by Andrews McMeel Publishing, she has dealt with all the issues other women face on Instagram and off: comparisons, aggression, bullying. But she has also built a community and an audience there in particular, with 1.6 million followers. Daunted by the tough stuff, she remained, because “it came back to the accessibility,” she said. “Instagram makes my work so accessible and I was able to build a readership,” Ms. Kaur said recently in a cafe in SoHo. “But then I always feel like within the literary world there’s of course downsides, because you have that label attached to your work and then, for some reason, that means you aren’t a credible literary source.” Instagram was where, in 2015, Ms. Kaur first seized on some fame, when the platform removed a photo of her. In it, she was in bed, back to the camera, with fake menstrual blood stains on her sweatpants and sheet. Instagram said the removal was an accident, and then returned it; now it’s just shy of 100,000 likes. Ms. Kaur appended a note: “i will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in an underwear but not be okay with a small leak.” "
707,"To the Editor: Re “Tillerson Denies Rift With Trump as Tensions Flare on Public Stage” (front page, Oct. 5):
The lack of self-respect and integrity among many of President Trump’s apologist servants is disappointing. While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was working hard in Beijing to establish communications with North Korea, directly or indirectly, Mr. Trump totally undermined him by tweeting that he was “wasting his time.” If something like that happened under any president before Mr. Trump, it would have been seen as shamefully disrespectful, terribly counterproductive and unbelievably bizarre. Yet Mr. Tillerson doesn’t have the courage to stand up for principle and quit. Shame on him for helping to enable Mr. Trump and for blindly serving his apparent master instead of the best interests of the American people. DAN ROTHMAN
FOUNTAIN VALLEY, CALIF. To the Editor: If Rex Tillerson owned up to calling the president a “moron” he’d be fired immediately, but he’d also earn the respect of many Americans and governments around the world. That would be his legacy as secretary of state. STAN PETERS, WARRENTON, VA. "
708,"A scientific enigma lies at the heart of a strange confrontation between the United States and Cuba. According to the State Department, nearly two dozen diplomats at the American Embassy in Havana have been stricken with a variety of mysterious medical symptoms, including hearing loss and cognitive difficulties. After concluding that staffers were the victims of a stealth attack, the department withdrew nonessential personnel from Havana and issued an advisory urging Americans not to visit. On Tuesday, the Trump administration expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the United States. The State Department has not provided further details about the medical condition of the affected staffers. But government officials have suggested anonymously that the diplomats may have been assaulted with some sort of sonic weapon. Experts in acoustics, however, say that’s a theory more appropriate to a James Bond movie. Sound can cause discomfort and even serious harm, and researchers have explored the idea of sonic weaponry for years. But scientists doubt a hidden ultrasound weapon can explain what happened in Cuba. “I’d say it’s fairly implausible,” said Jürgen Altmann, a physicist at the Technische Universität Dortmund in Germany and an expert on acoustics.

709,"To the Editor: Re “On Busy Calendar, E.P.A. Chief Puts Interests of Industries First” (front page, Oct. 3): The Environmental Protection Agency exists to protect human health and the environment. Its administrator, Scott Pruitt, continually undermines the purpose of this agency he is supposed to be running. We know that. It is unsurprising, but we cannot allow that to negate the fact that it is unacceptable at every level. Yes, he spends government money irresponsibly and meets with the wrong people, but the real issue and dangers go beyond that. He refused to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos, overruling the scientists working under him and ignoring objective evidence of significant hazards, and he delayed new rules for methane. He is continually endangering our health and the health of future generations and our planet. I’ve lost track of how many policies he has hastily rescinded in just a few months — policies that were designed to protect us. LILY VOGELSONG, TUSCALOOSA, ALA. To the Editor: As his recently published schedule proves, Scott Pruitt has consistently sought meaningful engagement with only a narrow subset of stakeholders — most notably, rich corporate polluters. My organization, Waterkeeper Alliance, which represents 176 clean-water advocacy organizations across the United States, requested a meeting with Mr. Pruitt in April. Our request was denied because of “a very busy schedule” (undoubtedly meetings with polluters), and we were instead directed to other Environmental Protection Agency staff members. Mr. Pruitt has shown that he is not interested in or willing to meet with nongovernmental organizations whose mission is aligned with E.P.A.’s — that is, protecting human health and the environment. It is reprehensible that the government official responsible for protecting American citizens from pollution is shutting out groups working on behalf of the public interest. We welcome the opportunity to meet with him and hope that he will, at some point, provide health and environmental advocates the same opportunities to be heard that he has routinely provided to polluters. "
710,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to overrule his top national security advisers and decline to certify the Iran nuclear agreement, according to people who have been briefed on the matter, a decision that would reopen a volatile political debate on Iran but is likely to leave in place the landmark deal negotiated by the Obama administration. By declining to certify Iran’s compliance, Mr. Trump would essentially kick it to Congress to decide whether to reimpose punitive economic sanctions. Even among Republicans, there appears to be little appetite to do that, at least for now. Still, Mr. Trump’s expected move would allow him to tell supporters that he had disavowed the accord, while bowing to the reality that the United States would isolate itself from its allies if it sabotaged a deal with which Iran is viewed as complying. Mr. Trump repeatedly ridiculed the accord during the 2016 presidential campaign, vowing to rip it up. White House officials cautioned that the president had not yet formally decided to “decertify” the agreement. But he faces an Oct. 15 deadline, and he has made little secret of his intentions, most recently when he declared at the United Nations two weeks ago that the agreement was “embarrassing to the United States.” Mr. Trump will present his decision on the deal as part of a broader American strategy to crack down on Iran for its ballistic missile program and destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East. Administration officials said he had signed off on the overall approach and hoped he would present it before the deadline. The strategy is an effort by the Trump administration to make the nuclear agreement only part of a multidimensional approach to pressure Iran on many fronts, including its missile program, its support for militant groups like Hezbollah and its intervention in the Syrian civil war on behalf of the Assad government. "
711,"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders in Congress are under attack from all sides of their own party, battered by voters from the right and left, spurned by frustrated donors and even threatened by the Trump White House for ineffective leadership and insufficient loyalty. Since last week, Senate Republicans lost one of their own when Roy S. Moore, the firebrand former state judge, trounced Senator Luther Strange in a Senate runoff in Alabama. The retirement of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee kicked off a potentially fratricidal fight for his seat, with the establishment’s preferred successor, Gov. Bill Haslam, declining to run on Thursday. An audiotape surfaced of Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Nick Ayers, lambasting Republican leaders and urging conservative donors to close their wallets to lawmakers who are disloyal to President Trump. And a House Republican, Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, was forced to resign this week after a text from his mistress became public in which she mocked him for trumpeting his staunch opposition to abortion as he pressured her to terminate a pregnancy. Former Representative Michael Grimm of New York has also resurfaced after serving time for felony tax fraud to challenge his Republican successor on Staten Island — with the backing of Mr. Trump’s former strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who was first elected to Congress in 1978, said he had never seen rank-and-file Republicans so stirred up against the party’s leaders in Congress. “Right now, the Moore-Bannon faction prevails,” Mr. Shelby said. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are making no attempt to mask their fear, predicting that failure to pass a tax overhaul in the coming months will lead to a wipeout in next year’s midterm elections. For the first time, some senators are contemplating whether their advantages on the electoral map next year could crumble amid a wave of primary challenges and other departures, putting their two-seat majority in jeopardy next year. "
712,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia warmly welcomed King Salman of Saudi Arabia under the gleaming chandeliers of the Kremlin on Thursday, signaling a rapprochement between two longtime rivals who have faced off in some of the world’s thorniest conflicts. King Salman’s visit, the first by a Saudi monarch, sought to cement growing ties between the world’s two largest oil producers, which have coordinated efforts to stabilize crude prices, lift their economies and end the war in Syria. The visit highlights efforts by King Salman, since he ascended the throne in 2015, to shift away from his country’s historical reliance on the United States and diversify its international partnerships, analysts said. The visit also acknowledges Russia’s increasing clout in the Middle East, and the kingdom’s tacit acceptance of the enduring rule of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, whom Saudi Arabia had opposed and Russia had intervened to save. “We cannot ignore that Russia has become a key player in the Middle East, particularly due to the Obama doctrine that saw the U.S. role in the region shrink,” said Faisal J. Abbas, editor in chief of Saudi Arabia’s Arab News, who was in Moscow for the visit. “Russia, with its financial and military might, stepped into the equation.” The recalibration of the kingdom’s foreign relations comes as it ushers in domestic reforms that could alter its socially conservative society. King Salman, 81, removed the power of arrest from the country’s religious police, and announced last week that the ban on women driving would be lifted. Other changes, such as repealing the ban on cinemas, are expected soon. "
713,"Seth Forrence is the fourth-generation manager of his family’s apple farm, Forrence Orchards, in Peru, N.Y. He is only 41, but the business, he said, has changed drastically during his lifetime. Traditional varieties like McIntosh and Cortland are slowly giving way to the sweetness of Honeycrisp and SnapDragon, and the trees are getting smaller; up to 1,200 can be packed into one acre. But there has been one constant during his time on the farm: the Jamaicans. At the orchard on a recent afternoon, a white 15-passenger van pulled up. The foreman, James Spence, who goes by Jimmy, got out, followed by another dozen Jamaican men of all ages. Dressed in long-sleeve shirts and pants, the unseasonably warm weather didn’t seem to be an issue. They said it reminded them of Jamaica. Joking with one another in a mix of English and Patois, the Jamaicans grabbed aluminum ladders from a nearby trailer, slung buckets around their necks and headed for the trees. “Get them red, get them big, no drops, no bruises,” Jimmy said. “O.K.?” Not that they needed the reminder. All the men were experienced pickers – they’ve been coming back for years, some of them decades. “They’re part of the family,” said Mr. Forrence, who remembers having a Jamaican babysitter as a child. “Jimmy has been with the family for 31 years.” Jimmy corrected him: “32.” New York is the second-largest apple-producing state in the country (the first is Washington State), churning out more than one billion pounds of fruit each year, according to the New York Apple Association. Weekenders looking to frolic in the orchards on a beautiful fall afternoon barely put a dent into such a bounty. To complete the harvest within the narrow picking window (late August through October, weather depending), orchards hire thousands of foreign workers, including hundreds from Jamaica. It’s a practice that stretches back more than 70 years in the region, and to the 1970s at Forrence Orchards. The workers come under the H-2A program, which brings temporary agricultural labor to the United States. For this year’s apple season, the Forrences hired 185 Jamaicans, split into about a dozen crews. "
714,"CHANTILLY, Va. — Standing before the space shuttle Discovery in a voluminous hangar outside of Washington, Vice President Mike Pence announced on Thursday a renewed focus on putting Americans in space and making a return to the moon. “We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond,” Mr. Pence said during a meeting of the National Space Council. The council, a group of senior federal officials that coordinates policy between NASA, the Defense Department and other agencies involved with space, was disbanded in 1993, but President Trump signed an executive order in June to reestablish it. (The meeting, which was held at the National Air & Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, was streamed live on the internet). Council members include Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao; Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross; General H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser; and Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Pence did not lay out a timetable for when American astronauts would step on the moon again or propose a strategy for getting there, much less broach the topic of a price tag. In his introductory comments to the council, Mr. Pence described the United States space program as in decline, and leveled sharp criticism of the Obama administration. “Rather than competing with other nations to create the best space technology, the previous administration chose capitulation,” he said. "
715,"The Trump administration urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to dismiss two cases challenging its revised travel ban, issued in March, saying they are moot in light of recent developments. But the plaintiffs urged the justices to decide the cases notwithstanding recent changes in the scope and duration of the travel restrictions. The court had been set to hear arguments in the case on Oct. 10. But the justices removed the case from the argument calendar last month after the administration announced in a presidential proclamation that it would replace temporary travel restrictions issued in March that had limited travel from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days. The new restrictions, which are set to take effect on Oct. 18, apply in various ways to nine countries. Most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea will be barred from entering the United States, while citizens of Iraq and some groups of people in Venezuela will face restrictions or heightened scrutiny. “A case is moot,” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote on Thursday, “when a challenged government regulation is replaced by one that is not substantially similar.” The new restrictions are different from the earlier ones in important ways, he wrote, and were “based on detailed findings regarding the national security interests of the United States that were reached after a thorough, worldwide review and extensive consultation.” A challenge to the new restrictions, Mr. Francisco wrote, “must proceed on its own terms and in the district court in the first instance.” "
716,"Washington Redskins receiver Terrelle Pryor said he was called racial slurs from the crowd during Monday night’s game at Kansas City, and the N.F.L. said on Thursday that it was looking into the incident. On his way out of the game, Pryor made an obscene gesture to the crowd, which he said was motivated by the slurs. A brief video published by TMZ Sports shows the scene after the confrontation had started. It revealed obscene words and gestures on both sides, but no racial slurs are clearly audible. “We are looking into all aspects of it, and we will report back when we have concluded that review,” Joe Lockhart, an N.F.L. spokesman, told NBC. “We have no tolerance for racial comments directed to anyone. Those fans are not welcome to come back this week, next week, or any time.” On Instagram on Wednesday, Pryor said that he was called the slur multiple times. He said that as a result, an N.F.L. employee stood next to him from the second quarter on. He wrote that such incidents were “the exact reason why guys are kneeling during anthem.” “Me flicking the person off is more deserving,” he wrote. “I do apologize to my teammates and the organization. But at some point you keep calling us the N-word, we going to start acting up.” Race has been a major issue for the N.F.L. this year, with many players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination and police brutality. President Trump has weighed in, scolding those who do not stand. Pryor stood for Monday’s anthem — “I chose not to kneel because as a team we decided to be one and stand,” he wrote — but at least two Chiefs players did not. The Chiefs won the game, 29-20. Pryor, 28, was a quarterback at Ohio State and initially in the N.F.L. with the Raiders, then converted to wide receiver with the Browns. He was briefly a member of the Chiefs, but he did not get in a game. In May, Orioles outfielder Adam Jones was racially taunted by some fans in Boston. He received an extended ovation from Red Sox fans the next night. "
717,"WASHINGTON — When Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson traveled to Saudi Arabia with President Trump last spring, he impressed hosts and visitors alike by swaying along with the traditional men’s dancers swathed in white robes and brandishing swords. “Not my first sword dance,” Mr. Tillerson deadpanned afterward. Indeed, the calculation behind Mr. Tillerson’s appointment was that he could parlay decades of experience as an oil executive brokering deals in the Middle East and elsewhere into success in the nation’s top diplomatic post. But as Mr. Tillerson has discovered, the most important target of any secretary of state’s diplomacy is the president he serves. Now the man brandishing the sword is Mr. Trump, who holds it over Mr. Tillerson’s neck, poised to swing at any moment. The relationship between the two men has grown so acidic that Mr. Tillerson felt compelled to call an extraordinary news conference on Wednesday to deny that he was thinking of resigning — a move that paradoxically only increased speculation that he might in fact resign, of his own free will or not. Even if he stays, Mr. Tillerson is now a wounded figure, his credibility at home and abroad diminished by the perception that he does not have a close alignment with the president. Foreign leaders and diplomats may doubt that he truly represents the administration or that his assurances will stick. A countdown clock has been set, ticking away toward what many assume is the inevitable departure. “Tillerson has good instincts on many foreign policy issues and is ready to provide independent advice,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime State Department peace negotiator now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “Despite Tillerson’s efforts to project the fact that it’s all one big happy family, however, the road ahead with a president who consistently undercuts him publicly won’t be easy.” Michael Doran, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who served in several national security positions under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump has made clear that staying on the same page as his top advisers is not a priority. In some cases, he said, that may provide value in forging a “good cop, bad cop” strategy that gives Mr. Tillerson leverage to demand more in negotiations with other countries. "
718,"A federal agency on Thursday imposed tough new restrictions on so-called payday lending, dealing a potentially crushing blow to an industry that churns out billions of dollars a year in high-interest loans to working-class and poor Americans. The rules announced by the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are likely to sharply curtail the use of payday loans, which critics say prey on the vulnerable through their huge fees. Currently, a cash-strapped customer might borrow $400 from a payday lender. The loan would be due two weeks later — plus $60 in interest and fees. That is the equivalent of an annual interest rate of more than 300 percent, far higher than what banks and credit cards charge for loans. Because most borrowers cannot repay their debts quickly, the loans are often rolled over, entangling those who take them in hard-to-escape spirals of ever-growing debt. The new guidelines pit the consumer bureau, an independent watchdog created in the aftermath of the financial crisis, against congressional Republicans and President Trump, who has made rolling back business regulations a centerpiece of his agenda. The bureau has aggressively pursued new regulations and enforcement actions since Mr. Trump took office, even as other federal agencies loosened the reins on the industries they monitor. "

The late-night shows were buzzing with Wednesday’s reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had called President Trump a “moron,” and that Vice President Mike Pence had to persuade him not to resign.

After resisting legislative limits on guns for years, Republicans signaled that they were open to banning the firearm accessory that Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas gunman, used to make his rifles mimic automatic-weapon fire. We explain what “bump stocks” are, and how he used them. With photographs and maps, we look inside Mr. Paddock’s 32nd-floor suite, where the casino regular stayed for free as a reward for his loyalty. We also learned about his gambling habits. (He preferred video poker.) Here are the latest updates in the investigation. Mr. Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, said on Wednesday that she hadn’t known of his plans. She was in the Philippines at the time of the shooting and thought — because he had wired her money and told her to buy a house — that he was breaking up with her. Read her statement. • Fourteen minutes of chaos. Using videos and police scanner conversations, we reconstructed the events that left 58 dead and about 500 injured. We also debunked some rumors that spread after the shooting. "

723,"PYONGYANG, North Korea — To fly into North Korea on an old Russian aircraft is to step into an alternate universe, one in which “the Supreme Leader” defeats craven American imperialists, in which triplets are taken from parents to be raised by the state, in which nuclear war is imminent but survivable — and in which there is zero sympathy for American detainees like Otto Warmbier. Warmbier was the University of Virginia student who was arrested for stealing a poster, then sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and eventually returned to the U.S. in a vegetative state. “He broke the law in our country,” said Ri Yong-pil, a senior Foreign Ministry official, adding that Warmbier was returned (a week before his death) as a “humanitarian” act. Another senior ministry official, Choe Kang-il, insisted that North Korea had provided excellent care and spent “all the money for nursing” him. Something in me snapped. I asked how North Koreans could possibly boast about their spending on a young man when he was in a coma only because of them. Choe replied just as hotly that Warmbier had not been mistreated and was in fine condition when he was sent back home. “The U.S. administration, or some people with a certain intention, let him die,” Choe said. “This must be intended to foster and spread anti-Communist hatred within America.” Officials offered no apology and gave no ground, reflecting a hard line toward the United States that I found everywhere on this visit; Choe derided President Trump as “a crazy man,” “a thug” and “a pathetic man with a big mouth.” I’ve been covering North Korea on and off since the 1980s, and this five-day trip has left me more alarmed than ever about the risks of a catastrophic confrontation.

725,"It was exactly six years ago — a lifetime in the world of politics in Washington — that A.J. Ferate, then a senior regulatory lawyer and lobbyist at Devon Energy in Oklahoma City, first reached out to Scott Pruitt, then a little-known first-term attorney general, to ask for a bit of help. Back in 2011, Devon executives were so determined to try to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from enacting a new rule intended to more aggressively limit methane leaks from oil and gas wells — a potent contributor to climate change — that they drafted a letter for Mr. Pruitt to send to Lisa Jackson, then the E.P.A. administrator. Shortly thereafter, Ferate followed up. Mr. Pruitt’s office sent the letter nearly verbatim. Devon Energy ultimately donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Attorneys General Association and an affiliated organization. The New York Times reported on that in 2014, detailing the alliance between Mr. Pruitt and the oil and gas industry while he served as Oklahoma’s attorney general. Our stories were part of a package that won a Pulitzer Prize. So why return to the issue now? Well, until this year, Mr. Pruitt was never really able to deliver on what Mr. Ferate, and Devon Energy, wanted: the termination of the methane rule, and of a related effort by the E.P.A. to collect data on methane emissions by oil and gas companies.

726,"LONDON — The Russian energy and aluminum company EN+ said on Thursday that it planned to raise $1.5 billion in an initial public offering in London and Moscow. The listing would be one of the largest by a Russian company since the Kremlin drew sanctions and international condemnation by annexing Crimea in 2014. The I.P.O. would be a test of how attractive Russian assets are to investors, given the often tense geopolitical background. EN+ is owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska. Mr. Deripaska is a member of the inner circle of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and he once had close ties to Paul J. Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager. Mr. Deripaska offered this year to cooperate with congressional committees investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States, but American officials were said to be unwilling to accept his conditions, which included a request for full immunity. Maxim M. Sokov, the chief executive of EN+, said in a news release that listing in London and Moscow “will further increase our profile among the international financial community, support our deleveraging plans and give new investors a chance to participate in an exciting yield and growth story.” “Looking ahead, we are confident that we can create real value for all shareholders, deliver strong growth and pay an impressive dividend,” he added. EN+ said it intended to list global depositary receipts on the London Stock Exchange and on the Moscow Exchange, adding that it intended to list in London next month. The company said it planned to use the proceeds to repay a portion of its debt. As part of the offering, AnAn Group, a Singapore-based strategic partner of CEFC China Energy Company, is expected to act as a cornerstone investor and has committed to purchase $500 million in securities. EN+ is a producer of hydropower through EN+ Power and of aluminum through Rusal, in which it holds a 48.1 percent stake. EN+ reported revenue of $5.8 billion in the first half of this year. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch International, SIB (Cyprus) Limited and VTB Capital are acting as joint global coordinators on the offering. "
727,"I have never understood the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment. From a law-and-order standpoint, more guns means more murder. “States with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides,” noted one exhaustive 2013 study in the American Journal of Public Health. From a personal-safety standpoint, more guns means less safety. The F.B.I. counted a total of 268 “justifiable homicides” by private citizens involving firearms in 2015; that is, felons killed in the course of committing a felony. Yet that same year, there were 489 “unintentional firearms deaths” in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Between 77 and 141 of those killed were children. From a national-security standpoint, the Amendment’s suggestion that a “well-regulated militia” is “necessary to the security of a free State,” is quaint. The Minutemen that will deter Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are based in missile silos in Minot, N.D., not farmhouses in Lexington, Mass. From a personal liberty standpoint, the idea that an armed citizenry is the ultimate check on the ambitions and encroachments of government power is curious. The Whiskey Rebellion of the 1790s, the New York draft riots of 1863, the coal miners’ rebellion of 1921, the Brink’s robbery of 1981 — does any serious conservative think of these as great moments in Second Amendment activism? And now we have the relatively new and now ubiquitous “active shooter” phenomenon, something that remains extremely rare in the rest of the world. Conservatives often say that the right response to these horrors is to do more on the mental-health front. Yet by all accounts Stephen Paddock would not have raised an eyebrow with a mental-health professional before he murdered 58 people in Las Vegas last week. What might have raised a red flag? I’m not the first pundit to point out that if a “Mohammad Paddock” had purchased dozens of firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition and then checked himself into a suite at the Mandalay Bay with direct views to a nearby music festival, somebody at the local F.B.I. field office would have noticed. "
728,"Updated Feb. 1, 2018 The list of Trump scandals keeps growing. “Amid the chaos and dysfunction,” Slate’s Jamelle Bouie writes, “it can be easy to miss that this White House is corrupt. Remarkably, unbelievably, corrupt.” Given the number of potential scandals involving personal enrichment — of President Trump, his family or top administration officials — I wanted to create a list of all the major ones. Here goes: • The presidency is benefiting Trump’s business in numerous ways. Government officials have stayed in hotels that bear Trump’s name, for example, while some foreign government officials have taken steps to curry favor by better accommodating Trump-branded properties in their countries. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club doubled its membership rates after he won the White House. Trump’s companies sold more than $35 million in real estate last year, according to one report. Many of the sales went to opaque shell companies, which hide the buyers’ identities, and flow into a trust the president may access. Trump International Realty, run by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s sons, is seeking new business in South Florida. Also: Eric Trump has been giving his father quarterly updates on the financial health of his businesses, despite promises that the president would have no involvement. Those businesses have also done deals with foreign governments, despite the president’s pledge that they wouldn’t. • Trump has spent more than $30 million of taxpayer money traveling to properties he owns, by one estimate. • Ryan Zinke, Trump’s secretary of the interior, is under investigation for chartering a $12,000 flight from Las Vegas to Montana at taxpayers’ expense. Zinke also failed to disclose an investment in a Montana gun company, booked a $12,000 flight on an oil executive’s plane, spent almost $40,000 of a wildfire preparedness fund to pay for flights and paid $6,000 for a helicopter trip to visit Vice President Mike Pence. • David Shulkin, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, charged taxpayers for a trip to Europe that included stopovers at Wimbledon and Westminster Abbey, plus a river cruise for him and his wife. "
729,"Although the U.S. Department of State recently issued a travel warning on Cuba, a number of cruise lines plan to add itineraries to Cuba next year. The Sept. 29 statement, which “warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Cuba,” is based on a series of mysterious illnesses that have befallen U.S. Embassy workers in Havana. But several cruise lines operating ships in and around Cuba have released statements pushing back on the warning, noting that no tourists have been harmed in these incidents. They also say cruising is compliant with new travel restrictions that were imposed in June by President Trump, who essentially rolled back President Obama’s easing of sanctions in 2014. The new rules make independent travel more difficult, essentially funneling interested travelers to tour companies, including cruise lines. Although the Trump administration’s expulsion of Cuban diplomats this week in retaliation for the American diplomats’ ilnesses suggests that relations are becoming more fraught between the two nations, travel remains legal, and non-Cuban-born Americans seeking to visit Cuba may still receive their visas to do so through their airline, cruise line or tour operator. It is possible, given the skeleton crew operating at the Cuban embassy, that the visa process could slow, but at present tour operators say they have visas on hand. Several cruise companies had already announced significant expansion of their Cuba operations before the warning was issued. Carnival Cruise Line launched its Cuba itinerary aboard the Carnival Paradise in June and recently announced five new sailings in 2018. Departing from Tampa, the mix of four-to-eight-day cruises include Havana as a port of call along with other Caribbean island stops (from $589 a person). Norwegian Cruise Line is adding four-day cruises to Cuba from Port Canaveral next May. The trips also visit Key West and offer an overnight in Havana (from $599 a person). "
730,"The architecture of Canada’s new National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa is both symbolic and haunting, with six concrete triangles depicting the stars that Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany, and that marked millions of them for extermination during World War II. But while the structure’s design embodies Jewish suffering during the Holocaust, a plaque placed outside it failed to mention Jews or anti-Semitism, an omission that has drawn furious criticism. The plaque outside the memorial — the country’s first national Holocaust monument, 10 years in the making and inaugurated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week — paid tribute to the “millions of men, women and children murdered during the Holocaust” and the “survivors who persevered and were able to make their way to Canada after one of the darkest chapters in history.” The omission of any mention of Jews in the inscription was immediately seized upon by opposition politicians, rights advocates and the Israeli news media. Some groups turned to social media to express criticism. The plaque was removed. The Times of Israel headline blared, “Canada Holocaust memorial omits any mention of Jews, anti-Semitism.” David Sweet, a lawmaker from the opposition Conservative Party, asked Canada’s Parliament, “How could the prime minister permit such a glaring omission of reference to anti-Semitism and the fact that the millions of men, women and children who were murdered were overwhelmingly Jewish?” He added: “If we are going to stamp out hatred of Jews, it is important to get history right.” "
731,"WASHINGTON — Rising exports and falling imports shrank the United States’ trade deficit in goods and services to the lowest level in nearly a year, data released Thursday by the Commerce Department showed. The trade deficit — the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports — narrowed to $42.4 billion in August, down $1.2 billion from July. Exports for the month were $195.3 billion, while imports came to $237.7 billion. The nation’s trade deficits with China and the European Union both shrank in August. Josh Feinman, the chief economist of Deutsche Asset Management, said those trends were largely the result of a strengthening global economy that buoyed American exports, as well as the weakening of the value of the dollar. “Global growth is looking better,” Mr. Feinman said. “That does create a little bit of a tailwind for exports.” He cautioned that the economic impact of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25, could be distorting the data somewhat, as ports closed and people stayed home from work and shops. Despite the narrowing in August, the overall trade deficit is still growing on an annual basis. It was up 8.8 percent in the first eight months from the same period in 2016, according to Commerce Department data. President Trump has often pointed to the trade deficit as evidence that the United States is not benefiting from global trade in the way that it should. He has promised that his America-first policy will help shrink the gap, consistently citing deficits with other countries as a sign that the United States is losing when it comes to global trade. And he has typically blamed trade agreements and negotiators for failing to achieve the best terms for American exporters. "
732,"Not since the Cold War has there been a diplomatic mystery as intriguing as the “sonic weapon” purportedly used against American and Canadian officials in Havana. The Trump administration has yet to identify a culprit or a device that would explain the rash of symptoms among officials first noted months ago and acknowledged in August, but these are real and deeply worrisome: hearing loss, dizziness, headaches and cognitive issues. Every country keeps tabs on potentially hostile diplomats and spies, and the Cold War spy vs. spy games were rich in gimmickry and trickery. But deploying a tool that causes serious health problems would be a serious violation of accepted international behavior. Cuba’s repressive government must be the prime suspect. It would certainly want to keep watch over a large batch of newly arrived American diplomats and intelligence operatives. If Cuba is found to have used some new surveillance machine, the United States would have the obligation to respond angrily. But until there is concrete evidence about the source of the attacks, the Trump administration is wrong to expel Cuban diplomats from Washington, as it did on Tuesday. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s explanation that Cuba should be punished for failing to protect American diplomats presumes that Cuba was at least aware of the attacks, which the United States has neither demonstrated nor claimed. So far, the Cuban government has strongly denied any awareness of a sonic weapon and has actively assisted American investigators. Other parties, most notably Russia, must also figure as suspects: President Vladimir Putin would probably welcome a setback to U.S.-Cuban relations. Until something more is known, punishing Havana serves only to further undermine the sensible opening to Cuba begun under Barack Obama. President Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the détente — in June his government ordered restrictions on contacts with Cuba that have slowed the flow of visitors to the island, and last week the State Department warned Americans not to travel there, though there is no evidence that tourists are in danger. The sonic attacks on Americans are too serious to be used for cynical political ends. "
733,"LOS ANGELES — An invitation to visit Pink in Venice, a few blocks from the beach, for a home-cooked Monday night dinner could seem like a contrived play for authenticity. But it’s hard to remain skeptical when faced with a giggling baby. Faux-intimate or not, the domestic scene earlier this month featuring Top 40’s long-reigning rebel was disarmingly unpolished: an entryway cluttered with roller skates, stuffed animals, kites and bike helmets; a chicken in the oven; and the singer’s second child, the nine-month-old Jameson, making only a moderate mess with his spoon-fed mush. (Willow, 6, was elsewhere with her father, the former motocross racer Carey Hart.) Pink, who has spent nearly two decades selling her relative edge and honesty from within the pop machine, is not quite Martha Stewart. She wore tattoo-baring overalls and diamond earrings as she passed the baby (named for the whiskey) to his nanny, and began dressing a salad with the uncertainty of a 20-something playing dinner party. Slide sandals emblazoned with the words “Frigid Whore” sat nearby. This is the life of a well-adjusted veteran star, who’s not quite sure how she’s survived this long and stayed this sane. A vestige of the Y2K, peak-CD, MTV “TRL” generation, Pink, now 38, hasn’t melted down or ever really gone away, a fact she owes to never having been “the one.” “I’ve never won the popularity contest,” she said over the roasted chicken and vegetables she declared “mostly cooked.” “I was never as big as Britney or Christina. If you look at any paragraph about pop music, I don’t get mentioned — my name doesn’t come up. And yet, here I go again, right under the wave, duck-diving.” It’s not that she’s been ignored, or burrowed in a niche. Since her debut, “Can’t Take Me Home,” in 2000, Pink has sold more than 16 million albums and some 45 million digital songs in the United States, according to Nielsen Music; she’s had 23 songs in the Billboard Top 40 (including her current single, “What About Us”), with four No. 1 hits and 11 more that reached the Top 10. She headlines arenas around the world and will perform on “Saturday Night Live” on Oct. 14, the day after the release of “Beautiful Trauma,” her seventh solo album. "
734,"Can this tax plan be saved? Given the chorus of derision that greeted the release last week of the “Unified Framework for Fixing Our Broken Tax Code,” as the White House is calling it, the most ambitious attempt at tax reform in over 40 years would appear to be on a respirator, if not yet dead. Predictably, Democrats, their allies and many independent economists pounced on the plan as a tax cut for the rich. Deficit hawks, including many Republicans, denounced it as recklessly driving up the federal deficit. And legislators from high-tax states, including Republicans, howled at the proposal to end the deduction for state and local taxes. Not surprisingly, for the most part President Trump has taken the approach of publicizing the benefits of his plan — mostly corporate and business tax cuts — while leaving the hard part, closing loopholes, to Congress. As Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, put it: “Tax cuts are easy. Tax reform is hard.” But this plan is just an opening salvo. I was surprised this week, in interviews with tax experts from across the political spectrum, to hear that all those issues can be resolved, if Congress is willing to take up the challenge. Critics of the plan have mostly ignored that substantial elements of it have drawn bipartisan support. Almost everyone agrees that corporate tax rates need to be cut because of global competition. Companies should not be able to stash earnings overseas tax-free. With the standard deduction doubled, many more individual taxpayers could file a simple short-form return. A lower rate for small businesses and pass-through entities, while more controversial, should promote economic growth. “The most important things for the middle class will be better economic performance and growth in wages,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative pro-growth advocacy group. “That’s a much more powerful force than any tax policy. From that perspective, this is a promising start. But it’s only a start.” "
735,"Major leaguers set records in 2017 for home runs, strikeouts and relief innings. The top eight teams in slugging percentage all reached the postseason. So did the top eight pitching staffs in strikeouts. Now, a season of extremes hurtles into October. With the wild-card games complete, the best-of-five division series are set: Boston at Houston; the Yankees at Cleveland; the Chicago Cubs at Washington; and Arizona at the Los Angeles Dodgers. The American League games start Thursday, the National League Friday. “You could make the argument the field is as strong as it’s been in recent memory – and not just with one or two defined strengths, but really well-rounded teams,” Chris Antonetti, the Indians’ president of baseball operations, said last week. “Anyone’s really capable of winning.” That is true, and we hate to spoil the suspense. But if you’d like to know precisely what will happen, here are our reality-based, sure-to-be-accurate predictions: Oct. 6, Houston, A.L.D.S., Game 2 – Eight players have collected five hits in a postseason game, most recently Albert Pujols in the 2011 World Series. Make way for another as the Astros’ Jose Altuve – who has 98 more hits than anyone else in the majors over the last four seasons – torments the Red Sox in Game 2. Oct. 9, New York, A.L.D.S., Game 4 – The mighty Yankees bullpen, which collected 26 outs in the wild-card game, is called on to bail out Luis Severino again in Game 4 against the Indians. After Severino’s scoreless first inning, Chad Green escapes a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the second. The Indians win to advance, but Severino does improve his postseason earned run average to 20.25 – mercifully lower than Jay Witasick’s infamous 21.60 showing in 2001. "
736,"WASHINGTON — The House took the first major legislative step Thursday toward enacting a promised overhaul of the tax code, approving a budget blueprint that would allow a future tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes. The House voted 219 to 206 to pass the budget resolution, with 18 Republicans voting against it. The belated approval of a spending and revenue blueprint for the fiscal year that began on Sunday offered a momentary display of Republican cohesion as the party moves ahead in its attempt to overhaul the tax code for the first time since Ronald Reagan was president. The document itself ostensibly charts a path toward a balanced budget over the next 10 years, giving Republicans something to offer their core conservative voters while providing Democrats with new lines of attack in the 2018 midterm elections. But few people believe the broad spending road map will lead anywhere. What is important is parliamentary language that would shield a tax bill from a filibuster in the Senate. A week after Republicans conceded defeat in their attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, that constituted a step forward in their new legislative quest. “Our budget is the golden key that unlocks pro-growth tax reform,” said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee. For Republican lawmakers still looking for a major legislative achievement in the Trump era, the hard part still remains. President Trump and Republicans in Congress need to agree on the contents of a bill to overhaul the tax code, a daunting task. "
737,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) San Francisco’s drug problem is in your face. Walk around long enough and you may well kick a used syringe or see someone shooting up in plain view. The visibility of the scourge is one reason city leaders are starting to move seriously toward creating so-called supervised injection sites. It would be among the first American cities to do so. Supervisor London Breed has been a champion of the idea. In an interview, she recounted some of the efforts so far to address the drug problem: outreach, a needle exchange program and cleanup crews that collect thousands of syringes a month. “But that’s not all working,” she said. Needle exchanges have existed in the United States since the 1980s. They’ve been shown not only to slow the spread of deadly viruses, but also to aid in recovery by luring addicts into the public health system. Supporters say injection facilities, which include clean syringes and medical supervision, extend those benefits. Australia, Canada and several European nations have had them for years. "
738,"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed Randal K. Quarles as the Federal Reserve’s vice chairman for supervision, an important victory for the Trump administration in its campaign to ease some financial regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Quarles is the first person to officially hold the position, created after the crisis to sharpen the Fed’s focus on financial stability and regulation. As a governor on the Fed’s board, Mr. Quarles will also vote on monetary policy. Daniel K. Tarullo, who stepped down from the Fed earlier this year, was the Fed’s point man on regulation but was never confirmed as vice chairman. The vote, 65 to 32, ensures that the Fed will still have four governors on its seven-seat board after its vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, steps down later this month. The Trump administration has not nominated candidates for the three remaining vacancies. President Trump also must decide whether to replace or renominate the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, when her term ends in February. Mr. Quarles said at his confirmation hearing in July that the government should relax some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry since 2008. The Trump administration argues that regulation is impeding lending and economic growth. “Regulatory policies enacted since the financial crisis have improved the safety and soundness of the financial system,” Mr. Quarles said. “But as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order.” "
739,"The biggest taboo in the immigration debate is the idea of an “amnesty.” Immigration opponents routinely paint amnesties for undocumented immigrants in the United States as catastrophic blows to the rule of law. The implication is that the only proper thing to do is enforce laws uniformly, all the time, without exceptions — and that an immigration amnesty would thus be a threat to truth, justice and the American way. But there’s a problem with that theory: Amnesties, though not always labeled as such, are central to how the nation’s legal system functions. The ways that laws are not enforced, legal experts say, can be as vital to the legal system’s effectiveness as enforcing them. Take criminal law, for instance. One might imagine that this is an area where uniform enforcement is particularly important: Society has an interest in preserving public safety and seeing justice done. That is why criminal cases are brought on behalf of the state. But in fact, statutes of limitations mean that most crimes can’t be prosecuted at all after a certain amount of time has passed, usually no more than a few years. The principle is so strong that only a small number of very serious crimes can be prosecuted indefinitely. "
740,"BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is getting even larger. The company said Wednesday that it had taken in $264 billion in new funds so far this year, bringing its total assets under management to a staggering $5.9 trillion. BlackRock is the beneficiary of a global rush by investors to place their money in so-called passive investments, rather than the traditional actively managed mutual funds. The influx of money — along with soaring financial markets — helped boost Blackrock’s profits for the third quarter, which were up 13 percent. Of the $96 billion in new money that BlackRock brought in during the third quarter, most of it, $52 billion, came into its exchange-traded funds business, which operates under the brand iShares. BlackRock, along with its chief competitor, Vanguard, has been at the forefront of the recent boom in passive investing, cashing in on investor frustration with mutual funds, which charge higher fees and, of late, have not performed on par with stock market indexes. Together, these two investment giants now oversee more than $10 trillion in assets. Exchange-traded funds track all the broad stock and bond market indexes as well as a wide range of investment strategies, some of which are designed to replicate the approaches of portfolio managers picking value or growth stocks. BlackRock now oversees $1.6 trillion in E.T.F.s, by far the most in the industry, and its leadership has made it clear that these types of investment funds represent the future for BlackRock. And the results this quarter reveal why: funds with active strategies took in $5.7 billion while passive offerings attracted $70 billion. "
741,"“Mr. Robot” debuted in 2015 as a captivating and uncanny reflection of not just our fractious times — all those eerie parallels with real-world events — but also of the isolating effects of technology billed and sold as a means of connection. The story was to our world as Mr. Robot was to Elliot: A darker, (somewhat) angrier version, with a mysterious agenda born of deep pain. Then it folded inside itself in Season 2, testing viewers’ patience as it burrowed into Elliot’s inner struggle to reconcile his splintered selves. (Unsuccessfully, as it turned out.) His overlong prison interlude and the trials of Angela and Darlene nicely broadened what had been a narrowly focused story about a troubled hacker, but they also raised a question: Could “Mr. Robot” get far enough out of its own head to recapture some of the fun that made its first season so intoxicating? Based on Wednesday’s Season 3 premiere, the answer seems to be a qualified yes. I say “yes” because Bobby Cannavale’s mustache, alone, was more delightful than anything in Season 2 — which I liked, for the record — aside from the sitcom segment and perhaps Elliott’s Adderall montage. I say “qualified” because the show seems to be venturing into metaphysical realms that could undermine the techno-political urgency that makes it feel so essential. [Interview: Sam Esmail Discusses Season 3] We’ll get to that in a minute, but first back to the mustache. We opened on Mr. Cannavale as Irving, a used-car salesman and all-purpose Dark Army fixer who cleaned up Tyrell Wellick’s shooting of Elliott, settling, it seems, any lingering mystery over whether Wellick is a figment of Elliot’s damaged psyche. In a measure of how much this show messes with you, I briefly wondered if Irving, too, was somehow an Elliott projection. But it seems clear that he exists in the world, as does Wellick. More surprising: So does Mr. Robot, in a way. In Season 2, Elliot seemed to reach an understanding with Mr. Robot, only to be shot for trying to defy him in the finale. In the new season, the show seems to have synthesized the two sides of its personality more successfully than Elliot has, externalizing his existential struggle and placing Mr. Robot, as roguishly portrayed by Christian Slater, directly into the global disruption narrative. Elliot heroically dons the hoodie and descends, via a 4-plus minute Steadicam shot, into the frenetic hacker Olympics in order to close the backdoor that would enable the Stage 2 destruction of Evil Corp’s hard copy archives. Then later Mr. Robot meets back up with Wellick to seemingly devise a workaround. Which is to say, last season’s lackluster chess match has expanded into Elliott aiming to outmaneuver himself on a broader scale, with many lives and the fate of civilization in the balance. "
742,"BRUSSELS — Anxious about political trends in Germany that are sowing divisions with the United States under President Trump, foreign-policy experts have warned the incoming German government that the trans-Atlantic relationship must be preserved at all costs. In a manifesto titled “In Spite of It All, America,” the German signatories said: “The liberal world order, with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets, is in danger” from the Trump administration because of its “America First” credo. But, the manifesto says, “It is exactly this order on which Germany’s freedom and prosperity depends.” “If Germany wants to be an effective actor in Europe,” the paper says, “it needs the United States.” The document, to be published in Thursday’s edition of the weekly Die Zeit newspaper, suggests that the government should concentrate on the fundamentals of the trans-Atlantic relationship with the United States, like security, and avoid more contentious issues like trade and migration. The manifesto warning against budding anti-Americanism is aimed at the German political parties negotiating with Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a new government, and also at the Social Democratic Party, now in the opposition, which has criticized Mr. Trump. “The message is designed to hit at those who think that Trump has finally shown the real nature of America, and that it’s time for the Germans and French to free themselves from trans-Atlanticism,” said Jan Techau, who is one of the signatories, director of the Richard C. Holbrooke Forum at Berlin’s American Academy and a former head of Carnegie Europe. "
743,"Read the Article: “German Foreign Policy Experts Warn Against Anti-Americanism” The following is an English translation of the manifesto “In Spite of It All, America: A Trans-Atlantic Manifesto in Times of Donald Trump — a German Perspective,” written by a group of foreign-policy experts on German-American relations, that was to be published in Thursday’s edition of the weekly Die Zeit newspaper. The New York Times was provided a draft advance copy. 1. International Order — the new German-American conflict of interests One of the new German government’s premier challenges will be to manage the trans-Atlantic relationship during Donald Trump’s presidency. Its success in this endeavor will be one way to measure its overall performance. We, a group of foreign policy experts from civil society, would like to offer some ideas. The liberal world order with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets — is in danger. It is exactly this order on which Germany’s freedom and prosperity depends. The order is being challenged from various directions and sources: rising powers strive for influence; illiberal governments and authoritarian regimes are ascending; anti-modern thinking is gaining traction and influence even within Western democracies; Russia is challenging the peaceful European order; and new technologies are disrupting old economic structures. Lastly, the United States, inventor and — until recently — guardian of the liberal order, currently does not see itself as system guarantor. Donald Trump is the first U.S. president since World War II to fundamentally question the ideas and institutions of the liberal international order. He opposes this order by advocating a system of raw power and national interest. In his alternative system, small and medium sized countries play a role as dependent and secondary actors. Donald Trump is skeptical of any and all of the United States’ commitments to multilateral institutions and norms. With its preference for stable treaty-based alliances and long term, multilateral commitments, Germany sees the current international order as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. For Germany, Donald Trump’s foreign policy creates a previously unknown conflict of interest with its most important ally. Since Germany’s as well as Europe’s security and affluence rest upon the current international order even as President Trump charts a different course for the United States, an increased responsibility falls to the European Union and its member state Germany to safeguard and strengthen the international order. "
744,"WASHINGTON — Ehud Barak, the former Israeli leader known for his hawkish views on Iran, said it would be a “mistake” for President Trump to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, both because it would play to Iran’s advantage and because it would scuttle any hope of a negotiation with North Korea. Mr. Barak, a decorated soldier who was prime minister and defense minister, is the latest and most prominent Israeli to urge Mr. Trump not to disavow the deal — a step the president is expected to take when he announces his broader strategy for dealing with Iran later this week. “Even if America decides to pull out of it,” Mr. Barak said in an interview on Tuesday, “no one will join — not the Chinese, not the Russians, not even the Europeans. It will serve the Iranians.” Iran, he pointed out, is complying with the terms of the agreement. It will “continue to harvest” the economic benefits of the deal. But if Mr. Trump disavowed it, that would give the Iranians a pretext for resuming their drive toward a nuclear “breakout” capability, particularly in the latter years of the agreement, when the economic benefits are outweighed by Iran’s desire to join the club of nuclear states. The lessons of a broken deal will not be lost on North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Barak said. “They will say it makes no sense negotiating with the Americans if they can pull out of a deal that has been signed, unilaterally, after a relatively short time.” An unconstrained North Korea could impel Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, he said. In the Middle East, Iran’s renewed drive for a bomb would pressure neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey to do likewise. "
745,"Of all of the dismaying and disgusting details of the Harvey Weinstein saga, none is more depressing than this: It has so few heroes. There is a storybook villain, Mr. Weinstein, whose repulsive face turns out to be the spitting image of his putrescent soul. There are victims, so many of them, typically up-and-comers in an industry where he had the power to make or wreck their careers, or bully or buy their silence, or, if some allegations are to be believed, rape them. But mostly there are enablers, both those who facilitated his predations and those who found it expedient to look the other way. The enablers were of all sorts. Corporate board members who declined to investigate allegations of his sexual behavior and now claim the news comes as “an utter surprise.” Assistants who acted as “honeypots,” joining meetings between Mr. Weinstein and his intended victims to give them a sense of security — and then leaving the predator to his prey. Reporters who paid him tribute with awards, did his bidding with fawning coverage, or went after his enemies with hit pieces. A lavishly paid Italian studio executive whose real job, according to former Times reporter Sharon Waxman, was “to take care of Weinstein’s women needs.” (A lawyer for the executive reportedly denies the allegation.) And then there was the rest of Hollywood. Mr. Weinstein’s depredations were an open film industry secret, the subject of an onstage joke by Seth MacFarlane at the 2013 Oscar nomination announcement. Everyone laughed because everyone got it. Some of his victims, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, became Hollywood powers in their own right but never publicly rang an alarm until this week. The actor Ben Affleck, who owes his start to Mr. Weinstein, is an overnight laughingstock because he acts surprised by the producer’s behavior. He won’t be the only celebrity doing his best Claude Rains “shocked, shocked” impression. Even some of the ostensibly good guys in this saga cannot be let off lightly. In The New Yorker, Ronan Farrow reports that Irwin Reiter, a top Weinstein Company executive, sought to console one of the office assistants harassed by Mr. Weinstein by saying the “mistreatment of women” was a longstanding company issue and that “if you were my daughter he would not have made out so well.” But Reiter never went public. "
746,"The broad debate over President Trump’s fitness for the difficult and demanding office he holds has recently been reframed in a more pointed and urgent way: Does he understand, and can he responsibly manage, the most destructive nuclear arsenal on earth? The question arises for several reasons. He has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. He has reportedly pressed for a massive buildup in the American nuclear arsenal, which already contains too many — 4,000 — warheads. And soon he will decide whether to sustain or set a course to possibly unravel the immensely important Iran nuclear deal. Doubts about his competency were reinforced this week by Senator Bob Corker, who charged that Mr. Trump was treating his office like “a reality show” with reckless threats that could set the nation “on the path to World War III.” Mr. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, says he is relying on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to help “separate our country from chaos.” That is a searing indictment, and Mr. Corker is no garden-variety legislator; as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is a respected, and largely responsible, voice on national security issues. Further, NBC News now reports that Mr. Tillerson judged Mr. Trump a “moron” after a July 20 meeting in which Mr. Trump, apparently distressed that the arsenal has declined since the Cold War, said he wanted a nearly tenfold increase in weapons. Mr. Trump’s policy pronouncements during the campaign betrayed either profound ignorance or dangerous nonchalance: At one point he wondered why America had nuclear weapons if it didn’t use them; at another he suggested that Japan and South Korea, which have long lived under the American security umbrella, should develop their own nuclear weapons. But nothing he said has been quite as unsettling as his recent tweetstorms about North Korea, his warnings of “fire and fury” and his quip about “the calm before the storm.” Many have hoped, and still hope, that Mr. Trump’s aggressive posture is mostly theater, designed to slake his thirst for attention, keep adversaries off guard and force changes in their behavior by words alone. But there is no underlying strategy to his loose talk, and whatever he means by it, Congress has been sufficiently alarmed to consider legislation that would bar the president from launching a first nuclear strike without a declaration of war by Congress. It wouldn’t take away the president’s ability to defend the country. That’s a sound idea, and could be made stronger with a requirement that the secretaries of defense and state also approve any such decision. As things stand now, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, passed when there was more concern about trigger-happy generals than elected civilian leaders, gives the president sole control. He could unleash the apocalyptic force of the American nuclear arsenal by his word alone, and within minutes. "
747,"HARRISBURG, Pa. — President Trump took his campaign for tax cuts to another key battleground state on Wednesday in search of elusive Democratic votes as he argued that his plan would benefit middle-class Americans, like truck drivers, more than it would help his fellow business tycoons. At a rally in an airport hangar reminiscent of his fiery events during last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump told hundreds of truckers that slashing rates would produce more hauling contracts and put more money in their pockets. Uncertain that he can count on a fragile Republican majority during a critical Senate vote next week, he sought to pressure Pennsylvania’s Democratic senator to support the plan. “We’re going to fight, and we’re going to get those Republicans and maybe of few of those Democrats to raise their hand,” Mr. Trump told the cheering crowd. “And you’re going to have so much money to spend in this wonderful country and this great economy. That is why we have proposed tax cuts that are pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro-American.” But if he hoped to turn Senator Bob Casey, the Democrat, Mr. Trump made little traction. In a statement, Mr. Casey called the president’s plan “a massive tax giveaway” to the richest Americans at the expense of the middle class. “It’s time for the administration and Congress to stop advocating for this scheme to cut taxes for the superrich and focus on raising wages and creating good-paying jobs for our families in Pennsylvania,” Mr. Casey said. The short trip to the Pennsylvania state capital underscored the complicated politics of the tax fight for the president. The 52-vote Republican majority may not be enough next week to secure a budget measure needed for the tax cuts, given that some of that party’s senators are balking or on the fence. Mr. Trump has been hunting for Democrats without any certain converts. "
748,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is coming under mounting pressure from European allies and fellow Republicans to preserve the Iran nuclear deal. With the president widely expected to disavow the agreement when he outlines his Iran strategy on Friday, defenders and even erstwhile opponents of the deal are urging him not to unravel it completely. Mr. Trump’s top national security aides are united behind a plan to decertify the deal, but leave it in place, with a goal of revising its terms. But in pursuing that course, the president will set off a volatile sequence of events that some warn could end up mortally wounding the agreement. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers will have to decide whether to reimpose punitive sanctions on Tehran, a move that would almost certainly scuttle the 2015 deal that was brokered by world powers. In European capitals, allies are showing signs of resisting pressure to join the United States in trying to renegotiate its terms. “While the Trump administration is making a very fine distinction between a decertification that is a report to Congress rather than leaving the deal, I’m concerned that that distinction will be lost on our allies and adversaries,” said Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain called Mr. Trump on Tuesday to urge him to uphold the deal, adding that it should be “carefully monitored and properly enforced,” according to a spokesman for 10 Downing Street. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, reinforced that message in a call to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The White House’s overarching Iran policy is predicated on de-emphasizing the nuclear deal in favor of confronting Tehran on other issues, including its missile program and its support for extremist groups throughout the Middle East. Yet Mr. Trump’s longstanding contempt for the nuclear accord — he has labeled it a “disaster” and the “worst deal ever” — has kept it center stage. "
749,"Eminem is far from the first rapper to trash the current American president. The most explicit attack came in August from the California rapper YG. His song “FDT” — the title is an abbreviation whose meaning can’t be spelled out in a family newspaper — calls President Trump a “cancer” and insists: “He can’t make decisions for this country, he gon’ crash us/No, we can’t be a slave for him.” Kendrick Lamar took aim at the president in March in “The Heart Part 4,” with the lyrics: And the young rapper Aminé used his television debut on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon” back in November to deliver these lines: “9/11, a day that we never forgettin’/11/9, a day that we always regrettin’.” Then there are scores of implicitly anti-Trump songs that take on issues like police brutality and economic inequality, like Chance the Rapper’s latest, which he performed late last month on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”: “And y’all just keep clappin’ and keep happen/Like Flint got clean water and y’all don’t got teen daughters and black friends and gay cousins, y’all just gon’ say nothin’.” Yet Eminem’s “The Storm,” a scathing four-minute attack on the “kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust,” which he debuted at the BET Awards on Tuesday night, has already overshadowed all of these previous anti-Trump musical efforts. It’s made major news headlines. It’s already garnered 8.7 million views on YouTube. And there have been some two million tweets about the performance, with praise pouring in from stars including LeBron James and Ellen DeGeneres. What gives? Some see the overwhelming reaction to the rap as evidence of racism — that Eminem’s song is generating such overwhelming attention because he’s white. There’s no denying that the key difference between the rappers mentioned above and Eminem isn’t that he’s the only one from Detroit. "
750,"After 24 years in operation, Tent City, an outdoor Arizona jail that served as an emblem of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s “tough on crime” stance, has been closed. The final 370 or so inmates were transferred to another detention facility, and the area was officially shut down on Saturday. The relocation of the inmates had been underway since May. The closing, a cornerstone of the new Maricopa County sheriff’s agenda, further unravels the legacy of Mr. Arpaio, who was convicted in July of ignoring an order to stop racially profiling Latinos, and then pardoned by President Trump in August. Mr. Arpaio, a hard-liner on illegal immigration, said on Wednesday that he was proud of what he had accomplished with Tent City, which he once described as a “concentration camp.” “It’s been a great program, a great deterrent,” he said. “Had over half a million people come through the tents. All convicted, doing their time.” “To this day, people approach me and thank me — parents about their kids having to go to the tents and they straighten out,” he went on. Tent City, which was outfitted with dozens of Korean War tents, was a spectacle that attracted much national attention for Mr. Arpaio’s tactics: Most inmates were issued pink underwear to wear underneath their jumpsuits, pornographic magazines were banned and cooking shows were broadcast in the cafeteria while the inmates ate two meatless meals a day. Inmates also endured extremely hot conditions, something human rights groups criticized as cruel. "

752,"When Ronan Farrow made a guest appearance on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” on Tuesday night, he tried to make it clear that he was the reporter, not the story. “We are there in service of women doing something really tough,” Mr. Farrow told the host, “and I hope people hear their voices and focus on that.” The next day, however, the media and entertainment industries were still discussing how and why Mr. Farrow’s story on allegations of sexual abuse levied against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein by numerous women had ended up being published by The New Yorker — after it began as an investigative report for NBC News. Mr. Farrow, formerly a contributing correspondent for NBC News, told Ms. Maddow he had taken his investigation to The New Yorker only after the network dragged its feet. But Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, disputed the suggestion that the network’s news division had lacked the courage to air Mr. Farrow’s exposé. “We supported him and gave him resources to report that story over many, many months,” Mr. Oppenheim said during an annual meeting with NBC News staff members on Wednesday at Studio 8H, the home of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” “The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.” Mr. Farrow’s 8,000-word article concerned 13 women, several of whom went on the record to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault and rape. The story, published on Tuesday, went online days after the publication of the first of two investigative articles by The New York Times on Mr. Weinstein, who was fired from the Weinstein Company on Sunday.

753,"NAZARETH, V.I. — The day after Hurricane Maria finally subsided, I looked up at the ceiling and exhaled. “Thank you,” I whispered, relieved to still be alive. Hurricane Maria’s winds were just as terrifying as Hurricane Irma’s two weeks before, but when the storm hit around Sept. 19, it made me imagine the devil. My family huddled inside a downstairs bedroom of our two-story home, and it felt like the pitchforked monster had opened hell’s gates, freeing his demons to try to tear down the door and devour us. The idea wasn’t far-fetched. A former classmate of mine who lived in Tutu High Rise, one of St. Thomas’s largest public housing developments but now a hollow shell, had been sucked out of her window and smashed to death by Hurricane Irma. At one point as the storm shrieked, I wondered if the world was ending and we, in America’s sole majority-black territory, were going to have the misfortune of being the first to go. “When will it end? I wish it would just stop,” my sister Grace said, pleading for the divine intervention my mother, a devout Christian, also sought. “Father, don’t let us die like this!” my mother prayed, raising her fist toward the window.

754,"WASHINGTON — President Trump, after failing  to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress, will act on his own to relax health care standards on small businesses that band together to buy health insurance and may take steps to allow the sale of other health plans that skirt the health law’s requirements. The president plans to sign an executive order “to promote health care choice and competition” on Thursday at a White House event attended by small-business owners and others. Although Mr. Trump has been telegraphing his intentions for more than a week, Democrats and some state regulators are now greeting the move with increasing alarm, calling it another attempt to undermine President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. They warn that by relaxing standards for so-called association health plans, Mr. Trump would create low-cost insurance options for the healthy, driving up costs for the sick and destabilizing insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act. “It would have a very negative impact on the markets,” said Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner in Washington State. “Our state is a poster child of what can go wrong. Association health plans often shun the bad risks and stay with the good risks.” They also worry that the Trump administration intends to loosen restrictions on short-term health insurance plans that do not satisfy requirements of the Affordable Care Act. "
755,"WASHINGTON — Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday that they planned to make public the thousands of Facebook ads linked to Russia that appeared during the 2016 presidential election campaign, the first indication that the ads would be released. The lawmakers told reporters about their plans after an afternoon meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. They said the 3,000 ads would probably be released after a Nov. 1 hearing on the role of social media platforms in Russia’s interference in the election. That hearing, and a similar one that the Senate Intelligence Committee plans to hold with Facebook, Google and Twitter, will place Silicon Valley’s top companies under a harsh spotlight as the public perception of the giants shifts in Washington. Ms. Sandberg sat down with Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leader of the House investigation, and Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, at the start of two full days of meetings with federal officials. The meetings are a part of the company’s lobbying and public relations push to contain fallout from disclosures that a group linked to Russia bought more than $100,000 in ads on divisive issues on Facebook. Lawmakers and public interest groups have called for the release of the ads, which Facebook shared with Congress last month, to understand what kind of material foreign buyers placed in front of Facebook users. But Facebook has said it had no plans to release the ads. Ms. Sandberg also agreed to hand over additional Facebook content unrelated to ads, such as fake news and inflammatory posts on pages to organize rallies, that the Russian-linked actors appeared to use to sow discord, Mr. Schiff said. “They will provide that information in the near future, and that will be important to look at,” he said in a separate interview. Mr. Schiff and Mr. Conaway said Ms. Sandberg appeared to understand the gravity of the political pressure surrounding Facebook. “I think they certainly realize the intense interest in what the Russians did on their platform, the responsibility they have on their own to ferret this material out,” Mr. Schiff said to reporters after the meeting. Before the ads can be released to the public, he said, they need to be scrubbed of any personally identifiable information. He said lawmakers had asked Facebook for help in that process. “It’s our hope that when they conclude, then we can release them publicly,” Mr. Schiff said. Later in the day, Ms. Sandberg met with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. On Thursday, Ms. Sandberg will take the stage with the media outlet Axios for a 30-minute interview about Facebook’s handling of the Russia inquiry. Then she will meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who are concerned that racist and anti-immigrant messages spread on the site were amplified by the platform’s technology and fake accounts. "
756,"WASHINGTON — For Republicans trying to rally their base, no political villain has been more effective than Representative Nancy Pelosi, the longtime Democratic leader. In campaign after campaign, they made her the symbol of the Washington they claimed to be running against. Now a renegade group of anti-establishment Republicans is adapting that model and turning it against their own party. They are replacing Ms. Pelosi with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. “He is an anvil,” said L. Brent Bozell III, a longtime conservative activist who on Wednesday joined a group of a half-dozen activists from the right demanding that Mr. McConnell and his leadership team step down. “Not with Democrats,” he said, “but with his own party. This is the trouble that he’s in.” Mr. McConnell was an ever-present boogeyman in the recent primary campaign in Alabama between Senator Luther Strange, a McConnell ally, and Roy Moore, the deeply conservative former state Supreme Court judge who ran on a caustically anti-leadership message. Mr. Moore won in an upset, despite being attacked with millions of dollars from groups loyal to Mr. McConnell as a zealot who was removed twice from the bench for refusing to obey orders from higher courts. A faction of conservative activists, including President Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, now hopes to replicate that kind of grassroots-fueled victory across the country. But their targets are not where the rest of the Republican Party is aiming — states with Democratic senators that Mr. Trump won where there are large pockets of conservative voters — but in seven states where Republicans already hold a Senate seat. Many Republicans consider this strategy suicidal. “This is the reason that Republicans didn’t regain the majority in 2010 and 2012,” said Josh Holmes, a former aide to Mr. McConnell who is president of Cavalry Strategies in Washington. “You had this for-profit, quote, unquote conservative crowd who found it much more entrepreneurial to challenge from within than to fight back against Democrats. And ultimately what happened in those two cycles is that Democrats won. Republicans exhausted their resources.” "

758,"Not such a long time ago, in this very galaxy, civil rights protesters were lectured about finding the “right time and place” for their demonstrations. It’s all well and good to express your opinion, they were told, but in-your-face street protests are disruptive and can harden opposition. Or, as The Huntsville Times in Alabama put it, “the path to equal rights” is “down the road of moderation, mutual respect and minimal resort to mass perturbation.” In another editorial, it said “racial troubles” should be taken “off the streets and into the courts.” That was 1965, after Sheriff Jim Clark’s uniformed thugs whipped, beat and gassed civil rights marchers in Selma. Two years later, when Martin Luther King announced his opposition to the war in Vietnam, The New York Times editorial page lectured him about getting back to his place as a civil-rights leader. He should, The Times said, “direct the movement’s efforts in the most constructive and relevant way.” Now comes the National Football League, dropping its pretense of supporting the broad aims of athletes who kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and joining the chorus — led by President Trump — that they should find more respectful ways of voicing their anger. In a masterpiece of euphemism, Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, said the league’s leaders “care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues.” "
759,"PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago — For Joey Richardson, a 61-year-old retired civil servant known as Porche, watching his beloved men’s soccer team crush the United States was like watching David slaying Goliath. Except that David was killed, too. But maybe that didn’t matter. “The revenge was sweet, even though we have not qualified for the World Cup game,” Mr. Richardson said. Trinidad and Tobago, a twin-island nation in the southern Caribbean, was abuzz on Wednesday with one of the strangest upsets in recent World Cup history: The previous night, it defeated the United States in a 2-1 qualifier game, which, along with simultaneous matches in Panama and Honduras, meant the Americans failed to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1986. Compounding the oddness of it all was the Trinidad team really had nothing to play for. Its losing streak had been so bad that it had already lost any chance of going to Russia for the World Cup next year — leaving Mr. Richardson one of the few fans in the bleachers last night in a nation largely uninterested in the game. Until now. The winning goals have been on continual repeat across television screens, and the victory blazed in huge headlines across newspapers; it is all anyone wants to talk about on the streets of the capital, Port of Spain. “T&T Puts a Licking on the U.S.,” declared The Daily Express, a local newspaper, referring to both countries by their initials. And then there were the memes, mostly mocking President Trump. In one, he throws paper towels over the waterlogged field to his team on the other side. Another takes the form of a fake tweet from the president’s account: “But why do we have to play against 2 teams, Trinidad AND Tobago??? Not fair.” "

761,"Saudi women are gaining the right to drive. American women are losing the right to employer-provided birth control. The first development signifies a theocratic kingdom’s bow to the inexorable onslaught of modernity. The second is a cynical bow to the forces of reaction against modernity. It would be too far a stretch to see in Saudi Arabia even the glimmer of the emergence of civil society. But it’s not much of a stretch to see in the rules issued by the Trump administration last week the fraying of civil society as the United States has known it. Ours is a diverse society in which all are expected, with limited and precisely defined exceptions, to abide by the rules that apply to all. The alternative, as Justice Antonin Scalia observed decades ago, “would be courting anarchy.” The new rules, which went into immediate effect, create exceptions that are anything but limited. They are, in fact, there for the taking. Any “entities” that claim not only religious but also “moral” objections to birth control are entitled to refuse to comply with the federal contraception mandate that until last Friday was enabling 55 million women to receive birth control without charge as part of their work- or college-related health insurance coverage. Which entities? The list is on page 161 of the administration’s 163-page announcement of its “interim final rule” on religious objections (a separate document applies to the moral objectors, a completely new concept in this five-year-old controversy). The list of religious objectors includes churches and religious orders (which from the beginning have been completely exempt from the mandate anyway); nonprofit organizations; a “closely held for-profit entity;” a “for-profit entity that is not closely held” (including publicly traded companies); and “any other nongovernmental employer” along with institutions of higher education.

763,"To the Editor: Re “E.P.A. Announces Bid to Roll Back Emissions Policy” (front page, Oct. 10): The cheers of the Hazard, Ky., crowd listening to Scott Pruitt’s jettisoning of the Clean Power Plan struck me as a validation of behavioral economics, which explores how humans often make irrational economic decisions. Richard Thaler may have just won a Nobel Prize for exploring this phenomenon, but Mr. Pruitt and his ilk have made a career out of exploiting it. They use emotional language such as “winners and losers” and “war on coal” to obscure what’s really going on, which is the coal industry extracting as much labor from people and coal from the environment as possible, leaving both the poorer for it. The challenge is to put the principles of behavioral economics to work to ramp up the public support for policies boosting clean power, not coal. It is now up to governors — like Andrew Cuomo in New York, Jerry Brown in California and John Hickenlooper in Colorado — to lead the nation on that path. ELIZABETH POREBA, NEW YORK To the Editor: Scott Pruitt proclaimed the end of the “war on coal” on Monday. “No better place to make that announcement than Hazard, Ky.,” he added unironically.

765,"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — In 2006, when Tom Hanks wanted to get a story published, he sent it to his friend and sometime director Nora Ephron. Having had my own writing critiqued by her, I know just how daunting that could be. “Oh, petrifying, horrifying, yes, yeah,” Mr. Hanks said, grimacing. The piece was a sweet paean to his makeup man Danny Striepeke, then 75 years old and retiring, a 50-year Hollywood veteran who had started by giving Elvis Presley his tan in “Viva Las Vegas” and Laurence Olivier his Roman nose in “Spartacus” and ended by turning Mr. Hanks into a policeman, an astronaut, an Army Ranger, an F.B.I. agent, a Master of the Universe, a Slavic tourist stuck in an airport, Santa Claus and a Harvard professor of symbology. Hanks sent Ms. Ephron the piece — she got mail! — and asked, “Is this a thing?” “And she said, ‘Yes, it is a thing. Send it to The New York Times. I’ll make some calls for you. It shouldn’t be in the Sunday Styles section but maybe in the Thursday Styles section,”’ Mr. Hanks recalls. And after many rewrites and lots of no-mercy Nora editing, like “What does this mean?” and “This is not good” and “Voice, voice, voice” and “Tell people what you’re going to tell them, and then tell them, and then tell them what you just told them,” it was finally published in Thursday Styles. I hesitate, wondering if now is the moment to break the news to Mr. Hanks: He has spent a decade honing his writing and, despite all the other acting and directing and producing he does, and despite being, as the historian Douglas Brinkley calls him, “American history’s highest-profile professor,” he has managed to squeeze in a book of fictional short stories called “Uncommon Type.” And yet he’s still going to be in Thursday Styles. And not only that. I will have to ask him about The Times’s first bombshell report about Harvey Weinstein, just published, and Hollywood’s guilty silence on the incendiary subject. What does Mr. Nice have to say about Mr. Sleazy? "
766,"Nearly a year after Election Day, Facebook’s role in our modern political infrastructure is finally coming into focus. We now know, for example, that Russian-linked Facebook ads reached roughly 10 million Americans during the presidential election season, and that Russian government actors posed as Americans on Facebook to push divisive social issues like gun control, gay rights and the Black Lives Matter movement. We also know, thanks to a recent interview with Brad Parscale, President Trump’s digital campaign director, that the Trump campaign considered Facebook’s advertising microtargeting tools essential to its victory. But there is much more to know. Facebook has addressed some election-related questions, and may share more next month when its executives testify in front of the House and Senate intelligence committees. These investigations may focus solely on Russian interference, but they could also produce valuable information about how Facebook operates as a company, how it views its role on the political stage, and how it plans to safeguard its platform from malicious activity in the future. The conversation about Facebook would benefit from more facts, and less speculation. So this week, I sent a list of some of my unanswered questions to Facebook. Two representatives — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, and Joe Osborne, a company spokesman — responded to several questions in some detail. The company declined to answer several other questions, but I include those here as well, in hopes that they might one day be answered. Below are my questions, followed by Facebook’s responses, where applicable. 1.
In an April 2017 white paper, your security team disclosed an incident during the 2016 election in which “malicious actors” were discovered to be using fake Facebook accounts to promote links to stolen information. The paper did not name the actors, but it was later revealed that this referred to a coordinated campaign to promote emails that were stolen from Democratic National Committee officials by Russian hackers and published by WikiLeaks. It has also been reported that Facebook’s legal and policy teams pressured the security team to exclude any mentions of Russia from their report. Why did they want to keep this information from becoming public? Alex Stamos, chief security officer, Facebook: In our April white paper, “Information Operations and Facebook,” we described the activity that we detected from a sophisticated threat actor that was spreading stolen information about specific political targets in the run-up to the U.S. election and using it to feed press stories that they could then amplify. We took steps to disrupt this activity and reported details to the relevant authorities. "
767,"A group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday that would compel top federal officials, including President Trump, to disclose how changes to regulations might benefit them financially. The bill comes after a recent investigation by The New York Times and ProPublica showed that some appointees to the Trump administration’s deregulation teams had close industry connections and could be reviewing rules that their previous employers had tried to weaken or eliminate. Mr. Trump established the teams at major federal agencies as part of his effort to roll back regulations, presenting industries with a new avenue for bucking rules they have long argued were hurting profits, depressing job creation and raising prices. In addition to the president and members of deregulation teams, the legislation would require disclosures by senior White House advisers, including those who do not receive a government salary, and agency chiefs. The bill’s author, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, was among a group of Democratic lawmakers who demanded in an August letter to the White House that the Trump administration disclose the names deregulation team members and documents related to their potential conflicts of interest. The administration did not respond to the letter. Other sponsors of the bill include Representatives John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon. The bill does not have Republican sponsors, which suggests it is unlikely to be approved. Agencies have been opaque about the deregulation teams. A full vetting of their industry ties has been difficult to conduct because some agencies have declined to provide information about team members, including, in some instances, their names. The teams include former employees of industry-financed organizations that oppose environmental regulations, lawyers who have represented companies in cases against federal regulators and staff members of so-called political dark money groups. In all, The Times and ProPublica identified 85 known current and former team members, including 34 with potential conflicts. Several federal agencies have not yet released the names of people serving on deregulation task forces. We need your help finding them and figuring out what they’re doing. Got a tip?

768,"A few years ago, Robert Plant found himself suddenly overcome with an urge to return to his roots. “I know I’m emphatically British,” he said. “But I didn’t realize how much that was true until I’d been away for a while.” He had been living in Austin, Tex., with his girlfriend at the time, the singer-songwriter Patty Griffin, who was also his bandmate on his 2010 album and tour, “Band of Joy.” And, for a time, he relished the opportunity to absorb American life and culture. “The hospitality and friendships and initiation into Americana — not just music — was marvelous,” he said. The process began several years earlier, when he teamed with the bluegrass great Alison Kraus for the Nashville-recorded 2007 album “Raising Sand,” probably the most acclaimed and successful project of his post-Led Zeppelin career. (He last played with his old band 10 years ago this December, during a one-off gig at the O2 arena in London that made headlines around the world.) The pair won an album of the year Grammy, and the LP went platinum; along the way, he discovered an entire world of Appalachian music and the joys of vocal harmonies, which were never a big part of his musical repertoire. “It was one of the most rewarding, classic periods of my life,” he said. “And it was just such a” — he paused to search for the right word — “tear to leave America and return to Britain.” Mr. Plant was calling from the lobby of the Frome Memorial Theater in Somerset, England, which was built just after the First World War and is within easy driving distance of his house in Shropshire, near the Welsh border. Since returning from the United States, he has lived, as he put it, “only eight miles from where I learned how to speak French and do geometry.” Affable and chatty, he cheerfully recounted tales from his past lives: as the golden-maned, howling frontman of Led Zeppelin; in partnership with the Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page as Page and Plant; a foray into ’80s synth-rock; and the rootsy solo path he has forged over the last two decades. "
769,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he intended to name Kirstjen Nielsen, a top White House aide, to lead the Department of Homeland Security, elevating a former homeland security official in the George W. Bush administration who has lately worked to impose order in Mr. Trump’s chaotic West Wing. Mr. Trump announced his choice in a statement that noted Ms. Nielsen’s “extensive professional experience in the areas of homeland security policy and strategy, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure and emergency management.” She is the first nominee for the homeland security post who had served in the department, according to the statement. If confirmed, Ms. Nielsen would replace John F. Kelly, who was homeland security secretary until he left in July to serve as the White House chief of staff and bring discipline and direction to a West Wing plagued by disorganization and infighting. Mr. Kelly had drafted Ms. Nielsen to be his chief of staff at the Homeland Security department, and when the president plucked him for the White House, he brought her as his No. 2. Known as a no-nonsense player and policy wonk, Ms. Nielsen appears unlikely to land at the center of the type of controversies that have engulfed Mr. Trump’s presidency. But her regimented style in a freewheeling and often dysfunctional West Wing frustrated some senior officials and people close to the president, who chafed under her dictates. On Wednesday, some of them described Ms. Nielsen’s promotion as a solution to a toxic personnel situation, while others fretted privately that her departure would create a void at the White House that would be difficult to fill. Mr. Kelly pushed hard for her selection, making a personal appeal to Mr. Trump during a monthslong search process. Among the other candidates considered, according to people familiar with the process, was Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. Former colleagues said on Wednesday that Ms. Nielsen was well qualified. “She’s a total homeland security expert — absolutely has no learning curve,” said Michael Allen, who worked with Ms. Nielsen during the Bush administration. “She’s an experienced manager, she’s an implementer, she knows how to get under the hood and figure out what needs to be connected to what.” "
770,"“Mr. Robot” began as a story about a troubled programmer but steadily expanded to encompass underground revolutionaries, global power brokers and a hack that disrupted the entire world. The USA techno-thriller returned for its third season Wednesday night with even broader horizons, as key characters like Whiterose (B. D. Wong) and Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday) seemed to envision alternate universes, while the tormented hero, Elliot (Rami Malek), resumed his baroque existential struggles. The episode found him recuperating from last season’s culminating gunshot and pondering ways to counteract his Mr. Robot alter ego, specifically his world-shattering acts of cyberterrorism. “The big question this season is: Can you put it together after you’ve broken it?” said Sam Esmail, the show’s creator. “Can he reverse what he did? Or is it going to be forever changed, given the set of events he set in motion?” After debuting to near-universal acclaim in 2015, “Mr. Robot” put off some viewers last season with a slower pace and deeper focus on the internal struggles of Elliot and other characters. Season 3 will be “a lot more action packed,” said Mr. Esmail, who again directed every episode (and wrote five of the 10). In a recent phone interview, he discussed why criticisms of Season 2 surprised him, and why the rise of President Trump is the latest real-world event to eerily parallel the universe of “Mr. Robot.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Where do things stand with Elliot heading into Season 3? The internal battle he went through in the second season led to a certain kind of acceptance. In the third season we rip that all apart again, in a very different way. In the same way he is wondering if he can take back the 5/9 hack, he’s also dealing with his dissociative identity disorder and questioning whether he can put that genie back in the bottle. “Mr. Robot” has always been interested in duality in its characters and structures. But this season it seems as if you’re getting into parallel universes. "
771,"WASHINGTON — The North American Free Trade Agreement, long disparaged by President Trump as bad for the United States, was edging closer toward collapse as negotiators gathered for a fourth round of contentious talks here this week. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has sparred with American businesses that support Nafta and has pushed for significant changes that negotiators from Mexico and Canada say are nonstarters. All the while, the president has continued threatening to withdraw the United States from the trade agreement, which he has maligned as the worst in history. As the trade talks began on Wednesday, Mr. Trump, seated in the Oval Office beside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, said it was “possible” that the United States would drop out of Nafta. “It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” the president said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers. And in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also. So we’ll see what happens with Nafta, but I’ve been opposed to Nafta for a long time, in terms of the fairness of Nafta.” Mr. Trudeau, in comments later at the Canadian Embassy, said he remains optimistic about the potential for a Nafta deal but noted that Canadians must be “ready for anything.” The collapse of the 1994 trade deal would reverberate throughout the global economy, inflicting damage far beyond Mexico, Canada and the United States and affecting industries as varied as manufacturing, agriculture and energy. It would also sow at least short-term chaos for businesses like the auto industry that have arranged their North American supply chains around the deal’s terms. "
772,"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Wednesday to use the federal government’s power to license television airwaves to target NBC in response to a report by the network’s news division that he contemplated a dramatic increase in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. In a story aired and posted online Wednesday morning, NBC reported that Mr. Trump said during a meeting in July that he wanted what amounted to a nearly tenfold increase in the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile, stunning some members of his national security team. It was after this meeting that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson reportedly said Mr. Trump was a “moron.” Mr. Trump objected to the report in a series of Twitter messages over the course of the day and threatened to use the authority of the federal government to retaliate. He repeated his complaint later in the day, when reporters arrived in the Oval Office to cover his meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. “It’s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write and people should look into it,” Mr. Trump said. "
773,"WASHINGTON — The International Monetary Fund delivered a blunt warning to international policy makers ahead of the fund’s annual meeting this week: Governments risk undermining global economic growth by cutting taxes on the wealthy. The message, while aimed broadly at all developed nations, carries particular resonance in the United States as the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers push a tax plan that critics say will exacerbate income inequality by reducing taxes for the richest Americans. In a report issued Wednesday, the fund emphasized that flatter tax rates across income scales and lower rates for the highest earners could exacerbate a troubling trend toward growing inequality in the United States and around the world. The White House is currently pushing a proposal that tax experts warn would cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans by lowering the top rate, by eliminating the estate tax and by doing away with the alternative minimum tax, which imposes a higher rate to ensure the wealthy are not exploiting loopholes. The monetary fund’s report builds on its broader message this week — that governments should take advantage of global economic strengthening to get their fiscal houses in order. By acting now to curb debt, overhaul inequities in taxation and lift spending on education and health for the poor, countries can stave off another economic crisis and help the most vulnerable in the process. President Trump’s agenda in many ways defies those recommendations. He championed several bills in Congress this year that would have reduced federal spending on health care, though none of them passed the Senate. "
774,"BEIJING — He was one of China’s most prominent commanders, with hopes of rising higher. So when Gen. Fang Fenghui disappeared from public view, it sent a clear warning to the top leaders of the People’s Liberation Army: President Xi Jinping was not done shaking up their once-unassailable ranks. General Fang, the chief of the army’s Joint Staff Department, was not the only military leader to fall ahead of next week’s Communist Party congress. Gen. Zhang Yang, the director of the military’s political department, also vanished from sight. Their names have not appeared in the Chinese news media for more than a month, when their successors were announced with no fanfare. Removing the two generals was the latest step by Mr. Xi to strengthen his grip on the military, a pillar of Communist Party power. On the eve of the party congress, which will kick off his second five-year term as the nation’s leader, he seems to have concluded that he must exert greater control to remake the country’s armed forces into a power worthy of China’s global standing. Mr. Xi’s reorganization of the military has already gone further than seemed possible under his recent predecessors, but as the overhaul and its attendant personnel cuts have begun to take shape, Mr. Xi has confronted poor coordination among branches of the armed forces and foot-dragging from senior officers whose positions have been threatened. “The removal of those top leaders, senior elderly generals and admirals, is part of a broader drive to promote and advance younger, more professionally minded officers,” said Timothy R. Heath, an expert on the Chinese military at the RAND Corporation. “There are huge numbers of top brass in the P.L.A.; it’s top-heavy, and huge numbers of these guys are going to lose their jobs.” Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has used a crackdown on corruption to purge commanders deemed corrupt or disloyal. The moves have given Mr. Xi, whose father was an important figure in China’s revolutionary army, a degree of authority over the People’s Liberation Army that had eluded previous civilian leaders. "
775,"LONDON — Denise Gough has never been to New York: She swore to herself that she’d first visit as an actress. “I wanted to wait — I thought, one day I will do theater in New York, and that is how I will experience the city.” Her dream is coming true, in quite spectacular fashion. This month, the Irish-born Ms. Gough brings her star performance in Duncan Macmillan’s “People, Places & Things” to St. Ann’s Warehouse. In February, she’ll be part of what she calls a “most gorgeous ensemble” and “the Marvel Comics of theater,” doing “Angels in America” with Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane at the Neil Simon Theater on Broadway. Mr. Macmillan’s scorching script centers on Emma, an actress and drug addict who checks into rehab after losing focus during a production of “The Seagull.” The play kinetically conveys the highs as well as the despairing, disorienting lows of addiction, with a lead part that demands an actress dig deep: Emma is fiercely intelligent and funny, but also destructive, damaged and vulnerable. It’s a huge role, but Ms. Gough, 37, didn’t so much rise to the challenge as blow the theater’s roof off. She won the Olivier and other prizes for a performance described as both virtuosic and emotionally shattering, and was likened to Mark Rylance in “Jerusalem.” This was less a gush and more a righteous roar of approval, however, with critics cheering that a secret star of British theater — so chameleonic that she’d gone underrecognized for over a decade — had finally smashed into success. The play, which originated at the National Theater, in a coproduction with Headlong, duly transferred to the West End. But success came only just in time: If Ms. Gough hadn’t gotten the part, she was going to quit acting altogether. She’d had a year without any work, and was broke. "

777,"WASHINGTON — Republicans are staggering, knocked off kilter by internecine conflict between President Trump and his own party in Congress. Incumbents are under aggressive challenge from conservative activists. Frustrated veteran lawmakers are bailing out. Given the swirling tumult, one political and legislative reality is suddenly becoming crystal clear: Republicans must deliver a tax cut or face an epic backlash that would pose a significant threat to their governing majority and long-term political health. After Republicans were unable to fulfill their longstanding promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the tax cut proposal is the only remaining game in town for the struggling majority and its allies on K Street. The inability to enact a tax cut — an idea that nearly all Republicans support in theory while differing on the details — would represent a monumental failure. The party would have virtually no argument for re-election in 2018 and Senate and House incumbents would be wide open to challenge from both the right and the left. Big donors who are already sitting on their wallets would have no motivation to open them up. Mr. Trump’s ongoing Twitter feuds have complicated the task, but the Republican Party really has no choice — it must find a way to get a tax cut to the president’s desk. “We are 10 months into a new president with a city that appears to be dysfunctional,” said Scott Reed, senior political strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “It is vital that tax reform and economic growth get accomplished by the Congress.” Like many other advocacy groups, the chamber is putting extra emphasis on how lawmakers vote on tax and economic issues and won’t be inclined to throw its support behind those who don’t share the views of the business lobby. "
778,"Donald Trump ran for the White House as a change agent hostile to the habits of Washington, the place he nicknamed “the swamp.” It worked. But the customs he continues to upend as president are the scaffolding that supports the otherwise fragile words of our written Constitution. Mr. Trump’s rejection of them is more threatening to both his presidency and our constitutional regime than any technical violation of the law that he has been accused of (at least so far). Customs are the punctuation marks of republican politics, the silent guides we follow without pausing to consider their authority. They operate in a space that is difficult for formal rules to codify. That the president of the United States speaks with caution and dignity, that he exercises the pardon power the Constitution grants him soberly rather than wantonly, that he respects the independence of law enforcement, and that, to the extent reasonable politics permit, he speaks truthfully — these are all customs, not laws. Law is powerless to impose them and powerless without them. When Mr. Trump drains language of its normal meaning, the law can do nothing about it. His  ridiculing of the United States senator who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, his repeated use of the word “fake” to describe news coverage when he actually means “unpleasant” and his style of rhetoric in front of the United Nations, where he called terrorists “losers” and applied a childish epithet to the head of a nation in whose shadow tens of thousands of American troops serve and with whom nuclear war is a live possibility, are all cases in point. There is no way to formalize conventions of maturity and dignity for presidents. Custom fills that void. Mr. Trump’s prodigious abuse of language violates the custom according to which presidents use words to convey serious meanings. Examples arrive daily, but here are a few more. The president has promised to decree his way to better health care, which he cannot constitutionally do. He has repeatedly tweeted threats at North Korea whose imprecision has turned red lines into smudges. He zigs and zags between alliances with and attacks on other constitutional officers in such a way that no one can constructively work with him. Yet all of these abuses of language are violations of custom, not law. When he violates such customs, Mr. Trump is at his most impulsive and self-destructive. It may sound ridiculous to invoke James Madison or Edmund Burke when we talk about this president, but that is part of the problem. Mr. Trump could profit from the wisdom of his predecessor Madison, for whom the very essence of constitutionalism lay not in what he derided as “parchment barriers” — mere written commands there was no will to follow — but rather “that veneration which time bestows on every thing.” The Constitution, in other words, would be only as strong as the tradition of respecting it. "
779,"There is an abiding dream in the tech world that when all the planet’s people and data are connected it will be a better place. That may prove true. But getting there is turning into a nightmare — a world where billions of people are connected but without sufficient legal structures, security protections or moral muscles among companies and users to handle all these connections without abuse. Lately, it feels as if we’re all connected but no one’s in charge. Equifax, the credit reporting bureau, became brilliant at vacuuming up all your personal credit data — without your permission — and selling it to companies that wanted to lend you money. But it was so lax in securing that data that it failed to install simple software security fixes, leaving a hole for hackers to get the Social Security numbers and other personal information of some 146 million Americans, or nearly half the country. But don’t worry, Equifax ousted its C.E.O., Richard Smith, with “a payday worth as much as $90 million — or roughly 63 cents for every customer whose data was potentially exposed in its recent security breach,” Fortune  reported. That will teach him! Smith and his board should be in jail. I’m with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who told CNBC, “So long as there is no personal responsibility when these big companies breach consumers’ trust, let their data get stolen, cheat their consumers … then nothing is going to change.” Facebook, Google and Twitter are different animals in my mind. Twitter has enabled more people than ever to participate in the global conversation; Facebook has enabled more people than ever to connect and build communities; Google has enabled everyone to find things like never before. Those are all good things. But the three companies are also businesses, and the last election suggests they’ve all connected more people than they can manage and they’ve been naïve about how many bad guys were abusing their platforms. "
780,"Facing deportation to Mexico and fearing separation from his children, Javier Flores Garcia took refuge last year in a Methodist church in downtown Philadelphia. Members of the congregation prepared a makeshift bedroom for him in the basement, and promised to give him sanctuary, no matter how long he needed it. On Wednesday, after nearly 11 months, Mr. Flores walked out of the church for good, a rare winner among the tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have fought battles over deportation this year. His case was resolved in an unusual way: He has been promised a special type of visa given to victims of crime who assist the police. But even so, Mr. Flores’s freedom gives the growing sanctuary movement, organized by houses of worship across the country to protect undocumented immigrants, a small victory in the face of a widespread federal crackdown. Mr. Flores’s case shows “that when we fight and when we resist, that we win,” said Erika Almiron, executive director of Juntos, an immigrant rights organization in Philadelphia that took up Mr. Flores’s case. President Trump came into office vowing to rid the country of millions of illegal immigrants, and immigration arrests have risen by nearly 40 percent in 2017, compared to the previous year, to a rate of almost 400 people a day. Since Mr. Trump was elected, 34 people facing deportation have publicly taken refuge inside of churches, including four this week, according to the Rev. Noel Andersen, a minister of the United Church of Christ and the national grass-roots coordinator for Church World Service, an ecumenical human rights and refugee resettlement organization. So far, seven of those 34 have left their sanctuaries after winning relief from deportation, he said. "
781,"The only fitting reaction to the news that Steve Bannon intends to support primary challengers against Republican incumbents from sea to shining sea is a terrible, almost Teutonic sort of world-weariness. Bannon’s grand ambitions should inspire the same soul-deadening déjà vu, the existential exhaustion, with which Bill Murray’s weatherman greeted every morning in Punxsutawney, Penn. They should bring to mind both Friedrich Nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence and his warning that if you stare deep into the abyss, it stares into you. They should inspire a vision of the Republican Party as a wheel turning endlessly in darkness, with the illusion of movement but the light forever out of reach. O.K., maybe that’s all a little much. But really, didn’t we just go through all this? It was just seven years ago that Republican incumbents were facing populist challengers who promised ideological revolution, just a little while ago that the establishment was losing primaries to a mix of true believers, opportunists and erstwhile witches. What Bannon is promising is what the Tea Party actually delivered, in a past recent enough to still feel like the present: a dramatic ideological shake-up, an end to D.C. business-as-usual, and the elevation of new leaders with a sweeping vision for a new G.O.P. Then it all came to naught. The ideological shake-up took the form of paper promises, not successful legislation. The end to D.C. business-as-usual just created a new normal of brinkmanship and gridlock. And when the Tea Party’s leaders — Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, above all — reached out to claim their party’s presidential nomination, they found themselves steamrolled by a candidate who scorned all their limited-government ideas and offered, well, Trumpism instead. Alas when it comes to governance, Trumpism turns to have two fatal weaknesses: the dearth of Trumpists among elected Republicans, and the total policy incapacity of Trump himself. So having failed in his appointed role as Trump whisperer and White House brain, Bannon has decided to do the Tea Party insurgency thing all over again, except this time with his nationalist-populist cocktail instead of the last round’s notional libertarianism. Maybe it will work. Maybe repetition is the charm. Maybe the Tea Party was a dead end, but some Trumpist primary candidates will finally produce a Republican Party capable of doing something with its power. If you squint at the Bannon vision, you can almost imagine it. His professed nationalism, with its promise of infrastructure projects and antitrust actions and maybe even tax hikes on the rich, is potentially more popular than the Tea Party vision — an easier sell to swing voters than a stringent libertarianism or a zombie Reaganism, a more plausible response to the new political landscape that the stale agenda currently on offer on a Republican-controlled Capitol Hill. "
782,"Your podcast, “Conversations With People Who Hate Me,” is exactly what it sounds like: You interview people who have posted racist, homophobic or otherwise terrible things about you on the internet. Fast Company said it’s the “timeliest podcast of 2017.” Why would you want to put yourself through this? Just because someone says something outrageously mean to you online doesn’t mean they’re sad and lonely. I wanted to go toward these messages rather than run away. But surely you’re aware of the internet maxim “Don’t feed the trolls.” I’ve made the conscious choice to not even use the term “troll.” These are real people who have said things to me online that they wouldn’t necessarily say to me in person. How do you decide whom to talk to? I chose people who had a nuanced take on why they hated me or my work. All my guests had initially reached out to me on Facebook. Do you see your show as part of this trend in journalism toward reaching out to “real America” and trying to figure out what drives Trump voters? I really don’t like the mentality of “Identity politics aren’t the real issue” or “What we really need to care about is coal country.” It just feels like there are so many edicts every day of the right and wrong ways to care, but I think we can get to know the trials and tribulations of those in coal country while also acknowledging and exploring the marginalized identities of people who have been systematically oppressed for so long. There’s so much policing that goes on within the left. I came face to face with it last summer when I covered the Democratic and Republican National Conventions for Seriously.TV, a digital comedic news channel. Everyone loved Donald Trump at the R.N.C.; people rallied around him. At the D.N.C., there was so much talk about how awful Hillary Clinton was. It was so divided. How do you psych yourself up for the actual phone call? The truth is the phone calls feel incredible: They make the world feel smaller and more manageable. It makes you feel like connection is possible with people with whom you’ve had a rocky beginning. The really emotionally draining part is delivering the episode to the world, trying to make sure that my guests and their views are accurately represented. I want to ensure that I’m actually engaging in conversation with them and identifying things that I disagree with, and that it’s not, like, the most masturbatory thing ever. "
783,"Lee Friedlander’s “The American Monument” was first published in 1976. That’s “monument” singular, though one of the many singular things about Friedlander is that he’s nothing if not a pluralist. Whitman-like, he is great, contains multitudes. In an essay appended to the sumptuous new edition of this landmark work, Peter Galassi (who curated the 2005 Friedlander retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art) deems it “pointless” to try to count precisely how many books the photographer has published since 1976 before settling on roughly one a year. The retrospective was huge, and, inevitably, the accompanying catalog was almost too hefty to lug home comfortably. It was sort of monumental, though monuments tend to be erected to the dead. On receipt of a lifetime achievement award from the International Center of Photography in 2006, the 71-year-old Friedlander responded that the honor, while welcome, was premature. At the glamorous reception and dinner, he spent the evening photographing, snapping guests and the other honorees like a cub photographer eager to make the most of what might prove to be his big break. That break actually came in 1967 at MoMA when he, Garry Winogrand (who died in 1984) and Diane Arbus (who died in 1971) were chosen to represent a shift in documentary photography from social concerns toward more personal ends. It’s possible that his reputation, as it has risen in the decades since, has also suffered, in the way that Dizzy Gillespie’s did in comparison with that of his doomed fellow bebop pioneer Charlie Parker. Almost inevitably for an artistic career stretching over more than five decades, the quality of the work is uneven. Unlike Winogrand, Friedlander hasn’t given up on editing, but he is more interested in taking pictures and getting them out than in scrupulously curating his own oeuvre. “It’s a generous medium, photography,” he is quoted as saying in the epigraph to the MoMA catalog. He was thinking particularly of a picture of his uncle, which also included a bunch of other, unintended information. “The American Monument” came about in similar fashion, when he noticed that memorials and statues of all kinds cropped up in multiple contact sheets, some of which were primarily concerned with other matters. After that, he began seeking out such monuments in the course of his travels throughout the States. Eventually he had enough pictures for a book — which, in Friedlander-ese, means more than enough. The original edition boiled thousands of potential candidates down to 213, the bulk of them taken between 1971 and 1975, supplemented by a brilliant afterword by Leslie George Katz. That essay still feels remarkably fresh in the reprint, even though Katz’s observations occasionally gleam with a faith in the assumption of the continued worth of monuments that may turn out to be “discredited,” “outmoded” or ironically apposite, as when he says of their power, “Something like racial memory is at work.” Robert Musil wrote that nothing is as invisible as a monument, and Friedlander in the 1970s relished the simple and complex task of making the invisible visible. He did this by showing how monuments hide in plain sight: subsumed by traffic, by familiarity, by the abundance of incidental detail he “got” in that picture of his uncle. The poet Siegfried Sassoon expressed the cruel paradox of remembrance while contemplating the Cenotaph, dedicated to the dead of the First World War, in London: “Make them forget, O Lord, what this Memorial/Means.” Friedlander’s photos read like an almost-random survey of the aesthetics and meanings of all kinds of monument — and of how easy it is to forget what is meant to be remembered. It is entirely coincidental that the book is being reissued at a time when the silent claims of monuments on our attention have become more audible than at any period in their long and dormant history. Misgivings about a few make us newly attentive to the many. The album is essentially the same as it was in 1976, but we view it rather differently. Monuments, after all, are also mirrors. So, for that matter, are the windows (often of cars) through which we see them — and few photographers have had more fun than Friedlander exploiting, exploring and reflecting on the capacities of these two pieces of technology to complicate what is shown in a frame. Dependent on all manner of mirroring, both felicitous and contrived, the slim volume Friedlander published before “The American Monument” was a collection of self-portraits. The self of which the pictures in the reprinted book offer a composite portrait is, of course, America. "
784,"BERLIN — If President Trump decertifies the Iran nuclear deal this week, as seems likely, “it will show total disrespect for America’s allies,” Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to the United States, told me. That’s the least of it. This — and I know competition is stiff — would be the rashest, most foolish act of the Trump administration to date. The president’s refusal to certify an accord his own defense secretary, James Mattis, says Iran is upholding, and is in the American national interest, would send a strong signal that the United States has become a bait-and-switch power whose word is worthless. It’s America’s word as solemn gage that has underwritten global security since 1945. Goodbye to all that. Uncorked, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has grown bubbly. He’s compared Trump’s White House to “an adult day care center” in which only the likes of Mattis are keeping the child-sovereign’s tantrums from causing disaster. He’s suggested that, through infantile recklessness, Trump could set us “on the path to World War III.” Exhibit A in this pattern of puerility would be the decertification of a multilateral deal that is working and is supported by China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, powers with which Trump may even have a passing acquaintance. Bait and switch, I said. The accord is a nuclear nonproliferation deal, not a grand bargain with Iran. It was concluded, as most breakthrough diplomatic accords are, with a hostile power. It was designed to curb the potential threat from the Islamic Republic, not change the nature of the regime overnight. It was about centrifuges, not Iranian support for Hezbollah; enriched uranium, not Iran’s terrible human rights record. It represents a difficult compromise between two countries — the United States and Iran — whose accumulated grievances stretch back decades but whose unyielding confrontation benefits neither. "
785,"One of the Democratic Party’s most prominent financial backers is demanding that lawmakers and candidates on the left support removing President Trump from office, putting pressure on Democrats to make Mr. Trump’s ouster a defining issue in the 2018 midterm elections. Tom Steyer, a billionaire California investor who spent more than $91 million supporting Democrats in the 2016 elections, issued the demand to his party in a letter on Wednesday. In his message, Mr. Steyer called Mr. Trump a “clear and present danger to the republic” and urged Democrats to pledge that they would seek to remove him from office if they take control of Congress next year. Mr. Steyer — who is considering a run for Senate, perhaps against Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fellow Democrat — cited a range of acts by Mr. Trump to justify impeachment, including the president’s “relationship with Vladimir Putin and Russia,” allegations that Mr. Trump has used the presidency to “promote his own business interests” and his “seeming determination to go to war.” And he pointed to mounting expressions of concern on the right, including the warning by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, that Mr. Trump was at risk of fomenting a world war, and reports that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson described Mr. Trump as a “moron.” Democrats, Mr. Steyer said, should be no less confrontational. “This is not just an issue of Twitter screeds but what it means for a person who has control over our nuclear arsenal,” Mr. Steyer said, adding in a plea to lawmakers: “I hope you will make your position clear so that Democratic voters who are under constant attack by this administration, know their elected representatives have the patriotism and political courage to stand up and take action.” The letter, which was sent to Democratic congressional offices and the party’s House and Senate campaign committees, and shared with The New York Times by an aide to Mr. Steyer, represents a significant boost to efforts on the left to make impeachment a mainstream political consideration.

Most of climate change’s dangers remain far-off in the future, and almost anything in the future feels uncertain, even squishy. This uncertainty is a big reason that climate change is such a hard political problem to solve. The Trump administration’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan — and promote coal use — is clearly bad for the planet’s far-off future, because it will aggravate climate change. But I think the most effective strategy for the opponents of repeal is to focus on the here and now. And unlike some anti-environmental policies, this one will begin to harm Americans very quickly. Coal plants release a stew of pollutants, including mercury (which damages children’s brains) and particulate matter (which includes bits of unburned coal small enough for people to inhale). These bits of coal cause asthma, strokes, lung damage and heart attacks. Worldwide, particulate matter is the seventh-largest cause of avoidable deaths. Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s E.P.A. director, has a long record of running government agencies on behalf of the energy industry. First in Oklahoma and now in Washington, he’s enacted policies to increase industry profits, no matter the health consequences. Buried deep in the proposed rule change that the E.P.A. released yesterday, the organization acknowledges part of the damage it is doing: “Some of the benefits of reducing these pollutants would have accrued to children.” Indeed. But in Pruitt’s E.P.A., keeping children from breathing coal doesn’t seem to be a priority. On this subject, Richard Revesz and Jack Lienke have written an op-ed in The Times carefully detailing how the E.P.A. has fudged the economic numbers to justify its policy. Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund has written a pithy series of tweets. The Editorial Board also addresses the subject today. In The Times. “It’s also hard to reconcile ESPN’s decision to suspend Jemele Hill for not quite calling for a boycott with the outspokenness that ESPN prizes in anchors who are not black women, who say things much more offensive and only get a slap on the wrist,” argues Kashana Cauley, a television writer. "
788,"On Tuesday, the day after the slightly surreal public tussle between Ivana and Melania Trump over who actually was first lady (Mrs. Trump #1 joked it was she; the current occupant of the White House was not amused), the official first lady made a visit to an opioid clinic in West Virginia, signaling that the drug epidemic would be a focus for the East Wing. It was a classic first lady moment, and it’s clearly an important cause (less controversial, perhaps, than the cyberbullying idea), but also classic was Mrs. Trump’s choice of dress for the occasion: a green shirtdress from Cefinn, the brand created by Samantha Cameron. Yes, that Samantha Cameron: the former first lady of Britain. Or the equivalent; there is no formal first lady title there. Still, it was, in effect, an appearance that quietly doubled-down on the first lady messaging. Earlier this year Ms. Cameron introduced Cefinn — the name derives from a combination of her children’s initials — some months after her husband, David, resigned as prime minister after the country voted to leave the European Union. The moderately priced and easy-to-wear collection is sold on Net-a-Porter, among other retailers, and the particular dress that Mrs. Trump wore, a belted muslin number, is available for $450 (Mrs. Trump changed the belt). That makes it a relatively accessible public-image choice on the Trump continuum, another interesting signal from a first lady whose clothes, such as the $51,500 Dolce & Gabbana coat that she wore in May during the Group of 7 summit meeting in Sicily, have tended toward the gilded and out-of-reach. And, like the Timberland boots she wore this month in Puerto Rico, it demonstrates some sensitivity to the reality of the place she was visiting. (Of course, Mrs. Trump also wore towering Christian Louboutin snakeskin stilettos to the clinic, which retail for $1,395, but everything is relative, and the shoes have become part of her signature. Baby steps.) In any case, the Cefinn dress is also interesting in the context of the furor that surrounded Mrs. Trump early in her husband’s administration, when a libel suit against The Daily Mail revealed that the first lady had maybe-possible plans for a brand in her post-White House life. That created an uproar, and Mrs. Trump denied any such idea, though Mrs. Cameron, of course, has done exactly that — and with no negative repercussions. Indeed, there was a fair amount of excitement in Britain when the news was announced (British Vogue did a story), though it had little impact in the United States. This clearly has not escaped Mrs. Trump. That she is now supporting the post-Downing Street fashion life of a member of the small club that is former world leaders’ wives could be — well, a noteworthy look. "
789,"The rapper Eminem struck out at President Trump in a video that played at the BET Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday, accusing the president of racism, hypocrisy, disrespect of military veterans and more in almost five minutes of furious freestyle rap. He also excoriated Mr. Trump for his responses to the recent violence in Charlottesville, Va., the devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria and the mass shooting in Las Vegas. The video, titled “The Storm,” was filmed in Detroit as part of the BET Hip Hop Awards’ traditional cyphers, in which rappers typically aim to deliver showy verses in a group setting. In his solo appearance, Eminem, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and baseball cap, name-drops Colin Kaepernick (“This is for Colin/ball up a fist”), Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Stephen K. Bannon. Throughout, he alludes to an array of Mr. Trump’s political clashes, including a reference to Senator John McCain (“Unless you’re a P.O.W. who’s tortured and battered/’cause to him you’re zeroes/’cause he don’t like his war heroes captured.”) Mr. Kaepernick expressed his support on Twitter with a raised fist emoji. Eminem also ripped into his fans who are Trump supporters. “And any fan of mine/who’s a supporter of his/I’m drawing in the sand a line/you’re either for or against/and if you can’t decide/who you like more and you’re split/on who you should stand beside/I’ll do it for you with this,” he raps, before giving the middle finger to the camera.

792,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump’s feud with Senator Bob Corker continued on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump tweeted to suggest that Mr. Corker, a Republican, had been tricked by The New York Times into saying disparaging things about the president. On “The Late Late Show,” James Corden took aim at Mr. Trump from a variety of angles. Mr. Corden also addressed another internecine fight that’s occupying Mr. Trump’s time. The New Yorker on Tuesday published an unsparing investigation into the film producer Harvey Weinstein’s conduct with female actors and models, including accusations that he raped multiple women. But the late-night shows seemed reluctant to deal with the reports, and only some addressed them at all. Even those shows that did failed to spend much time on the revelations or mention the most unsettling accusations. Stephen Colbert discussed Elon Musk’s suggestions that artificial intelligence could pose a greater threat to humanity than North Korea’s nuclear program. Mark Zuckerberg had called that claim “pretty irresponsible,” leading Mr. Musk to tweet a spicy, dismissive response. "
793,"WASHINGTON — American military officials at the Guantánamo Bay prison recently hardened their approach to hunger-striking prisoners, detainees have told their lawyers, and are allowing protesters to physically deteriorate beyond a point that previously prompted medical intervention to force-feed them. The claim comes during two significant developments for the military commissions at Guantánamo this week, including a Supreme Court decision on Tuesday not to hear an appeal in a much-watched case. Together, the events are renewing attention on the wartime prison operation that President George W. Bush opened in 2002, that President Barack Obama tried without success to close and that President Trump has so far left alone. Of the 41 men remaining at the prison, 10 were charged or convicted in the commissions system and the rest are being held in indefinite wartime detention without trial. That group includes about five men who have gone on hunger strikes to protest, detainee lawyers say. For years, the military has forcibly fed chronic protesters when their weight dropped too much. Detainees who refuse to drink a nutritional supplement have been strapped into a restraint chair and had the supplement poured through their noses and into their stomachs via nasogastric tubes. But around Sept. 19, guards stopped taking hunger-striking detainees to feeding stations, said Clive Stafford Smith, a lawyer for the international human rights organization Reprieve. He said this change was reported by two Reprieve clients who had been subjected to tube feedings, and corroborated by several other clients. David Remes, who represents another hunger striker, said his client had been on such a strike since August but had not been tube-fed despite losing significant weight. The client also told him that other protesters were no longer being force-fed. "
794,"The tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that’s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline. The companies I call the Frightful Five — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have experienced astounding growth over the last few years, making them the world’s five most valuable public companies. Because they own the technology that will dominate much of life for the foreseeable future, they are also gaining vast social and political power over much of the world beyond tech. Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing — in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches — are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit. I’ve spent the last few years studying the rise of these giants. As tensions over their power reached a high boil this summer — Facebook and Russia, Google and sexism, Amazon and Whole Foods — I began thinking more about the nature and consequence of their power, and talking to everyone I could find about these companies. Among them were people in the tech industry, as well as many in other power centers: Washington, Hollywood, the media, the health care and automotive businesses, and other corners of society that may soon be ensnared by one or more of the Five. This is the first of several columns in which I’ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment — their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked. Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.

795,"Good morning on this wobbly Wednesday. Things got feisty last night at the first general election debate in the race for New York City mayor, and the raucous audience was partly responsible for it. (If you missed it, here are five takeaways and a fact-check.) Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican candidate, and Bo Dietl, an independent, were met with cheers, jeers, boos and screams as they answered questions about homelessness, subway delays, police reform and racial segregation in schools, among other topics. Mr. de Blasio harped on the other candidates’ support for President Trump. Ms. Malliotakis called out the mayor’s touchy relationship with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. And Mr. Dietl managed to work the term “nincompoop” into some comments on jail reform. We asked some of the attendees: Who won the debate? “No one won the debate. It was a S-show in there. Everyone was booing, you couldn’t hear the answers to the questions — it was too much.” — Christina Jerez, 28, a Queens resident who supports Mr. de Blasio “Nicole won the debate. I thought she was excellent. I came in being a Bo Dietl supporter because I was tired of de Blasio’s failed four years, and I thought she nailed it. She focused on the issues. She didn’t get into senseless politics.” — Amber Barth, 38, a Queens resident who supports Mr. Dietl “Nicole. Not because I support her, but she was on point on all the issues. The issue of education in the city right now, what’s important to the schools, the subway system and the M.T.A., safety, housing, homelessness. I don’t think she won, I know she won.” — Baxter Bey, a Manhattan resident who supports Ms. Malliotakis "

797,"President Trump usually ignores the criticism that comes his way from MSNBC, the reliably liberal cable channel that, his advisers argue, will attack his administration no matter what. But two reports by the channel’s parent network, NBC News — including a scoop that the president sought to expand the nation’s nuclear arsenal — set off some of Mr. Trump’s most hostile rhetoric yet about the freedom of the press. “Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked,” he wrote on Twitter. “Not fair to public!” A few caveats to keep in mind. Rage against the media is political Wagyu for the president’s base. And Mr. Trump’s notion of suspending licenses — along with his proposal, tweeted last week, that late-night comedians be subject to the “equal time” rule — is essentially unworkable, given how government regulation of the airwaves actually works. So was it a genuine threat — or just another comment from a president who seemingly thrives on narrative tension simply trying to top himself? "
798,"The situation in Iowa remains horrifying. More than a third of the population has been without clean water for three weeks, and waterborne diseases appear to be spreading. Only a sixth of the population has electricity. The health care system is a shambles, and sheer hunger may be a problem in some remote areas. Fortunately, the federal government is going all out to aid its citizens in distress. The president is making disaster relief a top priority, while praising the often heroic efforts of Iowa residents to help themselves. And generous aid, he promises, will continue as long as it’s needed. O.K., I lied. The dire situation I just described is in Puerto Rico, not Iowa (which happens to have just about the same number of U.S. citizens). And my upbeat portrayal of the federal response — which is how things might have played out if this nightmare were, in fact, in Iowa — is the opposite of the truth. What we’re actually witnessing, in effect, is the betrayal and abandonment of three and a half million of our own people. It’s hard to make an accurate assessment of the initial emergency response to Hurricane Maria, although there are a number of indications that it was woefully inadequate, falling far short of the response to natural disasters in other parts of the United States. What is clear, however, is that recovery has been painfully slow, and that life is actually getting worse for many residents as the cumulative effects of shortages of power, water and food take their toll. And the Trump administration seems increasingly to see this tragedy as a public relations issue, something to be spun — partly by blaming the victims — rather than as an urgent problem to be solved. From the beginning, Donald Trump — who literally seems to think that he deserves praise for throwing a few rolls of paper towels into a crowd — has suggested that Puerto Rico is responsible for its own disaster, and he has systematically denigrated the efforts of its people to take care of one another. "
799,"SAN FRANCISCO — At the start of this decade, the Arab Spring blossomed with the help of social media. That is the sort of story the tech industry loves to tell about itself: It is bringing freedom, enlightenment and a better future for all mankind. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, proclaimed that this was exactly why his social network existed. In a 2012 manifesto for investors, he said Facebook was a tool to create “a more honest and transparent dialogue around government.” The result, he said, would be “better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time.” Now tech companies are under fire for creating problems instead of solving them. At the top of the list is Russian interference in last year’s presidential election. Social media might have originally promised liberation, but it proved an even more useful tool for stoking anger. The manipulation was so efficient and so lacking in transparency that the companies themselves barely noticed it was happening. The election is far from the only area of concern. Tech companies have accrued a tremendous amount of power and influence. Amazon determines how people shop, Google how they acquire knowledge, Facebook how they communicate. All of them are making decisions about who gets a digital megaphone and who should be unplugged from the web. Their amount of concentrated authority resembles the divine right of kings, and is sparking a backlash that is still gathering force. “For 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,” said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Now sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.” "
800,"WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, the 264th day of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, a Democratic congressman from Texas walked onto the floor of the House and presented articles of impeachment against the commander in chief. President Trump has not necessarily committed a crime, the congressman said, but he has “undermined” the integrity of his office, “brought disrepute” on the presidency, and “betrayed” the trust of Americans. Congress, firmly in Republican control, barely blinked an eye. The dynamic is likely to become a lot more familiar on Capitol Hill as the Trump presidency and investigations into the president’s associates grind on. Driven by an angry and energized base and insulated by the surety that Republican leaders will block their efforts, liberal Democrats are turning to one of Congress’s most symbolically freighted cudgels — impeachment — to add urgency to their longstanding criticisms of a president they say is unfit for office. But with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, still pursuing his investigation, the efforts lack the weight of a prosecutor’s brief — and could become the objects of scorn, if not mockery. “I believe that there is support across the length and breadth of this country,” the congressman, Al Green of Texas, said in an interview shortly before he went to the floor on Wednesday. “I do not take this lightly.” Mr. Green’s articles of impeachment have company. Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, plans to introduce his own impeachment articles in the coming weeks. Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, did so in July. And other Democrats in the House, where impeachment proceedings must begin, say they will not be far behind. "
801,"For Democrats, the warning shots are coming thick and fast. “More than half of Americans don’t think Donald Trump is fit to serve as president, yet he has a clear path to winning reelection,” Doug Sosnik, who served as President Bill Clinton’s political director, wrote in the Washington Post last week. “Are Democrats Headed for a McGovern Redux?” Alan Greenblatt asked in Politico on Oct. 9. On the same day, a New York Magazine headline declared: “No One Should Rule Out a Trump Re-election in 2020.” What can Democrats do? A Pew Research Center survey released earlier this month documented the growth of the partisan divide: “the median (middle) Republican is now more conservative than 97% of Democrats, and the median Democrat is more liberal than 95% of Republicans.” The two accompanying charts illustrate the heights partisanship has reached. Much of the current polarization is driven by difference of opinion on issues of race and immigration. Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke who has focused much of her research on the racial attitudes of whites, emailed me to comment: Disrupting this linkage is an uphill battle for Democrats: According to Cornell Belcher, a prominent Democratic pollster who worked for President Barack Obama, attempts to win white working class votes in presidential elections should not be the Democrats’ top priority. He wrote me: Belcher pointed out that In terms of Congressional and state legislative contests, Belcher argues, “we can and should do better among non-college white voters” because they are crucial to the outcome in many districts. But doing so, he argues, will be a tremendous challenge: Significantly, Belcher contends, the anxiety about rapid social change is politically salient. Offering economic palliatives will not adequately address that anxiety, he said: Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan who is an expert in elections and party politics, wrote in an email that many voters in 2016 were worried about the rate of changes taking place in the racial and ethnic composition of their communities and in the continuing shift from manufacturing to service industries: This difference played into a second Democratic liability, according to Lupia: Voters who cast Republican ballots last year experience disproportionately higher levels of both cultural and economic anxiety than Democratic voters, Lupia argued, but “many people on the left mock this uncertainty and those who feel this uncertainty are quite good at knowing when they are being mocked.” Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, agrees with Lupia in many respects, but places greater emphasis on economic policy as a coalition building mechanism: Cain is critical of the lack of attention Democrats paid to economic issues in 2016: "
802,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Most male late-night hosts have not made much of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. But on Wednesday, Samantha Bee led “Full Frontal” with a full-on attack. She started by taking aim at Mr. Weinstein’s response last week to the initial reports that he’d sexually harassed women throughout his career. Ms. Bee was also irked by Mr. Weinstein’s statement that “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.” President Trump suggested on Wednesday that the Federal Communications Commission should consider revoking NBC’s broadcasting license for publishing stories he finds objectionable. Stephen Colbert has another idea. Jimmy Fallon wondered whether Mr. Trump had forgotten about the First Amendment entirely. "
803,"M
innesota is home to some of the world’s most ancient rocks, as old as 3.5 billion years. Earth has been around for only 4.5 billion years. About 2.7 billion years ago, basalt lava flowed underwater near what’s now the state’s border with Canada; the lava hardened, and the creep of geologic time turned it into a bedrock of greenstone and granite. On top of it, a layer of sedimentary rock rich in iron ore formed nearly two billion years ago, when the region was ocean floor. Then a billion years ago, Earth’s crust cracked open, producing a 50-mile-wide fissure stretching from Lake Superior to Kansas. For the next 100 million years, lava bubbled up into what geologists call the Midcontinent Rift, forming a mineral deposit filled with copper and nickel. Settlers first made their way to the area in 1865 in a fruitless search for gold. What they did find was iron ore, and lots of it. Rails were laid for iron-ore transport, and the town of Ely was founded a few years later, in 1888. Today Ely is home to a few thousand people, a place of long, hard winters that is, in the words of one resident, “not on the road to anywhere — we’re literally the end of the road.” People do not end up here by accident. For most of the town’s history, the main reason they came was to make a living off the rocks. The ore supported abundant mining jobs for generations. For almost as long, however, people have been coming to this area for another reason, too: to visit America’s most popular national wilderness area, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, which encompasses roughly a million protected acres and thousands of lakes and welcomes 150,000 visitors annually. The “Land of 10,000 Lakes” is actually a land of 11,842 lakes, and that figure counts only those bigger than 10 acres. They are a legacy of the glaciers that retreated from the region about 10,000 years ago. As a result, the state has a significant fraction of the world’s supply of surface-available fresh water; 6 percent of Minnesota’s surface area is water, more than any other state. Geological coincidence makes Ely — one three-square-mile town in the northernmost reaches of the continental United States — a focus of a national debate about the proper use of public lands. The place also distills the political fault lines in today’s America, pitting an angry working class against progressive activists. Just southeast of Ely, an international mining conglomerate has invested hundreds of millions of dollars during the past decade toward potential copper-nickel mines a few miles outside the Boundary Waters. The company — Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the Chilean mining giant Antofagasta — has drilled 1.6 million feet of core samples out of 496 holes to explore the deposit from which it soon hopes to process 20,000 tons of mineralized ore a day. The company believes the area’s valuable metals — copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, gold and silver — can be extracted in an environmentally responsible way and can provide hundreds of jobs to the job-starved economy of Minnesota’s Arrowhead Region, along the northwestern coast of Lake Superior. But there’s a generations-long rift in Ely — between those who believe minerals are the region’s greatest asset and those who believe clean waters are — that has been laid bare recently. In December the Obama administration denied a renewal of Twin Metals’ mining leases and put in place a moratorium while a two-year comprehensive federal study is being conducted on mining near the Boundary Waters. Depending on its findings, the stoppage could be a prelude to what conservationist groups here hope for most: a 20-year prohibition on mining in a 230,000-acre portion of the Rainy River Watershed that includes land surrounding the Boundary Waters. That could lead to a permanent end to mining around the Boundary Waters. Now, mining supporters, among them Representative Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represents Ely’s district in Congress, are trying to undo the moratorium. The battle is being fought on both moral and economic grounds. Mining advocates stress the hundreds of tangible construction and mining jobs this copper-nickel operation could create in the coming decades. Boundary Waters activists argue that the very presence of mining — its disruption of this area’s natural character, not to mention the specter of pollution — could hamper the region’s “amenity-based” development in a multitude of tangible and intangible ways, from destroying property values to stripping away jobs that feed off this area’s natural beauty.

804,"When President Trump announced his long list of immigration demands on Tuesday, it threw another wrench into the fraught negotiations over fixing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era policy that until last month protected some young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. But if the Washington deal-making drags on too long, it could be disrupted by a different force: a federal judge in Brooklyn who has sternly warned that should policy makers prove unable to repair the program, commonly known as DACA, he might have to do it. In recent weeks, the judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, has made a series of unusually forceful statements from the bench, calling the Trump administration’s approach to fixing DACA “cruel,” “heartless” and “unacceptable.” He has also offered praise for the 800,000 young immigrants who were shielded by the program, lauding them as people who pay rent, taxes and mortgages, and who “support their communities.” Judge Garaufis has even professed confusion over Mr. Trump’s tweets about DACA, saying that the president’s apparent desire to save the program does not square with his government’s continued efforts to rescind it. But perhaps most forebodingly, the judge has stated several times that while he would prefer “the political branches” to resolve the issue, if that becomes impossible, he may have to impose his own solution. A Democrat appointed by President Clinton, Judge Garaufis has found himself in a position to guide DACA’s fate because two linked lawsuits have landed in his courtroom. The suits, filed separately last month by a coalition of immigration lawyers and by more than a dozen state attorneys general, have challenged Mr. Trump’s repeal of DACA by arguing that it is an “arbitrary” exercise of power and betrays an “animus” toward Latinos. Similar suits have also been filed in California. Judge Garaufis has acknowledged that he is unlikely to decide on the merits of the lawsuits until early next year. And he may find that the United States Appeals Court for the Second Circuit does not take kindly to his rhetoric or eventual decision. "
805,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Palestinian unity deal. Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal in Cairo today that aims to end their decade-old rivalry and paves the way for joint control of Gaza’s borders. Under the agreement, brokered by Egyptian intelligence, Fatah will lift a series of punitive sanctions that it imposed on Hamas-controlled Gaza this year. But it leaves thornier issues unresolved. • Trump’s to-do list. With Congress failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Trump is ready to go it alone on health care. He plans to sign an executive order today that would relax rules on small businesses that band together to buy health insurance. On Wednesday, the president said it was “possible” the U.S. would drop out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. His administration has pushed for significant changes to the deal, but Mexico and Canada say they’re nonstarters. Separately, Mr. Trump threatened to use the government’s power over broadcast licenses to retaliate against NBC for a report about the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Curious about how The Times covers the Trump administration? You can submit questions for a TimesTalk at 6:30 p.m. Eastern today with our White House correspondents Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman, as well as Dean Baquet, our executive editor, that will be moderated by Jim Rutenberg, our media columnist.

806,"WASHINGTON — President Trump suggested on Wednesday evening that a soaring stock market might be “in a sense” reducing the national debt, a statement that is not true, in any sense. “The country — we took it over and owed over $20 trillion,” Mr. Trump told the Fox News personality Sean Hannity, following similar remarks he made earlier on Wednesday in a speech he delivered on tax issues in Pennsylvania. “As you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value.” “So you could say, in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt.” The comments represented the latest in a long-shifting series of positions on debt issues for Mr. Trump as both president and candidate, which has included, at various points, proclaiming “I love debt” and also promising to pay off the entire national debt in eight years. Wednesday’s remarks coincide with recent comments by Republican lawmakers and other administration officials playing down concerns about the federal debt. The White House and Republicans in Congress are pushing a tax rewrite that independent analysts warn could add trillions more to the debt, but administration officials say will more than pay for itself with increased economic growth. The federal budget deficit increased in the 2017 fiscal year, both in dollar terms and as a share of the economy, the Congressional Budget Office reported this month. Total debt held by the public stands at $20.38 trillion, up from $19.95 trillion when Mr. Trump took office in January. "
807,"To the Editor: Re “Citing Scandal, Studio’s Board Fires Weinstein” (front page, Oct. 9): I wish Jenni Konner, the executive producer of “Girls,” were right when she says Harvey Weinstein’s firing is a tipping point. Alas, we have a president who brags about sexually abusing woman, lots of gold in the parachutes handed to Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly after they were ousted, “gag orders” as standard operating procedure, and countless women in every industry who are experiencing offensive and often criminal sexual misconduct right now. A quarter century after Anita Hill was vilified for speaking out about Clarence Thomas, we have a lot of fighting left to do. Fortunately, activists across the country, many of them women of color, are leading that fight. ELLEN BRAVO, MILWAUKEE The writer is the co-author of “The 9 to 5 Guide to Combating Sexual Harassment” and author of “Again and Again,” a novel about date rape. To the Editor: Harvey Weinstein’s public apology was both condescending and tiresomely clichéd. Mr. Weinstein has undoubtedly downplayed the sexual harassment of countless women in Hollywood over dozens of years. Unfortunately, he is not alone. I spent nine years in Hollywood as an actress. With my freckles and my “girl next door” visage, I was always cast as the little sister or the brainy girlfriend. I naïvely believed that this would safeguard me from the proverbial “casting couch” I had heard so much about. It did not. Over those nine years, I had multiple interactions with well-known directors and producers that were thoroughly offensive, demeaning and inappropriate. I was fortunate enough to extricate myself from these interactions. However, I never felt as if I could “blow the whistle” on these men. They were well respected, powerful and influential. I simply walked away, without giving them what they wanted and without the part. "
808,"Before there was Bach, there was Monteverdi. This is true both historically and for the eminent and versatile English conductor John Eliot Gardiner. In recent decades Mr. Gardiner has been best known for his consuming immersion in Bach, including a yearlong international Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with his Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists in 2000 and a thoroughgoing biography, “Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven,” published in 2013. But his formative involvement with Monteverdi dates to the beginning of his career, in 1964, when he began to form that Monteverdi Choir for performances of the composer’s 1610 Vespers — like Monteverdi’s other large-scale works, little performed at the time — with a view to the 400th anniversary of his birth, in 1567. Now Mr. Gardiner, 74, arrives in New York for Monteverdi’s 450th, with a rare semistaged triptych of the composer’s surviving operas, “L’Orfeo” (1607), “Il Ritorno d’Ulisse in Patria” (1640) and “L’Incoronazione di Poppea” (1642), to be performed at Alice Tully Hall next week to open Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival. Reached in Pisa, Italy, last week, between performances of the Vespers there and at Versailles, Mr. Gardiner discussed the project and bringing Monteverdi to Donald Trump’s America. These are edited excerpts from the interview. When you first came to Monteverdi, what did you think he had to say to the 20th century? What’s so striking about Monteverdi is his extraordinary, exceptional ability to encapsulate the whole range of human emotions in music. I don’t think anybody had done it before, and I’m not sure many composers have done it since. "
809,"WASHINGTON — The House, dismissing concern for the rising cost, approved a $36.5 billion aid package on Thursday that would provide hurricane and wildfire relief funding while bailing out the financially troubled National Flood Insurance Program. The aid package would also help Puerto Rico’s financially beleaguered government avoid running out of cash in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Conditions there remain dire, with most of the island still without power three weeks after the storm hit. The House approved the bill 353 to 69, with all of the no votes coming from Republicans. The disaster package, now awaiting consideration in the Senate, would be the second installment of aid money that Congress has approved in response to this year’s hurricanes, after a $15.3 billion relief measure in September. With the tab now more than $50 billion, lawmakers warn that much more money will still be needed. Lawmakers from Texas and Florida have already outlined expansive requests, adding up to tens of billions of dollars in total. And the United States Virgin Islands delegate to the House, Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat, complained that the package lacked aid needed by her devastated territory. “I know people are concerned that not every state’s need is met, but this is, I think, a good step in the right direction,” said Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who urged his colleagues to vote for the bill “so we can get this money out the door as quickly as possible.” The governor of the Virgin Islands, Kenneth E. Mapp, wrote to congressional leaders on Thursday to request $5.5 billion of disaster relief for the United States territory, a group of islands east of Puerto Rico that was raked by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. “We are at the U.S. government’s mercy,” the governor said, describing destroyed hospitals, schools and fire stations, two heavily damaged airport terminals, and an electrical grid that was a total loss. He said the greatest share of the aid would be put toward housing, because most homes on the islands had been “destroyed or substantially damaged,” along with the hotels and resorts at the heart of their economy. "
810,"The news arrived on Oct. 11, a day — as Facebook reminded us — designated as the International Day of the Girl. On the surface, it even seemed like it might be a progressive change: The Boy Scouts of America announced that it would allow girls to participate in Cub Scouts and to eventually earn Eagle Scout rank. The responses fell into a few broadly predictable categories. Some applauded what they saw as a long-overdue opening of closed doors, along the lines of the January announcement that transgender boys could join scouting and the 2013 end to the ban on gay members. Others, mostly men, many of them former scouts, objected to what they saw as creeping political correctness, an incursion of unwanted female influence into an all-male bastion. On Fox News, Laura Ingraham attributed the change to a “small, radical group of gender-benders.” But both sides seemed to agree that the shift in policy, whether they loved it or hated it, was essentially progressive. They’ve been had. The Boy Scouts’ decision to open its ranks to girls appears to be less an evolution toward openness and inclusion than a calculated business strategy. The move allows the organization, which has been rocked by revelations of decades of sexual abuse, to improve its public image. It opens up a broad new market with the promise of increased revenue, an attractive proposition for a nonprofit that has seen both membership rolls and corporate sponsorships shrink in recent years. Most crucially, it’s a direct attack on the Girl Scouts, a group that shares some historical roots with the Boy Scouts but has grown into a very different organization, with very different values. Unlike the Boy Scouts, in which individual troops are overwhelmingly affiliated with churches — a large share are tied to conservative denominations; an estimated 20 percent of scouts are Mormon, for instance — the Girl Scouts are a secular organization. While the Boy Scouts have an official policy against atheists and agnostics participating in scouting, the Girl Scouts make it clear that girls may substitute any words they like for the part of the Girl Scout Pledge in which they promise “to serve God.” "
811,"WASHINGTON — He was talking taxes with truckers on Wednesday evening when President Trump suddenly diverged into a curious tangent. He had been given “some very, very important news” that “you’ll probably be hearing about” in the next few days. What it was, he did not say. If the truckers packed in the airport hangar in Harrisburg, Pa., went home that night scratching their heads, Mr. Trump was right that they would eventually realize what he was referring to. By Thursday morning, word emerged that an American woman and her family had been released after five years of captivity by Afghan militants. The forecast by the president seemed to contradict Mr. Trump’s own declaration that he never telegraphs his moves in advance. But advisers have long ago learned that if Mr. Trump is told something, he may not be able to restrain himself from sharing, as he did with intelligence gleaned from the Israelis when he met with the Russian foreign minister in May. In this case, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump was hinting at a delicate development before it was fully completed, but aides were sensitive afterward about not disclosing anything prematurely. Mr. Trump often criticized his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for discussing overseas operations too early. “I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ‘yes, here’s what we’re going to do,’” he said shortly after taking office. The American hostage, Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband and their three children were freed from captivity “through an intelligence-based operation by Pakistan troops,” according to a statement from the Pakistani government. But the family was not yet in American hands. The Pakistanis said the hostages, captured in Afghanistan in 2012, were tracked as they were moved across Pakistan. “The operation by Pakistani forces, based on actionable intelligence from U.S. authorities, was successful,” the statement said. "
812,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Aung San Suu Kyi, in a nationally televised speech, pushed back against international criticism of Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis and promised to oversee efforts to repatriate those who’ve fled to Bangladesh. She did not address their accounts of the military driving them out with arson, murder and rape. Our correspondent was in Yangon, Myanmar’s commercial capital, to learn why the international diplomatic corps there has been so silent. Some diplomats said they were trying to preserve whatever influence they have left to avert an even worse catastrophe. _____ • President Trump is expected to disavow the Iran nuclear deal today, despite mounting opposition from European allies and fellow Republicans. "
813,"Ai Weiwei lives his life in public: blogging his anger at the Chinese government, transforming his detention into harrowing dioramas, and now Instagramming up a storm from his exile in Berlin. Over the last two years, the world’s most famous artist-activist has been traveling to refugee camps from Greece to Iraq and Gaza to Myanmar, documenting the displacement of millions and the borders they are desperate to cross. Others might have stayed behind the camera. Mr. Ai, now a refugee himself, puts himself right in front. The worldwide refugee crisis is the subject of “Human Flow,” Mr. Ai’s new film, and it also informs a gargantuan undertaking of new public artworks in New York, running from Harlem to Flushing and united under the title “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” Put aside its cheesy title, cribbed from Robert Frost, and there is a fair deal to admire in this new endeavor, which consists of new sculptures in the form of steel barriers; hundreds of lamppost banners of refugees past and present; and interventions at bus stops across the five boroughs. Remember the 1990s, when the hawkers of globalization told us this century would see borders fall? In fact construction of international walls and fences has surged worldwide to deter unauthorized migration; Europe’s borderless Schengen zone is under existential threat; Brexit promises to divide Ireland once again; and, if someone has his way, a “big, beautiful wall” may rise south of here soon. Mr. Ai saw those barriers firsthand while filming “Human Flow.” Now he has brought them to New York, where they fit in with alarming naturalness. This week I saw a solid hunk of the hundreds of small and large additions Mr. Ai has made to New York’s streets and parks. Out in Queens, Mr. Ai has encircled the Unisphere — the stainless steel globe that’s the primary symbol of the 1964 World’s Fair — with a running mesh lattice that rises to about knee height. “Circle Fence” cannot be traversed; this is an insuperable border. Yet the nets’ soft and pliant forms, which you’re free to touch or sit upon, may put you in mind of fishermen or trapeze artists more than of guards and wardens. "
814,"As National Football League team owners consider President Trump’s call to fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, they have stumbled into one of the most consequential debates in today’s workplace: How far can workers go in banding together to address problems related to their employment? In principle, the answer in the N.F.L. and elsewhere may be: Quite far. To the extent that most people think about the reach of federal labor law, they probably imagine a union context — like organizing workers, or bargaining as a group across the table from management. As it happens, the law is much more expansive, protecting any “concerted activities” that employees engage in to support one another in the workplace, whether or not a union is involved. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have defined such activity to include everything from airing complaints about one’s boss through social media to publicly supporting political causes that have some bearing on one’s work life. The league’s operations manual says players must be on the sidelines during the anthem and should stand. While the law might not bear on whether an individual player can kneel during the anthem, many experts say it could protect players from repercussions for making such a gesture together — or taking other action — to show solidarity on the job. And as unionization continues its decades-long decline, some believe that these alternative forms of taking collective action may be crucial to enabling workers to speak up. “Workers without a traditional organization that is meant to protect them at work are kind of scrambling around for new ways of protecting themselves,” said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University. “It does feel like these are nascent forms of something new.” "
815,"You know something is wrong when Wall Street loan sharks show more heart than the president of the United States. Last week, some of the companies that hold Puerto Rico’s $74 billion in debt and had been suing to force payment, no matter the consequences, started talking about cutting the island a break after Hurricanes Irma and Marie. One firm said it was dropping its lawsuit (at least for now). A top executive of a mutual fund admitted that Wall Street miscalculated the risk of buying all those unsustainable tax-free bonds from Puerto Rico in the first place and may actually have to lose some money on the deal. After all, said Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles & Co.: “They are U.S. citizens. We are U.S. citizens. We have an obligation to help.” President Trump, who has made some halfhearted and condescending efforts to show concern about Puerto Rico, is having none of that nonsense. In one of his deranged early-morning Twitter rants, Trump said on Thursday that Puerto Rico’s “infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.” He said Congress, which he knows perfectly well can’t do much of anything, has to “decide how much to spend” and warned that he “cannot keep” federal disaster relief officials and the military in “P.R. forever!” "
816,"MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines threatened on Thursday to expel the ambassadors representing the European Union, suggesting that he would give them 24 hours to leave his country. “You think that we are a bunch of morons here,” Mr. Duterte said in an expletive-laden speech at the presidential palace. “Because we can have the diplomatic channel cut tomorrow. You leave my country in 24 hours. All. All of you.” His remarks appeared to be a reaction to recent criticism of the country’s war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed by the police. A director of Human Rights Watch suggested that the Philippines should be removed from the United Nations’ top human rights body. A group including European lawmakers issued a statement after a visit to the country last week suggesting that the European Union might tighten its terms of trade with the Philippines for human rights reasons. The European Union said in a statement issued by its delegation in Manila that the lawmakers’ visit had been a private trip organized by the Progressive Alliance — a group that is critical of the Duterte government — not an official mission. “The statements made by the Progressive Alliance during its visit to the Philippines were made solely on behalf of the Progressive Alliance and do not represent the position of the European Union,” the statement said. "
817,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will scrap subsidies to health insurance companies that help pay out-of-pocket costs of low-income people, the White House said late Thursday. His plans were disclosed hours after the president ordered potentially sweeping changes in the nation’s insurance system, including sales of cheaper policies with fewer benefits and fewer protections for consumers. The twin hits to the Affordable Care Act could unravel President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, sending insurance premiums soaring and insurance companies fleeing from the health law’s online marketplaces. After Republicans failed to repeal the health law in Congress, Mr. Trump appears determined to dismantle it on his own. Without the subsidies, insurance markets could quickly unravel. Insurers have said they will need much higher premiums and may pull out of the insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act if the subsidies were cut off. Known as cost-sharing reduction payments, the subsidies were expected to total $9 billion in the coming year and nearly $100 billion in the coming decade. “The government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” the White House said in a statement. It concluded that “Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.” In a joint statement, the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said Mr. Trump had “apparently decided to punish the American people for his inability to improve our health care system.” "
818,"Ben Shapiro, the conservative writer, prides himself on speaking bold truths to liberal power. His shtick goes something like this: Set up a speech in a progressive bastion, ideally a college campus full of coastal elites who have never left their bubble. Spar with snowflakes who are offended by something he says about race or gender and perhaps even believe he never should have been invited in the first place. Post the exchange on the internet and use it as proof that the cultural consensus is stacked dramatically against conservatives. As Mr. Shapiro has put it: “The left has run out of aggressors to target; instead, they’ve become the aggressors, self-righteous morality police dedicated to wiping out dissenting thought.” It’s true that campuses tend to be hostile places to conservatives like Mr. Shapiro, Charles Murray and Heather Mac Donald. But the notion that they are the cultural underdogs is bogus. What Mr. Shapiro does on campus is shadow boxing meant to pander to his conservative fans whose values dominate mainstream American culture. If he wanted to be genuinely brave, he’d challenge some of the wrongheaded ideas held by his right-wing fans. Instead, he uses his megaphone — the website The Daily Wire — to reinforce what they already believe. To take only the most recent example: On Monday, The Daily Wire published a video that depicted Native Americans as animated savages before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. In one slide, the video lists Native American achievements as consisting of dreamcatchers, tomahawks and cannibalism, while stating that Columbus’s arrival in 1492 assured the arrival of “math” and “the iPhone.” The animated video was actually the second one The Daily Wire posted this past weekend on the subject; the other carried the subtle title “Christopher Columbus Actually Was a Great Man.” Mr. Shapiro and The Daily Wire aren’t alone in pandering to their readers. Over at the website The Federalist, the editors took the opportunity of Columbus Day not to examine its complicated legacy or illuminate some overlooked aspect of history but to publish an article titled “Why ‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day’ Is Far Worse Than Columbus Day,” which makes the case that the historical violence of some Native American peoples wash Columbus clean of his genocidal sins. “The only reason,” it says, that anti-Columbus activists “ideological idiocy has free rein today is because Europeans showed up in 1492.” That same publication had a “black crime” tag on its website until two weeks ago, which included an article titled “If You Don’t Want Police to Shoot You, Don’t Resist Arrest.” The subheading: “Every time I hear of a black man getting killed by the cops, he’s almost always a criminal thug I have no desire to defend.” "
819,"WASHINGTON — For months, Facebook has been trying to counter criticism about its influence on the 2016 presidential election. The company has hired three crisis communications firms and has bought digital and newspaper ads. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has posted live video to the social network to explain how much he cared about election integrity. This week, it sent Sheryl Sandberg to Washington to charm Congress and the public. Ms. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, acted as the giant tech company’s chief ambassador in the capital on Wednesday and Thursday — shuttling around to talk with dozens of lawmakers, and making numerous promises about how the company would change. In a public appearance hosted by Axios, the news start-up, she admitted that Facebook had made mistakes during the presidential campaign. She offered lawmakers who are investigating Russia’s meddling in the election more data from the company. And she promised the Congressional Black Caucus that she would help appoint an African-American to the Facebook board. “She said 10 to 15 times, ‘We’ve got to do better,’” Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democrat from Missouri, said after Ms. Sandberg met with the Congressional Black Caucus, which has complained about the level of diversity at the company. Facebook faces a variety of concerns about fake news and its broader role in the presidential campaign. But the criticism has become far more intense in the last few months, after the company revealed that Russian-linked groups bought more than $100,000 in ads on Facebook to influence the election. The complaints about Facebook have also helped propel debate about the technology industry more widely, and whether the biggest technology companies — like Facebook, Google and Amazon — have grown too large and powerful. Some lawmakers are now talking about potential ways to regulate the businesses. "
820,"SEOUL, South Korea — In the late 1980s, when I was in third grade in South Korea, a teacher spent an entire class period telling us that the United States was deliberately keeping the Korean Peninsula divided so it could sell weapons to our country. I repeated the story at home, and my mother and brother told me that my teacher must be a radical pro-North Korean sympathizer. I should know that the United States is our ally, they said, and that our real enemy is Kim Il-sung up north. Communists want to destroy us, and Americans were simply trying to protect us and our precious democracy. I believed it then. But it now looks like America could bring our doom. As the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, put it, President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, are acting like “children in a kindergarten,” spewing incendiary words and issuing threats. And while Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim try to outdo each other with verbal pyrotechnics, fear is growing in South Korea that we may be heading toward war. The new variable is Mr. Trump, who has no problem stooping to the level of a dictator. The man who’s supposed to be Seoul’s dependable ally is playing a dangerous game of one-upmanship to the peril of everyone who lives on the Korean Peninsula. Back in April, Mr. Trump tweeted that if the Chinese don’t help the United States deal with the North Korean nuclear problem, “We will solve the problem without them!” This was followed by Mr. Trump’s threat to rain “fire and fury” down on North Korea. He has taken to belittling Mr. Kim as “Little Rocket Man,” promising that North Korean leaders “won’t be around much longer!” More recently, Mr. Trump said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a diplomatic mission to East Asia, was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.” He added, “Save your energy, Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” "
821,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, after years of the United States distancing itself because of what it called the group’s “anti-Israel bias.” The administration also cited mounting arrears at the organization as a reason for the decision. “We were in arrears to the tune of $550 million or so, and so the question is, do we want to pay that money?” Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said Thursday at a news briefing. She added, “With this anti-Israel bias that’s long documented on the part of Unesco, that needs to come to an end.” While the United States withdrew from the group, the Trump administration said it wanted to continue providing American perspective and expertise to Unesco, but as a nonmember observer. The withdrawal goes into effect at the end of 2018, but that decision could be revisited, officials said. If Unesco returns “to a place where they’re truly promoting culture and education on all of that, perhaps we could take another look at this,” Ms. Nauert said. Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization popularly known for its designation of World Heritage sites, is a global development agency with missions that include promoting sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women. In a lengthy written statement, Irina Bokova, Unesco’s director general, expressed regret at the decision and said that the American people shared the organization’s goals. "
822,"To the Editor: Re “President Issues Terms of a Deal Over ‘Dreamers’ ” (front page, Oct. 9): As time passes and the six-month deadline for congressional action to protect Dreamers like me gets nearer, the sense of urgency seems to be deteriorating. I was one of the first persons to have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals granted. I played by the rules. I worked hard to get into college and even harder to make it through college. I am months away from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley. I have a clean record. I’ve repeatedly been admitted to prestigious internships, I have several mentors and whether I’d succeed was never in question. The conditions that President Trump has set for a bipartisan deal to protect the DACA recipients dim the chance of a deal, but I urge Democrats and Republicans not to politicize the lives of hundreds of thousands of people like me. Pass something. I and other Dreamers belong in this country. I spent only the first year of my life in Mexico, but because I was born there, this government fails to see me as American. Whether some like it or not, immigrants continue to shape and be a part of America. It is time that we stop dehumanizing fellow Americans. DIANA JAUREGUI IÑIGUEZ
BERKELEY, CALIF. To the Editor: President Trump’s latest anti-immigrant demand — that any legislation to protect Dreamers include a crackdown on unaccompanied children, concentrated at the border — is illogical and inhumane. First, deporting children would not deter other child migrants, as some hard-liners suggest. It is Central America’s horrific gang violence, not American immigration policy, that prompts parents to make the heart-wrenching decision to send their children on the perilous journey north. Second, border apprehensions, including of minors, have dramatically declined under Mr. Trump, which he attributes to his rhetoric. Instead, he should be thanking Mexico. Since 2014, when record numbers of unaccompanied children arrived at our border, Mexico has substantially increased apprehensions at its own southern border as well as resettlement of migrants in Mexico. "
823,"WASHINGTON — The message was as stark as it was startling. Three weeks after a killer hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico, President Trump indicated on Thursday that he was losing patience. At least some of the blame for the continuing crisis is yours, he told the island territory, and the federal government will not stay “forever.” While most residents endured another day without power and many without water or other basic services, Mr. Trump upbraided Puerto Rico’s leadership for mismanagement that predated the storm and said troops and emergency workers would eventually leave. Caught off guard, his advisers scrambled to reassure Puerto Rico that Washington was not abandoning it. The president’s warning came on the same day the House approved $36.5 billion in aid for natural disasters, including in Puerto Rico, with the tab rising weekly. Federal agencies expect to spend years helping the island rebuild. But Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for a slow and not always empathetic response to the storms that devastated Puerto Rico, sought to refocus responsibility to where he believes it belongs. “ ‘Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.’ says Sharyl Attkisson,” he wrote on Twitter, citing the host of a public affairs show on Sinclair Broadcast Group television stations. “A total lack of accountability say the Governor. Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. Congress to decide how much to spend. We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” The tweets set off alarms in San Juan, the Puerto Rican capital, where Ricardo A. Rosselló, the governor, anxiously called John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to seek an explanation. Mr. Kelly reassured him that no federal resources were being withdrawn anytime soon and then made an unannounced visit to the White House briefing room to repeat the message for the news media. “Our country will stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done,” Mr. Kelly said. The president, he asserted, merely meant that eventually the federal government would complete its mission. “The whole point is to start to work yourself out of a job,” he said. "
824,"New York City may be more lamentably dull than it was 20 years ago, but it remains a magnet for exceptional talent — in many parts of Brooklyn it is easier to trip over Rhodes scholars than it is to find a half-gallon of milk with additives. Recent economic studies also suggest that as knowledge fields have become increasingly concentrated in the country’s biggest cities, New York has become even more attractive to the brilliant and prestigiously educated. That from this vast pool we have not been able to fish out a vibrant, impressive (and young) political class is one of the paradoxes of life in New York right now. That we collectively mourn the loss of every old bar with sawdust on the floor more operatically than we despair the enfeebled state of our civic life is another aspect of the current disconnect. The mayoral debate this week provides merely the most immediate path to validating these claims. Bill de Blasio, an unpopular incumbent who maintains the fantasy that he is a national voice on progressive issues, went up against two opponents: the Republican Nicole Malliotakis, a representative in the State Legislature who looks at glaringly low crime statistics and manages to see Hell’s Kitchen in 1975, and Bo Dietl, a former detective, running as an independent who, aside from his various crimes against decorum and syntax, last spring admitted that he had been hired by Fox News to investigate and discredit the women who said that they had been victims of sexual harassment there. Episodes of the “Real Housewives” have delivered less shouting and more illumination. At the same time, Manhattan’s district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., a Democrat whose political ambitions were supported by a celebrated last name (his father was secretary of state in the 1970s) is running for re-election unopposed. This must now serve as a source of regret to anyone who might have considered mounting a challenge. Recent revelations have Mr. Vance refusing to prosecute Harvey Weinstein for sexual assault and Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. for fraud, despite significant evidence. Investigative reports have noted a backdrop of contributions made to Mr. Vance’s campaign from lawyers representing the prospective defendants. Mr. Vance and members of his team have maintained that in each case there was insufficient proof to go forward, and yet Mr. Vance did return the contribution from the Trump lawyers after details were publicized. Capitalizing on the moment, Marc Fliedner, a former prosecutor in Brooklyn and civil rights lawyer, presented himself as a write-in candidate. In Staten Island there is the spectacle of Michael Grimm, a Republican working to reclaim the congressional seat he lost when he pleaded guilty to tax fraud and went to prison. “I am absolutely absorbed with the question of how you get better people into politics,” Richard Ravitch, the businessman, former lieutenant governor in New York and longtime consigliere to state and city officials, told me. “I teach a lot; I’m around young people, and no one wants to run for office anymore.” The cult of money is at least in some part to blame, given how many young people come to the city with the pronounced aspiration to make lots of it, and given how severe an impediment the high cost of living here can be to time spent in public service.

825,"CAIRO — After a decade of hostility and recrimination, the two main Palestinian factions came together in Cairo on Thursday to sign a reconciliation deal that holds out the tantalizing prospect of a united Palestinian front. Hopes for the agreement, signed under the watchful eye of Egyptian intelligence, were tempered by the knowledge that many previous Palestinian initiatives have failed. Yet there is optimism that this time may be different, partly because the stakes are so much higher. For the two million Palestinians of Gaza, trapped in a tiny coastal strip that is frequently compared to an open-air prison, the Cairo deal offered a potential respite from their lives of dire shortages of electricity and lifesaving medicine, as well as a chance to travel to the outside world. For the Palestinian leadership, it held out the prospect of negotiating with Israel with a single voice, even as it forced the divided territory’s most radical militants to make painful concessions that acknowledged their own failure to advance their cause. Hamas, which controls Gaza and has fought Israel three times, said it was ready to cede control of Gaza’s borders and allow the rival Palestinian Authority to effectively take over the day-to-day running of the territory. It was a sobering reality check for a group that, despite years of fiery defiance and arms supplies from Iran, cannot rule Gaza without help from Fatah, the rival faction that controls the Palestinian Authority and was driven out of Gaza in violent clashes 10 years ago. "
826,"On July 14, 2016, as French families strolled along Nice’s seafront promenade, a Tunisian man driving a large truck rammed into a crowd, killing 86 people. A month later, the mayor of nearby Cannes declared that “burkinis” — a catchall term for modest swimwear favored by many religious women — would be banned from the city’s beaches; a municipal official called the bathing suits “ostentatious clothing” expressing an “allegiance to terrorist movements that are at war with us.” One of the law’s first victims was a third-generation Frenchwoman who was ordered by the police to strip off her veil while onlookers shouted, “Go back to your country.” Still, many French politicians and intellectuals rushed to defend the ban. The former president Nicolas Sarkozy called modest swimwear “a provocation”; Alain Finkielkraut, a prominent philosopher, argued that “the burkini is a flag.” But what they presented as a defense of secular liberal values was in fact an attack on them — a law, masquerading as neutral, had explicitly targeted one religious group. When rapid immigration and terrorist attacks occur simultaneously — and the terrorists belong to the same ethnic or religious group as the new immigrants — the combination of fear and xenophobia can be dangerous and destructive. In much of Europe, fear of jihadists (who pose a genuine security threat) and animosity toward refugees (who generally do not) have been conflated in a way that allows far-right populists to seize on Islamic State attacks as a pretext to shut the doors to desperate refugees, many of whom are themselves fleeing the Islamic State, and to engage in blatant discrimination against Muslim fellow citizens. But this isn’t happening only in European countries. In recent years, anti-immigration rhetoric and nativist policies have become the new normal in liberal democracies from Europe to the United States. Legitimate debates about immigration policy and preventing extremism have been eclipsed by an obsessive focus on Muslims that paints them as an immutable civilizational enemy that is fundamentally incompatible with Western democratic values. Yet despite the breathless warnings of impending Islamic conquest sounded by alarmist writers and pandering politicians, the risk of Islamization of the West has been greatly exaggerated. Islamists are not on the verge of seizing power in any advanced Western democracy or even winning significant political influence at the polls. The same cannot be said of white nationalists, who today are on the march from Charlottesville, Va., to Dresden, Germany. As an ideology, white nationalism poses a significantly greater threat to Western democracies; its proponents and sympathizers have proved, historically and recently, that they can win a sizable share of the vote — as they did this year in France, Germany and the Netherlands — and even win power, as they have in the United States.

827,"The actress Rose McGowan said in an Instagram post overnight that her Twitter account had been temporarily locked after a series of posts about Harvey Weinstein’s misconduct, including toward her. “TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE,” Ms. McGowan wrote on her Instagram page after midnight Eastern time on Thursday. She included a snapshot of a message from Twitter saying she would be able to send only direct messages from her account unless she deleted tweets that violated Twitter rules. The screenshot announced a temporary freeze that prevented her from tweeting, retweeting or liking for 12 hours. Unlike a full suspension, this measure left her account visible. The message in the screenshot said the lock was in effect because Ms. McGowan’s account had “violated the Twitter rules.” By midmorning on Thursday, as the Twitter universe was in full steam about Ms. McGowan’s situation, the company moved to explain its actions. In a statement, a Twitter representative said Ms. McGowan’s tweets had violated the company’s privacy policy because one of them included a phone number. "
828,"Fashion has an addiction problem. I am not talking about illicit substances here, though the industry’s past issues with those have been well documented. Rather, I am talking about illicit … well, talk. Gossip. It seems unable to stop, and it is getting worse. In Paris last week there was more leaking going on in the maisons of Avenue Montaigne than in the Trump White House. Rumors were rampant on the front row and in the back rooms; during dinner parties and over cocktail canapés. This designer was leaving this brand. That designer was coming. This house was firing that guy. That creative director was wildly unhappy. The whispering went beyond the Kim Jones-to-Versace rumors, which may be true but are largely presented as fact. (Remember what happened to the last Versace fact, that Riccardo Tisci was taking the helm? Nothing!) It went beyond the knock-on speculation about what would happen at Louis Vuitton men’s wear if Mr. Jones left that label and who might be migrating there (though that was a big topic of discussion). It encompassed at least three other big brands that were maybe, possibly, it could happen, undergoing a change. Some of the talk made no sense at all. Some of it was plausible. None of it was officially denied or confirmed, which meant it continued to gain currency. I have never heard so much flagrant muckraking. I’d like to say this season was an anomaly, but actually I think this may be the new normal. It’s all hearsay, all — or most of — the time. And that is a problem not just for the brands and people involved — not just for the designers, executives and, perhaps more important, all the relatively unsung men and women who work in the ateliers and on the design teams — but also for the clothes we are all supposed to wear.

830,"A new talk-show host arrives on BET with a fresh perspective. And two shows with rabid fan bases return to the CW. THE RUNDOWN WITH ROBIN THEDE 11 p.m. on BET. Ms. Thede, formerly the head writer for “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore,” will dive into her own show on Thursday as the only black female talk-show host on the air. And there will be another distinction that separates her from the pack: “We’re not going to spend a half-hour telling you Trump is bad, because black people didn’t vote for him anyway,” she told The New York Times in an interview this week. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 8 p.m. on BBC America. Twenty-five years before his methodical, menacing turn on “Westworld,” Anthony Hopkins changed cinema by slipping into the role (and mask) of Hannibal Lecter in Jonathan Demme’s psycho-thriller. His seductive frostiness and overwhelming brilliance led the American Film Institute to name him the greatest villain of the century; his electric and terrifying tête-à-tête with Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) still induces shivers. GOTHAM 8 p.m. on Fox. The young Bruce Wayne of this Batman origin series continues to mature and embrace darker and more theatrical impulses. In this episode, Bruce (David Mazouz) seeks to uncover the meaning of a knife that seems to incite violence wherever it goes. Meanwhile, Ra’s al Ghul (Alexander Siddig) goes to extremes to achieve what he wants. ARROW 9 p.m. on the CW. Two shows with rabid fan bases return to the CW on Thursday night. Season 5 of “Arrow,” the ever soapy and explosive superhero series, ended with a literal bang: The Lian Yu island blew up, leaving the survival of almost every character (except for the protagonist, Oliver Queen, and his son) in doubt. The showrunners have teased that Thursday’s season premiere will take place five months after the explosion — and will feature the death of a major character. At 8, SUPERNATURAL returns for its 13th (count them!) season; it’s the network’s longest-running show, and a spinoff is in the works. The rugged Winchester brothers, who inspire fan conventions all over the world, will continue to battle demons — emotional and literal — after deaths in their family. I LOVE YOU, AMERICA on Hulu. Sarah Silverman threw herself into the 2016 election with brio and bite, campaigning for Bernie Sanders and then scolding his rabble-rousing supporters at the Democratic National Convention. (“You’re being ridiculous,” she said to jeers while onstage with Al Franken.) Her new series continues her pursuit of political and social issues, as she traipses across the country to talk with people who share and abhor her views. But this won’t be a complete about-face for the potty-mouthed comedian. “Anything heady or even trying to be intellectual is sandwiched in a very, very bready sandwich of aggressively stupid,” she told Jimmy Fallon about her new series.

831,"Owners of Wall Street banks are being taken for a Washington ride. The S. & P. 500 Bank Index has surged 12 percent since Sept. 8. That is not justified by the trajectory of earnings, as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results Thursday that were no better than steady. Tax cuts would support higher stocks, but they’re at best some way off. In the meantime, banks have other concerns. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo each trade around 50 percent above their book value. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are neck-and-neck at some 1.3 times book, while the laggards Bank of America and Citigroup trade at par. Using the rule of thumb that big banks need to deliver 10 percent returns for their shareholders, JPMorgan Chase’s valuation means it ought soon to be cranking out a 15 percent return on book equity. Yet the bank run by Jamie Dimon will hit a return on equity of only 13.6 percent by 2020, according to estimates collated by Thomson Reuters. Across the first three quarters of 2017, it managed only an annualized 11 percent. If President Trump and Republicans in Congress succeed in cutting corporate tax rates to, say, 25 percent from the current 35 percent headline rate, that could, in theory, improve any taxpaying American company’s net profit by 15 percent — turning JPMorgan Chase’s sub-14 percent return into one above 15 percent. It’s a similar story at Citigroup. A return on equity of just over 7 percent so far this year, increasing to an estimated 8.7 percent in 2020, could get near 10 percent with lower taxes. The trouble is, that wouldn’t just require difficult tax legislation. It also needs banks to dodge problems elsewhere. Sluggish loan growth is one. That’s especially true for large banks, where lending has grown just 1 percent this year, compared with 6 percent at smaller banks, according to the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan managed a 3 percent increase in the year to September — though core loans grew faster. Citigroup’s loan book expanded by 2 percent. Loan defaults are rising, too. Citigroup has already warned of higher losses in its United States credit-card unit. Even share buybacks, which reduce book equity and share count, thus increasing return on equity and earnings per share, offer less bang for the buck: bank stocks are over a third more expensive than on the eve of the election last November. There may be no obvious calamity ahead. But there are enough obstacles to slow American bank bulls down. "
832,"On just the first day of a war between the United States and North Korea, according to a Stanford University assessment, one million people could be killed. Yet after my five-day visit to North Korea with three New York Times colleagues, such a nuclear war seems terrifyingly imaginable. In the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, it was clear that President Trump’s threat to “totally destroy” North Korea had backfired and is being exploited by Kim Jong-un for his own propaganda and military mobilization. The country has seized on Trump’s words to reinforce its official narrative that its nuclear arsenal is defensive, meant to protect Koreans from bullying American imperialists. And North Korean officials use Trump’s bombast as an excuse for their own. “The American Trump uttered nonsense about demolishing our country,” a military officer, Lt. Col. Hwang Myong-jin, told me. “So as soon as our supreme leader gives us an order, we will turn the entire country of the U.S. into fire.” One typical propaganda image shows a powerful North Korean soldier stepping on the face of an evil-looking blond American soldier and reads, “Death to invaders.” Kim doesn’t want to appear weak and seem as if he is caving to American pressure, and officials in North Korea repeatedly cited Trump’s threats to justify their military mobilization and their reluctance to engage in dialogue or conciliation. "
833,"Don’t say that we weren’t warned. In a September 2015 speech before the National Press Club in Washington, the Louisiana governor and Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal said: “Donald Trump is dangerous. But not in the way you think. Many people think he’s dangerous. They say, ‘Well, you wouldn’t want somebody like that with such a hot head with his fingers on the nuclear codes.’ And yeah, that’s certainly true. That’s not the real danger. The real danger is that ironically Donald Trump could destroy America’s chance to be great again.” During the second Republican presidential debate that same month, the CNN anchor Jake Tapper referred to Jindal’s concern about Trump and the nuclear codes, and asked Carly Fiorina, “Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump’s finger on the nuclear codes?” Fiorina hemmed and hawed, deflected and redirected, doing anything not to say what everyone knew — that Trump with the nuclear codes was a horrible idea. Jeb Bush also cowered when the question was put to him. But Rand Paul was forthright and forceful, saying: “I think really there’s a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. I’m very concerned about him, having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his visceral response to attack people on their appearance — short, tall, fat, ugly — my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?” During a December 2015 Republican debate, Dana Bash, the CNN anchor, referred to a statement Ted Cruz made on the campaign trail about his actual beliefs about Trump and nuclear weapons, saying, “Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to attack Mr. Trump in public.” She continued, “But you did question his judgment in having control of America’s nuclear arsenal during a private meeting with supporters.” Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign, in a foreign policy speech in June 2016, “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.” "
834,"Thanks to Ivana Trump’s new memoir, we now know that Donald Trump once did have a dog. Well, actually it was Ivana’s. A poodle named Chappy. And Donald didn’t like him. Nevertheless, this appears to be the closest our current president ever came to having a pet, so attention must be paid. This is possibly the biggest insight in “Raising Trump,” by Donald’s first ex-wife. (We are not going to go into her contention that people who have been married more than 10 years seldom have sex more than “a few times a month.”) I’m sort of presuming that you’re not going to read it, despite the fact that it includes several recipes. So let me summarize. The book is supposed to be about good parenting. But the most important thing you learn is that we can never say another mean thing about Donald Jr. again. Really, it sounds like the worst childhood ever. His story begins with Dad resisting the idea of naming the baby after him, in case his first born turned out to be “a loser.” As a toddler, Don Jr. broke his leg due to a negligent babysitter. Then one day when Ivana was out of town, he and Eric called hysterically to report they had found their nanny unconscious in the basement. (She died.) Wait, there’s more: During their infamous divorce, Dad sent a bodyguard from his office to get Junior, announcing: “You’re not getting him back. I’m going to bring him up myself.” "
835,"“You can’t get sick now” in Puerto Rico, Lisandra Figueroa told The New York Times after her father died last week when breakdowns in supplies and transportation deprived him of bottled oxygen. Three weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, scarce medical supplies, equipment and power mean illnesses easily treated under normal conditions now can be a death sentence in remote areas. Puerto Ricans who suffered injuries in the storm, who contracted infections from polluted floodwaters or drinking water, or who have chronic conditions requiring continuous care are not receiving help, and are dying. The humanitarian crisis affecting 3.4 million American citizens will not be helped by the administration’s allowing the expiration this week of a waiver of the Jones Act, which prohibits foreign-flagged or foreign-built ships from carrying goods from the mainland to the island commonwealth. (And it doesn’t help that on Thursday, President Trump threatened to withdraw FEMA and first responders from the island, in one of several cruel, misguided gestures he has already made.) While President Trump, since touching down for a photo op in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, has been focused on his usual schedule of tweets, insults and golf, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been hauling away tons of debris and contending with power and communications problems in their effort to deliver water, food and tarps for tens of thousands of homes without roofs. But residents’ needs have exceeded what the government has provided, and aid organizations have been forced to become ever more creative in filling the gap, delivering items like generators and medical supplies to the island, particularly its stricken interior. Securing the goods is the easy part. Delivering them to port, warehousing them and trucking them to people in need are the battles that will determine the outcome of the war. Some of the biggest humanitarian organizations arrange their own logistics. But most organizations must buy those services, and after large-scale disasters even the largest groups must scramble to supplement their networks. Delivery logistics consumes 60 to 80 cents of every aid dollar contributed, aid groups say, even without the headaches involved in actually finding and scheduling reliable transportation to disaster-stricken areas where communications are down and roads destroyed. "
836,"Read the latest details on the freeing of this couple here. WASHINGTON — An American woman and her Canadian husband who were held hostage by militants in Afghanistan for five years have been freed along with their young children, President Trump said on Thursday, ending a case that has long frustrated diplomats and F.B.I. agents trying to secure their release. Pakistan’s military said that “through an intelligence-based operation,” it took custody on Wednesday of the hostages from the Haqqani network, the Taliban faction that had seized Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her husband, Josh Boyle, 34, in 2012. The Pakistani military pledged to repatriate them, and American intelligence agencies were tracking the hostages as they crossed into the rugged tribal areas of northwest Pakistan. The Trump administration and the Pakistani government worked together to free them, Mr. Trump said, but a senior American official said Pakistan’s intelligence service arranged the handover of the family after being pressured by American officials. It was not clear what, if any, concessions were made to the Haqqani network to ensure the family’s release. “This is a positive moment for our country’s relationship with Pakistan,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “The Pakistani government’s cooperation is a sign that it is honoring America’s wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region. We hope to see this type of cooperation and teamwork in helping secure the release of remaining hostages and in our future joint counterterrorism operations.” The pair was kidnapped in October 2012 while backpacking in Wardak Province, a militant stronghold near Kabul. At the time of her abduction, Ms. Coleman, who is from Pennsylvania, was pregnant, and later gave birth. She had two more children in captivity, adding pressure to resolve an already desperate situation. American officials were exploring ways to get the family out of South Asia, with Mr. Boyle possibly headed to Canada and his wife and children back to the United States. "

839,"WASHINGTON — The White House inflated the potential benefits to workers from a proposed corporate tax cut, according to a Harvard University economist whose work informed the estimate, highlighting a challenge Republicans face as they push a tax rewrite that President Trump has promised will benefit the middle class. Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers said in a report released on Monday that reducing corporate taxes could raise average household incomes by as much as $9,000 a year. The top end of that estimate was based on work by a trio of researchers, and on Tuesday one of them, Mihir Desai of Harvard, said Mr. Trump’s team had misread the research. The actual income gain implied by his study, he estimated, would be $800. Mr. Trump’s economic team disagreed — saying Mr. Desai had erred in interpreting his own paper. The distinction could prove critical in the public reception to the Republican plan, which bets heavily on the notion that the best way to raise pay for American workers is to cut taxes on their employers. The Republican proposal, which still lacks key details, thus far includes what analysts project will be only modest reductions in income taxes for many middle-class Americans. But it reduces the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a move that Mr. Trump and Republican leaders say will spark faster economic growth and higher profits. Their theory is that companies will pass those winnings on to workers by raising their pay. That claim has already run into opposition from many economists, particularly liberal-leaning ones. It could prove a difficult sell politically, at a time when corporate profits are near record highs and polling suggests Americans are skeptical that the Republican plan will help average workers. “They are facing a lot of headwinds” in selling the plan, because Americans will not see it as a boon to the middle class, said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the liberal opposition research group American Bridge, which is gearing up to oppose the Republican plan. “This plan is vulnerable, based on that landscape.” "
840,"WASHINGTON — Four days after his son died in Afghanistan, John F. Kelly, then a Marine Corps general, eulogized two Marines killed by a truck bomb in Iraq. He made only a fleeting, oblique reference to his son Second Lt. Robert Kelly as he paid tribute to the two other fallen service members who held their ground for six seconds as a truck bore down on them. Now Mr. Kelly is President Trump’s chief of staff, and the commander in chief is testing his aide’s long-held reluctance to discuss his loss. Mr. Trump, in defending his handling of the deaths of four Green Berets in Niger, falsely claimed on Monday that President Barack Obama did not contact the families of fallen troops. And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump brought to light that Mr. Obama never called Mr. Kelly after the death of his son. Such phone calls are not routine, especially when the rate of combat-related fatalities is high, as was the case in 2010, when Lieutenant Kelly was killed after stepping on a land mine while leading a platoon in Afghanistan. But Mr. Kelly is the highest-ranking American military officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. Mr. Trump called the families of the soldiers killed in Niger, the White House said Tuesday, and the president has said that he would try to call as many families of American troops killed on his watch “when it’s appropriate.” “You could ask General Kelly, ‘Did he get a call from Obama?’” Mr. Trump said in an interview on Tuesday on Fox News Radio. “I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy. I can tell you my policy is I called every one of them.” A spokesman for Mr. Obama declined to comment. But Mr. Trump’s remarks have drawn angry rebukes from allies of the former president because his claims about Mr. Obama are false — he called or met with relatives of multiple fallen service members. Former military commanders, for their part, said Mr. Trump was politicizing one of the saddest and most sacred duties of the presidency. "
841,"WASHINGTON — When President Trump took office in January, the Islamic State controlled about 23,300 square miles of territory across Iraq and Syria. Now, as an American-backed militia declared on Tuesday that it had liberated Raqqa, Syria, the capital of the extremists’ self-proclaimed caliphate, the Islamic State’s territory has dwindled to no more than 9,300 square miles. For months, Mr. Trump has demanded credit for a stepped-up military campaign that has weakened the Islamic State, claiming repeatedly that he has done “far more against ISIS in nine months” than President Barack Obama did during his entire administration. Yet experts said it was always anticipated that the three-year war against the Islamic State that was started by Mr. Obama in 2014 would reach this point, and military officials are quick to praise local troops and fighters for battleground victories. “Just by looking at the map, the losses this year are off the scale compared to previous years,” said Columb Strack, an analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, which has been tracking the territory that the Islamic State has surrendered. But, he added, “I haven’t seen any major differences in the U.S. approach against the Islamic State.” "

For the six participants in a NASA-funded behavioral research study that simulates a trip to Mars, the hope is that the sacrifices they endure benefit the greater good. The eight-month project, named HI-SEAs (for Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation), places these scientists in isolation on Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii, a location chosen for its Mars-like conditions. There, strict restrictions cut them off from the rest of Earth’s comforts and connections. Through a continuing series of 360 videos, The Times is covering the research mission. Our Text to Text series pairs often-taught literary, historical, scientific and cultural pieces with articles from The New York Times. In this one we match an excerpt from Ray Bradbury’s 1954 short story, ""All Summer in a Day,” which explores the potential sacrifices required to live on Venus, with the “Life on Mars” series. _________ Traveling to another planet was once only imaginable in the realm of science fiction. Today, scientists are pursuing this as a real possibility, perhaps even by 2024. Will life on Mars be a reality for this generation, or the next? What might be gained from this exploration? What must be given up? Currently the HI-SEAS mission seeks answers to these questions — some of the same asked through Ray Bradbury’s short story in 1954. The Times 360 videos show that “home” for the HI-SEAS participants is a 1,200-square-foot structure called “the habitat.” Any time one of them wants to venture into the outdoors, they must first don a full-body spacesuit. Communication with outside colleagues, friends and family is restricted to email with a built-in 20-minute delay that mirrors the length of time it would take for transmissions to pass between Mars and Earth. How will the participants handle the extreme isolation of the simulation? Data gathered from the experiemtn will inform how astronauts will be selected for long-duration space travel in the future. Bradbury’s short story was written at a time when space exploration was gaining significant momentum, as the Cold War raged and the space race between the Soviet Union and the U.S. picked up speed. Just 15 years after “All Summer in a Day” was published, the 1969 Apollo 11 mission succeeded in sending the first humans to the moon. "
843,"A broad coalition of law enforcement officials and activists is expected to urge President Trump on Wednesday to adjust policies on policing and criminality, the first time such a group has spoken out against the Trump administration. Some of the nation’s most prominent prosecutors, police chiefs and criminal justice overhaul advocates — including Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, as well as representatives from the conservative Koch brothers network — will gather in Washington for the National Law Enforcement Summit. The former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. and Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general whom Mr. Trump abruptly fired in the first few days of his presidency, will speak. They and other presenters are expected to pose the challenge to Mr. Trump, who ran in 2016 as a “law and order” candidate but whose attorney general’s policies — as well as Mr. Trump’s own messaging — have come under increasing criticism from local law enforcement officials. In his inaugural address, he described a raging “American carnage” that he vowed to halt — a turn of phrase that rankled local officials who have prided themselves on crime reduction. Mr. Trump has frequently cited his support for police officers, and he has surrounded himself with local law enforcement officials at any opportunity. His attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has pursued an aggressive approach to crime in major cities. Without citing evidence, Mr. Sessions has claimed that changes imposed by the Obama administration that sought a reduction in mandatory minimum sentences for some drug prosecutions had led to a large increase in crime. Members of the coalition plan to urge Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions to reverse the current course the Department of Justice has taken. "

But, after a meeting Tuesday with union representatives and players, the league did promise to help support some of the causes targeted by the protesting players, including reform of the criminal justice system. The decision was faulted by President Trump on Wednesday morning. Trump, who has on several occasions criticized players who do not stand for the anthem, said on Twitter: “The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!” The owners’ decision to not toughen the league’s stance on anthem demonstrations showed yet again the contortions they have been going through to display support for their players while wrestling with the political fallout of the sideline protests that have persisted since last season. The players, largely on social media, had made clear they would not abide penalties for sitting or kneeling during the pregame anthem, while legal experts wondered if any punitive change would hold up in court. The gestures began last season, spurred by Colin Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, to draw attention to racial oppression and police brutality against black Americans. "

846,"It is unclear what possessed Woody Allen, of all people, to comment on the accusations of sexual predation against Harvey Weinstein, when he could have just not said anything, not expressed sympathy for an alleged serial rapist, not accused long-silenced women who said they were sexually assaulted of contributing to “a witch hunt atmosphere” and not felt compelled to issue a pouty follow-up statement in which he didn’t apologize but, in fact, reiterated how “sad” he feels for Weinstein because Weinstein is “sick.” I’m kidding! It’s totally clear why Allen would issue such a statement — why he wouldn’t hesitate to include the astonishing confession that “no one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” implying that people did tell him about Weinstein but he, with that odd omniscience native to the very rich, deemed them insufficiently serious. It’s also totally clear why Allen felt untouchable enough to add that even if he had believed the “horror stories,” he wouldn’t have been interested, let alone concerned, because he is a serious man busy making serious man-art. He said people wouldn’t bother coming to him anyway, because, as he described it: “You’re not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie.” (That last bit is fair, actually. If I’d been sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein, literally my last instinct would be to go to Woody Allen for help.) It’s clear because the cultural malfunction that allows Allen to feel comfortable issuing that statement is the same malfunction that gave us Allen and Weinstein in the first place: the smothering, delusional, galactic entitlement of powerful men. When Allen and other men warn of “a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere” what they mean is an atmosphere in which they’re expected to comport themselves with the care, consideration and fear of consequences that the rest of us call basic professionalism and respect for shared humanity. On some level, to some men — and you can call me a hysteric but I am done mincing words on this — there is no injustice quite so unnaturally, viscerally grotesque as a white man being fired. Donald Trump, our predator in chief, seems to view the election of Barack Obama as a white man being fired. He and his supporters are willing to burn the world in revenge. This whole catastrophic cultural moment was born of that same entitlement, of Trump’s paws and Weinstein’s unbelted bathrobe, of the ancient cycles of abuse that ghostwrote the Trump campaign’s real slogan: If I can’t have you, no one will. "
847,"President Trump has made a habit of filling important jobs with people dedicated to undermining the laws they’re supposed to administer while pampering the industries they’re supposed to regulate. His nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency’s top clean air post, William Wehrum, is a retread from the George W. Bush administration with a deep doctrinal dislike of clean air regulations. His choice to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality is borderline comical: Kathleen Hartnett White, a former Texas official who believes that the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is harmless. Yet no nomination has been as brazen, as dangerous to public health and as deserving of Senate rejection as that of Michael Dourson to run the E.P.A. office in charge of reviewing chemicals used in agriculture, industry and household products. Mr. Dourson is a scientist for hire. A toxicologist and a professor at the University of Cincinnati, he has a long history of consulting for chemical companies and conducting studies paid for with industry money. He frequently decided that the compounds he was evaluating were safe at exposure levels that are far more dangerous to public health than levels recommended by the E.P.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. His nomination is enthusiastically endorsed by the chemical industry. It horrifies environmental groups, public health advocates, firefighters and scientists and has inspired many letters in opposition to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which may vote as early as Wednesday. Among the chemicals that received a favorable nod from Mr. Dourson is 1,4-dioxane, which is used by paint and coating manufacturers and is also found in shampoos and other personal care products. His analysis recommended a safe level that was 1,000 times higher than the E.P.A.’s recommended level; the agency considers the chemical “a likely carcinogen.” Another is PFOA, a chemical used by DuPont to make nonstick surfaces. The compound has been linked to cancers, thyroid diseases and other health problems. Working for West Virginia on the recommendation of DuPont, Mr. Dourson in 2002 helped establish a safety threshold of 150 parts per billion for PFOA in drinking water. That is substantially higher than the standard of 1 part per billion that DuPont’s own scientists had recommended more than a decade earlier, and higher still than the health advisory level of 0.07 parts per billion set by the E.P.A. last year. More broadly troubling is that Mr. Dourson, if approved, will set back an arduous, yearslong effort to improve the regulation of chemicals. Last year, after many false starts, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that updated the Toxic Substances Control Act, a 1976 law that had made it very hard for regulators to ban or regulate chemicals by requiring the E.P.A. to meet a very high burden of proof before taking action. The law also made it easy for companies to keep data about their products hidden from the public by claiming the information was a “trade secret.” The new law simplified the task by streamlining it, directing the E.P.A. to review at least 20 substances at a time, giving priority to the riskiest chemicals. The money to do this work will come from up to $25 million in annual fees paid by chemical manufacturers and processors. "
848,"The leader of United Nations’ peacekeeping operations offered a dire appraisal of South Sudan on Tuesday, saying the world’s youngest nation is sliding further into mayhem with no sign that its antagonists want peace. In a report to the United Nations Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the under secretary general of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, called upon the leaders of South Sudan’s warring factions to “bring the country back from the impending abyss.” Mr. Lacroix said that a diplomatic effort by eight African nations to revitalize a 2015 peace agreement in South Sudan had received only a “lukewarm response” from the government of President Salva Kiir, and that Mr. Kiir’s political adversaries also remained cautious about it. Despite the presence of 17,000 United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan, Mr. Lacroix said that security had deteriorated and that armed clashes, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and other rights abuses had increased in much of the country. His report came a week before the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, is scheduled to visit South Sudan to press for a solution to the four-year-old civil war, which has left tens of thousands dead and has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. More than two million people have fled South Sudan and nearly two million have been displaced, totaling a third of the country’s population. United Nations relief officials have said extreme hunger threatens half the country. At least 200,000 South Sudanese are sheltering at United Nations peacekeeping bases. Ms. Haley, who will be the highest-ranking Trump administration official to travel to Africa, said last month that the eight-nation African diplomatic effort, known as the High Level Revitalization Forum, was “the last chance at salvaging the peace agreement in South Sudan.” She also pledged to the South Sudanese people in a Twitter posting that “we look forward to delivering the message in person very soon that we have not given up on them and have not forgotten them.” The United States is a leading aid provider to South Sudan and was a strong supporter of its independence from neighboring Sudan in 2011. Optimism about South Sudan’s prospects faded within a few years when an ethnic civil war erupted between forces loyal to President Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, and his former vice president, Riek Machar, a Nuer. Mr. Machar now lives in exile in South Africa. "
849,"Many of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party, led by Bernie Sanders, are advocating wealth redistribution through higher taxes and Medicare for all, and demonizing banks and Wall Street. Memories in politics are short, but those policies are vastly different from the program of the party’s traditional center-left coalition. Under Bill Clinton, that coalition balanced the budget, acknowledged the limits of government and protected the essential programs that make up the social safety net. President Clinton did this, in part, by moving the party away from a reflexive anti-Wall Street posture. It’s not popular to say so today, but there are still compelling reasons Democrats should strengthen ties to Wall Street. As the party has left behind that version of liberalism, it has also found its way to its weakest electoral position — nationally and at the state level — since the 1920s. Hillary Clinton’s lurch to the left probably cost her key Midwestern states that Barack Obama had won twice and led to the election of Donald Trump. After the 2016 election, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, warned that the party’s “broad anti-business rhetoric” distracts its leaders from making growth the goal and “manages to scare off entrepreneurs and small businesses, too.” Democrats should keep ties with Wall Street for several reasons. The first is an ugly fact of politics: money. Maintaining ties to Wall Street makes economic sense for Democrats and keeps their coffers full. "
850,"Toward the end of the Obama administration, the Justice Department called on judges to end the cash-register system of justice that had taken root across the country. In what is a clearly unconstitutional practice, people in localities nationwide were being sent to jail solely because they were too poor to pay the fines and fees that municipalities increasingly rely on for revenue. Some states heeded the advice, and progress was made. Now, a report from the United States Commission on Civil Rights shows what the Trump Justice Department needs to do to keep the momentum up for reform. The Obama administration brought this issue out into the open in 2015 during its investigation of policing in the racially troubled city of Ferguson, Mo., which exploded in violence in 2014 after a police officer shot and killed a black teenager named Michael Brown. Investigators found that the city’s policing tactics were both discriminatory and driven by a city budget that relied heavily on fines and fees associated with minor violations. In a quest for revenue, Ferguson officers trapped poor and minority citizens in a Kafka-esque cycle that began with fines they could not pay and led to crippling financial penalties, revoked driver’s licenses, jail time, lost jobs and ruined lives. The investigation showed that municipalities had essentially recreated debtor prisons, violating the Constitution by punishing people for being poor. Last year, the Justice Department followed up its Ferguson report with a letter asking court systems nationwide to be vigilant against similar policies. It explained that the courts had an obligation to ask people about their ability to pay before jailing them for nonpayment and were also bound to consider alternatives like community service or extended payment plans. The department also awarded grants to state courts in five states to help develop new approaches to fine and fee enforcement. According to the Civil Rights Commission report, Texas will use some of its grant for an automated system that judges can use to determine inability to pay. Beyond that, a national task force financed by the Justice Department created a blueprint for state reforms, with model laws and ideas about how to prevent local governments and traffic courts from lapsing into unconstitutional practices. Some judges have been outspoken about unfair use of fines. Last year, for example, the chief justice of Arizona issued an administrative order authorizing judges to mitigate mandatory fines and fees if the amount imposed an economic hardship and advised a state task force to take other steps. The chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court went further this year, admonishing politicians for treating the courts like “A.T.M.s,” and pointing out, “No one in America should be sent to jail — or threatened with jail — solely because they are poor.” Unfortunately, most states have done little or nothing to reform justice systems that clearly violate the Constitution. Judges need to keep pressing this point — and the Justice Department has an obligation to help them. "
851,"Well, it took almost a year, but we now have the “Trump Doctrine.” It’s very simple. And, as you’d expect, it fits neatly into a tweet. On nearly every major issue, President Trump’s position is: “Obama built it. I broke it. You fix it.” And that cuts right to the core of what is the most frightening thing about the Trump presidency. It’s not the president’s juvenile tweeting or all the aides who’ve been pushed out of his clown car at high speed or his industrial-strength lying. It’s Trump’s willingness to unravel so many longstanding policies and institutions at once — from Nafta to Obamacare to the global climate accord to the domestic clean power initiative to the Pacific trade deal to the Iran nuclear deal — without any real preparation either on the day before or for the morning after. Indeed, Trump has made most of his climate, health, energy and economic decisions without consulting any scientists, without inviting into the White House a broad range of experts, without putting forth his own clear-cut alternatives to the systems he’s unraveling, without having at the ready a team of aides or a political coalition able to implement any alternatives and without a strategic framework that connects all of his dots. In short, we’re simply supposed to take the president’s word that this or that deal “is the worst deal ever” — backed up by no serious argument or plan about how he will produce a better one. I’m open to improving any of these accords or institutions. I’m even open to the possibility that by just tipping over all these accords at once, and throwing away his steering wheel, Trump will get people to improve the Iran deal or Obamacare out of sheer panic at the chaos that might ensue if they don’t. "
852,"Richard B. Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, is scheduled to speak at the University of Florida on Thursday, prompting an outcry over whether his views are protected speech, dividing the campus and putting law enforcement officials on high alert. The university denied Mr. Spencer’s original request to speak on Sept. 12, citing the violent clashes in August between far-right demonstrators and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., as well as threats on social media of a “blood bath” if the speech were allowed. But the university has since relented. On Monday, reacting to Mr. Spencer’s coming appearance, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in Alachua County in North Florida, where the university is. The order helps coordinate law enforcement from various jurisdictions. The governor also activated the National Guard, so it can be called if necessary. The University of Florida president, Kent Fuchs, posted a YouTube message denouncing Mr. Spencer’s “message of hate and racism,” and urging students to stay away from his event and deprive Mr. Spencer of the attention he seeks. Far-right rallies and the counterprotests they engender on the left have become a vexing problem for universities, especially public ones, which are struggling to balance their mission of promoting free speech and the exchange of ideas with their responsibility to keep students safe. "
853,"WASHINGTON — Until Tuesday, the North American Free Trade Agreement looked like it might be headed for a quick demise. Now, it could be headed for a slow, painful one. The United States, Canada and Mexico said on Tuesday that they would extend Nafta negotiations into next year, with the parties citing “significant conceptual gaps” in how to rewrite the 1994 trade pact. Negotiators, struggling to find agreement on some of the thorniest provisions of the trade deal, will take an extended break to consult with politicians and interest groups before convening again in Mexico City for the fifth round of talks in mid-November. The trade talks, which were supposed to wrap up by year-end, have now been extended into the first quarter of 2018, the parties said. The extension signals the potential demise of a trade pact that, while critical to North American commerce, has come under withering criticism from the Trump administration as a bad deal for American workers. The three countries, which will meet again on Nov. 17, have been unable to reach agreement on a range of issues, including what percentage of a product should be made in the United States and whether the trade pact should expire every five years. Finding agreement on the outstanding provisions will get even trickier in the coming months, as negotiations collide with political events in all three countries that will only harden each nation’s stance. The Mexican presidential race will begin in earnest leading up to a July 1 election, raising the risk that President Trump’s proposals for revising Nafta will become a sensitive topic that Mexican candidates will shy away from supporting. "
854,"Changes loom near remote Dinosaur National Monument in Utah. It’s a rough region of 1,000-foot cliffs and canyons, two wild rivers — the Green and the Yampa — ancient rock art and archaeological evidence of 10,000 years of human history. The park, which straddles the Utah-Colorado border, affords visitors backcountry camping, white-water rafting and, most famously, spectacular dinosaur fossils. The Bureau of Land Management has announced that in December it will auction gas and oil drilling rights on 94,000 acres, or 146 square miles, of land, some of it near the park’s entrance road. Pumpjacks, drill rigs and other equipment would be visible from the park’s visitor center, which is 2.5 miles from one lease parcel, according to critics. The B.L.M. has said that equipment would not intrude on the average visitor’s field of view. The agency said it would take steps to minimize visibility, including light shields, noise mufflers and “placement of exhaust systems to direct noise away from noise sensitive areas” and “avoiding unnecessary flaring of gas.” Ozone pollution from such energy development already exceeds federal Clean Air Act limits in the monument area. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican who supports fossil fuel development on public lands, initially said he worried that the new leases would bring eyesores too close to the park. “The state wishes to ensure leasing of these parcels does not impact visual resources or cause light or sound disturbances,” he said in comments submitted to the B.L.M. in July. The monument’s National Park Service administrators have also expressed concern about dust, night lights, air and water pollution and threats to endangered species. The 330-square-mile, high-desert park is visited by about 300,000 people a year. It was designated a national monument by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915, using powers granted him under the Antiquities Act of 1906. "
855,"WASHINGTON — One after another, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to provide information. And again and again in nearly five hours of testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions refused. The lawmakers asked for more details about his conversations with President Trump before he fired James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff in Arizona. They wanted to know what the two had discussed about Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and possible links to Mr. Trump. The senators also asked about topics not involving the president, like whether Mr. Sessions had conversations with the attorney general of Texas about an immigration program the state had threatened to sue over, and whether any evidence supported Mr. Trump’s claim that the Cuban government was behind sonic attacks on American diplomats. “I’m just not able to comment,” Mr. Sessions said. Mr. Sessions’s demurrals — and Democratic anger over them — were a recurring theme during his first appearance before the panel for an oversight hearing in the eight months since he became the nation’s top law enforcement officer. The attorney general had testified in June before the Senate Intelligence Committee and refused then as well to answer questions about his conversations with Mr. Trump, saying they were potentially subject to an assertion of executive privilege by the president. The privilege provides a legal basis to avoid answering questions. Bracing for more of the same, Democrats had sent Mr. Sessions a letter last week arguing that he would not have a legal basis to continue to refuse to answer unless Mr. Trump invoked the privilege. They demanded that Mr. Trump do so, or that Mr. Sessions be prepared to answer. But from his opening statement, Mr. Sessions made clear that he would frustrate their ambitions. "
856,"Down the street from my home in Bangkok, next to a tailor and a nail salon, sits a peculiar outpost of the North Korean state. Inside the Pyongyang Okryu restaurant, five tall, pale waitresses float among the tables in sparkly dresses and carefully cultivated smiles. “Are they really North Korean?” my wide-eyed young son asked, a bit too loudly, on a recent visit. He’d been reading about the country’s isolation and the fusillade of insults and threats exchanged by President Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader. A waitress overheard him and nodded, but her blank smile — a rictus of nonrevelation — never wavered. This is one of the smallest, but in some ways most visible, tentacles of a secretive global-trade network that sustains the North Korean regime and its hereditary dynasty. Despite the tightening of international sanctions meant to brake the country’s development of nuclear weapons, North Korea generates about a billion dollars in invisible income every year by selling everything from arms and coal to seafood and textiles — and the labor of exported workers. For a regime denied access to international financial institutions, the foreign cash is crucial to offset deficits, buy loyalty and luxury items and acquire components for Kim’s nuclear arsenal. “North Korea needs hard currency for nearly everything,” says Go Myong-hyun, a researcher with the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. “And the only way to get it is through foreign trade.” In Bangkok, kitsch is on the menu as well as kimchi: On an earlier visit, the hostesses — indentured servants chosen from the most loyal of Pyongyang families — urged me to spend nearly $10,000 on a gaudy tapestry depicting Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea. (I declined.) Tonight, as we ate beef belly barbecue and spicy cold Pyongyang noodles, the waitresses disappeared at one point to get ready for the nightly musical show. It was sobering to know that the profits that night and up to 90 percent of the workers’ salaries would be sent home as “loyalty payments” to Kim Jong-un himself. The West can’t seem to shake the image of North Korea as the Hermit Kingdom. Diplomatically and culturally, the place is indeed isolated, and its state ideology of juche, or self-reliance, reinforces the feeling that North Korea is going it alone. But the country is not cut off economically, at least not yet. Over the past decade, as the Kims père and fils pursued their nuclear program, North Korea’s external trade boomed, more than doubling in volume. Economists believe that the country’s trade dependency has risen to higher than 50 percent, just shy of the global average. Nor is North Korea as ossified as outsiders might imagine. Kim still wields the instruments of totalitarian power, but he has relaxed the state’s grip on the economy, allowing officials and ordinary citizens greater autonomy to make money and engage in trade, so long as a chunk of the profits flows to Kim’s inner circle. As a result, the North Korean economy grew 3.9 percent last year. Food prices have stabilized. Mobile phones have proliferated. And construction cranes now dot Pyongyang’s rising skyline. “North Korea is no longer a communist country,” says Justin Hastings, the author of the book “A Most Enterprising Country.” “Every state entity has been deputized to make money.” "
857,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: “In my view, this agreement avoids chaos, and I don’t know a Democrat or a Republican who benefits from chaos.” That’s Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican, summing up a deal he reached with Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, to try to stabilize health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. President Trump indicated support for the plan, which would fund subsidies to insurers for two years. Separately, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is testifying at 10 a.m. Eastern today before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Here’s what to expect from the hearing, which we’ll cover live. And the president’s third attempt to block travelers from several countries — most of them predominantly Muslim — was blocked on Tuesday just hours before it was to take effect. “We have hot soup, we have bread: Come out and surrender,” one of the fighters said on a loudspeaker. “The ISIS members and their families who surrendered to us are safe.” "
858,"Thirteen years ago, in the midst of a different Republican administration, the liberal book of the moment was Thomas Frank’s “What’s the Matter With Kansas?” In answering his title’s question, Frank argued that hardworking heartland Americans were being duped by a Republican Party that whipped up culture-war frenzy to disguise its plutocratic aims. Middle-class and working-class Republican voters, he insisted, were voting against their own economic self-interest and getting worse than nothing in return. At the time, Frank’s analysis had two flaws. First, it minimized the importance of social issues, both their inherent moral stakes and their role in shaping the ecology of everyday life, of work and family and community. You don’t have to be a dupe to be a “values voter” of one sort or another: Whether you live in Topeka or Manhattan, you just have to believe that some moral questions are more important than where to set the top tax rate. Second, Frank minimized the extent to which Republicans, in the Bush era and before, did make a concerted effort to deliver for the middle class. The modern G.O.P. was certainly solicitous of the interests of wealthy donors and corporations and always eager for an upper-bracket tax cut. But as Henry Olsen points out in his recent book “The Working Class Republican,” Ronald Reagan also accepted the New Deal settlement and sought to balance his donor base’s interests with his voters’ pocketbook concerns — and George W. Bush did likewise. Yes, the Republican in the White House while Frank was writing his jeremiad was the president of dividend tax cuts and a lower top rate. But Bush was also the president of Medicare Part D, No Child Left Behind, a big homeownership push and a larger child tax credit and lower rates for almost everyone, not just the upper class. So Frank was wrong … or maybe he was prescient. Because he was writing just before Bush won re-election to a second term without a clear middle-class agenda, which led to the unpopular pushes for Social Security reform and an immigration amnesty and to the collapse of Bush’s political position. Then after Obama’s election the G.O.P. lurched away from the middle class in a more stark way than it ever did under Reagan or Bush or the Newt Gingrich speakership, embracing theories about how the working class was actually undertaxed, rallying around tax plans that seemed to threaten middle-class tax increases and promoting an Ayn Randian vision in which heroic entrepreneurs were the only economic actor worth defending. The success of Donald Trump’s populist candidacy seemed like a partial repudiation of this Randian turn, and a possible return to the middle-class-focused politics that had made Reagan and Bush successful — albeit in a more aggressively nationalist and mercantilist form. But as president, Trump has essentially become the Frankian caricature in full, draping the rhetoric of populism over an agenda that so far offers little or nothing to the middle class, making appeals to the religious right that are notable in their cynicism, and rallying his base through culture-war controversies distinguished mostly by their ginned-up phoniness. "
859,"The defendant was elsewhere, stirring and twittering in his new city, his name rarely spoken — just the title sufficed — but always top of mind inside an overstuffed Manhattan courtroom. “The president” is a businessman, the plaintiffs’ lawyer reminded the judge. “The president” refuses to leave the marketplace. This is hardly a fair fight, the logic goes, for those who are not “the president.” “I want to address the government’s view,” said the lawyer, Deepak Gupta, “that the president is above the law.” Such was the civic exercise on Wednesday — part liberal catharsis theater, part constitutional drama of the highest order — aimed at answering a simple question: Is a sitting president, disinclined to relinquish his gilded empire, violating the Constitution by continuing to own and profit from his businesses? The proceedings were the most prominent turn yet in a nearly yearlong legal effort to shine a light on President Trump’s business ties and press him to divest. At issue is a lawsuit filed this year in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by a legal watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. The group argues that Mr. Trump is violating a constitutional provision that a president may not accept any economic benefit from foreign governments or the United States government beyond a salary. Other plaintiffs in the case include a group representing restaurants, the owner of a hotel business in New York and a woman who books hotel events in Washington. The hearing concerned the government’s effort to have the case dismissed. "
860,"DUMFRIES, Va. — President Barack Obama will hit the campaign trail on Thursday to rally black voters behind candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey amid stern warnings that African Americans may not come out in force on an Election Day that is just three weeks away. Mr. Obama’s appearances on behalf of Virginia’s lieutenant governor, Ralph S. Northam, in Richmond and the financier Philip D. Murphy in Newark — two white candidates in predominantly black cities — come as Democrats struggle to inspire African-Americans to vote this year. While Mr. Murphy appears comfortably in the lead in New Jersey, the race in Virginia is close. And in Alabama, where voters go to the polls on Dec. 12, Doug Jones, a former prosecutor, is running a surprisingly competitive race for the Senate against the firebrand social conservative Roy S. Moore. “There is not one person in Birmingham who disagrees we need Doug Jones,” said Randall Woodfin, the newly elected mayor of Alabama’s largest city, which is predominantly black. “The issue is motivating them to come out and vote for him.” The party’s dilemma echoes a challenge that Democrats have faced in elections since Mr. Obama’s rise to the presidency: how to persuade some of the most loyal voters to show up for elections when the Democrat they most love is not a candidate. In 2017, antipathy for President Trump could be a new motivation, but Mr. Trump is not on the ballot either. Phillip E. Thompson, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. in Virginia’s Loudoun County, said he was worried that black voters were simply not engaged. "
861,"It’s been a little over two years since you removed a Confederate flag from the flagpole on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse. Are you surprised that we’re still having a debate over monuments to the Confederacy? Is it possible to not be surprised in retrospect? There was a point when it was shocking — maybe a year and a half ago, as I saw the ascendance of Donald Trump. But looking back, it makes sense to me that, given the history of America, there would be this backlash that accompanies the election of the first black president. When you took the flag down, you said: “I come against you in the name of God. This flag comes down today.” I was struck by your statement because it seems as if the right has tried to monopolize the language of faith, particularly Christianity, in the public square. Coming on the heels of the massacre at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, having that flag fly was just such an act of evil, and to me, there are certain moments when it’s not even a question of politics. It’s about a moral compass. I’m offended by the notion that Christianity can align only with the conservative movement. As a Christian, I don’t agree. I don’t think that taking health care from children aligns with my Christian values. I don’t think that a tax policy that basically gives more to the rich while placing greater tax burdens on the poor aligns with my Christian beliefs. Politically, we’re seeing all the ways it becomes problematic when one party proclaims itself a theocracy. A huge number of evangelicals voted for Trump. Do you think that a vote for him is a vote against their faith? I don’t know. We know that there are times when the teachings of Jesus lose out to racism. Look at how segregated the churches are. I can’t judge what is in people’s hearts, but I’m not surprised that white evangelicals might side with Donald Trump, even if a lot of things that he does could arguably not line up with Christian values, while at the same time he accuses Obama of being a Muslim. I think there has to be a way to acknowledge both the positive and negative aspects of Christianity, or else there’s no real reconciliation with the history there, right? "
862,"Few landscapes remain virtually untrammeled by the growing impact of the planet’s seven and a half billion inhabitants — places where the natural environment is so overwhelmingly intact and truly wild that coming across so much as a boot print is a surprise. It seems unlikely in this day and age, but such areas do still exist. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one such place. Lies and misrepresentations have characterized this Arctic region as a “barren wasteland.” In fact, this is a landscape of surprising beauty and biological diversity: 31,000 square miles of the craggy Brooks Range, valleys of spruce forest and flower-filled tundra extending north to the Arctic Ocean. In this terrain and the adjacent Arctic Ocean, you’ll find roughly 700 kinds of plants and a multitude of different species: 200 bird, 47 mammal and 42 fish species. It’s a place of living grandeur. Those of us who have explored the Arctic refuge treasure seeing grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep and thundering herds of caribou. With awe we have watched golden eagles and flocks of migrating birds from across the globe, many of which nest there in the summer after a winter spent in such faraway places as the Amazon, the coastal wetlands of Patagonia or the Sundarbans mangrove swamps of Bangladesh. Yet this stunning landscape is now in the cross hairs of the United States Congress. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to allow oil drilling in the refuge in order to generate revenue to offset the cost of tax reform. This expedited process allows Republicans in the Senate, where they hold a narrow edge, to pass a reconciliation bill with a simple majority, bypassing a filibuster from the Democrats. This is not the way we should consider a measure that threatens irreversible damage to our wilderness heritage. The refuge was originally suggested for protection in the early 1950s, when Alaska was not yet a state. To investigate its conservation value, Olaus Murie, the president of the Wilderness Society, and his wife, Mardy, who both had spent years in Alaska, suggested a biological survey to Fairfield Osborn, president of the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society). The Sheenjek River Valley and surrounding areas on the southern slopes of the Brooks Range were selected as the focus of the expedition. "

President Trump’s attempt to show camaraderie with Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, might have backfired on Monday: He spent most of a 45-minute news conference in long-winded exchanges with reporters, while Mr. McConnell looked on awkwardly. On “The Daily Show,” broadcasting this week from Chicago, Trevor Noah said he was surprised Republicans hadn’t begun to prevent Mr. Trump from public speaking altogether. David Letterman, who will receive a Mark Twain Prize on Sunday, sat down with Jimmy Kimmel to talk about — what else — hosting late-night TV. They took a few good-natured shots at other hosts: Mr. Letterman talked through his decision to send Conan O’Brien a horse as a gag gift, which he regrets, and he hinted at who his least-favorite late-night host is. On the weekly “Jim Jefferies Show,” the host took aim at Harvey Weinstein. He ridiculed Fox News for pushing a narrative that tied Hillary Clinton to Mr. Weinstein’s acts of alleged sexual harassment. "

And Abbi’s mom appears on “Broad City.” BROAD CITY Comedy Central at 10:30 p.m. When a mom shows up on a sitcom, it’s usually bad news for the child and great news for the audience. From Elaine Stritch as Colleen Donaghy (“30 Rock”) to Shelley Long as DeDe Pritchett (“Modern Family”), mom roles have given great older actresses a chance to dole out some tough love and questionable advice and make humiliating life decisions that perhaps strike a little too close to home. One of the two “Broad City” moms has already appeared: Susie Essman as Ilana’s brash mother. Now it’s Abbi’s turn, and her mom is played by sitcom royalty: Peri Gilpin (Roz from “Frasier”).

But they are both forcefully persuasive and more than willing to wade into substantive policy discussions, as seen in their health care debate in February. On Wednesday they will face off on another contentious issue coming before Congress: President Trump’s tax reform plan. Mr. Cruz called Mr. Trump’s plan “encouraging”; Mr. Sanders called it “morally repugnant and bad economic policy.” Sparks and grimaces will fly.

865,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Cheering and celebratory gunfire erupted in the streets of the Syrian city of Raqqa after a U.S.-backed militia composed of Kurdish and Arab fighters said they had seized the Islamic State’s de facto capital. Here’s what our photographer saw when he entered the city with Kurdish fighters. Analysts say the militant group is preparing for a new phase: morphing back into the kind of underground insurgency it was at the start. Trying to defeat its ideology will probably vex President Trump as it did his predecessors. In Iraq, Kurdish independence aspirations appeared to stall — at least for now — as government forces seized oil facilities near Kirkuk that supply most of Iraqi Kurdistan’s revenue. _____ "
866,"All year, President Trump had threatened to release a metaphorical bomb into the Obamacare markets — canceling a certain type of payment to health insurers. Everyone was convinced it would destroy the marketplace. Late last Thursday, he carried out his threat, later saying that “the gravy train ended the day I knocked out the insurance companies’ money.” Congress is responding. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, the chairman and ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, announced on Tuesday that they had reached a deal on legislation that would undo the president’s order and bring back the subsidies. But now it looks as if Obamacare markets won’t face wholesale devastation, regardless of whether that legislation passes. In 2018, at least, insurers may be made whole and consumers protected — even without the subsidies. How could that be? The details are complicated, but the crux is that insurers and state regulators worked together to find a way to funnel more federal money into the Obamacare insurance markets. The insurer-regulator hack will mean that navigating the Obamacare marketplace will be more complicated for consumers (more on that later). And the change will cost taxpayers more money — perhaps $21 billion more in 2018 alone. But, in the end, most customers will be unharmed by the president’s decision, and a substantial fraction will be better off, able to buy plans for about the same price they pay now, yet with lower deductibles.

867,"RED FAMINE
Stalin’s War on Ukraine
By Anne Applebaum
461 pp. Doubleday. $35. The Washington Post columnist Anne Applebaum has long lived in and written about Eastern Europe and is best known for her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Gulag: A History.” But my favorite of her books is the quirky and original 1994 “Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe,” in which she travels from the Baltic to the Black Sea, entirely through regions and cities that had found themselves situated, over the course of the 20th century, in several different countries. Today’s Lviv, for example, in western Ukraine, was previously Lvov in the Soviet Union, and before that Lwow in interwar Poland, and prior to 1914 was Lemberg in Austria-Hungary. And that’s not even counting its occupation by czarist Russia in World War I, Nazi Germany in World War II and a short-lived Ukrainian nationalist group in 1918. Most of the people she spoke to on that journey shared a sense of ethnic identity under threat by a nation in which they were now absorbed, or had been oppressed by in the past. They felt themselves to be unfairly Lithuanianized Poles, or Belarusified Lithuanians or Ruthenians denied a country when everyone else seemed to be getting their own. The book was prescient, for it is exactly that sense of aggrieved, wounded ethnic or national pride that has been cultivated so skillfully by politicians who have emerged in recent years, from Viktor Orban in Budapest to Vladimir Putin in Moscow to Donald Trump in Washington. The specter of clashing nationalisms also runs through Applebaum’s new book, “Red Famine: Stalin’s War on Ukraine,” a richly detailed history of the great famine, peaking in 1933, which killed an estimated five million or more Soviets, more than 3.9 million of them Ukrainian. Stalin, beginning several years earlier, had ruthlessly forced millions of independent small farmers into the new collective farms that he was certain would increase production and feed Soviet cities. The farmers understandably resisted giving up their land, often slaughtered and ate the animals they were ordered to bring with them, and had little incentive to work once they were taken, sometimes at gunpoint, to the collectives. This is certainly part of the story, but Applebaum puts more emphasis on something that has great relevance for today: Russia’s prolonged fear of losing a territory it had long treated as a lucrative colony. Even Alexander II, the reformer czar who freed the serfs, outlawed Ukrainian books and magazines and forbade the use of the language in theaters and opera. Schoolchildren generally had to be educated in Russian even when, despite the many ethnic Russians in Ukrainian cities, in the countryside most people spoke Ukrainian. In the chaos of dissolving empires toward the end of World War I, Ukraine declared itself independent, but its famously fertile black earth and Black Sea ports were tempting prizes for rival independence movements, for both White Russians and Bolsheviks, and for the territory’s neighbors. After several extremely bloody years of fighting (Kiev changed hands more than a dozen times in 1919), Ukraine was divided between two newborn states: Poland and — taking the lion’s share — the Soviet Union.

869,"WASHINGTON — On the eve of his first trip to South Asia as secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson made an impassioned plea on Wednesday for closer ties with India while casting China as a threat to the world order and saying Pakistan needed to do more to fight terrorism. The pro-India tone of his speech, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, was clear when Mr. Tillerson began by wishing everyone a “Happy Diwali,” a reference to the fall Hindu festival of lights that is often marked by fireworks displays. But he asked the audience to refrain from lighting any. “I don’t need any fireworks,” he said to audible chuckles. “I’m getting too many fireworks around me already.” Rumors about whether Mr. Tillerson has been considering leaving the Trump administration have surrounded him for months. His relationship with President Trump is thought to be rocky, with Mr. Trump posting messages on Twitter that undercut Mr. Tillerson’s diplomatic efforts and Mr. Tillerson openly disagreeing with the president on important policy matters. But top American officials have been calling for closer ties with India for most of India’s seven decades as an independent nation, and little was new about Mr. Tillerson’s calls for improved military and economic relations between the two. “The Trump administration is determined to dramatically deepen ways for the United States and India to further this partnership,” he said. "
870,"BEIJING — As Xi Jinping’s first five-year term as China’s leader ends, he gave himself a shining report card on Wednesday — and a big to-do list for his next five years. Speaking at the start of a Communist Party congress in Beijing, Mr. Xi gave a work report that summed up his achievements so far, while also laying out where he wants to take China in his second term, which starts after this congress. Sitting on a podium before 2,300 delegates, he spoke for 205 minutes, long enough that his predecessor, Hu Jintao, pointed at his watch when Mr. Xi finally finished. Mr. Xi did not mention Donald Trump or North Korea or other specific policy headaches. Party congresses are held every five years, and always start with China’s leader giving a work report that is a broad outline of policy, not a detailed blueprint. Even so, Mr. Xi’s priorities shone through. This is a leader who believes China is on the cusp of greatness, but who worries about domestic security threats and maintaining ideological control. Here are some key takeaways from Mr. Xi’s report: Mr. Xi said he would put China on a sounder economic footing by containing financial risks, encouraging innovation and increasing consumer spending. But he also refrained from calling for the liberalizing overhauls that earlier leaders like Deng Xiaoping used to bring China roaring growth in the 1980s and ’90s. Since then, the Chinese leadership’s enthusiasm for allowing market forces to pick winners and losers has wilted as social inequalities have grown, and Mr. Xi’s speech confirmed that trend. He used the word “market” only 19 times, compared with 24 times by Mr. Hu at the previous congress in 2012, and 51 times by then-President Jiang Zemin at the congress in 1997. Mr. Xi emphasized making state-owned enterprises stronger and bigger, yet more efficient. He also called for stricter regulation of banks and other parts of the financial system amid a surge of borrowing by companies and local governments. But he did not mention using market tools like improving the disclosure of information by banks and companies alike, which many economists advocate. Still, Mr. Xi did raise some points dear to economic reformers. He called for breaking up monopolies, even though he oversaw the merger of the two largest rail equipment manufacturers to prevent them from competing against each other for overseas projects. And he made a fleeting promise to “support the growth of private businesses.” "
871,"To the Editor: Re “Top General’s Grief Becomes a Political Talking Point for the President” (news article, Oct. 18): Lacking the grace, skill, empathy, humor, work ethic, knowledge, tact, thick skin and fitness for the job, all of which former President Barack Obama possessed in depth, President Trump displays his envy by lying about Mr. Obama: suggesting that he did not tend to fallen and wounded soldiers when Mr. Obama did so constantly; suggesting that the Iran nuclear deal is terrible and that the Affordable Care Act is a failure — both untrue, and Mr. Trump is unable to explain what is wrong with either. Mr. Trump is the same man who led the “birther” charge against Mr. Obama and accused the former president of wiretapping his office — both charges false. Mr. Trump’s obsession with Mr. Obama seems abnormal. JOHN E. COLBERT
ARROYO SECO, N.M. "
872,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Xi Jinping’s extraordinarily long opening speech set the tone for China’s weeklong Communist Party congress. He declared a “new era” and stressed the country’s “great power” in comments that effectively claimed a stature as significant to today’s China as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping held in theirs. Here are five takeaways. Mr. Xi’s rise has been marked by rekindled enthusiasm for traditional culture. Witness how his embrace of the Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming prompted one city to build a theme park, construct a museum and even commission a robot to bring him to life. _____ "
873,"Global bank watchdogs are acting as a line of defense against an American deregulatory push. The Treasury Department will soon decide whether to recommend scrapping the Dodd-Frank Act’s rules for liquidating failing banks, as some Republicans are urging. But foreign regulators are threatening to impose new curbs on American firms if it’s ditched. What’s known as Orderly Liquidation Authority was established in Dodd-Frank to avoid confusion if a complex financial institution fails, like Lehman Brothers did a decade ago. The act gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. the power to unwind bank holding companies, systemically important nonbanks and other financial firms, and set up a fund to pay for the associated costs. The F.D.I.C. would initially borrow from the Treasury, and recoup the expenses with a fee imposed on big banks. Some congressional Republicans decry this arrangement as another taxpayer-funded bailout. They have introduced bills to eliminate the liquidation procedures and replace them with an improved bankruptcy code. The criticisms prompted President Trump in April to order the Treasury Department to review those procedures and assess whether bankruptcy was a better method. The debate in Washington ignores the global nature of big banks and the role that international regulators play. The F.D.I.C.-supported method would deal with a failing bank at the holding company level, eliminating the need for each division — including overseas units — to have their own wind-down plans. Overseas watchdogs would defer to regulators in the United States and work in close cooperation with them. Bankruptcy judges don’t have those relationships and the process, even with improvements, would be too slow to handle the fast-paced chaos of a large, failing bank. Overseas regulators have smartly worked to get ahead of the decision, warning that without the Dodd-Frank rules, overseas subsidiaries of American banks could be subject to higher capital requirements, restructuring and ring-fencing. Wall Street also supports maintaining the liquidation authority. Despite Mr. Trump’s threats to gut Dodd-Frank, the Treasury Department under the leadership of Secretary Steven Mnuchin has so far been levelheaded in its recommendations for revising bank regulations and rules overseeing capital markets. The threat from global watchdogs is another reason to discount the odds of a major rollback of financial rules. "
874,"During nearly seven years as a Republican in the New York State Assembly, Nicole Malliotakis earned a reputation for embracing unpopular stances in the Democrat-controlled chamber, opposing minimum wage increases, paid family leave, gay marriage and public financing of elections. But some of her most heartfelt declarations were reserved for issues relating to immigration. At an Assembly hearing in January, she jousted with Mayor Bill de Blasio over a sanctuary city law that delineates which undocumented immigrants, when convicted of major crimes, can be turned over to federal authorities for possible deportation. “Why would you protect individuals who are here illegally committing these crimes,” Ms. Malliotakis said then, “instead of putting your citizenry first and foremost?” Ms. Malliotakis, who is from Staten Island, is now running as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, seeking to unseat Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat. She will be an understandable long shot on Election Day in November, given the power of incumbency, the six-to-one edge that Democrats hold over Republicans in New York City, and the 44-point lead that Mr. de Blasio enjoys over her in a recent poll. And her conservative record is not likely to pull Democratic voters to her side. She has sued the city over a program that provides identification cards to residents, trying to block officials from destroying records that might be used to identify people for deportation. "
875,"The Trump administration escalated a bitter confrontation with Iran on Wednesday, demanding that the United Nations Security Council punish the Iranian government for what the American ambassador called its “outlaw behavior” across the Middle East. “The United States will not turn a blind eye to these violations,” the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, told a Security Council meeting that had been meant to focus on developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ms. Haley used her speaking time instead to deliver a critique of Iran. Her remarks were among the most strident denunciations Ms. Haley has made of Iran since she became President Trump’s ambassador in January. The remarks seemed timed partly to respond to international criticism of the administration over Mr. Trump’s avowed hostility to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major powers, including the United States, which he has described as an embarrassment and a disaster. She spoke less than a week after Mr. Trump announced that he would disavow the nuclear agreement and might withdraw the United States from the accord altogether unless it was strengthened to his satisfaction. That decision has deeply angered Iran — which has ruled out any renegotiation — and has raised alarms among many American allies, including Britain, France and Germany, which were among the parties to the agreement.

876,"Let’s get this out of the way first: Ted Cruz is not the Zodiac killer. We’re pretty sure. The infamous serial killer’s last confirmed murder was in 1969, while the senator from Texas was born in 1970. We feel the need to be very clear about this: Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, is almost surely not the Zodiac killer. It’s just about impossible. But that’s long been a joke on the internet. And on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz, who evidence suggests is unlikely to be the Zodiac killer, posted the following on Twitter: You might recognize the image as a coded letter the Zodiac killer once sent. This does not, any reasonable person would conclude, offer definitive proof that Mr. Cruz is the Zodiac killer, who was blamed for at least five murders in the San Francisco Bay Area and has never been identified. But it did make for a suitable distraction on Wednesday, as people on Twitter erupted at what appeared to be Mr. Cruz’s first acknowledgment of the long-running joke. Did the one-time presidential candidate score a few points for being in on the joke? Did he ruin what was once a fun joke? Others — surely including those hearing about it for the first time through this article — were all sorts of baffled. Why did he tweet the Zodiac note? Why do people say he’s the Zodiac killer? Does anything make sense anymore? "
877,"The call came about 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday as a limousine carrying Myeshia Johnson and her two children, ages two and six, sat at Miami International Airport waiting for the transport plane carrying the body of her husband, Army Sergeant La David T. Johnson, to arrive. As President Trump spoke for three to five minutes, Ms. Johnson, 24, who is six months pregnant, wept openly, her body frozen with emotion, according to Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida who accompanied the young widow. “Myeshia, the entire time, was in a ball, rolled up almost like in a fetal position crying,” Ms. Wilson said on Wednesday. “What he said was, ‘I guess he knew what he was signing up for but it still hurts.’ That’s how he said it.” Ms. Wilson offered a harsh critique of the president’s words about the soldier’s death in an ambush in Niger, which she said were not comforting. “So in other words, when you sign up when you go into the military, you are really signing up to die,” she said of the president’s comments. “That is not what you say to a grieving widow, a woman who just learned that her husband cannot have an open casket funeral. In fact, she will probably not even be able to see his body.” "
878,"After a tumultuous month of hearing from the president and some football fans who are angry at players who do not stand for the national anthem, the N.F.L. owners left a two-day meeting agreeing to let their players protest, but to work with them on the social issues they are trying to address. A day after meeting players and union officials, the owners spoke among themselves for several hours on Wednesday in Manhattan. No specific resolution was proposed to strengthen the league’s rules on the anthem, and only a handful of owners expressed a desire for measures that would penalize players who did not stand. Most owners, though, said they wanted every player to stand for the anthem, but recognized that it would be misguided for the league to mandate it. “Look, we all want the players to stand, but as far as I’m concerned, because they want to stand as opposed to me having to tell them that,” John Mara, a co-owner of the Giants, said. Mara said there was some conversation about changing league rules, which say players should stand for the anthem, but he said “the policy is not going to change.” Mara was one of about a half-dozen owners who spoke to reporters after the meetings ended. Mara, the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank and the San Francisco 49ers co-owner Jed York said the owners were trying to move past the controversy, which has prompted fans to turn in season tickets, burn football jerseys and fly a plane over a stadium with a banner calling for a boycott of the N.F.L. The owners said that while they knew some fans were unhappy with the protests — which began more than a year ago as a way to highlight issues affecting black Americans — it was important for them to listen to their players and the reasons they have been protesting.

880,"WASHINGTON — Since Janet L. Yellen became the Federal Reserve’s chairwoman in February 2014, unemployment in the United States has steadily declined while inflation has remained low. Few Fed chairmen have achieved comparable success. Yet President Trump, who is scheduled to meet Ms. Yellen on Thursday, says he is still considering whether to nominate her for a second four-year term, and key White House aides are pressing for her to be replaced. Ms. Yellen’s peril reflects the polarization of American politics. The three previous Fed chairs were reappointed at least once by a president of the opposite political party, but some Republicans are eager to oust Ms. Yellen, a registered Democrat who has strongly defended post-crisis financial regulations. She may also become a victim of her own success. Steady economic growth and the tranquillity of financial markets have emboldened some critics, who see an opportune moment for a transition to new leadership. But Mr. Trump also faces warnings that replacing Ms. Yellen is an unnecessary risk to the economic growth the president has repeatedly pointed to as a primary success of his young administration. “The economy is humming along,” said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, a New York economic research firm. “The markets are humming along. Given all the other stuff that’s going on, why mess with that?” "
881,"President Trump’s ban on people from a handful of countries entering the United States, though worded as a national security measure, appears to be a veiled, unconstitutional bid to bar Muslims based on their religion, a federal judge in Maryland ruled on Wednesday in an order that cited the president’s own words at length. The order was the second in two days blocking the travel ban, which was set to go into effect on Wednesday; a judge in Hawaii on Tuesday ruled against the president’s action, and another challenge is pending in Washington State. The Trump administration said it would appeal the rulings. Judge Derrick K. Watson, in Federal District Court in Honolulu, ruled that opponents of the ban were likely to succeed in arguing that it violated federal immigration statutes, and issued a temporary restraining order against the administration pending a hearing on whether to grant a permanent injunction. In Federal District Court in Greenbelt, Md., Judge Theodore D. Chuang raised the stakes, finding that the president’s ban was suspect on both statutory and constitutional grounds, and granting an injunction for an indefinite period of time. “It’s significant that the two judges who examined it found that the ban violated the law in several ways, which gives the appellate courts and ultimately the Supreme Court more options for striking it down,” said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case. The district judges, both appointed by President Barack Obama, had ruled against an earlier attempt at a travel ban, as had the federal appellate courts for their regions of the country, and the appeals were consolidated and taken up by the Supreme Court, which allowed some parts of the ban to go into effect, pending consideration of the case. That became moot after Mr. Trump issued a revised ban last month. The new version was the one blocked by the two judges this week, and with the same issues still in play, the high court appears likely to consider the matter again. In response to Wednesday’s ruling, a Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, referred to his statement the day before: “Today’s ruling is incorrect, fails to properly respect the separation of powers, and has the potential to cause serious negative consequences for our national security.” "
882,"President Trump and Republicans in Congress have brought chaos to the American health care system by trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act and failing to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which, with bipartisan support for the past 20 years, has provided care for millions of children. Over the next few weeks they can choose to set things right or to destroy them. Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray on Tuesday announced a bipartisan deal that could help stabilize the A.C.A.’s insurance markets and undo some of the damage Mr. Trump has done through administrative actions. In an ideal world, Congress would quickly pass that bill, which includes several Republican priorities, and, at the same time, reauthorize CHIP, which now covers nearly nine million children. But with Mr. Trump in the White House and feckless Republicans leading Congress, it’s possible that none of this will get done, health care costs will be driven up and millions of children will be left without health insurance. First up, the Alexander-Murray deal represents real progress. These two no-nonsense lawmakers — the leading Republican and Democrat on the Senate health committee — have done yeoman’s work trying to fix a mess created largely by Mr. Trump. Their bill would appropriate money for payments to insurance companies that the president said he was stopping last week. He said they amounted to an illegal corporate bailout — a blatant lie. These payments, authorized by the A.C.A., or Obamacare, compensate insurers for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income families. Further, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray would require the administration to spend $106 million on advertising and on people to help people sign up for insurance when open enrollment begins on Nov. 1. Mr. Trump’s minions at the Department of Health and Human Services slashed spending on outreach efforts in recent months. The deal also advances two Republican health care ideas: giving states more flexibility to make changes to the A.C.A. and letting more people sign up for high-deductible health care policies. Thankfully, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray have made sure that neither of these changes undermines Obamacare’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions and the requirement that insurers cover essential health services like maternity care and cancer treatment. These changes could make the law function better by allowing sparsely populated states to attract more insurers by, for example, making it easier for them to set up reinsurance programs that protect companies from losses from a few customers. And the proposed high-deductible plans could work well for a small subset of people who buy A.C.A. policies but do not receive subsidies because they earn too much money. While these compromises provide some hope for the A.C.A., CHIP’s fate, and health care for nine million children, is being held hostage by Republican extremists in the House. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Finance Committee — Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden — have worked together to extend the program, which expired on Sept. 30. But Republican House members such as Greg Walden of Oregon and Fred Upton of Michigan are demanding that spending on CHIP be offset by cuts to A.C.A. costs and unnecessary changes to Medicare and Medicaid. Of course, these same lawmakers who are so tightfisted with children’s medical care want to slash taxes on wealthy families with no effort to offset that loss of revenue. "
883,"WASHINGTON — Most people think of the term “bailout,” as a political pejorative, often involving hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars being funneled to failing companies. It’s now become one of President Trump’s oft-repeated rhetorical cudgels against the Affordable Care Act and federal payments to insurance companies. In April, the president accused Democrats of wanting to “bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare.” In July, he threatened to end “BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies” if Congress did not repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. And in a speech Tuesday night to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Mr. Trump urged Congress to “find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.” But his use of the word is misleading. “Bailout” typically refers to financial assistance offered to prevent the bankruptcy of a company or industry. The 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (which Mr. Trump largely supported) was a bailout because it provided $700 billion for the Treasury Department to buy troubled securities from banks that were at risk of collapse. The funds Mr. Trump now refers to, on the other hand, are more accurately characterized as a reimbursement that the government pays to the insurance companies. It is done not to save the companies from financial ruin — unlike the banks in 2008, they are not in danger of failing — but to cover the cost of cheaper health care for low- and moderate-income Americans. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers must offer plans with reduced out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles and co-payments, for people who have purchased a silver-level plan and who have incomes of 100 to 250 percent of the poverty level (about $24,600 to $61,500 for a family of four). About seven million people, or about 58 percent of all marketplace enrollees, qualified for that financial assistance this year. "
884,"For decades, America has waged an ineffective war on drug pushers and drug lords, from Bronx street corners to Medellin, Colombia, regarding them as among the most contemptible specimens of humanity. One reason our efforts have failed is we ignored the biggest drug pushers of all: American pharmaceutical companies. Our policy was: You get 15 people hooked on opioids, and you’re a thug who deserves to rot in hell; you get 150,000 people hooked, and you’re a marketing genius who deserves a huge bonus. Big Pharma should be writhing in embarrassment this week after The Washington Post and “60 Minutes” reported that pharmaceutical lobbyists had manipulated Congress to hamstring the Drug Enforcement Administration. But the abuse goes far beyond that: The industry systematically manipulated the entire country for 25 years, and its executives are responsible for many of the 64,000 deaths of Americans last year from drugs — more than the number of Americans who died in the Vietnam and Iraq wars combined. The opioid crisis unfolded because greedy people — Latin drug lords and American pharma executives alike — lost their humanity when they saw the astounding profits that could be made. It used to be in America that people became addicted to opioids through illegal drugs. In the 1960s, for example, 80 percent of Americans hooked on opioids began with heroin. "
885,"Alaska is “open for business!” With these words, delivered before an appreciative audience of oil producers in Anchorage in May, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reaffirmed the Trump administration’s determination to open Alaska’s fragile environment to commercial exploitation. Here are the particulars of that assault, at least so far: In April, President Trump signed an order that to allow oil drilling in United States waters in the Arctic Ocean that President Barack Obama had declared off limits. In May, Mr. Zinke made clear his plan to reverse the Obama administration’s decision to protect environmentally delicate areas of the National Petroleum Reserve. Also in May, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, always eager to join in the environmental mayhem, reversed an Obama policy that had blocked a proposed gold mine in the headwaters of Bristol Bay, one of the most productive wild salmon fisheries. Mr. Pruitt made the decision after meeting with the chief executive of the mining company. But wait — there’s more. As early as Thursday, with Mr. Zinke and the rest of the administration cheering from the sidelines, the Senate could vote on opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s oil-rich coastal plain for drilling. Unlike the rest of the 19.6-million-acre refuge, mostly protected since its creation under President Dwight Eisenhower, the fate of the 1.5-million-acre plain — the refuge’s biological heart — is up to Congress. Congress has twice come within a hair of consigning the coastal plain and its abundant wildlife to the drillers — in 1995, when President Bill Clinton vetoed a budget bill that contained a drilling provision, and in 2005, when moderate Republicans in the House rose up against a similar plan. This time the threat comes wrapped in a giant budget package that, without mentioning the coastal plain explicitly, instructs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to find $1 billion in revenue to offset the bill’s giant tax cuts. This invites the committee chairwoman, Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, to write language in the budget legislation to allow development. Assuming that Senate Democrats mobilized by Ed Markey of Massachusetts hold firm, only a few Republicans are needed to block this maneuver. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine have voted against drilling in the refuge before; it would be astonishing if they did not do so again. It should not be hard to find at least one more who sees this bill for what it is — a budget scam that puts the wildest place left in America at risk. "
886,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Federal prosecutors in Brazil on Wednesday charged a Brazilian partner in the former Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro with paying bribes to propel the city’s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. The businessman, Arthur César de Menezes Soares Filho, is a fugitive in the United States, according to Brazilian prosecutors. They expressed frustration over what they characterized as Washington’s reluctance to help in the investigation, contending that American officials did not extradite him, freeze his bank accounts or search his Miami residence as part of an international attempt to bring him to justice. The 157-page criminal complaint made public on Wednesday charts what prosecutors called a “win-win” kickback scheme masterminded by a powerful trio: the former Rio de Janeiro governor, Sérgio Cabral; the recently-ousted head of Brazil’s Olympic Committee, Carlos Arthur Nuzman; and Mr. Soares, who ran several companies that were awarded multimillion government contracts. The complaint does not suggest that anyone in the Trump Organization was involved in, or aware of, the kickback scheme. The Trump Organization pulled out of the project last December, soon after the hotel came under scrutiny in a separate criminal investigation involving investments by public pension fund managers. The Trump Organization on Wednesday declined to comment on the record to questions submitted by email about its relationship with Mr. Soares and whether it had been contacted by investigators. According to the charging document in the Olympic bribery case, Mr. Soares, a longtime associate of the former Rio governor, was the source of at least $2 million in bribes paid to Lamine Diack, the former president of the International Association of Athletics Federations who had a vote in the selection of the 2016 Summer Games. "
887,"WASHINGTON — People trying to express sympathy to the families of fallen troops say the wrong thing all the time. When Marine First Lt. Travis Manion was killed by sniper fire during the Iraq troop surge in 2007, one well-wisher told his family that it was “such a waste.” Another called it a shame for him “to die in vain like that.” But usually, such comments do not come from the president. Asked amid an outcry over President Trump’s telling a soldier’s widow that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” families of slain troops described on Wednesday a range of encounters with him and his six immediate predecessors, from sympathy and sincerity — including from Mr. Trump — to awkward distances. Mr. Trump has denied making the comment, which was described by both the mother of the soldier and Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, who was present for the call. Mr. Trump spoke to Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, killed in an ambush in Niger this month, as she was being taken to receive her husband’s body, according to his mother. Several military families whose loved ones were killed this year did describe phone calls from Mr. Trump that they said gave them solace. Another spoke of a promised call from him that never came. Together, the episodes underscore one of the most difficult duties of a president — comforting family members of Americans killed carrying out the orders of a commander in chief. “I picture myself in that limo — the last thing you’d want to hear is something like that,” said Nadia McCaffrey, whose only child, Sgt. Patrick McCaffrey, was killed in an ambush in Iraq in 2004. She was furious with President George W. Bush after her son was killed, she said, and refused to take calls from the White House. Families of slain service members who have had exchanges with past presidents decried the timing of Mr. Trump’s phone call, which they said came at what was most likely one of Mrs. Johnson’s most vulnerable moments. And while a number of relatives said they were subject to verbal punches dressed up as sympathy, none came from the presidents who sent their sons and daughters to war. "
888,"BAGHDAD — When the Iraqi military battled Kurdish forces this week to reclaim the contested city of Kirkuk, the spectacle of one American-backed ally fighting another with American-supplied weapons was not the only incongruous sight. Another was the United States turning its back on a crucial ally in the fight against the Islamic State, the Kurds, as Washington’s goals aligned with those of a regional nemesis, Iran. While the military action in Kirkuk on Monday and Tuesday was carried out under the banner of the Iraqi military, the ground forces included Iranian-backed Shiite militias. American officials, including President Trump, insisted that the United States was not taking sides in the dispute, but some analysts say that the United States approved the Iraqi plan to enter Kurdish-held areas and that Iran helped broker the agreement with a Kurdish faction to withdraw its fighters from Kirkuk, allowing the Iraqi forces to take over largely unopposed. “Abadi would not have attacked without informing the U.S.,” said David L. Phillips, a former State Department adviser who worked on Iraq for 30 years, referring to the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi. “At a minimum, the U.S. knew that the attack was coming.” Maria Fantappie, senior analyst for Iraq at the International Crisis Group, said, “The United States gave a green light, and that was essential.” "

890,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, will go to the White House Thursday to interview for the job she currently holds. Her term ends early next year, and President Trump is deciding whether to reappoint her or pick someone else. When her name first appeared on the reported list of finalists, I assumed it was only for show. Trump likes to inject drama into an appointment process, as you may recall from the secretary of state bake-off. Including Yellen — the first woman ever to be Fed chair and originally an Obama appointee — as a finalist adds intrigue. In the end, I assumed Trump would choose a conservative man for the job, as he does for most big jobs. And he may well. But there is a strong case that Trump would be serving his own political interests by reappointing Yellen, and if we know one thing about Trump, it’s that he cares about his own interests. Think about the chaos that surrounds this administration: the Russia investigation, the struggling Cabinet secretaries, the West Wing leaks, the failure to pass significant legislation, the rebukes from Senate Republicans, the botched response to Hurricane Maria, the stymied Muslim ban, the nuclear tensions in North Korea and Iran and, underscoring it all, the 38 percent approval rating. What is the single biggest exception? The economy. It’s doing just fine. It’s not booming, but it is growing steadily, with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate. As Trump repeatedly notes, the stock market is indeed booming. "
891,"In a sign of mounting frustration among Republicans in Washington, Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a senior lawmaker with close ties to his party’s leaders, is expected to resign and take up an executive post with a business group in his home state, according to three Republicans briefed on his plans. An abrupt departure by Mr. Tiberi, who is an influential member of the House Ways and Means Committee, would signal a deepening level of discontent among mainstream Republicans in Congress. Despite holding Congress and the White House, Republicans have so far failed to achieve longstanding policy goals like overhauling the tax code and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Tiberi, 54, could announce his plan to leave Congress as soon as this week, Republican officials said, though it is unclear when he intends to vacate his seat. Two Republicans who were briefed on Mr. Tiberi’s decision said he had indicated that he plans to join the Ohio Business Roundtable, a business consortium that announced this summer that it was searching for a new president. Mr. Tiberi did not respond to a phone call or a text message seeking comment on Wednesday night. But some of Mr. Tiberi’s colleagues said that the grind of their jobs had gotten no better since Donald J. Trump’s election last year, giving Republicans full control of Washington. “This is a harder life in terms of being away from home and putting up with the pace and the public battering that one sometimes must endure,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. “And no raises in a decade is hard on many members with families.” Of Mr. Tiberi, Mr. Cole said that he was “happy for my friend, but Congress will be a poorer place without him.” "
892,"RALEIGH, N.C. — Republicans with a firm grip on the North Carolina legislature — and, until January, the governor’s seat — enacted a conservative agenda in recent years, only to have a steady stream of laws affecting voting and legislative power rejected by the courts. Now lawmakers have seized on a solution: change the makeup of the courts. Judges in state courts as of this year must identify their party affiliation on ballots, making North Carolina the first state in nearly a century to adopt partisan court elections. The General Assembly in Raleigh reduced the size of the state Court of Appeals, depriving Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, of naming replacements for retiring Republicans. And this month, lawmakers drew new boundaries for judicial districts statewide, which critics say are meant to increase the number of Republican judges on district and superior courts and would force many African-Americans on the bench into runoffs against other incumbents. “Instead of changing the way they write their laws, they want to change the judges,” Mr. Cooper said as he sat in a 19th-century, high-ceiling library at the Executive Mansion, which he has occupied uneasily since succeeding Pat McCrory, a Republican. The legislature has overridden nearly a dozen of his vetoes. The latest was on Monday, when lawmakers sustained a bill to eliminate judicial primary elections, which Mr. Cooper called part of an effort to “rig the system.” Republicans say their goal is to correct yearslong imbalances from shifts in population, ignored while Democrats held power, and to give voters more information about little-known judges in down-ballot races. “This is about making good policy,” Representative Justin Burr, who unveiled the proposed new judicial maps in a series of Twitter messages one Sunday in June, has said. North Carolina’s evolution comes in the context of longstanding but increasing politicization of federal courts. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, blocked President Barack Obama’s appointment of Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court for 10 months until Mr. Obama’s term expired. In the end, President Trump appointed Neil M. Gorsuch to the court instead. On Monday, appearing at the White House with Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell said he favors ending the tradition of giving senators a veto — known as a “blue slip” — over judges for appellate courts in their home states. "
893,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday backed away from his endorsement of a bipartisan Senate proposal to stabilize health insurance markets, throwing the legislative effort into doubt even as the chief architect of the deal predicted that it would become law before the end of the year. The latest actions by the White House confused Republicans on Capitol Hill and irked Democrats — but in the end, their effect was not clear. The effort to calm roiled insurance markets appears destined for a showdown in December, when supporters of the compromise, drafted by Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, will have the most leverage. The mixed signals began Tuesday, when Mr. Trump appeared to give his blessing to the deal to restore subsidies to health insurers that he said days before he would cut off. Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray agreed on legislation that would continue federal payments to insurance companies through 2019 to reimburse them for discounts that they are required to provide to millions of low-income people who have coverage under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. On Wednesday, the White House sent a different message. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said later that Mr. Trump did not support the deal in its current form but indicated that changes could win him over. “We want something that doesn’t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all Americans,” she said, adding that the deal was “a good step in the right direction.” "
894,"WASHINGTON — When Trump administration officials travel to Germany next month for United Nations climate change discussions, they will face a fundamental contradiction: how to negotiate the terms of a deal they say they’re walking away from. Like a spouse who demands a divorce but then continues to live at home, the relationship between the United States and other parties to the Paris agreement is, at best, awkward. The Trump administration has declared it will abandon the global climate change pact and make no effort to meet its voluntary target to curb planet-warming emissions. On Tuesday, President Trump repeated his claim that former President Barack Obama’s diplomats agreed to bad deals. “I will always put the needs of our country first,” Mr. Trump said. “That is why we are withdrawing from one-sided international deals,” he added, citing the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris agreement. Yet the United States cannot formally leave the accord until 2020, and in the interim administration officials have said they will continue to protect American interests, which essentially translates into helping to write the Paris agreement’s rule book. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have both dangled the possibility that some as-yet undefined improved terms might one day persuade the president to reconsider. "
895,"Good morning. Today’s introduction is by Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent based in Los Angeles. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) There has been no shortage of women eager to sign a letter denouncing a culture of sexual harassment in the state Capitol. After more than 140 initially lent their names, dozens more contacted organizers Tuesday asking to take part. In the letter and detailed comments to reporters, several lawmakers and lobbyists spoke of their experiences being groped and cornered by sexually aggressive men. Many were speaking out for the first time, but some had openly talked about their ordeals to friends and colleagues for years. But so far, none have publicly named the men doing the harassing. Women said the harassment in Sacramento has come from high-ranking staff members, experienced lobbyists and lawmakers. Few have filed formal complaints and even fewer have tried to press charges. In interviews, several women said they thought little good would come from naming specific men. They spoke of watching the intense scrutiny of Anita Hill in the 1990s when she testified against Clarence Thomas, now an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. (“She was a perfect lawyer from Yale,” one woman said. “If she was questioned, how much more for me?”) "
896,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. First: The bipartisan health care deal in the Senate, announced yesterday, is a very good deal. It undoes two of President Trump’s attempts to sabotage the law, by reinstating reimbursement payments to insurers and by encouraging people to sign up for insurance. It also gives states some more flexibility, a longtime conservative priority. Perhaps above all, it’s a sign that some leading Republicans are finally serious about trying to improve the health care system. The deal, John McCain said, “shows that good faith, bipartisan negotiations can achieve consensus on lasting reform.” Democratic-leaning experts were full of praise for it too, saying that, while it didn’t void all of Trump’s mischief, it was major progress. Jacob Leibenluft, a former Obama adviser, called the deal the “first concession” from Republicans that “they will own health care markets in 2018 and 2020.” The biggest caveat: The deal — between Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, and Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican — is still just a framework. It must pass both houses of Congress and be signed by Trump. An ugly, and close, campaign. Virginia and New Jersey are the only states to hold their governor elections the year after presidential elections, which turns the two states into gauges of a new president’s popularity. "
897,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s condolence call to the widow of a slain soldier exploded into a vicious row that swamped the White House on Wednesday, with the soldier’s grieving mother accusing the president of disrespecting her family and a defiant Mr. Trump complaining that his words had been cynically twisted for political purposes. The back-and-forth made a furious spectacle of what is, at the best of times, one of the most emotionally wrenching contacts between the commander in chief and a bereaved citizen. It overshadowed any talk of Mr. Trump’s legislative priorities and instead recalled his history of feuding with military families or even, as in the case of Senator John McCain, a war hero. Twelve days after four Americans were killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger, the president called the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, who was among the slain, and said that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” referring to the soldier only as “your guy,” according to Sergeant Johnson’s mother and a Democratic congresswoman, who both listened to the call. Mr. Trump angrily disputed that account, insisting that he “had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife, who sounded like a lovely woman.” The White House accused the congresswoman, Frederica S. Wilson of Florida, of politicizing a sacred ritual after Mr. Trump initially said she “fabricated” it. It was, to a great extent, a self-inflicted wound. Mr. Trump opened the issue on Monday when he deflected a question about why he had not spoken publicly about the deaths of the four soldiers by falsely accusing his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of not contacting the families of fallen troops. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump dragged his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, into the dispute. He told reporters that Mr. Obama had not called Mr. Kelly, a former Marine Corps general, when his son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in action in 2010 in Afghanistan. Mr. Kelly, who has long been reluctant to talk about the loss of his son, did not comment on the issue. "

A reminder: DealBook’s sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, is on Nov. 9. Want to join us? Apply to participate here. But should they be resting easy? Look at how the market reacted to the proposal by Senators Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander, to continue funding insurer subsidies for two years: But remember: • President Trump said that he supported the proposed compromise, although he could change his mind, and passage by Congress is far from assured. • The president also has let insurers sell cheaper, less comprehensive plans that could undermine the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges. Critics say that could lead to higher premiums for those who remain on exchange plans. One beneficiary of the new rules: UnitedHealth. • Bloomberg: Dan Schumacher, president of UnitedHealth’s insurance business, said the company was “excited” by the chance to offer short-term medical plans for as long as a year.

899,"While I was waiting to check out at the market, an older white woman in front of me turned to the black man behind me and said, “You look just like a young Gandhi. Has anyone told you that?” He said no. “Well, you do,” she said. “It’s wonderful!” When she resumed her place, he said, “That’s a new one.” He seemed dismayed. Clearly, this was not the first time a white person told him he looked like a famous person of color. I didn’t want to make his shopping any worse by confronting her, so I said nothing. Was I right? ANONYMOUS So many layers here! I wouldn’t have said anything to the older woman, either. You were all strangers. And it’s a pretty big assumption that she had fallen into an ugly “you all look the same to me” racist stereotype. (Not that she hadn’t just because she was pleasant.) There’s also no telling how she may have reacted to a comment from you. When it comes to confrontations with strangers, I subscribe largely to the Dionne Warwick model: “Walk On By.” But if the man was upset, you missed an opportunity. The older lady was in front, so presumably she left the store before you. After she exited, you might have said: “I’m sorry if she hurt your feelings with that Gandhi comment.” Then let the man respond, and take his lead. (Kindness to strangers is a clear exception to the Dionne Warwick rule.) Yet even absent any racial overlay, it’s a bad idea to comment on strangers’ looks or tell them whom they resemble. There are a million ways to be nice to people without objectifying them. And they may not care for the likeness you see. My husband and I are public interest lawyers. We own our home and paid for our daughter’s college education. We’re starting to have a decent nest egg for our retirement. Our daughter has begun a new relationship with a smart young man who could not afford to attend college. He recently had health problems, and now has medical bills he can’t pay. He and our daughter both earn $15 an hour, but he has no family to call on for help. Our daughter has asked us to pay off his bills. Should we? "
900,"The Federal Reserve’s inner workings are a mystery to most Americans. Presidents can’t order it around, nor can Congress — that much is generally believed. Along with its reputation for independence, the Fed can seem economically omnipotent. But in truth, our research shows, Fed independence is largely a myth. With President Trump having met with the Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen on Thursday as he considers new leadership, it’s worth examining the idea that the Fed is unfettered in making monetary policy. This notion misjudges the politics of its relationship with Congress. Instead, think of Congress and the Fed as interdependent institutions — a political relationship that constrains the Fed’s conduct. Why interdependent? Congress depends on the Fed to steer the economy and to absorb the blame when the economy falters. Repeated revisions or threats of revisions to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the law that created the Fed, have signaled the costs of failing to meet legislators’ expectations. At the same time, the Fed’s credibility and its capacity to carry out necessary, but often unpopular, policy hinges on maintaining broad political and public support. Otherwise, there’s the risk that Congress or the president may limit the Fed’s autonomy or undermine the economy with counterproductive fiscal policy. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 after the Fed failed to prevent the financial crisis is Exhibit A in a congressional blame game. Congress sought to deflect responsibility for the crisis by saddling the Fed with new regulatory responsibilities, even as it clipped its lender-of-last-resort power. Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul. Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both. Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher. "

902,"To the Editor: Re “U.S. Auto Giants Stake a Claim to a Future With Less Gasoline” (front page, Oct. 3): That American auto giants have decided to increase electric vehicle manufacturing even as the Trump administration slashes regulations and ignores science looks like a victory for free market demand. It is not. American automakers’ electric vehicle announcements are a response to regulations — just not American regulations. In this case, G.M. and Ford are responding to stricter Chinese and European emissions standards. In our global economy, America’s failure to adequately regulate industry, acknowledge truth or act as a responsible participant on the world stage does not build the United States’ bottom line or benefit our businesses. Instead, it just minimizes America’s influence in the world. The United States is handing the future to Europe and China on a gold-encrusted Mar-a-Lago platter. SAM ROCKWELL, MINNEAPOLIS "
903,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) In 2011, Jerry Brown, the newly minted governor, faced 870 bills to sign into law. Rejecting one that punished children for skiing without a helmet, he provided a glimpse into his thinking on government rule-making. “Not every human problem deserves a law,” he wrote. The bills have kept coming. With the 2017 legislative session now officially ended, Mr. Brown has signed nearly 6,000 measures over his latest two terms, according to government figures. Among the biggest this year were those intended to ease home building, fund road and bridge repairs with a gas tax, and adopt so-called sanctuary policies statewide. But as in 2011, the governor didn’t like everything he saw. He vetoed 118 out of 977 measures. Political analysts identified a few themes. “He puts the brakes, if you will, on the Legislature’s enthusiasm,” said Chris Micheli, a lobbyist who tracks bill-making in Sacramento. "

905,"WASHINGTON — The detention of a Turkish employee at the United States consulate in Istanbul, the subsequent United States decision to suspend the processing of nonimmigrant visas for Turks, followed by Turkey doing the same to Americans, has sunk United States-Turkish relations to a low point. It is important for the Turks and the Americans to question who stands to benefit from further deterioration of their strategic partnership. To ensure that the current crisis isn’t exploited by geopolitical rivals and strategic interests of the United States and Turkey don’t suffer, it is necessary to use diplomacy and pull the United States-Turkish relations out of their present impasse. The first step should be to insulate the American and Turkish people from the crisis. By denying visas to Turks, the United States has for the first time taken measures that affect ordinary Turks. The decision is aggravating existing resentments toward Turkey in the United States and fueling anti-Americanism in Turkey. Both nations should demonstrate greater sensitivity to each other’s concerns: Turkey needs the United States to show a more nuanced appreciation of its security concerns; the United States needs Turkey to show a strict commitment to governance by the rule of law. The alliance between Turkey and the United States goes back seven decades. Turkey, a NATO member since 1952, was a staunch ally of the West during the Cold War. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey contributed to peacekeeping efforts to stabilize the former Yugoslavia and later help repair churches, mosques, bridges and build schools in Bosnia. Turkey also helped build roads and schools for girls in Afghanistan after the United States intervention. In the 2000s Turkey took crucial steps to improve its democracy and economy that brought it close to European Union membership. The “Turkish Model” was widely praised as the way forward for Muslim countries aspiring for reform. The United States was constructively engaged in this process and saw Turkey as a critical pillar of the international liberal order. This policy ran through the Clinton, George W. Bush and a good part of the Obama administrations. "
906,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid political advertisements on television, on radio and in print have been subjected for years. An effort to change that begins today, when a bipartisan bill is to be introduced in the Senate to force Facebook, Google and other companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising. The proposal follows revelations that Russian-linked operatives bought deceptive ads before the 2016 election. For its part, the tech industry — which has fought previous efforts to require such disclosures — is mobilizing lobbyists and lawyers to help shape regulations. We noted on Wednesday that President Trump had indicated support for a Senate proposal that would stabilize health insurance markets by offering short-term funding for subsidies to insurers. Hours later, the president backed away from that endorsement, saying he could “never support bailing out” insurance companies. "
907,"Will President Trump’s assault on the norms underpinning constitutional democracy permanently alter American political life? On a daily basis, Trump tests the willingness of the public to accept a president who lies as a matter of routine. So far, Trump has persuaded a large swath of America to swallow what he feeds them. Asked whether the media makes up stories about Trump, nearly half the population of the United States, 46 percent, now says yes, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted Oct. 12-16. This compares to 37 percent who say that the media does not fabricate material about the president. While Republicans and Democrats diverge in the directions you would expect, a plurality of independents, 44 percent, says that the media produces false stories; 31 percent say the media is accurate. Trump has flourished at a time when trust in basic institutions — organized religion, banks, medical services, Congress, the media, government, you name it — has eroded. His presidency is a product of this erosion, but it is also proving to be an accelerant of the process. Eight days after Trump was elected, Clare Malone, a senior political writer for the website FiveThirtyEight, put it this way: Or, as Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk write in the July 2016 issue of the Journal of Democracy: The danger, they argue, cannot be underestimated: Trump is the most prominent of the right-wing populist politicians continuing to gain strength both here and in Europe (despite some electoral setbacks), but because the viewpoint he represents is now so widespread, he is in one sense personally irrelevant — a symptom rather than a cause. As Sasha Polakow-Suransky, the author of “Go Back to Where You Came From: The Backlash Against Immigration and the Fate of Western Democracy,” warns in The New York Review of Books: The threat to democracy posed by the current outbreak of populist nationalism has become a matter of concern for both scholars and ordinary citizens. The central topic at a conference at Yale earlier this month was “How Do Democracies Fall Apart,” and the subject will be taken up again in November at a Stanford conference called “Global Populisms: A Threat to Democracy?” "
908,"WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain and two Democratic senators moved on Thursday to force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, after revelations that Russian-linked operatives bought deceptive ads in the run-up to the 2016 election with no disclosure required. But the tech industry, which has worked to thwart previous efforts to mandate such disclosure, is mobilizing an army of lobbyists and lawyers — including a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign — to help shape proposed regulations. Long before the 2016 election, the adviser, Marc E. Elias, helped Facebook and Google request exemptions from the Federal Election Commission to existing disclosure rules, arguing that ads on the respective platforms were too small to fit disclaimers listing their sponsors. Now Mr. Elias’s high-powered Democratic election law firm, Perkins Coie, is helping the companies navigate legal and regulatory issues arising from scrutiny of the Russian-linked ads, which critics say might have been flagged by the disclaimers. In a two-front war, tech companies are targeting an election commission rule-making process that was restarted last month and a legislative effort in the Senate. “I’m not going to tell you they support this bill right now,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and the lead author of the proposed Honest Ads Act. But she and her co-author, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, urged the social media companies to take greater responsibility for the content that lands on their sites, including political ads and other content meant to sow discord or chaos. With Facebook and Google alone capturing an estimated 85 percent of all digital political ads, self-policing won’t cut it, they said. “They have to realize the world has changed,” Ms. Klobuchar said. Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid television, radio and print political advertising has been subject for years. The Federal Election Commission justified the so-called internet exemption rule by declaring the internet “a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.” "
909,"Capt. Gabriel Lorca (Jason Isaacs), who commands the starship that gives “Star Trek: Discovery” its title, injured his eyes in a battle. This requires him to work in a dimmed light that gives his vessel the techno-noir moodiness of a dystopian dance club. In the fifth episode, his old friend Admiral Cornwell (Jayne Brook) asked him what I’d been wondering: “Why don’t you get your damn eyes fixed?” Lorca had a cagey answer — “I don’t trust doctors.” But the situation sums up “Star Trek: Discovery,” which streams Sundays on CBS All Access. It’s dark — literally and figuratively dark, in the way that ambitious dramas are nowadays. But it’s not clear if all that murk is entirely necessary or productive. “Discovery” has brought the 50-year-old franchise — transporters, replicators and all — into the present by moving into its past, a decade before the events of the original series. The series began with a visually striking two-episode head-fake, which found Capt. Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) and her First Officer, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) in familiar “Trek” territory, on a mission of exploration. It turned into a battle, as a run-in with the hostile Klingons led to Georgiou’s death and all-out war. Burnham was imprisoned on mutiny charges for her actions in the Klingon attack, then conscripted aboard Lorca’s Discovery. The ship’s scientific research has been commandeered for military purposes — especially its experimental “spore drive,” designed by the “astromycologist” Lt. Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp), which uses a galactic network of fungi. (How far “Star Trek” has come! “Traveling across the universe on mushrooms” would have signified something far different in 1967.)

910,"STALIN
Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941
By Stephen Kotkin
Illustrated. 1,154 pp. Penguin Press. $40. Dictators lend themselves to caricature. We label them sociopaths, paranoiacs or just victims of bad childhoods. We flatten them in order to explain our own times. Saddam Hussein is Hitler; Vladimir Putin is Peter the Great; Donald Trump is Mussolini. Sometimes, we are told, they simply defy explanation. In a 1939 radio address, Winston Churchill conceded defeat in his efforts to understand Stalin’s Soviet Union. “It is,” Churchill said, “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” Stephen Kotkin demolishes such simplicities in his monumental “Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941,” the second part of a projected three-volume biography of the Soviet leader whose reign of cruelty stretched from the mid-1920s to his death in 1953. Drawing on an astonishing array of sources, Kotkin paints a richly variegated portrait, delving into Stalin’s peculiar personality even while situating him within the trajectories of Soviet history and totalitarianism more generally. This multilayered analysis has a downside: The densely packed, 1,154-page tome — roughly a page for every four days of the period it covers — is no easy read. Yet the book unquestionably rewards the patience that it demands. Slowly but inexorably, Kotkin teases out his subject’s contradictions, revealing Stalin as both ideologue and opportunist, man of iron will and creature of the Soviet system, creep who apparently drove his wife to suicide and leader who inspired his people. And a compelling central thread holds it all together: Stalin’s unwavering determination to transform his country into a fully Communist nation capable of holding its own in a world of hostile powers. “Stalin did what acclaimed leaders do,” Kotkin writes. “He articulated and drove toward a consistent goal, in his case a powerful state backed by a unified society that eradicated capitalism and built industrial socialism.” An eminent scholar of Soviet history at Princeton University, Kotkin picks up where he left off in Volume 1 — the eve of Stalin’s 1929 decision to collectivize Soviet agriculture — and carries his story down to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union on June 21, 1941. The narrative moves forward, though, in three distinct stages that highlight different facets of Stalin’s rule. The first section focuses on the Communist Party’s drive to abolish private landholding in the Soviet countryside from 1929 into the early 1930s. Aiming to feed a growing urban work force and increase exports, Stalin’s henchmen forced peasants onto collective farms and eliminated relatively well-off peasants known as kulaks. The human consequences were, in Kotkin’s word, nothing short of an “apocalypse.” Famine resulting from social upheaval and drought killed between five million and seven million people, while five million kulaks were arrested, deported or murdered. "
911,"With recent powerful hurricanes having battered Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands and the West still coping with widely destructive wildfires, the need for action on climate change has never been more obvious. It’s going to take a strenuous, persistent effort at all levels, including international cooperation; federal, state and local action, and private-sector commitments and follow-through. Leaders in the auto industry get this, if their public comments are any indication. This month, Mary Barra, the chief executive, of General Motors, announced her company’s plans to move toward a zero-emissions future with new electric vehicle options. In a letter accompanying the company’s 2016-17 sustainability report, Jim Hackett, the chief executive of Ford, and William Ford, the automaker’s executive chairman, declared their company was “absolutely committed” to reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency. In an increasingly climate-conscious global market, these industry leaders assure us they’re part of the solution. And they need to be: The transportation sector is now the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the United States. But the efforts of the auto industry’s lobbyists in Washington tell a different story. They are trying to undermine one of the country’s most successful policies to fight global warming: the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards that are designed to roughly double the miles per gallon of our passenger car fleet by 2025. G.M., Ford and other automakers agreed to these standards in 2010, but now industry allies in Congress have introduced legislation that would weaken them, and the Trump administration has “reopened” these standards for review, an ominous first step to potentially gutting them and stalling progress on cleaner cars and a healthier environment. As a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and a former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, we know firsthand how important and challenging it is to build good public policies — and why it’s shortsighted to roll back a policy that’s working. According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, since the standards went into effect in 2010, they have saved drivers more than $47 billion on fuel. If we stay the course, the benefits are enormous: By 2030, we’ll cut our oil use by 2.4 million barrels every day, and drivers will save $6,000 over the life of their vehicles. These standards will also reduce global warming emissions by 280 million metric tons and are projected to create 650,000 jobs. "
912,"It isn’t hard to guess who John McCain had in mind when, in a speech on Monday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia — the finest speech of his storied political career — he denounced the “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.” It’s easy to guess, too, the names of the Senate and House Republicans Stephen Bannon had in mind when, at a Values Voter Summit in Washington over the weekend, he declared “a season of war against the G.O.P. establishment.” McCain and Bannon are the antipodes of the Republican Party. The institutionalist versus the insurgent. The internationalist versus the America Firster. The maverick versus the ideologue. Above all, the hedgehog versus the honey badger. The hedgehog, said the Greek poet Archilochus, knows one big thing. McCain knows honor. He refused early release from prison camp in Hanoi to save his honor. He reproved Republican voters for calling Barack Obama an Arab in 2008 to save his party’s honor. He championed the surge in Iraq when it was least popular, to save the country’s honor. He paid for all of it and will be remembered as a giant among dwarves because of it. Right now, McCain, his allies and their ideas appear to be a waning force in the Republican Party. They are RINOs, cucks, and “globalists.” Many of them, like Tennessee’s Bob Corker, will retire rather than face bruising primary challenges from the ever-farther right. On Monday McCain called America “the land of the immigrant’s dream,” and said: “We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil.” To a large and growing segment of the G.O.P., which thinks magnanimity is for losers, these statements amount to a form of treason. The honey badger, by contrast, will do anything to get what it wants. It is wily, nasty and has as much use for honor as a pornographer has for dress. In the 2016 presidential campaign, according to biographer Joshua Green, Bannon treated white supremacists as useful fellow travelers and urged Donald Trump to persist in what seemed to many to be his use of anti-Jewish tropes. Later he waged a smear campaign against H.R. McMaster on the grounds that the national security adviser was anti-Israel. "
913,"The rising stock market has recently become one of President Trump’s favorite tropes. “Stock market has increased by 5.2 trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25 percent increase,” he tweeted on Oct. 16. Yet, for most Americans, the larger issue is that this upturn is seldom felt. An equity inequity has driven America’s wealth gap to historic levels. Eighty percent of Americans own only 8 percent of the nation’s stocks. One-third of Americans have saved nothing for their retirement. The scale of the challenge calls for ambitious initiatives to put asset-building power and retirement security into the hands of all Americans. Instead, Republicans and Democrats have played to type, even when all evidence points to the failure of both the traditional left and the traditional right solutions. If anyone wonders why Americans have lost faith in government, the sad saga of the myRA program tells the tale. The recent announcement by Treasury Department that it will shut down this Obama-era program marked the end of a story that began, as is so often the case in government, with the best intentions. The Obama administration announced the myRA program in January 2014 as a no-fee, no-minimum-investment version of a Roth individual retirement account to address the real challenges of Americans without access to an employer-based 401(k) retirement program. The myRA sounded like a good idea. Qualifying workers could put up to $5,500 a year into the account — or $6,500 if they were over 50 years old — which would be invested in government bonds, guaranteeing a modest but dependable return. "
914,"It is a commonly accepted rule among those who are in the business of argument, especially online, that he or she who invokes Adolf Hitler, either in oratory or essays, automatically forfeits the argument. The reference is deemed far too extreme, too explosive, too far beyond rational correlation. No matter how bad a present-day politician, not one of them has charted or is charting a course to exterminate millions of innocent people as an act of ethnic cleansing. Hitler stands alone in this regard, without rival, a warning to the world about how evil and lethal human beings can be, a warning that what he did can never be allowed again. That said, there are strategies that Hitler used to secure power and rise — things that allowed his murderous reign — that can teach us about political theory and practice. And very reasonable and sage comparisons can be drawn between Hitler’s strategies and those of others. One of those lessons is about how purposeful lying can be effectively used as propaganda. The forthcoming comparison isn’t to Hitler the murderer, but to Hitler the liar. According to James Murphy’s translation of Hitler’s “Mein Kampf”: “In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.” "
915,"The new bipartisan health proposal is far from a cure-all for Obamacare’s problems, but if it passed it would send health insurers a message they have sought all year: that it’s safe to stay in the marketplaces. Insurers have already signed contracts and are making final arrangements to sell their products in time for next year’s enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1. Though the proposal would guarantee payments to health insurers that President Trump canceled last week, and restore funding for Obamacare advertising that his Health and Human Services Department slashed, those changes would probably come too late to lower insurance prices or increase sign-ups significantly. But the deal proposed this week by Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, and Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, has reassured insurance executives. It is aimed at quieting nervous markets and making clear that the Obamacare market will exist beyond this year. “It’s the first signal we’ve seen in a long time to insurers that the government is not going to actively disrupt the market,” said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. While two years of funding may not be critical to the market’s stability, it shows “there is some future market,” he said. A widely circulated draft of the proposed legislation has attracted both compliments and scorn from the president. The legislation is intended to lower premiums and encourage insurer participation. It would guarantee federal payments to insurance companies to offer plans to low-income individuals that reduce their out-of-pocket costs through 2019. The loss of those payments has sent insurance premiums soaring, and is likely to increase federal spending on a different form of Obamacare subsidy, used to help middle-income Americans pay their insurance premiums. It would make it easier for state governments to tweak Obamacare’s rules on how they run their markets, easing the way for more experiments. The draft bill would make the application process for such “state innovation waivers” easier to complete, but would still require that the state plans cover a similar number of residents and offer insurance with “comparable affordability” to plans established under the Affordable Care Act.

919,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has picked Joseph J. Simons, a veteran antitrust lawyer who has represented tech giants like Microsoft, to lead the Federal Trade Commission at a time of broad bipartisan concern over corporate consolidation and big deals in the waiting, the White House said Thursday. Mr. Trump has also chosen Noah Phillips, chief counsel for Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Rohit Chopra, a fellow at a consumer advocacy group, to fill the remaining two seats at the agency, said Natalie M. Strom, assistant press secretary at the White House. The consumer protection and competition agency has been led by just two commissioners over the last 10 months. Mr. Trump’s other leading antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, was recently confirmed to lead competition cases at the Justice Department. The timing of the official nominations is unclear. They will be reviewed by Congress but are expected to be approved. Under Mr. Simons, who led the competition bureau of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration, the agency is expected take a free-markets and conservative approach to antitrust issues, maintaining decades-long interpretations of competition laws that put consumer welfare and the efficiencies of markets at the center of enforcement actions and merger reviews. But the traditional antitrust perspective could be tested by new skepticism over the power of big internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. Politicians from both parties, and many consumer interest advocates and academics, have called for greater restraints on tech companies that have quickly expanded their dominance in digital advertising, commerce and public opinion, as seen with the role social media firms like Facebook and Twitter played in the 2016 presidential election.

He told The Associated Press on Wednesday, “I think we can all agree that equity in education can help effect change that we all want to see in this country.” Long, the son of the Hall of Famer and broadcaster Howie Long, has been involved in charity and activism for some time. He started a foundation two years ago that supports causes including assuring access to clean water worldwide, fighting homelessness, supporting veterans and helping children in need. Long, who is white, drew attention this season for putting his arm around his black teammate Malcolm Jenkins, who raised his fist during the national anthem to protest discrimination and police brutality. A member of the champion Patriots last season when they won the Super Bowl, Long was among several members of the team who chose to stay away from its White House visit with President Trump. “Some people are tired of hearing me tweet because they want me to stick to football but I like to use social media like I was a regular guy because I think I am,” Long told NBC Sports Philadelphia in August. “I don’t tell people to stick to their job when they want to talk politics.” Referring to neo-Nazis marching in his hometown, he said: “For me, being from Charlottesville, no one wants to see you sit idly by and watch that stuff happen and not say anything. And I wish there was more categorical denial from some very important people in this country who have had the opportunity to strike it down but didn’t.” "
921,"Neither of them mentioned President Trump by name but two of his predecessors emerged from political seclusion on Thursday to deliver what sounded like pointed rebukes of the current occupant of the Oval Office and the forces of division that propelled him to power. In separate and unrelated appearances, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both warned that the United States was being torn apart by ancient hatreds that should have been consigned to history long ago and called for addressing economic anxiety through common purpose. While not directly addressing Mr. Trump, neither left much doubt whom and what they had in mind. Mr. Bush, the last Republican to hold the White House, spoke out at a conference he convened in New York to support democracy, noting that America first had to “recover our own identity” in the face of challenges to its most basic ideals. While Mr. Trump seeks to raise barriers to trade and newcomers, lashing out at targets with relish, Mr. Bush defended immigration and free trade, denounced nationalism and bigotry and bemoaned what he called the “casual cruelty” of current public discourse. “We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Mr. Bush said. “We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. We’ve seen the return of isolationist sentiments, forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places.” Mr. Obama was more circumspect, returning to the campaign trail for the first time since leaving office to support Democrats running for governor in New Jersey and Virginia. His speeches were mostly get-out-the-vote pleas, but he defended his record on health care at a time when Mr. Trump has been trying to dismantle it, and he, too, pointed to the social, economic and racial schisms cleaving American society. “What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before that dates back centuries,” Mr. Obama told a campaign rally for Philip D. Murphy in Newark. “Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed. That has folks looking 50 years back. It’s the 21st century, not the 19th century. Come on!” "
922,"The other morning, after too little sleep and with too much to do, Jenna Bush Hager found herself dragging, and kicked herself for it. “I almost called myself Low-Energy Jenna,” she told me. Ring a bell? Low-Energy Jeb was Donald Trump’s taunting nickname for her uncle during the 2016 campaign. I asked her and her twin sister, Barbara, what they made of that. “A bit like bullying on the playground,” Jenna said. “We’d seen it before, but we were in the first grade.” She smiled, then winced, wondering aloud if she’d just been too political, given her job on the “Today” show. “I don’t know,” Barbara said. “I’m not with NBC.” Jenna the irrepressible blonde. Barbara the reserved brunette. In that one exchange, the only two people alive who are both children and grandchildren of American presidents played to the stereotypes that they were assigned long ago. But not during the rest of a recent lunch near their homes in downtown Manhattan. It was Barbara who told me with little hesitation that she’d voted for Hillary Clinton and Jenna who demurred. Jenna’s answers were often the thoughtful mini-essays while Barbara naughtily thrust her smartphone at me to display the text messages that their father, the second President Bush, routinely sends them. Those missives included memes: a cartoon bunny that blew kisses before the words “I Love You” exploded like a Roman candle; a snippet of Jason Alexander as George Costanza in “Seinfeld.” There were long, silly strings of colorful, silly icons.

In a public relations mission that was part emotional catharsis and part political attack, Mr. Kelly lashed out at Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, for publicizing the call between Mr. Trump and Myeshia Johnson, whose husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, was one of four American soldiers killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. Mr. Kelly accused Ms. Wilson — who was in a car with Ms. Johnson when Mr. Trump called and is a longtime family friend — of being a publicity-seeking opportunist. He said that the congresswoman’s willingness to breach the confidentiality of Mr. Trump’s words is evidence of a broader decline in the values of an American society that no longer treats women, religion, “life” or Gold Star families as sacred. “It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation — absolutely stuns me,” Mr. Kelly said during a somber, 18-minute appearance in the White House briefing room. He said that he was so upset by Ms. Wilson’s appearances on TV news shows that he had to collect his thoughts by walking through the graves at Arlington National Cemetery for more than an hour. Late Thursday night, Mr. Trump assailed Ms. Wilson in a tweet, accusing her of listening “SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!” "
925,"JERUSALEM — With Egypt brokering a reconciliation between the two rival Palestinian factions, President Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East visited Cairo on Thursday to help move those talks along while trying to ensure that the Egyptians do not take them in a direction unacceptable to the United States and Israel. Hamas, the militant Islamic group that seized power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 and has run it ever since, agreed in Cairo last week to return administrative control of the impoverished coastal territory to the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. The Oct. 12 agreement calls for the Palestinian Authority to lift sanctions that it imposed on Gaza this year to pressure Hamas by cutting electricity supplies to a few hours a day and slashing payment of government salaries. Hamas, in turn, is to give the authority control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, opening up a critical lifeline for imports and for outside travel. But the pact was really an agreement to start talking: The more troublesome issues between Hamas and Mr. Abbas’s Fatah faction — including the merger of two separate work forces in Gaza, and what is to become of the estimated 25,000 Hamas fighters, their arsenal of rockets and network of tunnels — were left for later. For the Trump administration, which has hopes of achieving a grand Israeli-Palestinian bargain, Egypt’s efforts with Hamas and Fatah provided a potentially crucial opening to solve the problem of Gaza, which many see as a prerequisite to reviving the peace process. A key question is whether the talks in Cairo will give Hamas, which the United States designates as a terrorist organization, influence over a consolidated Palestinian government of both the West Bank and Gaza Strip — and how much. "
926,"A wave of asylum seekers entering Canada this year has exacerbated a backlog of refugee claims that the government is struggling to manage, leaving tens of thousands of people stuck in bureaucratic limbo even as they try to build new lives. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board says it has a backlog of 40,700 cases. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have crossed illegally into Quebec from the United States since July alone. But the board has the money and staff to process just 24,000 cases a year, meaning that many people will have to wait around 16 months for their case to be heard. “The strain on the organization to handle this many people’s hearings is enormous,” Shereen Benzvy Miller, the head of the board’s refugee protection division, told a parliamentary immigrations committee this month. “The math is clear,” she added. “Unless you put more resources to this problem, then it takes longer time to schedule, so there will be longer wait times.” The delay also increases the amount of money Canada spends on asylum seekers’ medical care, education and public assistance, said Richard Kurland, a former national chairman of the Canadian Bar Association’s citizenship and immigration section. “The longer they stay, the more Canadians pay,” he said. The immigration board set up a special task force in August to respond to the influx of asylum seekers who crossed illegally into Quebec. By the end of September, the task force had finalized around 300 claims, rejecting about 50 percent of them. "
927,"At the start of a City Council meeting in Ann Arbor, Mich., this week, the 11 elected officials who represent the city’s residents turned to the flag for the Pledge of Allegiance. Seven of them stood. Four of them knelt on one knee. It was the latest manifestation of a gesture that has spread in the United States in the last year, migrating from its first appearance on the football field to concert stages, schools and sports arenas, even crossing borders to places including soccer fields in Germany, where athletes have knelt as a protest against racism. But along the way, the question about what it means — and what it does not mean — has been continually challenged. Some supporters defend it as a peaceful way to object to racial and social injustice. Others say it shows a lack of patriotism or support for those in the military who have fought to defend the country. The controversy over the pose reached the White House, where President Trump called it an act of “disrespect” during the playing of the national anthem. As the gesture became the subject of national conversation, it also took root on the local level. In New York City on Sept. 27, 16 City Council members knelt in front of City Hall. On Oct. 10, more than a dozen people knelt during the Pledge of Allegiance during a San Diego City Council meeting, partly over incidents of racial profiling there, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. At the Ann Arbor council meeting on Monday, there was general business at hand: medical marijuana licensing, whether a deer cull would affect property owners, and locations for solar panels. "
928,"Two weeks ago, my smartphone shut down because of a low battery as I was about to board a flight to Europe. That seemed odd, given that I had barely used it that day. I plugged it in on the plane, but seven hours later, it still wasn’t functioning. When I arrived at my hotel I tried a different charger, to no avail. The phone was dead — terminally so, it turned out. I hadn’t brought a laptop, so I had no access to the internet or email. I had no camera, no guidebooks, no maps. I took a deep breath and decided to make the best of it. I’m hardly a smartphone addict. I rarely look at social media. I had happily traveled in Europe in the years before cellphones. I decided to emulate the movie star Eddie Redmayne, who last year said he had given up his smartphone in order to live “in the moment.” For the next 10 days I lived without my phone or any other connection to the digital world. There were indeed many compensations. But it was hard to shake a free-floating anxiety that some disaster loomed. (How would I retrieve my return flight reservations from a nonworking cellphone?) Lately the big internet companies have come under a barrage of criticism for invading privacy, carrying fake news, spreading hate messages (and selling ads against them) and undermining American democracy. What I learned is that, for better or worse, they have already so changed the world that life without them is all but impossible outside a monastery. Road maps, a mainstay of my pre-cellphone trips to Europe, were nowhere to be found, nor were the bookstores that used to sell them. The rental car agency in Milan offered a guide for getting out of the airport, but that was about it. Everyone assumes you have access to Google Maps. "
929,"To the Editor: Re “Condolence Call to Widow Ignites Trump Imbroglio” (front page, Oct. 19): The fact that President Trump did not acknowledge the deaths of four servicemen in Niger until asked about it 12 days later was certain to raise legitimate questions regarding his sensitivity. But Mr. Trump seems to have no sense of when and how to put controversy to rest and when not to be combative. Whether it’s North Korea, the National Football League, Puerto Rico or now condolences, the president can be relied on to maximize and sustain controversy. His job as commander in chief is to dampen controversy, not incite. ROGER HIRSCHBERG
BONDVILLE, VT. To the Editor: Your report of another presidential misspeak degrades your journalistic standard. Truth be told, it’s not a front-page story, just a gossipy attempt to satisfy a much larger quest. In 2016 the media warned voters that Donald Trump was unfit to be president. The voters didn’t listen. The Times and other media have never stopped taking every opportunity to validate that Mr. Trump is not just unfit, but despicable as well. The current reporting model feeds the nation’s frustration about and loathing of Mr. Trump. Confidence in our system of government is already wounded — we allowed a train wreck to become the president. Anti-Trump venting as the reporting model is tiresome and will become intolerable for another three years. We made a big mistake, and you remind us of that daily. It’s time for a reset. Stick with the big stories, and stop dignifying Mr. Trump by reporting his insults, lies and stupid phone calls. WILLIAM GOLDMAN
PALOS VERDES ESTATES, CALIF. To the Editor: The name of “the woman” is Myeshia Johnson. While watching the television coverage of “him,” taking no responsibility for his actions regarding his phone call to the recently widowed Mrs. Johnson, I did not once hear him refer to her by name. “Had a very nice conversation with the woman.” “Sounded like a lovely woman.” He is alleged to have not even known the name of her husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, during his phone call to Mrs. Johnson. First he disrespects a fallen American soldier, then compounds the insult by not referring to his widow by her name and denying accounts of the conversation. The guy is not only a supremely insensitive liar; he can’t even lie competently. PAUL IREMONGER, SEATTLE To the Editor: I agree with the expert quoted in your article that President Trump was not purposefully disrespectful, but merely clumsy, when speaking to Sgt. La David T. Johnson’s widow. He is simply inarticulate. And, yes, he lacks the kind of intelligence that promotes tact, sensitivity and good taste. But, hey, nobody’s perfect! GILBERT SCHECHTMAN

Michael Warren in The Weekly Standard: Mr. Warren gives President Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to interpreting what he intended in his comments to the widow of Sgt. La David T.

In 2004, her father, a Marine Corps helicopter pilot, was shot down in Iraq. She explains how she received a letter from President George W. Bush but “we didn’t get a phone call from the president, and we didn’t expect to.” It’s not protocol for presidents to reach out to families directly, unless the death is high profile. “Bickering over this kind of protocol,” she warns, “rarely ends well.” Read more » _____ Rich Lowry in National Review: According to Mr. Lowry, the uproar on both sides of the aisle over this issue is misguided. Mr. Trump may have been right that President Obama didn’t call each family of a fallen soldier, but he was nonetheless wrong to “use that point as a bludgeon.” Mr. Lowry adds that while the president’s reported comments to the family of Sergeant. Johnson sounded “horrible in isolation,” there’s no way to properly judge without hearing the entire phone call in context. Moreover, Mr. Lowry believes that controversies over condolence calls should be entirely left “out of our poisonous political debate.” Read more » "
931,"WASHINGTON — Almost no one on or off Capitol Hill has seen the tax overhaul bill that Republicans are drafting behind closed doors. Congressional staff members have not settled on many key details. Yet party leaders are preparing to move ahead on a timeline even more aggressive than their unsuccessful attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The swift pace to complete, release and quickly vote on a tax cut is aimed at leaving little time for the type of dissent that has scuttled previous tax proposals. Senators approved a budget resolution for the 2018 fiscal year on Thursday night, setting up a rapid series of hearings and votes with the aim of getting a bill to President Trump by Christmas. Republicans have been meeting for weeks in closed-door sessions to debate details of the tax plan, including two half-day retreats for House members late last month. House leaders will hold two smaller-group sessions next week, scheduled to last three to four hours each. The speed is striking — and strategic — for tax legislation that lobbyists believe could span 1,000 pages. Republicans hope the breakneck pace will help hold their narrow Senate majority together against what will almost certainly be a deluge of lobbying and Democratic criticism. The last major tax overhaul, which passed in 1986, took nearly 11 months from introduction to presidential signature. "
932,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Chief of Staff John Kelly made a somber appearance in the White House briefing room. In an emotional defense of President Trump’s much-criticized call to an Army widow, he said he had told the president what he was told when he was informed of his own son’s combat death in 2010: “He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were, because we were at war.” He said that Mr. Trump was trying to make the same point in conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson this week. Here’s the full video and transcript of Mr. Kelly’s remarks. _____ 2. On Capitol Hill, Senator John McCain and two Democrats moved to force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing political ads. "
933,"WASHINGTON — Mitch McConnell and Lamar Alexander go way back. The two Southern Republicans met in Washington in 1969 when Mr. Alexander was a promising young aide at the Nixon White House and Mr. McConnell an up-and-coming legislative assistant to Senator Marlow W. Cook of Kentucky. The story goes that Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. suggested to Mr. Alexander, his fellow Tennessean, that he should look up Mr. McConnell, that he was a “smart young man and I think you’d like him.” A nearly 50-year friendship and political alliance was born. In his book “The Long Game,” Mr. McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, says of Mr. Alexander: “Lamar would go on to become one of my closest confidantes and a very good friend.” Not many people are considered a close, let alone the closest, confidant of the notoriously reticent leader. But deep friendship aside, Mr. McConnell will be extremely cautious in moving ahead with the health care compromise that Mr. Alexander struck with Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, in an effort to stabilize the insurance exchanges for those buying coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And considering that President Trump is giving mixed signals on the proposal and that many Republicans in both the Senate and House are already opposed to it, the outlook for the rare bipartisan deal is murky at best. With Mr. McConnell’s blessing, Mr. Alexander engaged in a concerted effort to find a compromise with Ms. Murray, the senior Democrat on the health committee that Mr. Alexander leads. The goal was for Congress to officially appropriate the subsidies paid to make insurance more affordable for lower-income Americans while giving states more freedom in regulating insurance — an approach favored by Republicans. The subsidies, estimated at $7 billion this year, were challenged in federal court by the House in 2014 and found unconstitutional because Congress had not approved them. Mr. Trump announced last week that he was cutting them off and Mr. Alexander said he feared millions of people could now find insurance out of their financial reach. "
934,"WASHINGTON — The Senate’s proposed budget blueprint stretches 93 pages, sketching out trillions of dollars in spending over the coming decade on areas ranging from the military to Medicare. But perhaps all that really matters — and why senators are preparing to stay up late on Thursday night — is a few sentences buried deep into the document. A pair of congressional committees, it says, are to come up with “changes in laws within its jurisdiction” that would increase the deficit by not more than $1.5 trillion over a decade. On those few cryptic words rest the success or failure of President Trump’s top legislative goal, overhauling the tax code. (Another parliamentary instruction could pave the way for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling — another potential flash point down the line.) The rest, even Republicans admit, is filler. “Everything in here can be ignored, basically,” Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia and a member of the Budget Committee, said at a meeting of the panel this month. He described the budget process as “a fraud being perpetrated on the American people.” The budget resolution does do one big thing: It unlocks special procedures that will allow Congress to pass a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul with only Republican votes. It is the same approach that Republicans used in their failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. "
935,"WASHINGTON — The envelope was innocuous enough, addressed to me at the “NY Times” in New York, though some soul in the mail department had obviously opened it, marked it “personal” and forwarded it to our Washington office. It was May 3 — five months ago. I was strangely happy to receive the letter, since most hate mail comes via email and Twitter, and handwritten (or hand-typed) letters — at least the ones that aren’t from people in correctional facilities — usually say nice things. Wrong. “Dear Helene: You have the worst wardrobe of all the newscasters, male or female, on all of the networks and cable channels. Could you PLEASE get some help and start wearing jackets to cover up your fat arms? Could you not wear beach wear on Sunday a.m. talk shows? What are you thinking? Get a consultant to help you, please!!” It was signed: “A viewer who is driven insane by your attire.” What the heck? Okay, so I am not Tyra Banks, but I have always considered myself a fashionista by the low standards of the print journalism profession. That was one of the reasons I went the newspaper route instead of TV. I had taken a TV course in college and realized quickly that the time I was spending working to modulate my voice, put on lipstick and pour myself into shift dresses was time away from actual reporting. I quickly scurried back to print, where I — alongside my kinky locks, dangly earrings and cargo pants paired with Prada-outlet-purchased heels — was not only accepted but viewed as fashionable. Except now, as more print newspaper reporters are showing up on TV talking about stories, new avenues of criticism are opening up. It’s not just emails complaining that I spelled “sergeant” wrong or called a Marine “soldier.” (I cover the Pentagon so there’s a lot of that in my bloopers file.) "
936,"LONDON — An opposition lawmaker called on the British government on Thursday to investigate suspicions of Russian interference in Britain’s referendum on quitting the European Union, adding that there were “questions” about Arron Banks, one of the chief financial backers of the leave campaign. Speaking in Parliament, the lawmaker, Ben Bradshaw of the Labour Party, said there was “widespread concern over foreign, and particularly Russian, interference in Western democracies.” He asked for assurances that “all the resources spent in the referendum campaign were from permissible sources.” Mr. Bradshaw’s intervention follows the publication of what he called “very worrying” reports “on the role of dark money” in the plebiscite, which was held in June 2016 and in which 52 percent of those who voted opted to leave. Those who opposed Britain’s withdrawal, or Brexit, argued during the referendum that it would delight Moscow by weakening the European Union, which placed sanctions on Russia. But no links to Russian money have been proved. The investigative reports into the financing of the leave campaign were published by the Open Democracy website and included a detailed examination of Mr. Banks’s finances. Mr. Banks is a friend and political ally of Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party and one of President Trump’s biggest supporters in Britain. A businessman who made his money from insurance, Mr. Banks is thought to have spent about $12 million in cash, loans and other support for Brexit causes. He was the primary supporter of Leave.EU, for which Mr. Farage campaigned. "
937,"YANGON, Myanmar — Nearly a decade into Myanmar’s transition out of military rule, the country’s once-celebrated transition toward democracy is hardening into something very different from what activists and world leaders had hoped for. Citizens select their leaders, but without the robust institutions or norms like pluralism, universal rights or tolerance necessary for democracy to function. They express, in surveys and social media, desire for a strongman-style leader and raw majority rule. Democracy, many say, should be guided by religious strictures and nationalism. The military’s ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group, is popular, as are social controls against journalists and minorities. The civilian state, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, is rapidly centralizing power as checks and balances erode. It is growing oppressive in some areas and weak in others, ceding public space to extremists. Meanwhile, the military still controls important government functions and a perpetual quota of Parliament seats. The country appears to be converging on a democratic-authoritarian hybrid, formally known as illiberal democracy, which often resembles mob rule. It is a version of majority rule that excludes minorities, curtails freedoms and governs arbitrarily. "
938,"John F. Kelly, President Trump’s chief of staff, delivered an emotional statement on Thursday in the White House briefing room, defending Mr. Trump’s call to the widow of a slain soldier and responding to criticism from Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida. The following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by the White House. For further coverage of Mr. Kelly’s statement, read here » _______ JOHN F. KELLY, White House chief of staff: Well, thanks a lot. And it is a more serious note, so I just wanted to perhaps make more of a statement than an — give more of an explanation in what amounts to be a traditional press interaction. Most Americans don’t know what happens when we lose one of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, our Coast Guardsmen in combat. So let me tell you what happens: Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud, puts them on a helicopter as a routine, and sends them home. Their first stop along the way is when they’re packed in ice, typically at the airhead. And then they’re flown to, usually, Europe where they’re then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains, embalms them, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the medals that they’ve earned, the emblems of their service, and then puts them on another airplane linked up with a casualty officer escort that takes them home. A very, very good movie to watch, if you haven’t ever seen it, is “Taking Chance,” where this is done in a movie — HBO setting. Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me, and it’s worth seeing that if you’ve never seen it. So that’s the process. While that’s happening, a casualty officer typically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on. And then he knocks on the door; typically a mom and dad will answer, a wife. And if there is a wife, this is happening in two different places; if the parents are divorced, three different places. And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member and stays with that family until — well, for a long, long time, even after the internment. So that’s what happens. "
939,"Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to strike down a sweeping new rule that would have allowed millions of Americans to band together in class-action lawsuits against financial institutions. The overturning of the rule, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a 50-to-50 tie, will further loosen regulation of Wall Street as the Trump administration and Republicans move to roll back Obama-era policies enacted in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis. By defeating the rule, Republicans are dismantling a major effort of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog created by Congress in the aftermath of the mortgage mess. The rule, five years in the making, would have dealt a serious blow to financial firms, potentially exposing them to a flood of costly lawsuits over questionable business practices. For decades, credit card companies and banks have inserted arbitration clauses into the fine print of financial contracts to circumvent the courts and bar people from pooling their resources in class-action lawsuits. By forcing people into private arbitration, the clauses effectively take away one of the few tools that individuals have to fight predatory and deceptive business practices. Arbitration clauses have derailed claims of financial gouging, discrimination in car sales and unfair fees. The new rule written by the consumer bureau, which was set to take effect in 2019, would have restored the right of individuals to sue in court. It was part of a spate of actions by the bureau, which has cracked down on debt collectors, the student loan industry and payday lenders. The arbitration rule has sparked a political battle that has taken on broader significance in the new administration. Republicans latched on to the rule as a way to cast the agency as a player in the regulatory regime that was impeding business and the economy. Shortly after the rule was adopted in July, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce pointed to it as a “prime example of an agency gone rogue.” "
940,"Two months before Sgt. La David T. Johnson died in an ambush in Niger, he told his sister in an hourlong video chat that he was ready to come home. He wanted to see his children again and return to his wife, then four months pregnant with their third child. “He was ready,” said Torneisha Ghent, 24, who along with her brother grew up in Carol City, a neighborhood in north Miami-Dade County. But Sergeant Johnson remained committed to his role as an Army mechanic serving the 3rd Special Forces Group as part of a mission to train African troops in the fight against terrorism. He told friends and family he wanted to help his team. He also needed the money to buy a home for his growing family. Ms. Ghent would never see her brother again. Weeks after their last exchange, Sergeant Johnson’s family learned that he had disappeared in a firefight. Days later, they learned of his death after an ambush. And then came the controversy over President Trump’s call to Sergeant Johnson’s widow, Myeshia Johnson, and the swirling feud that followed involving the president, his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, Ms. Johnson and Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, over what was said in the call. Yet many who knew the slain soldier now lament that Sergeant Johnson’s story has gotten lost amid the flurry of criticism and accusations. The bitter back and forth is a marked contrast to his life, which family, friends and fellow soldiers say was characterized by kindness and an optimism that allowed him to rise above a tough upbringing, when so much around him seemed set on keeping him down. "
941,"You know that part in “Jurassic Park” when Dr. Grant and the kids are about to get chomped by velociraptors, but the Tyrannosaurus rex shows up and demolishes the raptors with her superior jaws? And you kind of forgive the T. rex for the first half of the movie when she was insatiably hungry for child meat, because in the end she stuck her neck out, as only a dino could, so our heroes could get away? That’s how I feel when Megyn Kelly goes in on Fox News and Bill O’Reilly. Except, of course, that Kelly, unlike a fictional dinosaur, has been through some truly horrific sexual violations, including vile and gendered comments from a man who is now the president of the United States, as well as an online silencing campaign that will most likely continue for as long as she refuses to capitulate. (Though, by the same token, that T. rex, as far as we know, has never gone on television and insisted that “Santa just is white.”) It’s a long, silly way to express the conflict at the heart of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy. Kelly spent more than a dozen years as part of the Fox News machine, churning out the same brand of soft propaganda that helped lead to the Iraq war, the Tea Party and, eventually, “fake news” and President Trump. Kelly happily trafficked in racist tropes for profit — black communities have a “thug mentality,” asking repeatedly whether the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown were necessarily related to race — until her own dehumanization at the hands of Roger Ailes, O’Reilly and others became untenable. If you’ve heard the term “white feminism” tossed around your social media feeds, this is a prime example: fighting for freedom and justice as far as the boundaries of your own identity and not beyond. It’s an unfortunate reality that Kelly’s stature as a right-of-center icon confers a degree of credibility that the Fox News rank and file — and, let’s be honest, the public — withhold from the traditional heralds of the ills of rape, abuse and sexual harassment: feminists. Activists and scholars who devote their lives to the study of gender-based violence and its legislative and social amelioration have been systematically smeared as reactionary liars. America’s traditionalist wing has set a tidy trap: The more you actually know about the way abuse functions, the less seriously you’re taken. So, what do we do with the fact that, as destructive as some of Kelly’s work has been, there are people who listened to her indictment of Ailes who would never have listened to, say, Anita Hill. When Kelly finds a righteous purpose, she is potent. She found one this week, when — with the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations still at a fevered peak — news broke that O’Reilly had agreed to pay a $32 million settlement to the former Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl. "
942,"BEIJING — The ceremony in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Wednesday was meant to introduce the world to China’s new leaders, members of an elite committee that for decades has tried to govern by consensus and sometimes has been compared to a corporate board of directors. Instead, the nationally televised event was more a display of the political power that Xi Jinping has amassed in just five years as president. None of the other members of the new Politburo Standing Committee could be considered equals or potential rivals. The six men stood stiffly in dark suits on the stage, each bowing as Mr. Xi introduced them. After reciting their names, Mr. Xi added almost offhandedly: “More information about them can be found through media outlets.” The debut of the new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, capped a weeklong Communist Party congress that became a celebration of Mr. Xi’s one-man style of rule and his promise to lead a resurgent China to a place at the center of the world stage. “A new era needs a new look, and even more needs new accomplishments,” Mr. Xi said as his colleagues, all men in their 60s, lined up before cameras. For the first time in a generation, the new Standing Committee did not include a younger leader who would be groomed as heir apparent. The decision to delay anointing a successor broke with the unwritten conventions that have ensured relatively stable leadership changes since the era of Deng Xiaoping, which was troubled by schisms and purges. "
943,"WASHINGTON — The presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee paid for research that was included in a dossier made public in January that contained salacious claims about connections between Donald J. Trump, his associates and Russia. A spokesperson for a law firm said on Tuesday that it had hired Washington-based researchers last year to gather damaging information about Mr. Trump on numerous subjects — including possible ties to Russia — on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. The revelation, which emerged from a letter filed in court on Tuesday, is likely to fuel new partisan attacks over federal and congressional investigations into Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s election and whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted in the effort. The president and his allies have argued for months that the investigations are politically motivated. They have challenged the information contained in the dossier, which was compiled by a former British spy who had been contracted by the Washington research firm Fusion GPS. The letter that was filed in court said that Fusion GPS began working for the law firm, Perkins Coie, in April 2016. Written by the firm’s general counsel, Matthew J. Gehringer, the letter said that Fusion GPS had already been conducting the research “for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest.” Perkins Coie was paid $12.4 million to represent the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. during the 2016 campaign, according to filings. The role of the Clinton campaign and the national party in funding the research for the dossier was first reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post. "
944,"WASHINGTON — A former Republican president. A senior Republican senator with a critical illness. A retiring Republican senator. And now an independent-minded Republican senator who faced a difficult, if not impossible, path to re-election. George W. Bush. John McCain. Bob Corker. And now Jeff Flake of Arizona, who delivered a stinging indictment of President Trump and his own party on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon as he announced that he would not seek another term. His stirring call to arms came minutes after Mr. Trump concluded a private session with Senate Republicans meant to unite them over their shared agenda. The four men represent a new type of freedom caucus, one whose members are free to speak their minds about the president and how they see his words and actions diminishing the United States and its standing in the world without fear of the political backlash from hard-right conservatives. But who — if anyone — will follow? Well aware of the mercurial nature of the president, most congressional Republicans are loath to do or say anything that could upset Mr. Trump and risk provoking an early-morning Twitter tirade from the White House when they are trying to delicately piece together a complex tax agreement. One can practically sense Republicans tiptoeing around the Capitol, taking extra care not to awaken the president to their presence in a way that could draw a scolding or rebuke. They are equally wary of raising the ire of hard-right activists who already had Mr. Flake in their sights, contributing to his decision. Those activists celebrated Mr. Flake’s decision, claiming a Republican scalp. "
945,"In 1911, in the midst of a debate about whether Britain’s House of Lords should willingly give up its veto power over legislation or fight a doomed battle to retain its privileges, a British peer, Lord Selborne, framed the debate for his fellow lords this way: “The question is, shall we perish in the dark, slain by our own hand, or in the light, killed by our enemies?” A similar question has confronted Republican politicians throughout the age of Trump, and again and again they have chosen to die in the dark. This was true of Trump’s strongest primary-season rivals, who fought him directly and concertedly during exactly one of the umpteen debates and then, finding open war hard going, chose to lose and bow out as though Trump were a normal rival rather than the fundamentally unfit figure they had described just a few short weeks before. It was true of the party functionaries, the hapless Reince Priebus above all, who denied the residual Republican forces resisting Trump the chance to fight him one last time in the light of the convention floor. It was true of the party’s leaders in Washington, both the men of savvy and the men of honor, who came up with endless excuses for why they couldn’t take on Trump directly before he won the nomination and put party over conviction thereafter. It was true of Paul Ryan; it was true even of John McCain. It was not true of everyone. Mitt Romney and John Kasich declined to fall on the sword of party unity; so did George W. Bush and his father; so did some governors and a few junior senators, Mike Lee and Ben Sasse and Jeff Flake. "

947,"On Wednesday “Mr. Robot” finally filled in some of the gaps surrounding the 5/9 hack, including what happened to the popcorn gun and how Elliot ended up in Tyrell Wellick’s SUV at the end of Season 1. The episode also suggested that Irving, the Thermos enthusiast and aspiring pulp novelist, has been involved with this story for a while, and revealed why Agent Santiago has often seemed to be working against the investigators who are trying to find Wellick. (The short answer: Because he is.) But the biggest gap of all has belonged to Wellick himself, the possibly insane Swede with a God complex and daddy issues. We now know his disappearing act took him to a country cabin to cool his heels, grow a beard, split wood and work on Stage 2 of E Corp’s demise. Along the way we saw him bulk up and get broken down by Wallace Shawn, here playing an fsociety mask brought to life, before making an ill-advised escape attempt that cost a small town cop his brains (and Wellick an intact thumb joint). It was a lot of Wellick, in other words. While this was necessary to bring the story up to speed — as well as answer lingering questions like, “So did he wear the suit the whole time he was gone?” — it also asked viewers to invest in the quandaries of a character we haven’t been conditioned to care much about, on an emotional level. Wellick has always been something of an enigma. He arrived as a Patrick Bateman-style corporate striver-as-sociopath — both took out their aggressions on homeless people, among others — but also oozed insecurity. Martin Wallström’s composed, confident Nordic features could turn brittle in a heartbeat, and Wellick’s frequent flights into rage suggested that, like Elliot, he had less control over himself and his situation than he’d like. His toxic ambition seemed driven mostly by his even more toxic wife, by her demands and his need to meet them. But his devotion to Elliot (really Mr. Robot), one-sided though it might have been, suggests that what he mostly craves is someone with answers to tell him what to do. Never a vision guy, Wellick’s more comfortable taking someone else’s plan and maniacally dedicating himself to it — he’s a slick suit full of avarice waiting to be directed. "

ust before I finished my story about Amazon’s arrival in Australia and its possible impact on the book industry, I started to hear something familiar in the way bookstore owners and authors were talking about their resistance to the giant American retailer. Then it hit me. Isn’t their intense opposition to Amazon’s arrival just another version of the nationalist populism of Pauline Hanson and Donald J. Trump? What if the culture industry is for the intellectual left what factory jobs are for the populist right — a piece of the economy tied to identity and nostalgia that they just can’t help but want preserved and protected at all costs? There are obviously differences between resistance to a large corporate behemoth like Amazon, and resistance to, say immigrants and refugees — big differences. But at some core human level, both are driven by fear of a future defined by outsiders, and a love for what is. I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath. In both cases, many of the people I talked to started with jabs of outrage only to end with sighs and worry. "
949,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices. The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion. But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated. They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google. “The marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975,” Mr. Pai said. It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry. Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry. In the spring, soon after he lifted a cap on how many stations a single company can own, the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The merger, which the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice are reviewing, would give Sinclair access to more than 70 percent of all television viewers in the United States. This week, the commission’s Republican majority lifted rules that required television stations owners to operate a main studio in each locality, which Mr. Pai said was unnecessary and costly for TV station owners. The announcement on Wednesday, at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing, pleased newspaper groups and broadcast stations, which have lobbied for changes that they say are necessary to compete with online media giants like YouTube and Facebook.

950,"A 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy has been detained by federal immigration authorities in Texas after she passed through a Border Patrol checkpoint on her way to a hospital to undergo emergency gall bladder surgery. The girl, Rosamaria Hernandez, who was brought over the border illegally to live in Laredo, Tex., when she was three months old, was being transferred from a medical center in Laredo to a hospital in Corpus Christi around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when Border Patrol agents stopped the ambulance she was riding in, her family said. The agents allowed her to continue to Driscoll Children’s Hospital, the family said, but followed the ambulance the rest of the way there, then waited outside her room until she was released from the hospital. By Wednesday evening, according to family members and advocates involved in her case, immigration agents had taken her to a facility in San Antonio where migrant children who arrive alone in the United States from Central America are usually held, even though her parents, who both lack legal status, live 150 miles away in Laredo. Her placement there highlighted the unusual circumstances of her case: The federal government maintains detention centers for adult immigrants it plans to deport, facilities for families who arrive at the border together and shelters for children who come by themselves, known as unaccompanied minors. But it is rare, if not unheard-of, for a child already living in the United States to be arrested — particularly one with a serious medical condition. Immigration agents have, however, detained some teenagers who are suspected of membership in gangs like MS-13, a gang rooted in Los Angeles and El Salvador that President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have repeatedly condemned. As a general matter, the Trump administration has hardened immigration enforcement across the country, lifting guidelines established under President Barack Obama that made it unlikely that any unauthorized immigrants other than recent arrivals to the country and those with serious criminal records would be deported.

952,"HOUSTON — A pregnant undocumented teenager in federal custody whose attempt to have an abortion set off a monthlong legal battle with the Trump administration terminated her pregnancy on Wednesday morning. She underwent the procedure a day after a court ruling forced federal officials to allow it. The teenager, who is 17 and is identified in court documents as Jane Doe, illegally crossed the border in Texas in early September and was apprehended. Her pregnancy was discovered during a physical exam, and since then she had been fighting in court to have an abortion. In a statement released by her lawyers and her court-appointed guardian, Jane Doe, who had been nearly 16 weeks pregnant, wrote of coming to the United States with dreams of one day becoming a nurse, and of not being ready to be a parent. “My lawyers have told me that people around the country have been calling and writing to show support for me,” Jane Doe wrote in her statement. “I am touched by this show of love from people I may never know and from a country I am just beginning to know — to all of you, thank you. This is my life, my decision. I want a better future. I want justice.” Jane Doe was transported from the federally funded shelter in Brownsville where she has been living to an abortion provider, which was not identified. She returned to the shelter after the procedure and remains in federal custody. She had received a state court order on Sept. 25 allowing her to have an abortion without her parents’ consent. But the decision that cleared the way came one month later, on Tuesday, when a federal appeals court in Washington sided with Jane Doe, sending the case back to a lower court, which immediately ordered the Trump administration to allow her to obtain an abortion “promptly and without delay.” "
953,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet. Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to allow more companies to test their flying machines at night, above people, at far greater distances and with packages — activities limited by federal restrictions. The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said. For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year. The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming. Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages. But the Transportation Department has proceeded cautiously around allowing the machines to integrate into airspace shared by planes. Lawmakers and public interest groups have also raised concerns about privacy. Many questions remain about the program announced on Wednesday, including how many drones could be part of pilot programs. The Federal Aviation Administration is still deliberating potential rules for commercial drones, which are expected to have far more impact on the industry than Wednesday’s executive memorandum. The White House said the approach taken by the United States until now has put the country behind other nations on technology innovation. Wing is testing in Australia, Amazon in Britain and Zipline in Rwanda, said Michael Kratsios, the deputy assistant to the president at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. “To maintain U.S. leadership, our country needs a regulatory framework,” Mr. Kratsios said.

954,"Richard A. Dietl, known to most by the percussive nickname Bo, climbed the stairs of a subway platform at Union Square in Manhattan when he bumped into a man who knew him from his time as a police officer in crime-plagued Harlem in the 1970s. Mr. Dietl had prowled the precinct in one of the department’s old green-and-white patrol cars. The man had been a drug dealer — but he greeted the former cop like an old friend. “C’mon, Bo, man, you were an action hero in those days,” the man, Eric Pitt, 58, said as they discussed notorious drug locales from four decades ago. ""When you came out, everyone closed up shop.” Now when Mr. Dietl comes out — 66 years old, barrel-chested and wealthy from a career as a television personality and private investigator — he is in search of votes for a mayoral run that is as unworldly as it is unlikely to succeed. He has no party line to run on. He voted for Donald J. Trump, a black mark for a citywide electorate that massively rejected the president in 2016. And a recent poll showed him more than 50 points behind Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat whom he often refers to as “Big Bird.” “It is going to be an extremely uphill battle to say the very least,” said Eric Ulrich, a Republican councilman from Queens who supports Mr. Dietl. “He has a vision. He isn’t always the most articulate in explaining his positions or why he’s in the race, but his heart is in the right place.” "
955,"The tech giants are too big. They’re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won’t. The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives — when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms — Americans turned to their government for a fix. In the last half-century, lawmakers and regulators set up a regime to improve the safety of automobiles and other manufactured goods, to break up a telephone monopoly that controlled much of the nation’s communications and to loosen the fatal grip that tobacco companies held over American society. We are now at another great turning point in the global economy. A handful of technology companies, the Frightful Five — Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, the largest American corporations by stock-market value — control the technological platforms that will dominate life for the foreseeable future. Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind. Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants’ power through government — and, if so, how.

Senator Jeff Flake in The Washington Post: After his speech on the Senate Floor on Tuesday, Mr. Flake wrote this op-ed in The Washington Post, urging members of both parties to remember to “stand up and speak out.” Unbound by the political burdens of running for re-election, Mr. Flake writes that he intends to spend the remaining 14 months of his term “guided only by the dictates of conscience.” Read more » _____ The editors of The Weekly Standard: The editorial board of The Weekly Standard notes that it is puzzling why President Trump and his “celebrity allies” such as Stephen K. Bannon and Laura Ingraham were so keen on unseating Mr. Flake from his Arizona seat. After all, the editors note, while he may differ with the president on immigration and trade, “his views on foreign policy and national security are closer to Trump’s than, say, Lindsey Graham’s.” They conclude that the president and his defenders cannot abide a person who praises the leader when he’s right, and criticizes him when he’s wrong. Read more » _____ Ben Domenech in The Federalist: Mr. Domenech has been arguing that Mr. Flake should not run for re-election since July. The reason, he writes, is that the senator from Arizona is “out of time, a vestige of the pre-Donald Trump fusionism of the Republican Party.” Mr. Flake choosing not to seek another term, writes Mr. Domenech, does not mark a “changing of the guard.” That’s because “Flake is not the guard, he’s more of a bystander to the guard, and he knows it.” Read more » "
957,"The Radio City Rockettes have owned Christmastime for more than eight decades. But repeated attempts to create a second Rockettes franchise show for warm-weather months have not gone smoothly, and the latest effort — a big-budget, multiweek “spectacular” that had been postponed until 2018 — is no longer in the works, people involved with the production said this week. The struggle to turn precision dance and kick lines into lucrative rites of spring and summer — akin to the Rockettes’ “Christmas Spectacular” — goes back years and at one point featured the now-disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein in a pivotal role. Once a source of great excitement, such efforts have become an enduring challenge for the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the Rockettes. Executives there torpedoed a new Rockettes show in 2014 and then mounted expensive “spectaculars” in 2015 and 2016 that drew scorn from many critics. A 2017 “spectacular” was postponed in February for a year, and the company instead made money by renting Radio City Music Hall this year to big draws like Dave Chappelle. Such lucrative rentals continue to hold strong appeal for James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, but he and other leaders still want another franchise for the Rockettes that rivals the popularity of the Christmas show, according to executives at the company and people close to the Rockettes. The current idea is for a Rockettes show that can be easily mounted, then packed up, then remounted — thereby providing flexibility so the company can make room for limited profit-making runs by the starry likes of Mr. Chappelle. David O’Connor, the company’s chief executive officer, said in a statement Wednesday: “We are actively reconceiving the show to take advantage of our technology investments in Radio City which allow us to further enhance the production as well as to more nimbly bring the show in and out to accommodate other events.” Devising a new annual entertainment tradition in an era when people have so many options, however, has bedeviled producers across fields like theater, circus, art, and concert festivals.

958,"To the Editor: Re “In Biting Speech, Flake Denounces ‘Reckless’ Trump” (front page, Oct. 25): Tuesday was a remarkable day in politics for the country and for the Republican Party. Two highly respected Republican senators spoke out resolutely and with great heart about the shortcomings of President Trump. They called out his incessant lack of truthfulness, and his penchant for debasing the ideals of democracy and free speech that are at the core of our great Republic. Yes, about a third of Americans don’t agree with Senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, or simply give the president a pass because they support his agenda. Seemingly for these people any price is worth the cost if their agenda is furthered. To these people I say, Be very careful what you wish for. You may find short-run satisfaction if parts of Mr. Trump’s agenda get passed, but at what ultimate cost to our country and the office of the presidency? Stay alert; our Republic is under attack from within. KEN DEROW, SWARTHMORE, PA. To the Editor: While everyone is touting the fact that Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are standing up to President Trump, they are, in fact, capitulating. By not running for re-election, they have given in to the Stephen Bannon wing and have taken the heart out of the G.O.P. What’s even more interesting is that Mr. Flake, one of the first Tea Party members, is not far enough to the right to be re-elected. This is not a happy day because people are standing up to the president. This is a sad day because the Trump/Bannon folks have won. ED MAXWELL, SOUTH HADLEY, MASS. To the Editor: While I do not agree with many of Senator Jeff Flake’s policy views, nor those of Senator Bob Corker, the country owes them a debt of gratitude for their willingness to speak up and call out President Trump’s behavior. They have done a service to our country. If only other senators would put the country’s interests above their political future, we might return to a functioning polity where civility and problem-solving take precedence over invective and intransigence.

959,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge sided with the Trump administration on Wednesday in a ruling against 18 states that sought to compel the federal government to pay subsidies to health insurance companies for the benefit of millions of low-income people. “It appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument,” Judge Vince Chhabria of Federal District Court in San Francisco wrote in the ruling. He refused to issue a preliminary injunction requested by the states, leaving the dispute to be resolved in a trial in his courtroom over the next few months. The states, led by the attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, contend that the payments are needed to prevent chaos and confusion in insurance markets during the annual open enrollment period, which starts on Nov. 1. But Judge Chhabria said at a hearing on Monday that California and other states had found “a very clever way” to protect their residents against immediate harm from termination of the subsidies by President Trump. As a result, he said in his Wednesday ruling, many low-income people will be “better off or unharmed.’’ The subsidies reimburse insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs for seven million low-income people who buy midlevel silver plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Under the law, insurers will still have to provide the discounts, known as cost-sharing reductions, but may be unable to collect reimbursement from the government. "
960,"Senator Jeff Flake is a conservative Republican from Arizona. I’m a Democrat from Delaware. We have opposed each other on nearly every vote for as long as we’ve served in the Senate. So his announcement on Tuesday that he won’t seek re-election in 2018 should be great news for me. That’s one way to look at it — the senator is nothing more than my political opponent, someone whose loss is my gain. But that’s not at all how I see things. I may disagree with Mr. Flake on policy, but I consider him an honorable man, a loyal friend and a valued colleague. His retirement is deeply troubling to me because he represents a principled and patriotic Republican Party, one that has long championed strong American leadership around the world, and one I now fear is falling apart. That should scare all Americans. It sure scares me. How did Mr. Flake, who served in Congress since 2003 and has been in the Senate since 2013, become such an outsider in his own party that he wouldn’t seek re-election after only one term? Over the past year, right-wing populists have mocked his principled independence, donors have funded his primary opponent and President Trump, hardly a conservative and only recently a Republican, has openly wished for his defeat. This has been Mr. Flake’s punishment for charting his own course on issues such as immigration reform and for having the courage to stand up to Mr. Trump, first as a candidate and now as president. His loyalty to the Republican Party, to his conservative principles and to his deep sense of right and wrong never wavered — which is why he refused to be silent when he believed the president was wrong. This situation didn’t come out of nowhere. Over the past few decades, our political culture has corroded. Traditions of compromise and civility have given way to a zero-sum, winner-take-all approach that is now out of control. As Mr. Flake said on the Senate floor Tuesday, “Anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.” "
961,"The adrenaline of a live show, the thrill of sharing air with a superstar performer and thousands of passionate fans, is difficult to replicate on a screen. But technology is trying. Images are getting sharper, speakers subtler and streaming faster. Viewers can customize and interact with real-time content while relaxing on their couches next to snacks and a clean restroom. Compared with the $92.98 average ticket price for a National Football League game or $200 for good seats at a Katy Perry concert, ordering in for entertainment is getting ever more appealing to consumers. And if the most important words for developers working on the next generation of arenas are location, location location, they’re followed closely by diversify, diversify, diversify. The English soccer club Tottenham Hotspur’s new stadium, set to open next year in London, will accommodate multiple sports with a field that can retract to reveal artificial turf to host N.F.L. games. T-Mobile Arena, the home of the N.H.L.’s Vegas Golden Knights, has two towers jutting from the interior, each serving as part-time viewing platforms and, occasionally, nightclubs. And plans for a 60,000-seat football stadium for the Washington Redskins include a recreational moat that can be used for kayaking and surfing in the summer and ice-skating in the winter, while its external skin could double as a climbing or rappelling wall. “People have so many opportunities at their fingertips to seek out the type of entertainment they want,” said Brian Mirakian, senior principal at Populous Activate, a firm that helped design the new Yankee Stadium and several Olympic stadiums. “Having the drawing power necessary to pull those people into our buildings has never been more critical.” "
962,"While global demand for coal is falling as the nations of the world have committed themselves to slashing carbon emissions, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia wants to help a powerful Indian conglomerate build an enormous system of coal mines in a remote stretch of Queensland. Burning the estimated 66 million tons of coal a year that the Adani Group aims to produce from six open-pit and five underground complexes known as the Carmichael mine can only make it harder for the world to meet its aspirations under the Paris climate agreement. The project has prompted huge protests across Australia. “You can’t have both the Paris climate agreement and Adani’s Carmichael coal mine,” the climate change activist Bill McKibben said. “Full stop.” Mr. Turnbull has promoted the mine with the same argument President Trump has made to remove what he sees as impediments to coal mining in Appalachia, framing mining as a job creator in a region that sorely needs jobs. The prime minister has also supported Adani’s request for a taxpayer-financed loan of $800 million. But even one of Adani’s consultants has disputed the company’s claim that the project will generate 10,000 jobs. In fact, the project could cost mining jobs elsewhere in Australia. The nearby Great Barrier Reef supports some 64,000 full-time employees, but shipping all that coal to India risks further harm to this environmentally sensitive area, already endangered by global warming. The Adani Group chairman, Gautam Adani, plans to use 60 percent of the Carmichael coal, which is of a higher quality than Indian coal, for his financially stressed Mundra coal-fired power plant in Gujarat, India. It would be a regressive move for India, which is making great strides with solar and other forms of renewable energy. In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed India to getting 40 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Existing coal-burning plants in India are running below 60 percent capacity, and while increased demand for energy may push them to full capacity, by then, “the price of renewables will be lower than the price of coal,” observes Ajay Mathur, director general of the Energy Resources Institute in New Delhi. India’s energy minister, Piyush Goyal, was clear: “We don’t wish to import coal from anywhere in the world,” he said. “We have sufficient coal capacity in our country.” Australia is helping Mr. Adani get what he wants, but it’s the opposite of what Australia, India or the rest of the world needs. "
963,"WASHINGTON — This past summer, the Trump administration debated lowering the annual cap on refugees admitted to the United States. Should it stay at 110,000, be cut to 50,000 or fall somewhere in between? John F. Kelly offered his opinion. If it were up to him, he said, the number would be between zero and one. Mr. Kelly’s comment made its way around the White House, according to an administration official, and reinforced what is only now becoming clear to many on the outside. While some officials had predicted Mr. Kelly would be a calming chief of staff for an impulsive president, recent days have made clear that he is more aligned with President Trump than anticipated. For all of the talk of Mr. Kelly as a moderating force and the so-called grown-up in the room, it turns out that he harbors strong feelings on patriotism, national security and immigration that mirror the hard-line views of his outspoken boss. With his attack on a congresswoman who had criticized Mr. Trump’s condolence call to a slain soldier’s widow last week, Mr. Kelly showed that he was willing to escalate a politically distracting, racially charged public fight even with false assertions. And in lamenting that the country no longer holds women, religion, military families or the dignity of life “sacred” the way it once did, Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general whose son was killed in Afghanistan, waded deep into the culture wars in a way few chiefs of staff typically do. Conservatives cheered his defense of what they consider traditional American values, while liberals condemned what they deemed an outdated view of a modern, pluralistic society. “The real issue is understanding really who John Kelly is,” said former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, a Democrat for whom Mr. Kelly worked at the Pentagon during President Barack Obama’s administration. “If you understand what makes him tick, then it all fits together.” “He is a Marine first and foremost,” Mr. Panetta said. “In addition to being a Marine, he was born and raised in Boston” among blue-collar families with traditional views about God and country. “You combine those two and you realize” that he “shares some of these deep values, some of which Trump himself has tried to talk about.” "
964,"The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said on Wednesday that he had rebuffed a request for help last year from the head of a data firm that worked for Donald J. Trump and is now facing congressional scrutiny. On Twitter, Mr. Assange said he had been approached before the 2016 election by Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Mr. Trump during the final months of the campaign. Mr. Assange did not disclose what kind of help Mr. Nix sought, only that he had declined the request. “I can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica,” Mr. Assange wrote, “and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.” But The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that Mr. Nix had emailed Mr. Assange looking for copies of more than 30,000 emails that were deleted from Hillary Clinton’s private server and never publicly released. Mrs. Clinton has said that the emails were personal in nature. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday evening. It is not clear precisely when the two men corresponded. CNN reported on Wednesday that the emails were exchanged in the summer of 2016. Cambridge Analytica was being paid by a rival campaign — that of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas — through early June, according to Federal Election Commission records. By early summer, Cambridge Analytica had also begun wooing the Trump campaign, which hired the firm in June. The firm’s principal owner is the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, who backed Mr. Cruz during the campaign before switching his allegiance to Mr. Trump. It is also unclear why Mr. Nix would have believed that Mr. Assange had copies of the missing emails. Earlier last year, WikiLeaks had posted a searchable database of more than 50,000 emails from Mrs. Clinton’s private server, all of them previously released by the State Department. But Mr. Trump himself seemed eager to find the missing emails: At a campaign rally in July, Mr. Trump publicly asked Russia to obtain the deleted emails. "
965,"It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted. At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers. On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans. Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts. The administration made it easier for companies to stop providing no-cost birth control to employees if they have religious or moral objections to doing so. It announced that teenage pregnancy prevention grants would end two years early. Congress repealed an Obama-era rule that forbade states to deny family planning funds to Planned Parenthood. Congress overturned a rule restricting the ability of coal companies to dump their mining debris into streams and other waterways, threatening rural communities, forests and wildlife. "
966,"WASHINGTON — This article was updated on Dec. 21 with more details about Fusion GPS, the company that compiled the dossier, and who paid for it. The dossier of research into President Trump’s connections to Russia is the product of a research firm founded by a former journalist, Glenn R. Simpson. It is a 35-page collection of research memos written by Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence agent, primarily during the 2016 presidential campaign. The memos, compiled by a research firm called Fusion GPS, allege a multifaceted conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to help Mr. Trump defeat Mrs. Clinton. The memos also detail unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, and real estate deals that were intended as bribes, among other claims about Mr. Trump’s businesses. Mr. Simpson founded Fusion GPS in 2010. The firm is paid to do research by a variety of clients, including political donors, corporations, hedge funds and law firms. During election years, the firm is mostly focused on political opposition research — digging up dirt on a client’s opponent. The firm’s website lists very few details — there is a two-paragraph description of what the firm does and a single email address. During the Republican primaries, a research firm called Fusion GPS was hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, to unearth potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump. The Free Beacon — which was funded by a major donor supporting Mr. Trump’s rival for the party’s nomination, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida — told Fusion GPS to stop doing research on Mr. Trump in May 2016, as Mr. Trump was clinching the Republican nomination. After Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates — including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information. "
967,"President Trump falsely dismissed Senator Jeff Flake as a Democrat on Wednesday, offering a distorted timeline of their conflict a day after Mr. Flake, Republican of Arizona, announced his retirement with a strongly worded rebuke of the president. “Long before he ever knew me, during the campaign, even before the campaign — I mean, he came out with this horrible book, and I said, ‘Who is this guy?’” Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. “In fact, I remembered the first time I saw him on television I had not really been — nobody knew me in terms of politics.” “But the first time I saw him on television, I said, ‘I assume he’s a Democrat. Is he a Democrat?’” Mr. Trump said. “They said he’s a Republican. I said, ‘That’s impossible.’” In truth, the two men met in early July 2016 at a private Republican summit meeting on Capitol Hill, after Mr. Trump had won the last primaries but before the Republican National Convention, where he accepted the party’s nomination. Mr. Flake has said that he began working on his book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” during the general election. Mr. Trump posted several tweets calling him “weak” in September 2016. The book was published in August. The White House did not respond to inquiries about when Mr. Trump initially saw Mr. Flake on television or what prompted the assumption that the senator was a Democrat. But the characterization is perplexing given the Mr. Flake’s consistent standing as one of the more conservative members of the Republican Party since he was first elected to Congress in 2000. In the 1990s, Mr. Flake served as the executive director of the Goldwater Institute in Arizona, a libertarian think tank named for Barry M. Goldwater, the deeply conservative senator. While a member of the House of Representatives for 12 years, Mr. Flake staked his reputation on being a fiscally responsible conservative, voting against spending bills and waging fights over earmarks. "
968,"The Weinstein Company is looking for a new financial lifeline after a preliminary agreement for an immediate cash infusion from Colony Capital fell through. Last week, Colony, the private equity firm run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr., reached a preliminary agreement to provide much-needed cash to the studio, which has been thrown into turmoil by allegations of sexual harassment and rape against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein. Colony was also given a limited period to exclusively pursue the purchase of some or all of the Weinstein Company’s assets. But those plans have changed. Colony has not and will not provide a cash infusion, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Wednesday to discuss private deliberations. It was unclear why the preliminary agreement had fallen apart. Colony, which has experience in distressed Hollywood assets, continues to explore the purchase of some or all of the Weinstein Company’s assets. But Colony found more disorder than it had expected — and less value — once it started closely examining the studio’s assets, according to two people who were briefed on the matter. They added that Colony saw bankruptcy as the most likely near-term outcome for the studio. Representatives for Colony and the Weinstein Company declined to comment. The Weinstein Company still has options. Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that has lent money to beleaguered film companies in the past, has been working on a potential financing package for the studio valued at roughly $35 million, which would provide enough liquidity for the studio to operate roughly through January, according to three people briefed on the matter. On Monday, the New York attorney general opened an inquiry into the studio, examining whether allegations against Mr. Weinstein reflect broad gender discrimination and other civil rights violations. "
969,"As a child growing up in Snowflake, Ariz., a town that his Mormon pioneer great-great-grandfather helped found in the 1870s, Senator Jeff Flake learned to sing a popular children’s hymn, “Choose the Right.” He had no trouble recalling the hymn’s words on the telephone Wednesday, a day after he took to the floor of the Senate to deliver a stinging rebuke to his party and president, and to announce that he would not run for re-election in 2018. His decision was political and pragmatic, he acknowledged: he faced a tough primary battle and trailed in the polls. But his revulsion at President Trump also appeared to reflect his Mormon faith. It is a faith that puts a premium on decorum and comity, one that was born in America but is increasingly international and multicultural, and one whose young people often wear rings engraved “CTR” as a reminder of the hymn, which begins, “Choose the right when a choice is placed before you.” Mormons are also accustomed to testifying in public at monthly meetings, sometimes offering passionate stories of personal revelation. “We are taught that we ought to stand up for what we know is right, and also to be decent,” Mr. Flake said in the telephone interview. “I hope I’m acting on the faith that I believe in.” Mr. Flake came out early in the presidential primaries as an opponent of Mr. Trump, and unlike many in his party, he has remained a vocal critic, despite representing a state where the president is still popular. Although he has generally voted with Mr. Trump and the Republican majority in the Senate, he chastised his party on Tuesday for acquiescing in the lying and divisiveness that he said had come from the White House. "
970,"Despite the fervor of President Trump’s Republican opponents, the president’s brand of hard-edge nationalism — with its gut-level cultural appeals and hard lines on trade and immigration — is taking root within his adopted party, and those uneasy with grievance politics are either giving in or giving up the fight. In some cases, the retirement of an anti-Trump Republican could actually improve the Republican Party’s chance of retaining a seat. Senator Jeff Flake’s decision on Tuesday to not seek re-election was greeted with quiet sighs of relief in a party anguished by his plunging approval ratings. But such short-term advantages mask a larger, even existential threat to traditional Republicans. The Grand Old Party risks a longer-term transformation into the Party of Trump. “There is zero appetite for the ‘Never Trump’ movement in the Republican Party of today,” said Andy Surabian, an adviser to Great America Alliance, the “super PAC” that is aiding primary races against Republican incumbents. “This party is now defined by President Trump and his movement.” On Wednesday, Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, announced that he would not run again, an indication that the Washington fever was spreading. Mr. Straus, a pragmatist with deep ties to the Bush family who had tangled with his state’s hard-liners, delivered a plea that Republicans “appeal to our diverse population with an optimistic vision,” but he still chose flight over fight. Mr. Straus’s dash for the exits followed the retirement announcements of Mr. Flake, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Dave Reichert of Washington State — all members of the Republican establishment. "
971,"BAGHDAD — The American commander of the international military campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria said Wednesday that the militants were “on the run” and facing defeat as the American-led coalition made plans to kill or capture several thousand remaining insurgents. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, is clinging to roughly 5 percent of the territory it controlled in the two countries three years ago, the commander, Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk II, said in an interview. “Daesh has no chance to win,” General Funk said. “The outcome is not in doubt.” He said only about 1,500 to 2,500 militants remain in western Iraq near the Syrian border, and an additional 2,500 to 5,500 in the Euphrates River valley in eastern Syria. The coalition said that the territory controlled by the Islamic State in both countries had dropped from a peak of more than 40,000 square miles in 2014 to about 2,700 square miles today, split roughly between Iraq and Syria. “They cannot hold territory,” General Funk said. “They cannot hold any viable cities. Their leaders have abandoned them.” But he warned that Islamic State militants in both countries were likely to mount terrorist attacks and maintain underground cells even after losing control of territory. He said the coalition planned to turn soon to training Iraqi security forces to combat any Islamic State resurgence. The Trump administration and the Pentagon have not specified how long the American train-and-assist mission would last, but they have emphasized they will not repeat the Obama administration’s decision in 2011 to withdraw. "
972,"Banks just scored a victory against disgruntled customers — and, in the longer term, against themselves. The Senate has killed a rule allowing groups of consumers to sue financial firms and card issuers even when the small print of their contracts prohibits them from doing so. Clauses that keep customers out of the courts have caused reputational problems for Wall Street before, and will again. Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night. The measure was proposed by Richard Cordray, the head of the agency, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. Mr. Cordray argued that consumers needed protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged. Banks said the rule would increase costs for consumers. Their celebration could be short-lived. Equifax, the credit-scoring agency, had to drop its arbitration clause for the 145.5 million consumers who may have been affected by a data breach it disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general. And after Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration. Before the vote, the industry had been enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington. Wall Street wasn’t even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they needed further antitrust regulations. The Senate vote reignited their ire, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, calling it “a giant wet kiss to Wall Street.” Bashing banks is also still in style among the populist base that elevated Donald J. Trump to the presidency. The shrinking political target on the backs of banks is set to grow again. "
973,"ST. LOUIS — In 1977, when I was 2 years old, my family and I moved from Iran to America so that my father could pursue his doctorate in chemistry at Michigan State University. Two years later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized power and Iran was no longer the country my family knew. We stayed in the United States, becoming permanent residents and eventually citizens by 1999. My parents were raised Muslim but they stopped practicing after leaving Iran, so our household was secular. In many ways, my family was the picture of assimilation. We lived in Edwardsville, Ill., and my father taught chemistry at the local university. My mother opened a tailoring shop. I played tennis, joined a fraternity at the University of Illinois and married my wife in a Catholic church. My sister was in the National Honor Society, and my brother was on the high school football team and played bass in punk bands. Today, he is a corporate chef who hires and supervises hundreds of American workers, and she is a local prosecutor specializing in crimes against children. None of these accomplishments, however, have shielded us from the indiscriminate damage of President Trump’s travel ban, which my mother is challenging as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and partner organizations. In December 2016, my family received the devastating news that my father’s liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer that was first diagnosed in 2014, had returned. His prognosis was terminal. We needed family more than ever during that time. Fortunately, my aunt who lives in Iran had plans to travel here for my sister’s wedding, so she offered to stay for a month or so to support my mother. (They are sisters, and my aunt knows best how to help my mom.) But on Jan. 27, President Trump issued an executive order that revoked visas from Iranians, as well as from citizens of six other Muslim-majority countries. To this day, my aunt has not been able to get her visa, even though she has passed background checks twice. After courts stopped the first two versions of Mr. Trump’s ban, he issued a third on Sept. 24. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court dismissed the last remaining appeal in a pair of cases opposing the second ban, and lawyers are challenging the third version, which is even worse. If implemented, all of our relatives will be permanently barred from visiting us here. I was just with my father in the hospital, and such naked bias, from a country he loves and has raised his family in, deeply hurts him. "
974,"It’s a tough time for Republicans. Although there are worse things in the world than being stuck with Donald Trump as president. You could be locked in a cage with a ravenous tiger. Tied to the leg of a stampeding elephant. Locked in a small room with a swarm of rabid ferrets. Truly, the list goes on. Stop complaining. This week Trump denounced the Republicans’ tax plan before they even had one. He appeared to change his mind once again on immigration and kept the House and Senate dangling on health care. He also told reporters that “I’m a very intelligent person.” The only two things we can absolutely be confident about are that on almost any given day, Trump will refer to himself as intelligent and remind people how many electoral votes he won. For the rest, it’s anybody’s guess. Republicans in Congress generally try to just soldier on, but some of them are starting to snap. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona denounced his party’s president in a dramatic “I’m outta here” speech that Trump shrugged off, saying, “Even before the campaign he came out with this horrible book.” This would presumably be the anti-Trump book Flake published two months ago. Did you know that Jeff Flake once appeared in a reality TV special called “Rival Survival”? I am bringing this up because there does seem to be a reality TV theme running through Washington. Some years are about “hope” and some years we have “fiscal responsibility.” This year it’s along the line of “Naked and Afraid.” “Rival Survival” paired Flake with a Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. The two of them were left alone on a desert island to test their ability to feed and shelter themselves with bipartisan cooperation. They got along great, but were almost completely incapable of catching fish or boiling water. You will have to come up with your own moral. Now Flake is one of the prideful Republican rebels who are standing up to Trump on a daily basis, along with Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona. Corker, whose theme is that Trump is “utterly untruthful” and sort of nuts, does not seem to have ever been in a reality TV show. However, McCain ran for president in 2008 with Sarah Palin as a running mate and that should count for something. "
975,"Even though it’s been on the air for less than a month, the reboot of “TRL” on MTV already has a few signature moves. There is the bumbling repetition of interview questions, because no one seems to be able to hear anything over the screaming audience members. There is the smoke that engulfs guests as they enter, and that in a few cases has left them disoriented. And there is the occasional paternal pat on the shoulder the guests give the hosts, a gesture of dominance and control, the sort of thing an elder does to let the youth know to turn it down a notch. The seams are visible, and frayed, on “TRL,” which is currently in its fourth week and no steadier than it was in its first. In its initial incarnation, which ran from 1998 to 2008, “TRL” — originally “Total Request Live” — was the essential countdown show of the teen-pop era. It took place after school and often filled the streets of Times Square with shrieking teenagers. But that was when the phone screen was less enticing than the television screen, when music was closer to the heart of MTV’s mission. The “TRL” of 2017 is less a coherent show than a series of loosely threaded distractions. Each episode is an hour but feels like two. It is preoccupied with viral moments but creates none of its own, or barely anything even worth a GIF. (One exception: the recent sketch that found DJ Khaled break dancing and dropping to the floor for a backspin.) "

978,"URGENCH, Uzbekistan — Muhammad Bekjanov, often called the world’s longest-imprisoned journalist, did 18 years of hard time in some of Uzbekistan’s most notorious prisons, with nicknames like “Goodbye to Youth.” He was a writer with never much hope for a happy ending to his own story. “I was accused of insulting President Karimov,” he said, referring to Islam A. Karimov, the thin-skinned and iron-fisted former president of Uzbekistan, a strategically important country north of Afghanistan. In prison, Mr. Bekjanov lost his hearing in one ear and contracted tuberculosis. And yet, despite his years of suffering and deprivations, Mr. Bekjanov has become an improbable spokesman for a political and economic overhaul underway in Uzbekistan that began after Mr. Karimov’s death last year, a movement sometimes called the Uzbek Spring. The thaw, which started to take shape quietly this year, has already loosened police controls on the population and is testing the limits of gradual political change in a region more noted for its revolutions, such as those that deposed authoritarian leaders in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. “I am hopeful,” Mr. Bekjanov said of the shift. So far, the government has elevated the authority of locally elected councils, met with human rights observers and, this fall, freed thousands of students from the usual drudgery of picking cotton in state-owned fields for little or no compensation. It has also loosened the screws on political journalism, allowing a few live talk shows on television. The opening is one of the more improbable developments in the politics of the former Soviet states, among which Uzbekistan, the third-most-populous former Soviet country, has long been written off as a black hole of repression and poverty. "
979,"WASHINGTON — Update: The National Archives on Thursday released thousands of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Read the coverage, here » Few seem as excited about the release of the final batch of secret documents from the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy as the current occupant of the Oval Office. “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow,” President Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “So interesting!” Surely, then, it was just a coincidence that Mr. Trump posted that message while on Air Force One heading to, of all places, Dallas. Or was it? Fifty-three years and 11 months after the event that gave rise to a thousand conspiracy theories, the president even landed at Dallas Love Field Airport, where Kennedy’s body was brought for the final flight home, and his motorcade came within a few miles of Dealey Plaza, where the fateful shots rang out. Somehow it feels only appropriate that the remaining papers from one of history’s most infamous mysteries would be made public by the administration of a president who dabbles in conspiracy theories himself. After all, it was Mr. Trump who during last year’s campaign suggested that the father of his Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the Kennedy assassination. And one of his longtime advisers, Roger J. Stone Jr., wrote a book blaming the killing on Lyndon B. Johnson. Moreover, this is a president who, unlike most of those who have occupied the White House over the decades, has been in open war at times with the agencies that seem most worried that the release of documents may embarrass them by disclosing evidence of mishandling or even, some suspect, collusion of some sort. “Of all the presidents since 1963, this is the one who would mind the least if the release of these documents damaged the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., two organizations that he’s very angry at at the moment,” said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. "
980,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Scott Brown, the United States ambassador to New Zealand, was investigated and cautioned by the State Department about comments he made to women while on an official trip to Samoa, he revealed Wednesday. Mr. Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, told Fairfax Media that he had been instructed to be more culturally aware after the July trip in which he called guests at a Peace Corps event in Samoa in July “beautiful,” and told a woman serving food and drink at the function that she could “make hundreds of dollars” as a waitress in the United States. But he suggested his comments had been misinterpreted and that complaints about them had been politically motivated. Mr. Brown’s revelations come amid increased scrutiny of the behavior of men in high-ranking positions toward women after allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against the movie executive Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Brown, who was among the first leading politicians to endorse Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential bid, has been in his New Zealand posting since June. The United States ambassador to New Zealand is also the envoy to Samoa, an independent state in the Polynesian islands. In a short video statement released Wednesday, Mr. Brown, sitting next to his wife, said he had become aware through “rumor and innuendo” of media reports that there was an “administrative investigation” into his comments underway. Fairfax reported that the State Department sent investigators to Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, to interview people who were at the dinner, including the ambassador. "
981,"Update: The National Archives on Thursday released thousands of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Read the coverage, here » The granddaddy of all conspiracy theories has re-emerged in the American psyche with the planned release of the National Archives’s final trove of records about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy’s death on Nov. 22, 1963, and the numerous investigations that followed were simultaneously some of the most secretive and public events in modern history. The last of the sealed government papers relating to the assassination are expected to be made public by Thursday, after President Trump announced last week that he would not block their release. Government agencies, Hollywood big shots and amateur sleuths have floated theories of what happened to Kennedy: a plot by Cold War adversaries like Cuba and the Soviet Union; an elaborate mafia-backed hit; a covert federal government coup. And it’s been going on for over 50 years. Kennedy’s was one of the most public murders in history, a victim shot in front of hundreds of spectators, with a coterie of news reporters in tow. Page One of The Times blared the news of the assassination, reporting that “he died of a wound in the brain caused by a rifle bullet that was fired at him as he was riding through downtown Dallas in a motorcade.” "
982,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. This morning’s headlines are about Jeff Flake, but I find myself thinking about Roy Moore. Right now, it seems that the Republican Party has room for Moore but not Flake. Flake, of course, is the Republican senator and Trump critic who announced yesterday that he wouldn’t run for re-election, because he thought that winning would require giving in to Trumpism. “It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end,” he said on the Senate floor. Moore is the former judge who recently won the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in Alabama. He is also a demagogue who has called homosexuality “evil” and “so heinous” and who engaged in a discussion, on video, about whether it should be “punished by death.” After Flake’s speech, his Senate colleagues applauded and honored him. But applause is easy. The more important question is: What are those same senators doing about Moore — a man who, unlike President Trump, can still be prevented from taking high office? They are endorsing him, that’s what. Mike Lee of Utah has praised Moore’s “tested reputation of integrity.” Rand Paul of Kentucky has lauded Moore for “defending and standing up for the Constitution.” Ted Cruz, just a couple of hours before Flake’s speech, released a full-throated endorsement of Moore that celebrated his “lifelong passion for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.” "

985,"WASHINGTON — The idea for “The Sweat of Their Face,” a coming exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, came from a plumber. When Dorothy Moss, the museum’s curator of painting and sculpture, was researching her graduate dissertation, she found news accounts from 1897 about a plumber who visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art on a break but was asked to leave because he was wearing overalls. Thinking of the plumber, Ms. Moss became interested in one of the central questions of museums: Whom are they for? “The Sweat of Their Face,” which she curated with the museum’s senior historian, David C. Ward, tries to address that question. Consisting of more than 75 portrayals of American laborers from the 18th century through today, the gallery will open in November as part of the museum’s 50th anniversary celebration. Though the selections were made months before the election, several of the exhibition’s themes are essential to today’s politics: the role of the migrant worker, the lost glory of the coal miner, the devastation of the factory. What better time than now, Ms. Moss said, to think about ordinary life in an artistic sense, and in the nation’s capital. "
986,"Do brains trump brawn? A remarkable new study of how the human body prioritizes its inner workings found that if you intensely think at the same time as you intensely exercise, your performance in both thinking and moving can worsen. But your muscles’ performance will decline much more than your brain’s will, the study found. The results raise interesting questions about the roles that our body’s wide-ranging abilities may have played in the evolution of humans and also whether a hard workout is the ideal time to be cogitating. Compared to almost all other animals, we humans have disproportionately large brains for our size. Our supersized cranial contents probably provided an advantage during our evolution as a species. Smart creatures presumably could have outwitted predators and outmaneuvered prey, keeping themselves fed, uneaten and winners in the biological sweepstakes to pass on their genes. But most other species eschewed developing similarly outsized brains during evolution, because large brains carry a hefty metabolic cost. Brains are extraordinarily hungry organs, requiring, ounce for ounce, more calories to sustain their operations than almost any other tissue, and these caloric demands rise when the brain is hard at work. Thinking demands considerable bodily fuel. In order to feed and maintain these large brains, early humans’ bodies had to make certain trade-offs, most evolutionary biologists agree. Our digestive systems shrank during evolution, for one thing, since food processing is also metabolically ravenous. But whether a similar trade-off occurred with our muscles has remained in doubt. Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger. "
987,"SYDNEY, Australia — Australia and Papua New Guinea have failed to protect hundreds of asylum seekers sent to Manus Island under Australia’s contentious offshore processing policy, and threats to their safety and health will increase if Australia closes the island’s main detention center next week as planned, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday. In a report based on interviews with 40 of the 770 refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, which is part of Papua New Guinea, Human Rights Watch investigators said that several had been assaulted or robbed by local young men, who in some cases were drunk and armed with knives or screwdrivers. At least three victims since June required emergency medical attention in Papua New Guinea’s capital, Port Moresby, or in Australia, according to the report, which said that in most of the cases no one was charged or punished. “There has been an escalation in violence in the last six months and there has been little to no action by police,” Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview. “It’s simply not safe to move them out of the facility.” The report, which includes video interviews with refugees from a trip to Manus in September, was released days before the planned closing on Tuesday of the main processing center on Manus, and as debate about the costs and risks of Australia’s refusal to accept asylum seekers who try to arrive by boat continues to flare. In Parliament this week, Australian immigration officials told lawmakers that 606 people at the main center in Manus were refusing to move out by the Tuesday deadline. Senator Nick McKim of the Greens party said the government’s plan to cut off food, water and power after the deadline was an attempt to “starve out” the remaining asylum seekers, all of whom are men.

988,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified. And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy.” That was Senator Jeff Flake, challenging both President Trump and Republican leaders on Tuesday in an extraordinary speech in which he announced he would not seek re-election next year. After tangling with the president for months, Mr. Flake faced worsening poll numbers in Arizona. He now joins what our chief Washington correspondent, Carl Hulse, calls “a new type of freedom caucus”: Republicans who are free to speak about Mr. Trump without fear of the political backlash. • We have video highlights and a full transcript of Mr. Flake’s speech. • Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for research that was included in a dossier containing salacious claims about connections between Donald Trump, his associates and Russia.

989,"TORONTO — More than 20 years ago, a precocious teenage girl made a surprising request of the novelist Margaret Atwood. She had just read Ms. Atwood’s “Alias Grace” and found herself entranced by the true story of Grace Marks, a 19th-century Irish immigrant and servant who became a celebrity “murderess” in Toronto. So she sent Ms. Atwood a letter seeking the movie rights. Ms. Atwood’s correspondent was Sarah Polley, then best known as a Canadian child star from the Disney Channel’s “Road to Avonlea” and years away from becoming a screenwriter and director of independent films like “Away From Her” and “Take This Waltz.” Ms. Atwood declined. Obviously. “She was 17!” she said. “I didn’t think she had the wherewithal.” Now, at the age of 38, Ms. Polley is seeing her Hail Mary of a pitch come to fruition: She is the writer and a producer of the mini-series adaptation of the Booker Prize-shortlisted book, debuting on Netflix on Nov. 3. After decades of sputtering starts — both Jodie Foster and Cate Blanchett were attached at various points — “Alias Grace” arrives at a time of peak Atwood. This September the Hulu adaptation of the novelist’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” became the first streaming-service show to win an Emmy for best drama; the iconic red cloaks the handmaids are forced to wear have become popular costumes for both protesting and Halloweening; her backlist is on best-seller lists; and the 77-year-old author is herself an internet star. (Ms. Atwood has 1.77 million followers on Twitter, and when she carried her black velvet purse on stage at the Emmys, a gotta-be-me violation of unwritten awards-show etiquette, she sent social media into a loving frenzy.) “The Handmaid’s Tale,” now shooting its second season in Toronto, depicts a near-future dystopia where women are forced into surrogacy for a dictatorial elite. “Alias Grace,” meanwhile, is a six-part period piece based on the unsolvable mystery of a poor housemaid (Sarah Gadon) who either abetted the murders of her boss and his housekeeper/lover (Anna Paquin), or was sacrificed by Victorian moralists for being a little too free, a little too desirable. "
990,"WASHINGTON — One week before they are set to unveil a sprawling overhaul of the federal tax code, Republicans struggled on Wednesday with key parts of their plan, reigniting a fight over retirement savings and racing to cut a deal with lawmakers from high-tax states ahead of a critical budget vote in the House on Thursday. The challenges — and the dogged effort to resolve them on Capitol Hill — highlight the increased importance of the tax issue for a fractured party desperate for a legislative victory. The prospect of a once-in-a-generation bill to cut taxes on businesses and individuals increasingly appears to be the best hope for a party anxious to find common ground and advance an effort that it has long championed as the pinnacle of Republican orthodoxy. It is a bit like having a baby to save a failing marriage. But, like a crying newborn, the drafting of the bill is already costing party leaders sleep. That was evidenced on Wednesday, when President Trump and a top House Republican sparred over whether the plan would include sharp reductions in how much Americans might save, before taxes, in 401(k) accounts. Meanwhile, congressional leaders worked to forge a compromise on state and local tax deductions that could be necessary for the House to pass a budget measure that is needed to ensure the tax bill does not fall to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Republicans from states where the state and local tax — or SALT — deduction is widely used were not making it easy. “To me, the only way to stop this is to defeat the budget tomorrow,” Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said on Wednesday. “Once the budget passes, they hold all the cards.” "
991,"FORT BRAGG, N.C. — The sentencing hearing for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009, began on Wednesday with an ex-Navy SEAL’s assertion that he knew the military operation to find the missing soldier would be dangerous. “Somebody’s going to get killed or hurt trying to get that kid,” Jimmy Hatch recalled telling another member of his task force before setting off on a mission to find Sergeant Bergdahl. Mr. Hatch was shot in the leg during the rescue effort and later underwent surgery 18 times. The defense declined to cross-examine Mr. Hatch. In other developments, the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance, said he was not yet ready to rule on the defense’s argument that recent comments by President Trump had made a fair hearing impossible. The defense has argued that the president seemed to endorse previous assertions, made when he was a candidate, that Sergeant Bergdahl was a traitor and deserved execution. As commander in chief, he is the superior officer of all the military officials responsible for disciplining Sergeant Bergdahl. Sergeant Bergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban and held captive for five years, has pleaded guilty and faces up to life in prison. Colonel Nance will determine his sentence after a hearing that is expected to last into next week. Mr. Hatch’s testimony was intended to support a charge Sergeant Bergdahl’s actions had endangered other troops. The charge, formally known as “misbehavior before the enemy,” is rarely used today but has a colorful history. The charge is so broadly written it could seemingly cover most war-zone misconduct, including cowardice, failing to do the utmost to destroy the enemy, and failing to do everything possible to assist and relieve allied troops. "
992,"SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey has become a household name in Silicon Valley thanks to his role as the chief executive and co-founder of Twitter, President Trump’s favorite megaphone. People will sometimes mention, as an afterthought, that Mr. Dorsey also runs another start-up he helped found, the payment company Square. Sometime in the very near future, though, the value of Mr. Dorsey’s distinctly less-sexy second company, where he tends to work in the afternoon, is likely to become more valuable than his more well-known first company, where he works in the morning, separated by a short walk between the two companies’ headquarters in San Francisco. Thanks to its steadily ascending stock price, Square’s value — as measured by the value of its outstanding shares — has been closing in quickly on Twitter, which has seen its stock price stuck in neutral for months. On Wednesday, Square was worth $12.62 billion, or just $3 million less than Twitter. Just a year ago, Square was worth less than half as much. If current trends continue, the two could switch places as soon as Thursday, when Twitter announces its most recent quarterly financial results. Square, coming off five straight quarters of exceeding Wall Street expectations, will provide its results in November. (By one method of counting shares, including options given to employees, Square is already worth more than Twitter.) "
993,"Lost in all the attention to the Trump administration’s effort to scuttle President Barack Obama’s clean power plan is its attempt to prop up the struggling coal industry by doing something very un-Republican — subsidizing it. Last month, Rick Perry, the secretary of energy, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — the independent agency that regulates electricity markets — to adopt a new rule to pay certain coal and nuclear plants more than they would otherwise earn in a competitive market. In essence, consumers would pay these plants a premium for electricity that competitors could produce, and are already producing, more cheaply. Mr. Perry’s plan is premised on two unfounded claims: First, it assumes that coal and nuclear power plants, because they can stockpile fuel on site, are uniquely able to enhance the “reliability and resiliency” of the electric power grid, especially in times of fuel supply disruptions. Second, it assumes that those plants are being driven out of business by unfair subsidies to renewable-energy producers, as Mr. Perry has repeatedly claimed or implied. But a Department of Energy study conducted under Mr. Perry’s direction concluded otherwise. In fact, the retirements of aging coal and nuclear plants, the study showed, have not compromised reliability, the term used to describe the grid’s ability to keep the lights on under normal conditions. While the grid might need more bolstering in the future, “reliability is adequate today despite the retirement of 11 percent of the generating capacity available in 2002, as significant additions from natural gas, wind, and solar have come online since then,” the report noted. The study also found that the availability of cheap natural gas, not renewable energy subsidies, was “the biggest contributor” to driving old coal and nuclear plants out of business. Other factors included the low growth of electricity demand, the rising availability of solar and wind power, and the costs of complying with environmental regulations, according to the report. By putting a thumb on the scale for coal, Mr. Perry’s proposal would reverse 30 years of dogged work by successive FERC commissioners to promote fair competition in electricity markets. Rather than setting rates for each energy provider based on its production costs plus a reasonable return on investment — as FERC’s top-down regulation used to do — the agency has moved steadily to let the market set prices.

On “Late Night,” Seth Meyers refused to celebrate Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who delivered a fiery speech denouncing President Trump on the Senate floor on Tuesday. Clapping slowly and sarcastically, Mr. Meyers said Mr. Flake’s address — in which he announced he would not seek re-election in 2018 — was too little, too late. Jimmy Fallon looked at another Senate Republican who’s embroiled in an insult battle with Mr. Trump: Bob Corker of Tennessee. And Stephen Colbert offered a general assessment of the situation. Trevor Noah and other late-night hosts went after Bill O’Reilly, who is in the news after reports emerged that he had settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for $32 million last year. "
995,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • In China, all eyes were on the new lineup of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s top rung. No new member has the background to become the heir apparent to President Xi Jinping. Challenging Mr. Xi could now amount to ideological heresy, as the party’s revised Constitution effectively puts him on par with Mao. Globally, Mr. Xi has positioned his country as a stable alternative to an increasingly inward-looking U.S. Domestically, his unease with the rise of outspoken entrepreneurs could end up hurting economic growth. Separately, the fate of a Chinese-born Swedish publisher who disappeared in Thailand two years ago and reappeared in a Chinese jail took another strange twist: he’s missing. "
996,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Laura Ingraham landed here in a private jet and climbed into a waiting S.U.V., accompanied by her personal assistant, a publicist, and a single piece of luggage. The private plane was paid for by the publisher of her latest book, “Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution From Reagan to Trump.” The publicist came courtesy of her new primary employer, Fox News. “I love it out here,” Ms. Ingraham said, seated in the back seat as a string of desert resorts glided by last week. She was on her way to speak at a fund-raiser for Kelli Ward, the insurgent Republican primary challenger to Senator Jeff Flake. Stephen K. Bannon — the executive chairman of Breitbart News, former White House chief strategist for President Trump and one of Ms. Ingraham’s pals — was also on the program. Next week, Ms. Ingraham, 53, will take over one of the most coveted slots on cable television: 10 p.m. on Fox News. At the event for Ms. Ward, she served up some of her high-dudgeon populism to a Hilton hotel ballroom filled with several hundred fans, denouncing the “Democrat-media complex” before launching into an acidic attack on Mr. Flake, a critic of President Trump. “Since we are in the south, I can say bless his heart, but it’s time to melt the snowflake,” she said as the room vibrated with boos. A chant of “Build that wall!” broke out. "
997,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on eight individuals and a business affiliated with the Islamic State in Yemen and with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the first coordinated action taken with a newly formed center to combat terrorist financing led by the United States and Saudi Arabia. The fresh round of sanctions was unveiled by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, as he embarks on a four-country trip to the Middle East intended to strengthen America’s capacity to crack down on terrorist financing networks. President Trump has made attacking terrorist financing a priority in his first year in office, and the Treasury has been increasingly working with Persian Gulf countries to freeze the assets of people who are plotting attacks. The Terrorist Financing Targeting Center was established in May during Mr. Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also members of the group, and have agreed to share information about the financing of terrorism. “Our enemies have felt the effects of being blocked from the world financial system,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a speech at the Future Investment Initiative summit in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. “They are finding it harder to raise, move and distribute money.” The United States has in recent months imposed sanctions to stem North Korea’s financing and development of weapons of mass destruction and earlier this month targeted Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Mr. Mnuchin said he is also focused on targeting fund-raising efforts that prop up the Taliban in Afghanistan and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Among the individuals sanctioned on Wednesday were Abu Sulayman al-Adani, the head of the Islamic State’s Yemen affiliate, Nashwan al-Wali al-Yafi’I, the group’s chief financial officer, and Khalid al-Marfadi, a militant who helped coordinate joint operations between the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in Yemen.

998,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) With a vacancy rate of around 1 percent, Santa Rosa was a tough place to find a home before its recent disaster. Then the Tubbs fire wiped out about 5 percent of city’s housing stock — roughly 3,000 homes. For some of the displaced, the question is now: Do you stay? Chris Coursey, Santa Rosa’s mayor, said the common reaction of fire victims has been a determination to rebuild. Even so, he added, “I would be naïve to say nobody is going to leave because of this.” Many homeowners who held insurance policies will be able to erect new houses on their ash-laden properties. But the wine country’s zigzagging infernos didn’t discriminate between rich and poor. Low-income people who were displaced now face a housing market where the median monthly rent hovers around $2,500, double the national average. The median home price is more than $600,000. Those figures are expected to rise. "
999,"WASHINGTON — President Trump continued his attacks on two retiring Republican senators on Wednesday, and said a recent meeting with lawmakers in his party was mostly a “love fest with standing ovations.” Two of Mr. Trump’s early morning Twitter posts on Wednesday were about Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, both Republicans, who have announced they would not run for re-election. “They had zero chance of being elected,” Mr. Trump said. “Now act so hurt & wounded.” Mr. Flake, of Arizona, announced his retirement on Tuesday. The senator, who has been outspoken against Mr. Trump for months, is the fourth prominent Republican to issue a stinging and recent rebuke against Mr. Trump’s presidency and style of governing. Senate Republicans cannot afford to lose any support from their own party if they want to pass significant tax legislation that the president has promised for months. "
1000,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Thailand enters the era of King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners lined the streets of Bangkok to witness the funereal procession to the cremation of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Our correspondent said the ceremony had “the gilded pageantry of a bygone era.” The collection of the ashes today opens the way to the new king’s official coronation. _____ • In Washington, President Trump declared America’s opioid crisis a public health emergency. The move falls short of Mr. Trump’s promise to declare a national emergency, which would have triggered federal funds to fight a scourge that claimed more than 59,000 lives in 2016. And the House of Representatives narrowly cleared a budget blueprint that will allow a tax overhaul bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes. Republicans aim to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion.

1001,"ALBANY — For as long as anyone can remember, dysfunction has ruled New York’s capital: Corruption is common, power is limited to a few, and habitual calls for change disappear like the sun on a January day. But next month, the voters of New York have a chance to force a wide-open, monthslong, everything-on-the-table examination of the state’s founding document by authorizing a constitutional convention, a sight not seen here since Robert F. Kennedy was the state’s junior United States senator. If passed, Proposition 1 would trigger the first such state convention in the nation in more than a quarter century; the last one, in 1992 in Louisiana, was limited to discussing the bone-dry issue of state and local revenues. In New York’s case, however, the changes to the State Constitution could be profound, as could the impact on the inner workings of Albany and beyond. Ethics reform, sweeping changes to the judiciary, easing the stranglehold of power exerted by the governor and legislative leaders — all of it would be fair game for consideration. But it is that freedom that terrifies some groups, many of them unions that fear that such a free-for-all could enable anti-labor forces to undermine collective bargaining rights, or gut pensions. Potential rollbacks of personal freedoms — from abortion rights to the Second Amendment — have galvanized opponents on the left and the right, as have concerns about protections for the environment and public education. “It comes down to fear versus hope,” said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a good government organization that is neutral on Proposition 1. “The fear that something bad could come out of it, and the hope that something good could.” "

Above, oxycodone pills. _____ "
1003,"GENEVA — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Thursday that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not remain in power, but that negotiations about the country’s future should continue while Mr. Assad was in charge. “The United States wants a whole and unified Syria with no role for Bashar al-Assad in the government,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters, adding, “The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. The only issue is how that should that be brought about.” The comments came after Mr. Tillerson met in Geneva with the United Nations special envoy on the Syrian crisis — the last stop on a weeklong visit to the Middle East and South Asia in which he dashed among capitals in the region, often spending only a few hours on the ground before getting back into his motorcade and heading to the next stop. While he came home with no major accomplishments, the trip was also not interrupted by tweets from President Trump contradicting his efforts, as happened early this month with the secretary’s efforts on North Korea. Mr. Tillerson’s visit on Tuesday to Pakistan was perhaps the most interesting of the trip, since Mr. Tillerson had just the week before heaped praise on India, Pakistan’s longtime rival, while bluntly insisting that Pakistan had to do more to fight terrorism. The Pakistanis nonetheless showered Mr. Tillerson with kindness. When they sat down for talks, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi gave an effusive statement for the gathered reporters that Pakistan was fighting terrorism more than any other country. "
1004,"To the Editor: “Chemical Industry Insider Now Shapes E.P.A. Policy” (“Trump Rules” series, front page, Oct. 22), about the development of chemical safety rules, follows a well-worn path of reducing a complex policy debate to a garden-variety turf battle between two officials of the Environmental Protection Agency. The decision to define the concepts of “best available science” and “weight of the scientific evidence” in chemical safety rules will support the use of credible studies and transparent decision-making. This clarity is in the public interest. The chemical safety law, passed in 2016, prioritizes transparency, flexibility and safety. There are ample opportunities for public comment. All methods, policies and procedures must be reviewed every five years so new developments can be applied. And the E.P.A. can prioritize chemicals it judges to be in most need of review. The article’s misleading depictions and personal attacks distract from the ways that the well-written final chemical safety rules will enhance public safety, the scientific credibility of E.P.A. decisions and transparency throughout the regulatory process.

1005,"Amid the slow-motion agonies of Puerto Rico, it is heartening to see the reopening of some schools — though fewer than one in 10 — signaling the local resolve to prevail over Hurricane Maria’s devastation more than a month ago. Comparable resolve, however, and a far greater sense of urgency are needed from the federal government if the crippled island is ever to have a decent chance at recovery. The key — restoring electrical power to the island’s 3.4 million American citizens — remains a frustrating and mysterious process, with 75 percent of the island still without electricity. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s vow to have 95 percent restoration by mid-December was quickly dismissed as unrealistic by the Army Corps of Engineers, which is working to rebuild the island’s flattened power grid. Confidence has not been helped by the news that a two-person, two-year-old Montana electrical company with limited experience was able to land a $300 million contract for a part of the task that is far larger than any project the company has ever done. The contract is stirring suspicions of inside favoritism, prompting the financial oversight board that manages Puerto Rican affairs to consider appointment of a special monitor over the island’s power authority. A congressional inquiry is being promised as lawmakers look into the fact that the company, Whitefish Energy, is from the same Montana town as the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, and that its chief executive knows Mr. Zinke. Both the secretary’s office and the Whitefish executive, Andy Techmanski, say this is a hometown coincidence; they deny that there was inside help in winning approval from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. “We just answered the call,” Mr. Techmanski said of the hurried deal. The company claims it now has more than 300 utility subcontractors in Puerto Rico, with more arriving daily. The power authority, which is facing deep financial problems of its own, says Whitefish won by claiming experience in working in difficult mountainous terrain and also by not asking for money up front, as another company did. But an overriding question is why the power authority did not use the industry’s “mutual aid” agreements to rush in thousands of emergency workers from other utilities, as Texas and Florida did after recent hurricanes. Industry groups say they offered to go but never heard from the island power authority. "
1006,"SAN FRANCISCO — Fires need fuel. In this era of political rage, a Twitter account that called itself the unofficial voice of Tennessee Republicans provided buckets of gasoline. Its pre-election tweets were a bottomless well of inflammatory misinformation: “Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.” A mysterious explosion in Washington, it said, had killed one of Mrs. Clinton’s aides, raising her “body count” to six. Another proclaimed, “Obama is the founder of ISIS.” The account, @TEN_GOP, eventually reached more than 130,000 followers — 10 times that of the official state Republican Party’s Twitter handle. It was one of the most popular political voices in Tennessee. But its lies, distortions and endorsements came from the other side of the world. @TEN_GOP was a Russian troll account devoted to stoking division in America, according to a report earlier this month by RBC, a Russian media company with a history of independence. Twitter declined to even discuss the account, which had posted 10,000 tweets by the time it was finally shut down in August. That was more than a year after Republican officials in Tennessee had first complained about its misrepresentations to Twitter. “It’s disappointing and disheartening to see how an outside actor can pinpoint areas of division in America and then exploit them,” said Brent Leatherwood, the former executive director of the Tennessee Republican Party. “You think we’re getting to a better place and then something like this throws a Molotov cocktail into it.” Perhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information. Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning. They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia. "
1007,"WASHINGTON — President Trump ordered the long-awaited release on Thursday of more than 2,800 documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, but bowed to pressure from the C.I.A. and F.B.I. by withholding thousands of additional papers pending six more months of review. While incomplete, the documents were a treasure trove for investigators, historians and conspiracy theorists who have spent half a century searching for clues to what really happened in Dallas on that fateful day in 1963. They included tantalizing talk of mobsters and Cubans and spies, Kremlin suspicions that Lyndon B. Johnson was behind the killing, and fear among the authorities that the public would not accept the official version of events. Paging through the documents online on Thursday night was a little like exploring a box of random papers found in an attic. There were fuzzy images of C.I.A. surveillance photos from the early 1960s; a log from December 1963 of visitors, including a C.I.A. officer, to Johnson’s ranch in Texas; and reports that Lee Harvey Oswald obtained ammunition from a right-wing militia group. Some of the documents convey some of the drama and chaos of the days immediately after the murder of the president. Among them is a memo apparently dictated by J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, on Nov. 24, 1963, shortly after Jack Ruby shot and killed Oswald as he was being moved from Police Headquarters to a local jail. “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead,” the memo begins laconically, before reciting the day’s events. "
1008,"The United Nations investigator of human rights abuses in Myanmar expressed deep disappointment Thursday at what she described as an indifferent response by the country’s Nobel laureate leader to the violence raging against the Rohingya Muslim minority. The comments by the investigator, Yanghee Lee of South Korea, a leading child rights expert appointed to her United Nations human rights post in 2014, underscored international frustrations over the behavior of the Myanmar leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, regarding the persecution of the Rohingya. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a hero of democratic rights who endured years of house arrest by Myanmar’s military to become the top civilian politician of her country and de facto head of the government, has not criticized the deadly campaign against the Rohingya, who are widely reviled among the country’s Buddhist majority. The campaign, carried out by Myanmar’s armed forces and allied militias, has uprooted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from their villages in the western border state of Rakhine since August. The fallout has created a refugee and public health crisis in Myanmar’s impoverished neighbor, Bangladesh, as more than 600,000 people have fled across the border. Other top United Nations officials have called the anti-Rohingya purge a campaign of ethnic cleansing or worse. Diplomats of the Security Council are discussing a draft resolution aimed at pressuring the Myanmar military to end the violence. The Trump administration also has threatened to take punitive action. Speaking to reporters at the United Nations on Thursday, Ms. Lee said “there is so much hatred and hostility against the Rohingya” in Myanmar that few dare speak out against it. Well-documented accounts of killings, rapes, burned villages and forced displacement get no coverage in Myanmar’s news media. "
1009,"WASHINGTON — Under pressure from Republicans and Democrats, the Trump administration on Thursday turned over to Congress a list of Russia-connected entities it will use to determine new sanctions meant to rebuke Russia for actions in Eastern Europe, Syria and the 2016 United States presidential election. Administration officials made clear to lawmakers that they intended to impose sanctions on individuals in the United States and elsewhere who did “significant” business with the Russian entities, sending an early warning that such deals must soon end. The list appeared to be an attempt to mollify critics — including Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland — who said that the administration had not moved quickly enough to punish a key American adversary, using legislation passed by Congress in July and signed by President Trump in August. That legislation required that the administration produce the list of entities by Oct. 1. Administration officials said the list, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, was not itself an imposition of sanctions, but rather the government’s assessment of organizations or persons “that are part of, or operating for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors of the government of the Russian Federation.” Under the law, persons who “knowingly engage in a significant transaction” with these entities could be subjected to sanctions as soon as Jan. 29. Officials said they intended to work with individuals and the United States’ allies to help them avoid sanctionable activity. "
1010,"The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience.

Here’s the comment Christine posted: Other readers were confused. And some, amused. The original commenter, Christine, whose green check mark means her comments post automatically, eventually realized that something had gone terribly wrong.

1011,"It was a calamitous ambush. On Oct. 21, militants fired rockets and detonated explosives in the desert southwest of Cairo, killing at least 59 Egyptian police officers and security officials in the worst assault on security forces since 2015. The shocking attack is the latest reminder of the very real threat that armed militants pose to Egypt’s security forces. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seems incapable of quelling this menace: An insurgency that has killed hundreds of troops and police officers in northern Sinai continues; judges and police officers in Cairo have been attacked. So with such a real and present danger, why would Mr. Sisi’s government, aided by a team of media personalities and religious authorities, spend the past month whipping up a frenzy over another kind of “threat” altogether? As part of what can best be described as hysterical homophobia, more than 65 people, mostly gay men, have been arrested in the crackdown against L.G.B.T. Egyptians. At least 20 people have received prison sentences, ranging from six months to six years. Several men have been subjected to anal examinations, which human rights groups describe as a form of torture, ostensibly to determine whether they have engaged in anal sex. This wave of arrests and raids began after gay-pride rainbow flags were flown at a concert by a Lebanese indie-rock band, Mashrou’ Leila, whose lead singer, Hamed Sinno, is openly gay. It was not the first time fans displayed rainbow flags at a Mashrou’ Leila concert, a gay friend who has attended some of the band’s previous concerts in Cairo reminds me. He also reminds me that rainbow flags were flown in Tahrir Square during the 18 days of protest that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Same-sex relationships are not illegal in Egypt, but gay men are arrested under “debauchery” laws. So why now? Why the parade of men “confessing” to being gay and “repenting” on TV talk shows, and the psychiatrists touting “conversion therapy”? "
1012,"SAN DIEGO — The Department of Homeland Security unveiled several border wall prototypes here on Thursday that the agency said was the first step in carrying out President Trump’s plan to build a barrier along the nearly 2,000-mile border that the United States shares with Mexico. Agency officials said they would test the mock-ups over the next few months to determine which worked best in curbing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. “The prototypes are vitally important to the future of border security,” said Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol. Mr. Vitiello said the walls were central to the agency’s efforts to secure the border. As Mr. Vitiello spoke alongside the prototypes, erected near existing fencing along the border in San Diego, a few Mexican police officers stood on the other side, watching. Before he spoke, Mr. Vitiello walked over and shook their hands. Despite the fanfare, the prototypes are still far from the “physically imposing” and “aesthetically pleasing” border wall that Mr. Trump promised during his campaign and ordered built shortly after assuming office. For now, Mr. Trump’s vision remains largely aspirational. For one, Congress has not appropriated funds; the Homeland Security Department used money from other programs to pay for the prototypes. The House Homeland Security Committee voted to approve a bill that provides $10 billion for a border wall, but Senate Democrats have vowed to block attempts to provide funding for it. "
1013,"WASHINGTON — The Republican race to overhaul the tax code broke into a sprint on Thursday, with House members narrowly clearing a budget blueprint that would allow a tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes, and Senate leaders signaling that the bill could be introduced, debated and approved in both chambers by the end of November. Those ambitions are already complicated by difficult math, both in terms of tax revenues and vote counts. The budget vote put those competing factors on display, with 20 Republicans defecting and the resolution narrowly passing, 216 to 212, in part over concerns about the possible elimination of a tax break that disproportionately benefits residents of high-tax states. A potential reduction in contribution limits for 401(k) retirement accounts also appears to be stoking an intraparty fight. Neither the retirement issue nor the squabble over the deduction for state and local taxes was resolved on Thursday, but party leaders vowed to push ahead at an even faster pace than they had previously outlined. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said his committee would introduce a bill on Nov. 1 and begin amending it on Nov. 6. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters that the Senate would follow about a week behind the House. “We need to get the tax bill out of the Senate by Thanksgiving,” he said. Privately, Republican leaders echoed that aggressive timeline. The exacting pace is meant to maximize party cohesion and neutralize attacks by Democrats and business groups. If Republicans stick to it, they will speed what could be a 1,000-page piece of legislation, affecting every corner of the United States economy, through the House and the Senate in less than three weeks. Democrats were swift to criticize the approach, saying it was an attempt to hide tax changes that will hurt, not help, middle-class families. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill was shaping up to be “a bunch of false promises to the middle class.” Republicans, he said, “know the details — the specifics of what they’re really about — will be hard to argue in the sunlight.” "
1014,"Mark Halperin built an empire as journalism’s ultimate political insider, spinning the world of government into dramatic narratives of power and ambition. His best-selling books and television appearances made him one of the most prominent and highly paid reporters in the country. That empire began to collapse on Thursday after allegations surfaced that he had sexually harassed multiple women years ago while working as the director of political coverage at ABC News. A report published by CNN late Wednesday included interviews with five unidentified women who described Mr. Halperin making unwanted and aggressive sexual advances toward them. It was the latest instance of harassment claims against a towering figure in American media, and the fallout was swift. MSNBC, where Mr. Halperin was an analyst on the influential show “Morning Joe,” said he would no longer serve as a contributor. HBO dropped a planned television adaptation of Mr. Halperin’s upcoming book about the 2016 presidential election. And by Thursday evening, his publisher, Penguin Press, said in a statement that it had canceled plans for the book entirely, “in light of the recent news.” In a statement, Mr. Halperin denied any nonconsensual contact with the women who spoke to CNN, but he apologized for his behavior with his ABC News colleagues. "
1015,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday directed the Department of Health and Human Services to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency, taking long-anticipated action to address a rapidly escalating epidemic of drug use. But even as he vowed to alleviate the scourge of drug addiction and abuse that has swept the country — a priority that resonated strongly with the working-class voters who supported his presidential campaign — Mr. Trump fell short of fulfilling his promise in August to declare “a national emergency” on opioids, which would have prompted the rapid allocation of federal funding to address the issue. His directive does not on its own release any additional funds to deal with a drug crisis that claimed more than 59,000 lives in 2016, and the president did not request any, although his aides said he would soon do so. And he made little mention of the need for the rapid and costly expansion of medical treatment that public health specialists, including some in his own administration, argue is crucial to addressing the epidemic. “No part of our society — not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural — has been spared this plague of drug addiction and this horrible, horrible situation that’s taken place with opioids,” Mr. Trump said during an elaborate and emotional ceremony in the East Room of the White House, attended by families affected by opioid abuse, members of Congress and administration officials. “This epidemic is a national health emergency.” To combat the epidemic, the president said the government would produce “really tough, really big, really great advertising” aimed at persuading Americans not to start using opioids in the first place, seeming to hark back to the “Just Say No” antidrug campaign led by Nancy Reagan in the 1980s. “This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs,” Mr. Trump said, “it’s really, really easy not to take them.” He shared the story of his brother Fred, who he said had struggled with alcohol addiction throughout his life and implored Mr. Trump never to take a drink — advice the president said he had heeded.

Must vote NO on budget to stop this!” That tweet — and I’ll decode the acronyms momentarily — may sound as if it comes from an unhappy Democrat, but it doesn’t. Pete King, the Long Island (“LI”) Republican who’s been in the House for almost 25 years, sent the tweet Tuesday evening. He is unhappy with the current Republican tax plan because it would eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes (“SALT”), and he has company in the Republican caucus. The deduction reduces income taxes for millions of families across the country. Nationwide, almost 30 percent of taxpayers benefit — and at least 17 percent of households in every state benefit. The Republican tax plan would eliminate the deduction, which disproportionately benefits the upper middle class, largely to help pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy. No wonder some House Republicans are grousing. Tom MacArthur, a Republican from New Jersey, has said that there are enough members unhappy about losing SALT to block the House budget — a first step toward a tax cut — from passing. (It’s not clear if he’s correct about that. House leaders said last night that they would proceed with a vote today on the House budget, which is a sign of confidence.) Either way, though, a theme is emerging: The Republicans are having a hard time passing bills that shower gifts on the wealthy and stick everyone else with the bill. "

The SoftBank founder told Andrew at the Saudi Arabia conference on Wednesday that his $93 billion Vision Fund was only the first part of a colossal series of tech investments. The highlights from the interview: • Mr. Son said the Vision Fund has made a $3 billion profit and a 22-percent return over the last five months. Dan Primack of Axios noted on Twitter: “Only public security known is Nvidia. Only up 12 percent since announced but SB did months earlier. So it’s possible.” • Mr. Son said of Vision Fund: “People said it’s too much. I say it’s too little. It’s not that much.” Regarding how long it will take to invest that giant sum, he said, “It’s not going to take five years — it’s going to take much less.” The dreams of other investment moguls: Mr. Son’s ambitious plans have others in private equity thinking about creating supersize funds dedicated to specific industries like health care. Could they attract all the deals in one sector in the way that Mr. Son has with tech? "
1019,"WASHINGTON — Frustration over President Trump’s delay in imposing the stiff tariffs he has promised on imports of foreign steel and aluminum is morphing into a fight over two of Mr. Trump’s trade policy nominees. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Thursday that he would block the nominations of Gilbert B. Kaplan for the top international trade post at the Commerce Department and Nazakhtar Nikakhtar for assistant secretary of commerce until the White House advanced a stalled effort to protect American metal producers from cheap Chinese products. Mr. Schumer’s timing is intentional, coming just ahead of Mr. Trump’s trip to Beijing early next month. Blocking the president’s nominees is one of the few levers Democrats have to try to force Mr. Trump to move ahead with his trade agenda, which is supported by labor unions and some Democrats, but opposed by some in the president’s own party. The nominees can be approved even with Mr. Schumer’s hold, but it will force the Senate to go through a more time-consuming cloture vote for approving officials, delaying these and other nominations in the pipeline. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Schumer said he was frustrated that a process the president began this spring as a precursor to imposing tariffs had not culminated in any action and had actually made things worse for United States companies. When the administration announced the investigation, “we felt, O.K., they’ve got the message. But they’ve just dragged their feet and delayed and delayed,” Mr. Schumer said. “The bottom line is the president has been a total paper tiger on this issue, and as a result, we feel the need to hold up nominees for the Commerce Department.” "
1020,"Last year, as it became clear that Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination, analysts on both the right and the left speculated that millions of regular Republicans would be repulsed by his ethnonationalism and misogyny. Writing in the Washington Post in August of 2016, Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, warned: Come Election Day, however, Republican voters did not abandon their party. The Republican share of the electorate grew slightly, from 32 percent in 2008 and 2012 to 33 percent in 2016, and Trump carried these voters 11 to 1. This pattern has continued into the present and shows no signs of letting up. In recent days, prominent Republicans, including George W. Bush, Bob Corker, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have warned in various ways that Trump is leading their party and the country in a very dangerous direction. For the moment, however, it is the president’s critics who are butting their heads against a brick wall. The reality is that neither Flake nor Corker is seeking re-election, and both would have struggled to win renomination if they presented themselves as adversaries of President Trump. In short, the Trump-Steve Bannon-Laura Ingraham wing of the Republican party is ascendant. As Mike Allen headlined his post on Axios Wednesday: “Virtually every Republican now a Trump Republican.” Allen went on: Why is this still true, despite their “private gripes”? Because of the “strong, sustained support of G.O.P. voters” that the president enjoys. In an email, Alex Theodoridis, a political scientist at the University of California-Merced, put the state of play in a larger perspective: “The real story of Election 2016 is that the vast majority of Republicans voted for Trump” despite the fact that he was an outlier candidate who “lacked the normal credentials in terms of experience, ideology and character.” The nomination of an untraditional candidate from outside the party’s mainstream turned the 2016 election into “a stress test for Republican partisanship, and it passed with flying colors,” Theodoridis wrote.

1022,"A battle between two political titans in New Jersey could cost $20 million by the time November’s election is over. And it is not the governor’s race. The high-priced campaign is unfolding in a largely rural legislative district in the southwest corner of the state where the New Jersey Education Association, which is considered the state’s most influential union, is engaged in a feud with Stephen M. Sweeney, the powerful president of the State Senate. It is a clash that, on paper, is perplexing. The education association, which represents about 200,000 public-school teachers, leans Democratic: Of its 105 endorsements this year, 91 were Democrats. Mr. Sweeney is a Democrat. His opponent, Fran Grenier, the chairman of the Salem County Republican Party, supports the departing Republican governor, Chris Christie, and President Trump, both of whom the union routinely vilifies. But a dispute over pension benefits that dates back to 2011 has put the union on a mission to defeat Mr. Sweeney. The multimillion-dollar campaign is reverberating beyond the district, which Mr. Sweeney has represented since 2001 and where he has rarely faced any serious competition. Democratic groups estimate they will spend $11 million to support Mr. Sweeney, while the teachers’ union is on pace to spend more than $8 million. Other unions are pouring money in on Mr. Sweeney’s behalf and by Election Day, Nov. 7, the total amount spent on the single race could easily eclipse $20 million. Additionally, the money flooding this race by Democrats would, in other years, be spent propping up other candidates around the state. "
1023,"That was quite a philippic Arizona Republican Jeff Flake delivered on Tuesday from the Senate floor, announcing his decision not to seek re-election while denouncing Donald Trump’s “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior and “flagrant disregard for truth and decency.” And that was some speech George W. Bush gave in New York the other day, warning pointedly of “nationalism distorted into nativism,” and a politics “more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.” And who will ever forget Republican Senator Bob Corker’s acid description of the White House as an “adult day care center,” or John McCain’s magnificent denunciation of “people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems”? Who will forget? Republicans will, led by the pro-Trump intelligentsia that has spent the past 18 months abasing itself so it could normalize him. In 1927 the French philosopher Julien Benda wrote “The Treason of the Intellectuals” (La Trahison des Clercs), a short book that pointed a damning finger at the ultra-nationalist thinkers of his time.

The budget resolution that would allow for $1.5 trillion in additional deficits faces a key vote in the House today. • This afternoon, President Trump will order the government to declare the epidemic of drug use a public health emergency, senior administration officials said. The move would free up federal money and ease laws and regulations to address the crisis, which Mr. Trump called a “national emergency” in August. "

Samantha Bee focused this week’s entire episode of “Full Frontal” on the extreme weather conditions that have rocked many parts of the country in recent weeks.

1026,"The Syrian Air Force was responsible for a lethal sarin chemical attack on a northern rebel-held village on April 4, a United Nations investigative panel said Thursday. Its report represented the first time that a politically independent investigation had concluded which side in the Syrian civil war had carried out the attack on the village, Khan Sheikhoun. The early morning attack killed dozens of civilians, including children, and is regarded as one of the worst chemical weapons atrocities in the conflict. The panel’s finding could place new pressure on Russia, the Syrian government’s most important ally, which pledged four years ago to ensure that President Bashar al-Assad purge all his chemical weapons. But the determination is also likely to be assailed by Russia as flawed, and could raise doubts about whether the panel, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, will be able to continue its work. A second finding in the report concluded that Islamic State militants had carried out an attack using sulfur mustard poison in Um-Housh, in Aleppo Province, on Sept. 16, 2016. "
1027,"WASHINGTON — Three times in a single day last week, Senator Lindsey Graham’s cellphone rang. The first time, President Trump called about the health care fight in Congress. The second time, the president thanked the senator for defending his honor on television. Then Mr. Trump rang seeking more intelligence on health care. Mr. Graham — Republican of South Carolina and a onetime target of the president’s barbs on Twitter — has transformed himself into the Senate’s Trump whisperer, shrugging off the White House chaos, personal insults and deep ideological differences in exchange for Mr. Trump’s ear. The metamorphosis of Mr. Graham from chastised to cheerleader is all the more striking as his best friend and longtime mentor in the Senate, John McCain of Arizona, moves in the other direction, defiantly standing against the president as he battles brain cancer. And it comes as other senior Republican senators who share Mr. Graham’s long-held beliefs in an activist foreign policy and toleration toward immigrants challenge their colleagues to condemn Mr. Trump and his inward-looking “America First” views. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said Tuesday that the president was “debasing” the country. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona criticized what he called the president’s “reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior.” Both lawmakers have said they will retire from office rather than continue to work with Mr. Trump. Mr. Graham — who worked with Mr. Flake on immigration and Mr. Corker on foreign policy — said he shared those “concerns about what the president says and how he behaves.” But cozying up is the better choice, he said. “I’m going to try to stay in a position where I can have input to the president,” Mr. Graham, 62, said in a lengthy interview. “I can help him where I can, and he will call me up and pick my brain. Now, if you’re a United States senator, that’s a good place to find yourself.” "
1028,"Donald Trump’s pledges to “drain the swamp” of corruption in Washington attest to his genius for unintentional irony. Nepotism, egregious conflicts of interest, flights on the public dime to see Wimbledon and the eclipse — the Beltway wetlands are now wilder and murkier than ever. It would be a mistake, though, to dismiss the swamp metaphor on account of Mr. Trump’s hypocrisy. You can’t make sense of his shocking victory last year without reference to the downward spiral of public faith in governing elites and established institutions. Years of stagnating incomes, combined with dimming prospects for the future, have primed voters for the message that the system is “rigged” and that only an outsider not beholden to the corrupt establishment can clean it up. In other words, one key to this populist moment in American politics is the link in the public mind between dysfunction in Washington and the economic malaise of the 21st century. An effective political response to this perilous moment begins with the recognition that this link is real — and that key changes in the policymaking process, supported by a major push from organized philanthropy, will be needed to turn things around. The image of the swamp conveys a profound truth about the American economy. Our predicament of slow growth and sky-high inequality has many causes, but one important factor is the capture of the American political system by powerful insiders — big businesses, elite professionals, wealthy homeowners — that use it to entrench their own economic power. In so doing, they protect themselves from competition, fatten their bank accounts with diverted wealth and slow the creative destruction that drives economic growth. Four key policy areas shed light on the growth of this political-economic swamp — financial regulation, intellectual property, occupational licensing and zoning. They show that the swamp isn’t confined to Washington; it can also be found in 50 state capitals and countless local jurisdictions. In the financial sector, a web of regulatory subsidies sustains financial institutions’ unhealthy reliance on extremely high levels of debt. These subsidies, including policies that strongly encourage mortgage securitization as well as the implicit promise to bail out “too big to fail” institutions, swell profits in the near term while increasing the systemic risk of a catastrophic meltdown in the long run. The result is a financial sector much bigger than the economy needs, chronic misallocation of capital and the diversion of some of the country’s top talent into counterproductive work. Luring people into excessive debt, draining their savings with hidden fees, inflating the next asset bubble — these and other dubious “contributions” by finance to the economy need to be curtailed. "
1029,"There’s been a flood of hand-wringing and tut-tutting over some observations that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. offered during the argument earlier this month in the big Wisconsin gerrymander case. He dismissed as “sociological gobbledygook” the metrics the plaintiffs offered for determining when districting decisions cross the line from ordinary politics to blunt force. He warned that the court would be putting its legitimacy in the eyes of the public on the line if it became the state-by-state arbiter of partisanship gone too far. “Gobbledygook” has received the most attention, some playful and some fairly snarky. A public letter addressed to the chief justice from Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, president of the American Sociological Association, was somewhere in between (with a dose of academic self-importance for good measure). He offered to “put together a group of nationally and internationally renowned sociologists to meet with you and your staff,” adding that “given the important ways in which sociological data can and have informed thoughtful decision-making from the bench, such time would be well spent.” Doubtless. My interest is not in the chief justice’s flippant remark, but in his serious one. He was addressing Paul M. Smith, the lawyer for the Wisconsin Democrats who, in the lower court, successfully challenged a Republican-drawn state Assembly map that gave Republicans 60 out of the 99 seats although the party drew only 48.6 percent of the statewide vote. (By a 5 to 4 vote in June, the justices granted Wisconsin a stay of the lower court’s decision striking down the redistricting map, to last until the Supreme Court itself decides the case, Gill v. Whitford. Dissenting from the stay were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.) The chief justice observed to Mr. Smith that if the plaintiffs prevailed, “there will naturally be a lot of these claims raised around the country.” He went on: “We will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win. So it’s going to be a problem here across the board. And if you’re the intelligent man on the street and the court issues a decision, and let’s say the Democrats win, and that person will say: ‘Well, why did the Democrats win?’ ” At this point, Chief Justice Roberts offered a rough approximation of the plaintiffs’ formula-driven approach to map drawing, and continued: “And the intelligent man on the street is going to say that’s a bunch of baloney. It must be because the Supreme Court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans. And that’s going to come out one case after another as these cases are brought in every state. And that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country.” Although the chief justice had not, in fact, posed a question, Mr. Smith ventured an answer: “It may be that you can protect the court from seeming political, but the country is going to lose faith in democracy, big time.” "
1030,"By now, it’s pretty obvious that President Trump sees foreign policy as an extension of the business world. In both, his strategy has been hard-nosed brinkmanship, trying to cow businessmen and world leaders like Kim Jong-un of North Korea with his refusal to compromise, even if getting his way risks significant damage to his interests and those of his friends. More than one administration official has described the president’s approach as the “madman theory,” the idea that one way to make a threat effective is to persuade your opponent that you’re unstable enough to follow through. Madman theory is nothing new, and there’s a reason Mr. Trump’s recent predecessors have avoided it: It doesn’t work. Nuclear strategists have been talking about madman theory at least since Herman Kahn declared, in his 1962 book “Thinking About the Unthinkable,” that it could be effective to “look a little crazy” in inducing an adversary to stand down. This was not a recommendation to American leaders, but rather an admonition about the sorts of adversaries they might have to confront. Behavior like that of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis was probably what Kahn had in mind. Khrushchev had a reputation for irrational behavior — consider his shoe-brandishing  episode at the United Nations in 1960 — and seemed to confirm it by deploying nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba, 90 miles from the American mainland. It was President John F. Kennedy’s cool deliberation and calibrated response to this rash move that compelled Khrushchev to withdraw the missiles (albeit in exchange for the United States’ secret pledging to subsequently remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey), making Moscow look weak and heedless and contributing to Khrushchev’s political demise. Kennedy’s conduct during the Cuban missile crisis was the opposite of the current president’s swaggering, ill-informed recklessness. In essence, Kennedy put into practice the ideas of the great civilian strategists, who counseled showing resolve through firm declarations of resistance and sober clarifications of military capacity, while leaving an adversary a palatable opportunity to back down and the diplomatic channels through which to do so. "
1031,"Senator Jeff Flake gave a powerful, even poetic speech on Tuesday rebuking Donald Trump and the menace of Trumpism consuming the damaged Republican Party. But he undercut the power of the speech by coupling it with the announcement of his impending retirement from the Senate. Anyone who has ever left a job knows that what you say during your exit interview — no matter how compelling and profound — is of limited utility. More important, this was the kind of speech where people focus more on the excerpt-worthy flourishes than on the disturbing minutiae. Yes, it was historic to have a sitting senator attack the sitting president of his own party from the Senate floor. But Flake wasn’t only excoriating Trump, he was also excoriating his fellow elected officials, particularly Republicans, and the Republican Party, which finds itself caught in a perpetual rage spiral, in which no one but extremists are pure enough. The circle of inclusion is being drawn smaller and tighter around an electorally deadly singularity: White people who espouse Christianity, accept patriarchy and misogyny, and turn a blind eye to (or sometimes openly encourage) white supremacy. Look at all the times Flake chided the “we” in that speech. As he said at one point, putting the blame squarely on his Senate colleagues: “And what do we, as United States senators, have to say about it? The principles that underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics because politics can make us silent when we should speak and silence can equal complicity. I have children and grandchildren to answer to.” "
1032,"PARIS — When friends come to Paris and ask what they should buy as gifts to take home, I start with a two-word answer: dish towels. Dish towels are practical, easy to pack, good value and, ideally, made in France. If you’re in Paris on a weekend, start by logging on to vide-greniers.org, which announces weekly street markets. Vide-greniers means “empty the attics,” but the site includes gatherings of itinerant professional dealers and residents participating in neighborhood yard sales. Crisply pressed old linens are usually for sale. Otherwise, my go-to place is the Marché St.-Pierre near the Sacré-Coeur basilica in the heart of Montmartre. One of the biggest fabric shops in the world, it spreads over five floors and covers almost 27,000 square feet. You can get lost for hours in the bolts of silks, satins, linen and lace. It is a journey into the past, a place where fabric cutters walk the aisles brandishing huge scissors and long wooden rulers. It is also not for the faint-of-heart shopper. Head straight to the second floor to find fine dish towels; the linen ones are about $7, and $21 will buy a crisp stone-beige all-linen chef-style apron. If you are brave enough to confront bolts of silks, satins, linen and lace, look for linen cloth with protective wax coating in solid colors. It makes an elegant, no-wash-or-iron dining room tablecloth. At $19 per 1 meter by 1.5 meter (around 3.2 feet by 4.9 feet), it’s a bargain. Dish towels tied with a ribbon around something else are an eco-friendly way to offer two presents instead of one. I have little patience for clothes and shoe shopping, so I recommend sticking to shops that focus on cooking and dining to find that special “something else.” These are some of my favorites. "

1034,"The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested on Thursday on federal charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based painkiller intended for cancer patients. John Kapoor, the Insys founder, was charged with engaging in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in Federal District Court in Boston. He was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and added as a defendant in a case that was previously filed against six former Insys executives and managers, including Michael Babich, the former chief executive, prosecutors said. In a statement, Brian Kelly, a lawyer for Mr. Kapoor, said, “My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously.” Insys, which has been in talks with the Justice Department about a settlement in connection with the inquiry, declined to comment. Its stock price closed down 22.64 percent to a four-year low of $5.74 on Thursday. The charges escalate the continuing inquiries into Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid. They came as President Trump declared the country’s opioid problem a public health crisis. William D. Weinreb, the acting United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said the charges reflected a commitment on the part of authorities to combat the opioid-abuse epidemic. Opioids drugs were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable, just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer,” Mr. Weinreb said in a statement. Mr. Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a member of its board, stepped down in January as the company’s chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015. He is currently chairman of the drugmaker Akorn Inc. and president of the investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises. Prosecutors said that after bringing Subsys to market in 2012, Mr. Kapoor, Mr. Babich and others devised a scheme to pay speaking fees and other bribes to medical practitioners who prescribed the drug. They also sought to defraud insurers into approving payments for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said. The other defendants include Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry, former company vice presidents; Richard Simon, a former national sales director; and Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan, former regional sales directors. They have pleaded not guilty. "
1035,"Some of President Trump’s liberal critics are characterizing the Oct. 4 ambush in Niger that killed four American soldiers as “Benghazi on steroids” — a reference to the yearslong partisan uproar over the 2012 attacks on two United States compounds in Libya. A few parallels can be drawn between the incidents. In each, four Americans died at the hands of Islamic extremists. After the Benghazi attacks, the Obama administration struggled to explain exactly what happened, and why. And now, President Trump and his top officials have yet to satisfy questions from Congress about the deaths in Niger, Republicans and Democrats said on Thursday. But popular allegations about Mr. Trump’s role in Niger have ranged from premature to conspiratorial. Liberal blog posts, shared online tens of thousands of times, falsely claim that Mr. Trump sent American troops to Niger to aid Russia. One, for example, reads: “Four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger two weeks ago, and no one knows what they were doing there — except that it came shortly after Niger curiously signed a military cooperation agreement with Russia.” "
1036,"In the film “Bill Nye: Science Guy,” Mr. Nye, the 1990s children’s-television personality with the signature bow tie, warns of “an anti-science movement” afoot in this country. And this delightful, revealing documentary, directed by David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg, offers evidence supporting that assessment. Mr. Nye, who left his Emmy-winning series after around 100 episodes, has embraced a new mission: educating an older generation as he champions space exploration and challenges creationists and climate-change deniers. In TV clips, Sarah Palin impugns Mr. Nye’s credentials, and an Obama-era Donald J. Trump declares, “Our president is worried about global warming — what a ridiculous situation.” Joe Bastardi, the former chief long-range forecaster at AccuWeather and a frequent Fox News guest, insists that extreme weather is merely meteorological variation, not the result of human-caused global warming. (Mr. Nye is polite but resolute as he argues with Mr. Bastardi during a visit to his home.) “As we stand here, the Juno spacecraft just went into orbit around Jupiter,” Mr. Nye says. “It’s an extraordinary accomplishment of engineering and rocket science.” “Here is anti-science,” he adds, gesturing in the direction of the Kentucky tourist attractions the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, whose exhibits present such sights as prehistoric humans cohabiting, Flintstone-like, with dinosaurs, and a sauropod (a dinosaur species) dwelling on Noah’s ark. Mr. Nye debates the museum’s chief executive, Ken Ham, on a stage, though his efforts only galvanize Mr. Ham’s supporters. The documentary also follows Mr. Nye’s work as chief executive of the Planetary Society, as he collaborates with the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and spearheads the LightSail project (a small spacecraft powered by photons from the sun), a tribute to Mr. Nye’s mentor Carl Sagan. And it accompanies Mr. Nye to Greenland, where he witnesses melting ice caps and ice-core studies revealing climate temperatures of centuries past and our fossil-fuel-poisoned present. Most inspiring, it finds him at a conference of adoring science teachers, who applaud him as a defender of all they hold dear. "
1037,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — It may not be politically popular to raise concerns about the human rights of Islamic State fighters and their families. But the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has monitored the treatment of the wounded, prisoners and civilians in wartime for a century and a half, sought to do just that in a strongly worded statement on Thursday. The organization is concerned about rhetoric that “dehumanizes” and “demonizes” the enemy or suggests that a particular adversary is “outside the bounds of humanity” and can be treated “as if humanitarian law doesn’t apply,” the group’s deputy director for the Middle East, Patrick Hamilton, told reporters via a telephone conference call. Language that could appear to justify or encourage war crimes and illegal treatment of detainees has become more common on all sides of the sprawling conflicts in Syria and Iraq, Mr. Hamilton said, to the point that the Red Cross felt it necessary to remind all combatants that international law requires due process and humane treatment of detainees “with no exceptions.” His comments come as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh, is surrendering more territory  to an array of government and militia forces. Several Western officials have said that it would be best if their citizens who have fought with the Islamic State died in combat. The Red Cross has a longstanding policy of not singling out governments or groups for criticism, because it seeks to preserve access to all sides in order to carry out missions such as monitoring the treatment of detainees and prisoners. The organization said its warning was directed at all combatants as well as countries that might receive returning Islamic State fighters. “It’s not that we are going to name no one,” Mr. Hamilton said of his warning against inflammatory rhetoric. “We name everyone.” "
1038,"LONDON — The letter is as British as it gets: polite, polished and understated. Written by a senior Conservative Party lawmaker, Christopher Heaton-Harris, and sent to British universities, it asked officials to reveal the names of professors involved in teaching students about Europe, including Britain’s decision last year to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit. “Furthermore,” the missive read, “if I could be provided with a copy of the syllabus and links to the online lectures which relate to this area I would be much obliged.” Despite its apparently mild tone, the letter has provoked a national debate on freedom of speech in universities and whether the country is being subjected to political censorship in a British version of McCarthyism. The uproar increased on Thursday after The Daily Mail, a popular tabloid that has vociferously supported Brexit and which carries an anti-immigrant slant, published a front-page article citing instances in which it said university professors had encouraged students to oppose a Brexit. On another page, more than a dozen headshots of academic leaders were assembled around a headline that read: “Just why is every new Oxbridge head a leftie?” (“Oxbridge” is shorthand for the two leading universities in Britain: Oxford and Cambridge.) While the letter itself is the work of a single politician, the backlash underscores the toxic climate and the searing divisions that dominate Britain more than a year after its referendum on Brexit. There is deep uncertainty and little consensus over what Britain’s future should look like. Negotiations with the European Union over divorce terms have all but stalled. Even the ruling Conservative Party, which called for the referendum in the first place, is divided over what kind of a break it wants. Resentment against elites remains as acerbic as ever. "
1039,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers sent Facebook a harsh message this  week over how Russian agents used the social network to spread division in the 2016 election. On Wednesday, Facebook’s top executives — including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg — spread a different message: one of profit. Around the time that Facebook wrapped up its attendance at hearings on Capitol Hill over Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election on Wednesday, the company reported another set of blockbuster financial results. Facebook said its revenue rose 47 percent to $10.3 billion in the third quarter from a year ago, with profit surging 79 percent to $4.7 billion, handily beating Wall Street expectations. The results showcased Facebook’s moneymaking strength in online advertising, which is precisely what the Silicon Valley company has been under fire for in Washington this week. Lawmakers questioned Facebook — as well as Google and Twitter — about how Russians may have misused online ads and other parts of their platforms to sow discord and inflame tensions in the American electorate. Some lawmakers were particularly irked by the no shows of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg at the hearings, as well as the lack of attendance by top executives from Google and Twitter. Facebook tapped Colin Stretch, its general counsel, to answer questions; Google and Twitter also sent their top lawyers. “I’m disappointed that you’re here, and not your C.E.O.s,” Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said during a hearing on Wednesday morning. "
1040,"To the Editor: Re “Mile-Long Manhattan Truck Attack Kills 8” (front page, Nov. 1): The carnage aimed for by a well-structured terror plan, painstakingly formulated to factor in method, timing and contingencies, can now be realized with breathtaking simplicity: possession of an ignition key. That and an utter disregard for the sanctity of human life are all that are needed to wreak havoc on the innocent. ROBERT WAGNER, NEW YORK To the Editor: Re “Trump Blames Schumer and Immigration Policies Hours After New York Terrorist Attack” (news article, nytimes.com, Nov. 1): I was born in Manhattan. I was in Manhattan when the towers fell. I was in Manhattan on Tuesday. I know the grit and goodness of New Yorkers. The day after the Las Vegas massacre, eager to avoid an honest discussion of this nation’s gun control policy, President Trump argued that it was not the time for politics. Yet not 24 hours after the horror in his hometown, Mr. Trump essentially blamed this attack on Senator Chuck Schumer, who supported the diversity visa program under which the suspect entered the United States from Uzbekistan. Now we know the president’s heart. A childhood in Queens and a career in Manhattan do not a New Yorker make. From behind double-paned glass, from the plush remove of a Fifth Avenue aerie, and from the gold-plated confines of his private plane, this president failed to pick up on what makes us us. We’re in this together. We look out for one another. This morning, I ache for a president who reflects those values. DAVID D. TURNER, NEW YORK To the Editor: None of President Trump’s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant policies would have prevented this tragedy: not the wall, not the travel ban, which did not include Uzbekistan, not extreme vetting. Instead, Mr. Trump is threatening to cut antiterrorism funds. "
1041,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers released scores of political ads on Wednesday purchased by Russian agents on Facebook and Twitter that showed the extent of the Kremlin’s attempts to polarize the American voting public on issues like race, police abuse and religion. Russia-linked actors created accounts with names like Blacktivists and Back the Badge aimed at voters concerned about police relations with their communities, and other accounts that called for secure borders that were aimed at immigration hard-liners. One account, Army of Jesus, published an illustration of an arm-wrestling match between Christ and the devil. “Satan: If I win, Clinton wins!” the headline read. The sampling of ads, some of which had been made public earlier, came during a second day of hearings with the top lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google and were intended to show the executives how pervasively Russia used their platforms to further its campaign of misinformation. Lawmakers of both parties expressed frustration with answers that fell short of what they had hoped and insisted that the companies, long the darlings of American technology, do better. “I must say, I don’t think you get it,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at the first hearing a day earlier. “I went home last night with profound disappointment. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.” Facebook, Google and Twitter said their general counsels were best equipped to dive into policy and legal questions. But counsels’ appearances on Capitol Hill also allowed the companies’ chief executives to escape high-profile scrutiny. “I’m disappointed that you’re here, and not your C.E.O.s,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine. "
1042,"They made for a wildly varied slide show, designed by Russia to exploit divisions in American society and to tip the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald J. Trump and against Hillary Clinton. The House Intelligence Committee provided on Wednesday the biggest public platform to date for a sample of the Facebook ads and pages that were linked by a trail of ruble payments to a Russian company with Kremlin ties. “America, we have a problem,” said Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who sits on the House committee. “We basically have the brightest minds of our tech community here and Russia was able to weaponize your platforms to divide us, to dupe us and to discredit democracy.” Among the ads the committee made public at Wednesday’s hearing were a Bernie Sanders superhero promoting gay rights ... ... and a shot of Mr. Trump giving a thumbs up and promoting rallies in Florida. An image of Jesus arm-wrestling Satan (who, the ad said, was backing Mrs. Clinton) ... ... and an endorsement of the Black Panthers as fighters against the Ku Klux Klan. There was a Confederate flag and a call for the South to rise again ... ... and a yellow “No Invaders Allowed” sign posted at the United States border. While many descriptions of Russia’s stealth influence campaign have stressed the focus on issues rather than candidates, many of the Facebook posts did both, often attacking Mrs. Clinton (sometimes via Mr. Sanders): But at least one ad attacked Mr. Trump: And although some of the Facebook pages fell on the liberal or multicultural side of the political divide, with names like Woke Blacks ... ... most leaned strongly to the right, including Back the Badge... ... and Stop All Invaders. In some cases, the Russian groups took opposite stands on painful issues, such as police shootings of black people. A page called Don’t Shoot took aim at police brutality... ... while Being Patriotic suggested that Black Lives Matter activists were killing police officers. While the ads being made public by Congress were just a sampling of the large Russian influence operation, independent researchers in recent weeks have identified and made public a far greater volume of such pages. Facebook, Twitter and other platforms have shut down the suspect accounts, but it is still possible to retrieve many of the posts and images because they were widely shared across the internet. Perhaps the biggest collection, put together by two American researchers who asked not to be identified to avoid online harassment, is posted at a page on Medium. The researchers based their searches largely on the pages and accounts named in a Russian media account based on interviews with former employees of the Russian company with Kremlin ties, the Internet Research Agency, accused of much of the fakery.  "
1043,"The terrorist attack in New York quickly turned into a debate over immigration policy after President  Trump revealed Wednesday that Sayfullo Saipov, the man accused of killing eight people, had benefited from an obscure program known as the diversity visa lottery. Mr. Trump’s comment — and his attack on Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who was instrumental in creating the program in 1990 — threw a spotlight on the lottery, a small part of the overall immigration system that nonetheless has been criticized by members of both parties. Mr. Schumer, in fact, was among senators proposing to end it several years ago. The lottery offers one of the fastest paths to legal permanent residency, often in less than two years. Some one million people have been awarded green cards through the program. Unlike other immigrants who gain admission, winners of the lottery do not need to have a close relative living in the United States, or any special skill. It is indeed a little like hitting a lottery. Some years, the program has attracted nearly 15 million applications, but no more than 50,000 visas may be awarded. During the monthlong application period each fall, which is currently in full swing, the lottery creates a craze in countries where it is regarded as a ticket out of poverty and to the American dream.

ustralia’s absolute refusal to resettle migrants who approach the country by boat sets it apart worldwide, and debate over that policy flared yet again this week as the government tried to shutter its Manus Island detention center even as more than 600 asylum seekers refused to relocate. The men, refugees from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries, said they had no food, no electricity and barely any water, but because they feared they would be attacked anywhere else on the island, they plan to hold out as long as they can. “If we have to move it will be against our will,” Imran Mohmammad, 23, a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar, told me in an interview. It’s still not clear how the standoff will end (and we’ll do our best to keep covering it) but as I read and watched the news reports here in Australia, I started to think about how disconnected the discussion in Australia has become from the larger global context. The migrants on Manus are but a ripple in a much wider sea. All over the globe, displacement is spreading, migration is increasing and dozens of countries are grappling with changing ideas of national identity. "
1045,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s bipartisan commission on the opioid crisis made dozens of final recommendations on Wednesday to combat a deadly addiction epidemic, ranging from creating more drug courts to vastly expanding access to medications that treat addiction, including in jails. The commissioners did not specify how much money should be spent to carry out their suggestions, but they pressed Congress to “appropriate sufficient funds” in response to Mr. Trump’s declaration last week of a public health emergency. The 56 recommendations — which covered opioid prescribing practices, prevention, treatment, law enforcement tactics and funding mechanisms — did not so much advocate a new approach as expanding strategies already being used. Reaction from treatment advocates was mixed, with many expressing frustration that the commission had not called for a specific level of funding. Chuck Ingoglia, a senior vice president at the National Council for Behavioral Health, which represents treatment providers, said that his group agreed with many of the recommendations, but that the report “starves the country for the real resources it needs to save American lives.” Although the commission did not put a dollar amount on its recommendations, it had specific ideas for how federal money should be funneled to states. Its top recommendation was to streamline “fragmented” federal funds for addiction prevention and treatment into block grants that would require each state to file only a single application instead of seeking grants from dozens of programs scattered across various agencies. The commission also appealed to the Trump administration to track more carefully the huge array of interdiction, prevention and treatment programs it is funding and to make sure they are working. “We are operating blindly today,” its report said. "
1046,"Many Americans projected their own feelings of disgust as they watched the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, seem to grimace while President Trump spoke in August of the “very fine people” on both sides of white nationalist demonstrations to preserve Confederate monuments, in which a counterdemonstrator was murdered. It seemed to be an example of how Mr. Kelly, the man brought in as “the adult” to calm the White House chaos, felt pained when he could not prevent the president from saying or tweeting something divisive, hateful or threatening. At least there was hope that he would speak up, either publicly or privately. Well, Mr. Kelly has now begun to speak up, and, in doing so, has provided sickening clarification of what this presidency stands for. When asked in an interview broadcast on Monday about plans by a Virginia church to remove plaques honoring George Washington and Robert E. Lee, he said it showed “a lack of appreciation of history.” “Robert E. Lee was an honorable man,” he added. He said that in the Civil War “men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.” With those remarks, Mr. Kelly revealed that it’s he, like the president, who lacks an appreciation of history — that he has chosen instead to embrace the mythology that white racists methodically created to hide the truth about the causes and course of the Civil War. The truth is, white Southerners went to war to destroy the United States in order to continue enslaving nearly 40 percent of the people in the region. "
1047,"We may shortly be facing a national crisis. President Trump’s base is egging him on to undertake his own “Saturday Night Massacre” and fire Robert Mueller for committing … for committing … uh, well, for working too hard as a prosecutor. On Fox News, the host Jeanine Pirro proposed firing Mueller, blaming the Democrats, and imprisoning Hillary Clinton. Speaking of the Mueller investigation, Pirro said, “It’s time to shut it down, turn the tables, and lock her up.” Wow. I’ve reported from tin-pot countries where public figures talk blithely of shutting down prosecutors and imprisoning rivals. I never thought I’d live in one. Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network denounced Mueller’s “gross overreach,” and the pro-Trump site Gateway Pundit excoriated “deep state crooked cop Robert Mueller.” Across the right wing, ideological snipers are taking potshots at Mueller, and even The Wall Street Journal has suggested in an editorial that Mueller resign. All this amounts to a perilous pirouette. After all, Mueller was last known to be a registered Republican and was appointed F.B.I. director by a Republican president, George W. Bush. Newt Gingrich reflected the G.O.P. consensus when he wrote in a May tweet: “Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.” Yet these days, Gingrich describes Mueller as an “out-of-control prosecutor” guilty of “grotesque abuse.” "
1048,"President Trump said on Wednesday that he was considering sending the terrorism suspect in the truck attack in New York to the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, an unprecedented step that would raise novel legal questions and likely set off a protest by veteran national security law enforcement officials. Mr. Trump made his comments at the start of a cabinet meeting a day after an immigrant from Uzbekistan, Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a pickup truck along a crowded Manhattan bicycle path, prosecutors say, killing eight people. Mr. Saipov had expressed support for the Islamic State, the authorities said. Asked by reporters whether he would send the suspect to Guantánamo, Mr. Trump said, “I would certainly consider that.” He added: “Send him to Gitmo — I would certainly consider that, yes.” The government last sent a detainee to Guantánamo in 2008, and it has never transferred someone arrested on American soil there. During the Bush administration, two terrorism suspects who were arrested inside the United States and initially charged in civilian court were transferred to military custody, but the Supreme Court has never resolved whether that was lawful. President Barack Obama refused to use the military to handle terrorism suspects who were arrested on domestic soil. But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would be “fine” with sending Americans to Guantánamo for military prosecution. The case of Mr. Saipov, a lawful permanent resident, presents a test of how Mr. Trump will handle such a situation now that he has the power and responsibility of governing. Doing so would infuriate career national security professionals and disrupt a carefully-honed approach to handling terrorism suspects, said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former Justice Department attorney. That includes the F.B.I.’s policy of delaying terror suspects’ Miranda warning rights to remain silent and have a defense lawyer during initial interrogations, he said. "
1049,"Everybody’s talking about taxes this week. Big Republican bill is coming out of the oven. Attention must be paid. Feel free to ask questions. Is it true that Donald Trump Jr. stole his kid’s Halloween candy? Don Jr. tweeted that he was going to take half of his daughter Chloe’s candy and give it to “some kid who sat at home. It’s never to early to teach her about socialism.” The most important thing about that tweet is that Junior misspelled “too.” His dad does that a lot. However, he also seemed to be talking about redistribution of wealth, so I guess it’s fair game for a tax conversation. Except that this is not the right moment to pick on Junior. His mother, Ivana, published a memoir recently that makes it clear this guy had one of the worst childhoods this side of Oliver Twist. His father didn’t want him named Donald Jr. in case he turned into a “loser.” He had to call Ivana in Florida to report he’d found his nanny unconscious in the basement. While he was in school, his father was having a torrid affair that was headlined in the tabloids every single day. So leave Donald Jr. alone. He had a weird upbringing. And maybe 20 years from now, we’ll offer the same sort of amnesty to Chloe. Meantime, about the taxes … Does Donald Trump think tax cuts will be his big first-year moment? For a president, every day is a new challenge to rise to the occasion. If, for instance, a terrorist assault hits an American city, he will want to quickly bring the people together by attacking the city’s U.S. senator and claiming the nation’s system of justice is “a joke.” So while taxes are of course a big presidential priority, it isn’t everything. Whoa, you’re sounding a little bitter there. "
1050,"NEW BRITAIN, Conn. — While Paul Manafort, St. Thomas Aquinas High School class of 1967, was becoming a power-suited political consultant and lobbyist in Washington and around the world, his old Catholic school was bleeding students. Eventually, almost two decades ago, the red brick shell of the school on this scuffed postindustrial city’s east side was abandoned. Adorned only with a few graffiti scrawls and a sign advertising long-discontinued games of Sunday evening bingo, it sat empty until it was sold to a developer last year for $80,000. But it acquired a certain interest for a wider audience than the local graffiti artists when Mr. Manafort was indicted on charges that he had laundered more than $18 million through overseas shell companies during a decades-long career as a lobbyist. For years, it seemed as if the fortunes of Mr. Manafort and New Britain — once famous as the Hardware City, home to corporations like Stanley Tools; now best known in some quarters as the residence of Daym Drops, a prominent YouTube food reviewer — were on permanently divergent paths. Search for New Britain on Google, and “the first name that comes up is Paul Manafort,” said Ed McKeon, a filmmaker who grew up in New Britain and now lives nearby in Middletown. “It’s kind of depressing, you know.” “We didn’t have anything to do with it,” protested John Whalen, a New Britain resident who works at an aerospace company. "
1051,"THURSDAY PUZZLE — Running is an extremely dangerous sport, primarily because it takes place outdoors and involves leaving the safety and comfort of my couch. And yet I do it. Well, what I do could better be described as “loping,” and only by people a lot more optimistic than me. But I am determined to be a runner, despite the dangers and despite the fact that I wheeze even more than I do when I go curling. Running is addictive and it’s supposedly good for you, providing you only do it to the point where you remain clinically not dead. This is frankly why I’m so worried about Peter Sagal. On Sunday, November 5, Mr. Sagal (whose day job is host of NPR’s “Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me”) will be running in the New York Marathon — a proper marathon, the full 26.2 miles, not some poncey run like I do — to which I say “Best of luck” and “Swift running to you,” not to mention “Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...” That is an absurdly hard thing to put one’s body through, and this particular marathon has runners putting their bodies through it in all five boroughs of New York City, if they run the whole thing. My point is, Mr. Sagal is a brave man for at least two reasons: He is laying his life on the line to run in the New York Marathon, he is doing it as a guide for a blind runner (see his notes below), and he has constructed his first crossword, in collaboration with game designer and constructor Mike Selinker. This is a lovely Thursday offering and I learned more about the marathon that I may never run today, so thanks for that, Mr. Sagal and Mr. Selinker. The theme stayed very cleverly hidden until the end for me, and I can’t ask for more than that. Except for maybe some hydration gel. I spoke with Mr. Sagal and Mr. Selinker about their puzzle, about the marathon, and why you should never listen to anything Mr. Sagal says during a race. "
1052,"Barely two hours after the deadly truck attack struck Lower Manhattan on Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio convened a news conference at Police Headquarters, where police and elected officials were to address the cameras that rolled for viewers around the world. Mr. de Blasio, speaking a week before a mayoral election that he is widely expected to win, presented himself as the head of the nation’s largest city at a time of pain. He responded with resolve, calling the attack terrorism in his first public remarks, and he vowed, as his predecessors had done in other moments of crisis, not to let the actions of those bent on terrorism alter the life of the city. Almost immediately afterward, the mayor and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo made a series of appearances — at the site of the attack, at a news conference and at the annual Halloween parade Tuesday night — and put aside, for the moment at least, the destructive political rivalry that plagued much of the mayor’s first term. “Everyone is here in common cause,” the mayor said in remarks at Police Headquarters on Wednesday, flanked by Mr. Cuomo, the city’s police commissioner and an array of grim-faced city, state and federal law enforcement officials. “This was an attack on our values,” Mr. de Blasio said, donning the mantle of leader for all city residents. “We will not change. We will not be cowed.” Sixteen years earlier, the Sept. 11 terror attacks had a profound effect across the United States, but nowhere more than in New York, where the World Trade Center was lost and the majority of the 2,977 victims from that day were killed. "
1053,"President Trump projected an air of calm on Wednesday after charges against his former campaign chief and a foreign policy aide roiled Washington, insisting to The New York Times that he was not “angry at anybody” and that investigations into his campaign’s links to Russia had not come near him personally. “I’m not under investigation, as you know,” Mr. Trump said in a brief telephone call late Wednesday afternoon. Pointing to the indictment of his former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, the president said, “And even if you look at that, there’s not even a mention of Trump in there.” “It has nothing to do with us,” Mr. Trump said. He also pushed back against a report published Monday night by The Washington Post, which the president said described him as “angry at everybody.” “I’m actually not angry at anybody,” Mr. Trump told The Times. The phone call seemed intended to dispel the impression of a president and a White House under siege. The indictment of Mr. Manafort and his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, on Monday came as little surprise to Mr. Trump or his team, and they were relieved that the charges were not directly related to last year’s campaign. Instead, both were indicted on charges including money laundering, tax evasion and failing to properly disclose lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. But the president’s advisers were surprised when another former aide, George Papadopoulos, who was on the president’s hastily assembled foreign policy team, pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his repeated efforts to connect the campaign with Russians who might provide “dirt” on Hillary Clinton drawn from “thousands of emails.” Most unnerving was the discovery that Mr. Papadopoulos had been secretly cooperating with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for three months. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has acknowledged that the investigation has taken its toll on the president. “It is very distracting to the president, as it would be to any citizen, to be investigated for something, while at the same time trying to carry the weight of what being president of the United States means on his shoulder,” Mr. Kelly told Fox News this week. "
1054,"Something seemed amiss with the brownstone at 377 Union Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. After it sold for nearly $3 million in cash in 2012, the gorgeous four-story townhouse in one of Brooklyn’s prettiest neighborhoods proceeded to become an eyesore and a nuisance. Renovations dragged on for several years, then stopped. I-beams and cinder blocks cluttered the yard. Windows broke. Neighbors complained that the construction caused their basements to flood. The security alarm would go off in the middle of the night for an hour at a time. “The speed of the transaction was strange, and then the length of the renovation was strange,” said William Jeanes, a retired city worker who lives a few doors down. The absentee owners broke a cardinal rule of brownstone Brooklyn: There is a ginkgo tree near the house, and in the fall, ginkgos drop fleshy, rotten-scented fruits. The owners were the only ones on their block who did not sweep their ginkgo fruit off the sidewalk. On Monday, federal prosecutors linked the house to something more than a local annoyance: It was, they charged, a mechanism through which Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, laundered millions in unreported income from lobbying work on behalf of pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort’s ownership of the property was first brought to the public’s attention in February by a blogger, Katia Kelly, who runs a neighborhood news site called Pardon Me for Asking. One springlike day, she went out to take pictures for a post about a controversial public school expansion. A passer-by saw her with her camera and offered a scoop. “She said, ‘Guess who lives on my block?’” Ms. Kelly recalled on Tuesday. “With all the celebrities moving into the neighborhood, my first thought was Jay-Z or Beyoncé, or Gwyneth Paltrow – my mind was going gossipy Hollywood instead of swampy Washington.” "
1055,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “We will not be cowed.” That was Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, one day after a truck attack killed eight people near the World Trade Center. The suspect, an Uzbek immigrant named Sayfullo Saipov, has been charged with carrying out the attack in the name of the Islamic State. The group has not claimed responsibility, but our correspondent notes that it often does not when a recruit is captured alive. Above, his photo displayed at an N.Y.P.D. news conference. _____ 2. Those killed included five Argentines celebrating their 30th high school reunion, above; a Belgian mother of two; and two local men, ages 23 and 32. "
1056,"President Trump, his motley crew of White House and cabinet ideologues, and many other Republicans claim to have a better understanding of American values, traditions and history than the rest of us. They are the “real Americans,” as the historically illiterate Sarah Palin loved to say many times a day. But a great many of their notions about America are deeply puzzling at best and, at worst, truly scary ideas infused with racism and intolerance of dissent. The list defies comprehensive accounting. (Time magazine has to keep updating a handy guide to the world according to Trump that it started after his first 100 days in office.) But here are some of my favorites. The Civil War: Back in August, after racists marched in Charlottesville to defend monuments to those who fought to preserve slavery, Trump’s lawyer, John Dowd, forwarded around an email saying that there was “literally no difference” between George Washington and Robert E. Lee. More recently, John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told Laura Ingraham on Fox News that the “lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War.” What possible compromise could there have been over slavery? But it’s also false history. There were plenty of “compromises.” All of them enshrined the evil institution of slavery and made the civil war more likely, not less. "
1057,"Murderous attacks by a brooding “lone wolf” attacker or full-blooded “terrorist” have become, alas, a blight of our times, an eruption of random killing that can strike a cafe, a crowded promenade, a country music festival or a bike path in New York. Each new attack is met by anguished questions: Why? Could not the police have prevented the attack? Sayfullo Saipov, in custody now after the attack in Manhattan on Tuesday that left eight people dead, is said to have been planning his death spree for weeks and had links to people who were the focus of terrorism investigations. Was there really no sign that he — or the shooter in Las Vegas, or the killers in Barcelona, Nice, Berlin, London, Stockholm or Paris, all places where innocent people have been killed by hate-filled fools — was about to commit an atrocity? The federal and local authorities in the United States and Europe have made considerable progress in the struggle with terrorism, and there have been many reports of foiled attacks. A lot of study has gone into the motivations and roots of Islamist violence and hatred. The fact that Mr. Saipov has survived should enable investigators to learn more about what leads a young man to carnage. But the hard fact is that it is not possible, and never will be, to anticipate every attack, to make cities teeming with life immune to the desperate acts of men seething with resentments, especially when final preparations are as banal as renting a truck. And as for the tiresome calls for draconian border controls, could immigration authorities really have foreseen in 2010 that a 22-year-old arrival from Uzbekistan — which is not on the list of countries on the Trump administration’s travel ban — would be radicalized and evolve into a killer? Mr. Saipov’s cries of “Allahu akbar” and other evidence speak to an affinity for the Islamic State, but it does not require a long apprenticeship in a terrorist network to rent a Home Depot truck and drive onto a bicycle path. "
1058,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday and signaled another rate increase is very likely to come in mid-December. But hanging over the meeting was the anticipation of a much bigger change: The nomination of Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman. The Fed’s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is expected to remain in that post until her term expires in February. On Wednesday, President Trump called Ms. Yellen “excellent.” Nevertheless, he is expected to nominate Mr. Powell, a current board member, for the Fed chairmanship at a Rose Garden event on Thursday, according to people familiar with the decision. Mr. Powell, a Republican who joined the Fed in 2012, has steadily supported Ms. Yellen’s approach to monetary policy and is expected to follow a similar trajectory if confirmed to lead the central bank. Mr. Powell has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, including its four interest rate increases and the gradual unwinding of the Fed’s stimulus campaign. The meeting Wednesday was the first since the Fed began reducing its vast portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which it acquired in an effort to stimulate the economy during and after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed is approaching the process cautiously, and so far investors appear unfazed. The central bank is paring its $4.2 trillion in bond holdings by just $10 billion per month through the end of this year, then gradually increasing the pace until it reaches a monthly rate of $50 billion. At the conclusion of its two-day gathering in Washington, the Fed announced that it would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1 and 1.25 percent, after lifting it twice so far this year. The vote was unanimous, and the central bank did not alter any of the careful wording in its statement about its expected rate of future increases — a sign that it is not trying to quell widely held expectations of a rate increase of a quarter point in December. "
1059,"Allahu akbar. It’s Arabic for “God is greatest.” Muslims, an eccentric tribe with over a billion members, say it several times in our five daily prayers. The phrase is also a convenient way to express just the right kind of gratitude in any situation. I say “Allahu akbar” out loud more than 100 times a day. Yesterday, I uttered it several times during my late-evening Isha prayer. Earlier, during dinner, I said it with my mouth full after biting into my succulent halal chicken kebab. In the afternoon, I dropped it in a conference room at the State Department, where I’d been invited to address a packed room of government employees about the power of storytelling. Specifically, I expressed my continuing gratitude for the election of Barack Obama, whom, in a joking nod to the Islamophobic paranoia that surrounded him, I called “our first Muslim American president,” adding “Allahu akbar!” People in the crowd laughed and applauded, the world continued to spin, no one had an aneurysm, and only a few people seemed to wonder with arched, Sarah Sanders-like eyebrows, “Wait, is he ...?” I even confess to saying “Allahu akbar” two days ago in a restroom after losing the battle, but ultimately winning the war, against a nasty stomach virus. I’m 37 years old. In all those years, I, like an overwhelming majority of Muslims, have never uttered “Allahu akbar” before or after committing a violent act. Unfortunately, terrorists like ISIS and Al Qaeda and their sympathizers, who represent a tiny fraction of Muslims, have. In the public imagination, this has given the phrase meaning that’s impossible to square with what it represents in my daily life. “Allahu akbar” is in the headlines again because the 29-year-old man who plowed a rental truck along a bicycle path killing eight people and injuring a dozen in Manhattan on Tuesday is reported to have said it after the attack. My heart sank as I heard the live news coverage, dotted with pieces of information meant to help us make sense of a tragedy: the suspect’s physical description, the kind of vehicle he drove, the stunned eyewitness accounts emphatically saying that it didn’t look at all accidental. And the two words the police say he shouted when the unthinkable act was over: Allahu akbar. "
1060,"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Legacy: Damaged Brains,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, Oct. 29): Pediatricians are alarmed by the Environmental Protection Agency’s recent decision to allow the continued use of chlorpyrifos, a toxic pesticide. Mr. Kristof explains in compelling detail the special interests that influenced the E.P.A.’s decision and why it should concern us all. Extensive epidemiologic studies associate pesticide exposure with adverse birth and developmental outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, pediatric cancers, neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits, and asthma. The evidence is especially strong linking certain pesticide exposure with pediatric cancers and permanent neurological damage. The agency’s own calculations suggest that babies, children and pregnant women all eat much more chlorpyrifos than is safe. In fact, the E.P.A. has estimated that “typical” exposures for babies are probably five times greater than its proposed “safe” intake, and 11 to 15 times higher for toddlers and older children. This chemical is unambiguously dangerous and should be banned from use. We urge the E.P.A. to reverse its decision and protect child health. FERNANDO STEIN, HOUSTON The writer is president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. "
1061,"We heard what sounded like a crash and what might have been a gunshot, but it didn’t register at first. Lower Manhattan is loud at every hour with traffic and construction, and my wife and I have grown used to ignoring the ambient noise. Even when one police siren follows another. Even when it is followed by dozens more. Two of our three children had been out shopping for Halloween. Then our 12-year-old son came home. He told us he had seen a truck smashed on our corner; that there had been a shooting; that he’d seen what looked like blood on the windshield. He said the police were swarming the neighborhood and helicopters were flying overhead and our building was locked down. He was composed as he told us all of this. He must have missed the attack by a few minutes at most. Where was our teenager? We experienced a moment of parental panic until she answered her phone and came home. I checked the news and saw something about bodies strewn along the bike path along the Hudson. I must have said “terrorism.” Our 8-year-old started to cry. “We’re safe up here,” my wife assured her. “No, we’re not,” she replied, not unreasonably. I went downstairs to try to see things for myself, just as I had when I lived in Jerusalem during the second intifada and similar events were an almost weekly occurrence. The day was clear and crisp. There were fire trucks and gurneys outside Stuyvesant High School, the elite public school that anchors the northern end of our neighborhood. I tried to get to the bike path, but stern-looking police officers waved me off at every corner. A woman pushing an infant in a stroller was sobbing; I heard her say that she had been outside when the crash took place. I stopped a paramedic to ask what he knew about the number of casualties. “A lot,” he said. It was clear that terrorism had returned to Manhattan, barely a year after a bomb went off on 23rd Street and injured more than 30 people. Within an hour it became clear that it was the act of another jihadist, most likely a self-starter inspired by what he had seen on TV of similar attacks in Barcelona and Nice. Ted Cruz and other right-wing populists sometimes deride Manhattan as a liberal La-La Land of privileged people living far from the real world. But on Tuesday there was only the stark reality of multiple homicides outside our home and grim-faced emergency medical workers racing to the scene. Disasters that strike close to home inevitably affect us differently from those we observe at a distance. I cross the bike path near the spot where the terrorist crashed his truck every day. My kids learned to ride their bikes on the same path that became Tuesday’s scene of carnage. We celebrated our older daughter’s bat mitzvah at a restaurant just off that path. My son went to soccer camp at Pier 40, where the rampage began. “There but for the grace of God go I” may be the world’s most shopworn phrase, but it’s one you feel keenly after an event like this. "
1062,"While allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful men in recent weeks have drawn wide public support and prompted quick response, women who came forward during the presidential race with accusations against Donald J. Trump said they spent the past year feeling dismissed and forgotten. “With Trump, it was all brushed under the rug,” said Temple Taggart, who claimed Mr. Trump kissed her on the mouth when she was competing in his Miss USA pageant in 1997. But that could change if a defamation lawsuit brought by a woman who accused Mr. Trump of unwanted sexual advances is allowed to proceed in New York State Supreme Court, a legal ruling that could come before the end of the year. Lawyers in the suit sought a subpoena seeking all Trump campaign records related to his female accusers. If the case advances, the accusers could be deposed, going up against Mr. Trump yet again. The plaintiff in the lawsuit — Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Mr. Trump’s show “The Apprentice” — is represented by the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has helped bring cases against Bill Cosby and other high-profile defendants. They claimed that Mr. Trump defamed Ms. Zervos during the campaign when he repeatedly described her and other accusers’ accounts as “lies” and “nonsense” and said the women either were being put forward by his opponent Hillary Clinton’s campaign or were motivated to come forward by getting “10 minutes of fame,” according to the complaint. Mr. Trump has sought to dismiss or stay the case, claiming that a sitting president cannot be sued in state court and that his comments amount to political speech, arguments that were reaffirmed by his legal team in a brief filed on Tuesday. But lawyers for Ms. Zervos point to the United States Supreme Court ruling that allowed Paula Jones to bring a sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton while he was in office, and several law professors have filed briefs supporting the legal grounds for such a suit. "
1063,"Against a backdrop of renewed fears of terrorism, Mayor Bill de Blasio and two of his main challengers clashed on Wednesday in their final pre-election debate that, after a solemn start, descended into frequent cross-talk and pointed attacks. The timing of the debate, a day after a man who immigrated from Uzbekistan rammed a pickup truck through a crowded Lower Manhattan bike path, killing eight and wounding a dozen, presented political difficulties for Mr. de Blasio’s opponents, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican candidate, and Bo Dietl, a former police detective running as an independent. The first three questions were related to terrorism: how to conduct police surveillance without violating civil liberties of Muslim New Yorkers; building bollards to better secure pedestrian and cycling areas; and reacting to President Trump’s comments on further restrictions to immigration. Neither challenger criticized the mayor on his handling of the attack; each started by praising the Police Department and the resolve of the people of the city. All three liked the idea of more bollards. But Mr. Dietl defended the surveillance of Muslims within minutes of the start. “As far as this profiling thing, worrying about it, just look at this terrorist,” Mr. Dietl said. “What did he look like? Did he look like the terrorist, if you looked at a dictionary, with that beard the way he had.” He added, “Political correctness cannot be there all the time.” The stage afforded a ready-made opportunity for viewers to imagine how the relatively unknown Ms. Malliotakis, who stood to the mayor’s left, and the bellicose Mr. Dietl, who stood to his right, might have reacted to a similar act of terrorism, six days before the vote on Nov. 7. "
1064,"New Yorkers on Wednesday were mourning the eight dead from a terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan and wondering how vulnerable they and their families might be, even as they picked themselves up, as New Yorkers do, and went on with life. Some of them inevitably thought back to another beautiful fall day in Lower Manhattan, on Sept. 11, 2001. After that day, they remembered, they and their nation were led in mourning, and toward unity, by a president who shared their sorrow and understood his own role. The current American president reacted rather differently. “A Chuck Schumer beauty,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday, blaming an immigrant visa program, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush and supported by Senator Schumer, for the fact that the terrorism suspect, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, was in this country as a legal resident. Mr. Trump might instead have rallied the nation. But he could not resist resorting to his campaign fantasy that closing the nation’s borders to those whom he selectively targets is the all-purpose solution to terrorist violence. Overnight, he and the nativist media seized on the title of the program — the Diversity Visa Lottery — to portray it as a “politically correct” indulgence undermining the country, rather than affirming its core values. “Sounds nice,” Mr. Trump said of the program, which is open to about 50,000 applicants a year from nations that traditionally send few emigrants here. But “it’s not nice,” he insisted. He called on Congress to end it. "
1065,"The Democratic Party has learned to stop worrying and love “big government” liberalism. The party’s top presidential prospects are advertising their ardor for socialized medicine, free public college, universal child care and paid family leave. Even the party’s moderate senators are now pushing for the same kind of public health insurance option that their centrist predecessors killed in the early Obama years. And the party’s 2018 platform — the consensus agenda that ostensibly unites all Democrats, from Joe Manchin of West Virginia to Bernie Sanders — calls for vigorous antitrust enforcement to prevent mega-corporations from rigging the economy against working people. The party’s resident “sensible centrists” are horrified: “Has the entire Democratic Party forgotten the words ‘George McGovern’?” they cry. In column after column, they have been imploring their co-partisans to remember a fundamental fact: America is a center-right nation, where nearly 70 percent of voters are moderate or conservative, and just 25 percent are liberal. Over the past eight years, Democrats lost sight of this inconvenient truth — and lost control of more than 1,000 state legislative seats, the House, the Senate and the presidency. This argument may sound coolheaded and pragmatic. But its core premises — that American voters are hostile to progressive economics and have punished the (increasingly left-wing) Democratic Party accordingly — actually rest on ideological conviction, not empirical evidence. In truth, the Republican Party’s dominance has little to do with the American electorate’s “center-right” ideology. We know this for two simple reasons: First, the vast majority of that electorate has no ideology, whatsoever. And second, when polled on discrete policy questions, Americans consistently express majoritarian support for a left-of-center economic agenda. The political scientist Philip Converse first brought the first reality to national attention in 1964. In his classic essay “The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics,” Mr. Converse demonstrated that only 17 percent of American voters could both correctly assign the terms “liberal” and “conservative” to the nation’s two major political parties and offer a sensible description of what those terms meant. The rest of the electorate did not understand politics as a fight over abstract theories of good government but rather a conflict between interest groups. Ordinary voters did not select the party that most faithfully represented their political philosophy — they picked the one that appeared to best represent their people, a group they might define with reference to class, region, religion, race or partisanship itself. "
1066,"In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start “a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.” But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful. Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, “This is your brain on drugs.” A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin. Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects — as in the “Just Say No” campaign — appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s. Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns. Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging. The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows. At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use. A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful. Why was the original campaign such a failure? In part it suffered from perverse incentives. Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress. But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents. In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion. Other reasons that campaigns backfire is that they make adolescents aware of a drug that they might not have heard of, sparking curiosity in some to try it. Campaigns against drugs can also create a false sense that drug use is more common than it is, making those who don’t use drugs feel socially abnormal. "

Here’s what we know and don’t know about the attack, the deadliest terrorist event in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. The suspect, a 29-year old man from Uzbekistan, was taken into custody after being shot by the police. A bystander’s video appears to show him after the attack. Law enforcement officials found notes that indicated an allegiance to the Islamic State, but they said they were treating the case as one of an “inspired” attacker. Among the victims were five tourists from Argentina who were celebrating a 30-year high school reunion. • “I approached to see if I could help and they did not need help — they appeared to be dead,” one man said.

1070,"The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over its detention of a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who was stopped by Border Patrol agents in Texas last week on her way to surgery. The girl, Rosa Maria Hernandez, had been living in Laredo, Tex., with her parents, where she was brought illegally from Mexico when she was 3 months old. Her case became a new flash point in a national debate over the administration’s hard-line immigration policies, eliciting outcries from members of Congress as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics, an advocacy group. The A.C.L.U. argues in its suit that Border Patrol agents illegally and erroneously detained Rosa Maria, who was traveling to a hospital in Corpus Christi to have gallbladder surgery, under the pretext that she is an “unaccompanied minor.” The lawsuit, filed in a United States District Court in San Antonio, further argues that the government violated Rosa Maria’s constitutional rights by separating her from her parents without due process. The A.C.L.U. asked the court for a temporary restraining order against the government to allow her immediate release. “This case is shocking,” Michael Tan, an A.C.L.U. lawyer working on Rosa Maria’s case, said in a phone interview on Tuesday evening. “And all of us who do immigration work are concerned that this is the new normal.” "
1071,"WASHINGTON — President Trump touched off a sharply partisan debate over some of the most divisive issues in American life on Wednesday as he cited this week’s terrorist attack in New York to advance his agenda on immigration and national security while assailing Democrats for endangering the country. A day after an immigrant from Uzbekistan was arrested on suspicion of plowing a pickup truck along a crowded bicycle path in Manhattan, killing eight people, Mr. Trump denounced the American criminal justice system as “a joke” and “a laughingstock,” adding that he was open to sending “this animal” instead to the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Shortly before midnight, the president took it a step further, posting a message on Twitter declaring that the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, should be executed. “NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room,” he wrote, referring to the driver’s reported interest in the Islamic State extremist group. “He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!” Presidents are typically advised never to weigh in on pending criminal cases because such comments can be used by defense lawyers to argue that their clients cannot get a fair trial — especially when the head of the executive branch that will prosecute the charges advocates the ultimate punishment before a judge has heard a single shred of evidence at trial. But Mr. Trump has disregarded such advice in other instances, as well. The president’s vocal response to the attack framed the emerging politics of the case. While the White House deemed it unseemly to have a policy debate on gun control immediately after the massacre in Las Vegas last month, Mr. Trump was eager on Wednesday to have a policy debate on immigration. He pressed Congress to cancel a visa lottery program that allowed the driver into the country, attributing it to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and called Democrats “obstructionists” who “don’t want to do what’s right for our country.” “We have to get much tougher,” the president told reporters. “We have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct. We’re so politically correct that we’re afraid to do anything.” "
1072,"It was an irony lost perhaps only on the White House that, almost nine months after he entered office, President Trump’s official photographic portrait was finally released … on Halloween. After all, it presented a very different image of the president than had most of his previous snaps. It is unlike the portrait that had often been used in the past few months on Mr. Trump’s Twitter profile, showing the president with a fearsome “You’re fired!” look on his face, and unlike the one on his White House Twitter account, in which his hands are clasped and he has a look of deep concern. The portrait, taken by the White House photographer Shealah Craighead, is also unlike the highly airbrushed official portrait of Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, which was released in April and features a Sphinx-like first lady, albeit with a soft focus. It does not include his trademark red tie (like the one he wore at his inauguration), nor a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. It does not remotely resemble the famous portrait of Winston Churchill — you know, the one taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, in which the former prime minister of Britain is scowling, with one hand on hip — who, The New York Times reported in March, was Mr. Trump’s model of choice. Instead, it depicts Mr. Trump in front of the de rigueur American flag, in a navy suit with flag pin, white shirt, patterned blue tie — and big grin. The orange glow has been toned down, but it is the smile that really sticks out. It almost looks as if he’s being tickled. The word chortle comes to mind. That the president and his team chose this image of benign cheer to adorn government offices across the country and to represent his administration is pretty striking, not simply because it seems to suggest “Hey, I’m enjoying this gig” or because it is counter to so much of Mr. Trump’s usual threatening, fight-picking, wall-building posturing. It is also something of an anomaly in the presidential portrait continuum, where the exhibition of restrained gravitas often seems to be the overriding imperative. "

First, if you read only one thing about John Kelly’s embrace of white nationalism and the Civil War myth, I recommend a string of tweets by Ta-Nehisi Coates yesterday. It’s “shocking that someone charged with defending their country, in some profound way, does not comprehend the country they claim to defend,” Coates wrote. He also walked through some of the copious historical evidence that the Civil War was indeed about slavery and that Robert E. Lee was a slavery true-believer and a torturer. (To read the full string, go to Coates’s Twitter page, scroll down to the tweet that starts with “Regarding John Kelly’s creationist theorizing...” and read upward.) On the same subject, and from the political right, Noah Rothman writes in Commentary magazine about Kelly’s “disastrous interview.” In The Times, Kashana Cauley explains how “compromise” — which Kelly said could have prevented the Civil War — allowed slavery to thrive. The dossier that won’t die. “Check the DEMS!” President Trump tweeted yesterday. “We now have evidence that Democrats literally paid money for Russian intelligence,” Fox News’s Tucker Carlson claimed on his show. “The Democrat-Fusion-Russia story requires as full an investigation as the question of Trump-Russia collusion,” The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote.

1075,"BEIJING — For more than a year, China has railed against South Korea, calling for boycotts of its products over Seoul’s decision to let the United States deploy an antimissile system, which Beijing fears threatens its own security. On Tuesday, however, China abruptly changed course, essentially saying “never mind,” as the two countries agreed to end their dispute even though South Korea is keeping the system in place. China’s unexpected move to settle the rancorous dispute could scramble President Trump’s calculations about how to deal with allies and North Korea on the eve of his first trip to Asia. The decision, by the newly empowered Chinese president, Xi Jinping, appeared to reflect a judgment that China’s continued opposition to the deployment of the American missile defense system was not succeeding in fraying the South Korean government’s alliance with Washington. But it could also pose a fresh challenge to Mr. Trump, as he attempts to build support in the region to put greater pressure on North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs. South Korea’s liberal president, Moon Jae-in, is more receptive to diplomacy with the North Koreans than either Mr. Trump or Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Drawing Mr. Moon closer to Beijing, analysts said, could create a new alignment on how to deal with the North, with China and South Korea facing off against Japan and the United States. "
1076,"The first indictments in Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 American presidential elections have made it very clear that “Russia-gate” will be a critical factor in American domestic politics in the months to come. But no matter how deep Mr. Mueller digs and what he finds, it seems unlikely that he is going to get to the bottom of a series of bigger questions about the Kremlin’s decision to interfere in America’s politics in the first place. Was this a desperate attempt to install a Russia-friendly president in the White House? Or was the main objective to discredit the American political system at a moment when the Kremlin has lost any hope for normalizing relations with Washington? Was it a major strategic move or just a “fun operation” meant more to hurt than to influence? And there are important questions not just about what happened but also about the future: How have Moscow’s recent experiences in America and Europe influenced Russia’s willingness to interfere in Western democracies’ politics? Does the Kremlin consider its meddling in American elections and the chaos that followed a success? If so, was its inability to sway France’s presidential election this spring a failure? Mr. Mueller’s indictments will not answer these questions. The Kremlin’s official position — that Russia never messed with the American politics — means that hardly anyone on the Russian side is willing to discuss the issue, either. And those who actually do know what Russia did and why are extraordinarily few in number — and none are particularly talkative. So if we want to figure out why the Russians did what they did, we need to leave the terrain of spy games and move to the realm of foreign policy. "
1077,"WASHINGTON — There is a math problem at the heart of the Republican Party’s protracted introduction of a sprawling tax bill, and it grows, in part, from President Trump’s two nonnegotiable demands. Mr. Trump has insisted on “massive” tax cuts, including reducing the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and delivering a tax cut for the middle class. Both of those goals have proved difficult for the Republicans putting together the House version of the tax bill. They are running into political challenges as they try to offset lost revenue to stay within the confines of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that lawmakers have voted to allow. The tax rewrite is pitting businesses against individuals, as lawmakers look for ways to offset trillions of dollars of personal and corporate income tax cuts by limiting popular individual tax breaks, including preferential treatment for 401(k) plans and the state and local tax deduction. Business groups, meanwhile, say lawmakers run the risk of putting the United States at a global disadvantage if it does not reduce the corporate tax rate to a level commensurate with other industrialized nations. The bill, which had been scheduled for release on Wednesday, is now expected to be unveiled Thursday, despite continuing struggles to reach agreement on how to pay for everything lawmakers want to include. Some industry groups familiar with the negotiations said the remaining shortfall was in the hundreds of billions of dollars. On Wednesday, lawmakers were discussing a potential bandage solution to buy themselves time to figure out the hard math. That solution would call for phasing in some rate cuts over a period of years, and making some cuts temporary, which would lessen the short- and long-term revenue hit. Industry groups familiar with the discussions said such a move was not meant to be the actual legislative solution, but rather a place holder that would allow Republican leaders to work out the details of a new set of revenue-raisers that would be inserted in the bill before the full House votes on it. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that the intention was to make the corporate tax cut permanent, but that it might not appear that way immediately. "
1078,"Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed charges accusing the driver in the Manhattan truck attack of carrying out a long-planned plot, spurred by Islamic State propaganda videos, to kill people celebrating Halloween. The charges, filed just over 24 hours after the deadliest terror attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, placed the case in the civilian courts even as President Trump denounced the American criminal justice system as “a joke” and “a laughingstock.” The charges describe the driver, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, as a voracious consumer and meticulous student of ISIS propaganda, and detail how he said he was spurred to attack by an ISIS video questioning the killing of Muslims in Iraq. They say he began planning the attack about a year ago and, after taking a test run in a Home Depot rental truck last week, chose Halloween to carry it out because more people would be on the streets. The charges were filed in civilian court, and not the military system set up for foreign terrorists, a decision that flew in the face of Mr. Trump’s broadsides against the criminal justice system. Mr. Trump said he was open to trying Mr. Saipov instead in military court at the American prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Saipov, accused of killing eight people and injuring 12 in the attack, was pushed into a Manhattan federal courtroom in a wheelchair just after 6 p.m. on Wednesday. He sat slightly hunched, his rail-thin body dressed in a gray shirt and gray pants. His hair stuck up slightly in the back. His hands and feet were chained. Five guards stood behind him. "
1079,"Did you hear the bugs are disappearing? Amateur entomologists tracking insect populations in Western Europe discovered that, at a number of survey sites, the biomass of flying insects caught in their traps fell by almost 80 percent between 1989 and 2014. For whatever reason, in a media landscape thick with catastrophe, this was the story that cut through for me in this moment. Flying insects pollinate our plants, including crops. They are food for birds and bats and frogs and things. If the almost-80 percent decline proves true, and bears out globally, and continues unabated, we may all starve to death long before Donald Trump has the chance to vaporize us in a nuclear holocaust. Other stories that flashed in and out (always out! Bye!) of my news feed this week: Orca whales may be extinct within the next 100 years, on a beach in Wales dozens of octopuses walked out of the sea and died, greenhouse gases are spiking to an unprecedented record, an endangered lemur in Madagascar is hanging on by a thread because of climate change, and something about the Great Barrier Reef that I couldn’t bear to click on. In non-environmental doom, Facebook is apparently helping to enable horrific violence in Myanmar, the president’s supposedly moderating minder John Kelly said in an interview that “the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,” and Mother Jones reports that artificial intelligence will render all human workers obsolete in the relatively near future and the desperate, idle populace will devolve into mass chaos while a few quintillionaire industrialists gaze chortling across their automaton armies. But at least Paul Manafort had a bad day, right? Yeah. Actually, that is something. The part that knocked the wind out of me about the bug thing wasn’t really the story itself, it was the crystallization of how desperately, comically far we are from taking it, or anything, seriously as a planet. Instead of leaping into global collective action to mitigate the collapse of the biosphere and potential human extinction, America’s ruling party is currently squabbling about whether they should punitively investigate Hillary Clinton over a routine committee decision from 2010 or for somehow rigging the election she lost. Why do we tolerate this from our elected employees? How is our basic animal survival instinct not sending us into open revolt? Even if we’d elected that bat from “FernGully” last year instead of a gaseous, smoke-belching coal baron who seems to feel personally wronged by fresh air, pulling the planet back from disaster would still be a nail-biting scramble at this point. I speak as a seasoned, professional procrastinator: It would still be the second-to-last day of the semester, and we have not remotely started the reading. Instead, we’re out in the woods burning our textbooks for warmth while we argue about whose job it is to chop down a tree to build a desk so we can start our kindergarten homework, and we don’t even know how to build a desk. This week’s indictments are satisfying, of course, and I feel faintly hopeful in a concrete way that I thought I’d lost. But I’m struggling to truly relish them. The efficacy of the Mueller investigation depends on so many unknowns, most pressingly whether the rule of law will hold after a year of President Trump’s assaults on it — and whether Americans across the political spectrum can find our way back to some common truth. "
1080,"Hours after a truck plowed along a Manhattan bike path on Tuesday, Americans returned to a debate that has become a vessel for some of the most contentious questions dividing an increasingly polarized society: When is an attack terrorism? A month ago, when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas, killing dozens and wounding hundreds, the attack was not broadly branded an act of terrorism. But that label was immediately attached to the attack on Tuesday that killed eight people, setting off another round of a fierce national debate. On the surface, this could be considered a straightforward question of motive. Terrorism is defined as an attack on civilians meant to frighten a larger community for political purposes. But the new generation of Islamist terrorism, conducted by individuals citing far-off inspiration, has blurred the distinctions between terrorist and disturbed loner. So have recent mass shooters who show signs of both mental illness and an attachment to vague ideological causes. As a result, terrorism is often in the eye of the beholder, determined as much by the attacker as by the community that is targeted, which must decide whether the attack represents a broader threat requiring a response. Each attack, then, quickly sets off a zero-sum debate over the related issues of gun control, immigration or religious tolerance — some of the most divisive issues in the country — litigated in a moment of national duress. "
1081,"UNITED NATIONS — The United States on Wednesday revived its objection to an annual United Nations General Assembly resolution deploring the American trade embargo on Cuba, a year after having abstained from the vote for the first time. The reversal, which left the United States nearly isolated on the issue at the United Nations, reflected the toughened attitude toward Cuba by President Trump, who has distanced his administration from the historic thaw in relations begun by his predecessor, Barack Obama. The vote on the resolution in the 193-member General Assembly was 191 to 2. The United States and Israel, which often acts in concert with its American ally, were the lone dissenters. The State Department had signaled on Tuesday that the United States intended to vote against the resolution, which calls for a repeal of the embargo imposed in 1962 after the break in relations with Cuba. “The United States does not fear isolation in this chamber or anywhere else,” Mr. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, said in a statement to fellow diplomats before the vote. In remarks that evoked the Cold War-era language aimed at the Castro government, Ms. Haley said the United States opposed the resolution to demonstrate “continued solidarity with the Cuban people and in the hope that they will one day be free to choose their own destiny.” Under Mr. Obama, the United States restored diplomatic relations with Cuba, easing five decades of enmity with the island nation of 11 million. But the trade embargo, which can be rescinded only by Congress, has remained in force. The annual vote on the resolution condemning the embargo has become something of a theatrical ritual at the United Nations and a venue for critics of American policy to vent their anger. Cuba’s foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, who also spoke before the vote, denounced the United States and Ms. Haley for what he described as her disrespectful remarks, and said the Trump administration lacked “the slightest moral authority to criticize Cuba.” The atmosphere was in sharp contrast to the vote in 2016, when Mr. Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, abstained, breaking with precedent and receiving sustained applause. Ms. Power said the abstention did not mean the United States condoned the political and economic restrictions in Cuba. But the abstention reflected the Obama White House’s view that decades of American efforts to ostracize Cuba had not worked. The General Assembly vote came against the backdrop of other tensions between the Trump administration and Cuba, tied partly to mysterious illnesses that have afflicted American diplomats in Havana. Last month, Mr. Trump blamed Cuba for the illnesses, which led to the abrupt withdrawal of American Embassy personnel. He also expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington. Cuban officials have denied responsibility for the illnesses and suggested that the Trump administration had concocted an excuse to downgrade ties. "
1082,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The man who sped a rental truck down a riverfront bike path in New York on Tuesday had been planning the attack for a year and “appears to have followed almost to a T the instructions that ISIS has put out,” a city police official said. A second man was being sought. Witnesses described the rampage as gruesome, grisly and surreal. The suspect was identified as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old native of Uzbekistan, which is considered a militant breeding ground. He was living legally in the U.S., but some close to him saw signs of trouble. President Trump said that he would consider sending Mr. Saipov to the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to cancel the immigration program that granted him entry. _____ "
1083,"Robert Mercer, a billionaire investor and top financial backer of conservative causes, is stepping down as co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, as the giant hedge fund faces a backlash from some clients who resent Mr. Mercer’s embrace of polarizing political figures. Discomfort with Mr. Mercer’s political activism — including protests aimed at university endowments, foundations and pension funds with money invested in Renaissance — has showed signs of taking a small but growing toll. The retirement fund for Baltimore’s police and firefighters, for example, last week asked that all of the $33 million it had invested in Renaissance be refunded, said David A. Randall, the retirement fund’s deputy executive director. The Baltimore fund had been contacted by a local reporter about whether the pension was bothered by Mr. Mercer’s political activities. Seeking to avoid bad publicity, the pension’s directors convened an emergency conference call and decided to pull their money. That $33 million withdrawal was a rounding error for Renaissance, which has more than $50 billion in assets. But it signaled a growing unease, inside and outside the firm, about Mr. Mercer’s backing of Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser. Renaissance’s founder, James Simons, is a prominent Democratic booster who supported Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. In letters to investors and to Renaissance staff on Thursday morning, Mr. Mercer said he would step down as co-chief executive and as a board member on Jan. 1. He said he would remain involved with the research arm of Renaissance, which uses complex mathematical equations to create trading strategies. Mr. Mercer, 71, sought in his letter to employees to distance himself from Mr. Bannon, who has gone back to running Breitbart News, the divisive media outlet and hub for nationalist and far-right activism. He said he was selling his investment in Breitbart to his daughters, who also are active in conservative politics. "

1085,"WASHINGTON — President Trump nominated Jerome H. Powell to chair the Federal Reserve on Thursday, bypassing Janet L. Yellen for a second term but turning to a replacement who is expected to stay the course on monetary policy if the economy continues its steady growth. “He’s strong, he’s committed, he’s smart,” Mr. Trump said in the White House Rose Garden, where he introduced Mr. Powell as his choice. Using Mr. Powell’s nickname, the president said, “I am confident that with Jay as a wise steward of the Federal Reserve, it will have the leadership it needs in the years to come.” Less certain is where Mr. Powell would lead the Fed if the economy falters. Mr. Powell, a member of the Fed’s board of governors since 2012, has consistently voted with Ms. Yellen to slowly raise interest rates and sell off assets that the Fed bought up in the wake of the severe recession of 2008 and 2009. Colleagues consider him a centrist and pragmatist. But he lacks the deep background in economics of some of his predecessors, and he has expressed skepticism in the past about the unconventional measures that the Fed took after the recession. Mr. Powell could also depart from the Fed’s current trajectory when it comes to regulating banks and other financial institutions — rules Mr. Trump has said should be loosened. The nominee offered little hint of his thinking during brief remarks in the Rose Garden. He said the nation’s economy has made “substantial progress toward full recovery” since the financial crisis and that banks are in far better shape. “I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks,” he said. "
1086,"WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers unveiled a sweeping rewrite of the tax code on Thursday, outlining a $1.5 trillion plan that will deliver a significant tax cut for corporations and more modest savings for middle-class families while tilting the United States closer, but not entirely, toward the kind of tax system long championed by businesses. The House plan, released after weeks of internal debate, conflict and delay, immediately ignited a legislative and lobbying fight as business groups, special interests and Democrats began tearing into the text ahead of a Republican sprint to get the legislation passed and to President Trump’s desk by Christmas. Lawmakers appeared unfazed by the blowback and scheduled the first official “markup” of the bill for Monday. “With this plan, we are making pro-growth reforms, so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. The bill is heavily weighted toward business, which would receive about $1 trillion in net cuts, or two-thirds of the total, according to calculations by the Joint Committee on Taxation. At its center is a proposal to permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent — a change that is estimated to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over the next decade alone. For individuals, the plan establishes three tax brackets — 12, 25 and 35 percent — instead of the seven that exist now and maintains a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires. The bill would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which is expected to hit 4.5 million families in 2017, and would roughly double the standard deduction for middle-class families. It would not, as many had feared, make any changes to the pretax treatment of 401(k) plans. Americans will still be able to make “both traditional, pretax contributions and ‘Roth’ contributions in the way that works best for them,” Republican lawmakers said in their talking points. "
1087,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. First, there is a simple reason that congressional Republicans have had so much trouble coming up with a tax bill: Their top priorities are cutting taxes for the wealthy and for corporations — and neither idea is popular. CBS News released a new poll yesterday, consistent with other recent polls, that showed a majority of Americans wants taxes on the rich and on big companies to rise. Yet congressional leaders are trying to write a bill that cuts those taxes enormously. So they’ve got a political problem, especially because they also plan to raise some taxes on the middle class and poor to hold down the bill’s price tag. Nonetheless, top Republicans have vowed to release a bill today. Once they do, look for them and President Trump to start selling it, less than honestly, as a middle-class tax cut. In truth, it is built around deeply cutting corporate taxes and repealing the estate tax. Bring on the robots. Human beings generally like to be in control or to hand over control to a trained professional, as I wrote last week in a column about driverless cars. We often prefer human control to computer control even when human control leads to worse outcomes. The past week has brought an especially stark example: the World Series. If you’re not a sports fan, please stick with me for a moment anyway. As Richard Thaler, the latest Nobel laureate in economics, likes to say, sports offers an unusually good window on human behavior, because it lets us watch decisions and outcomes as they happen. "

(And congrats to the Houston Astros for finally winning the World Series.)

Today, we’re supposed to finally see House Republicans’ vision of what a tax code change would look like (even if it is unlikely to bear the name President Trump is said to prefer, the “Cut Cut Cut Act”). The bill will include a permanent cut of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and a phased-in repeal of the estate tax, according to Axios. But the question of how the bill would be financed remains unanswered. “Some industry groups familiar with the negotiations said the remaining shortfall was in the hundreds of billions of dollars,” according to The NYT. Among the groups that are expected to pay more, according to Politico: private colleges, charities, companies that provide meals to employees and insurers. "
1089,"Spoiler alerts would be superfluous in a review of “11/8/16”: You already know the ending, and you’ve lived through the events. Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night. The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere. We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect. When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic. Many of these voters’ decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities. Some of their outlooks are naïve, others inspiring. Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated “11/4/08,” an examination of that Election Day. The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen. Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from “11/8/16.” But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled. Judging by most people here, that won’t be soon. "
1090,"OTTAWA — Why is President Trump picking on Canada? Canada has long been the United States’ best customer, buying more American-made goods and services than any other country — more than China, Japan or Britain. American trade with Canada totaled $627.8 billion in 2016; the United States had a $12.5 billion trade surplus. But trade relations have nose-dived since Mr. Trump took office. The president is throwing red meat to his base — much of which feels left behind by the modern economy — by attacking Canada and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada is an easy target. In the spring, the Trump administration imposed tariffs costing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars on Canadian softwood-lumber imports, escalating a decades-long dispute between American and Canadian lumber companies. This fall, following a complaint by Boeing, the Commerce Department announced it would recommend a 300 percent punitive tariff on Canadian-made Bombardier CSeries passenger aircraft, even though Boeing makes no equivalent product and receives indirect subsidies from the United States government. Mr. Trump also prompted renegotiations of Nafta, which he criticized relentlessly during his campaign as “the worst trade deal ever signed.” Started in August and scheduled to run until March, the Nafta talks have been shocking to many Canadians as the United States has issued a series of unreasonable demands that no Canadian or Mexican government could accept. The Trump administration is reportedly asking that Nafta be renegotiated every five years, which would create a state of perpetual uncertainty for business and deter investment. Washington also wants to eliminate Nafta’s binational dispute-settlement panels, a red line for Canada because Canadian businesses would have to rely on United States courts, which they don’t necessarily trust. Further, Washington is apparently insisting on “rules of origin” that would require Canadian and Mexican vehicles to contain no less than 50 percent American parts and services for duty-free entry into the United States, an onerous demand benefiting American producers. Washington is also asking that such vehicles contain at least 85 percent of parts and services from the three Nafta countries. The existing 62.5 percent has allowed for the use of cheaper supplies outside the trading group. "

1092,"HANOI, Vietnam — A Vietnamese businessman named Trinh Xuan Thanh disappeared off the streets of Berlin in July, one day before he had an appointment with German officials to seek political asylum. Germany blamed his country’s government, saying Mr. Thanh had been abducted by agents linked to Vietnam and demanding an apology for an episode it called “wholly unacceptable.” None came, at least in public. And today, Mr. Thanh’s continued detention is complicating the prospects of a smooth completion to a long-awaited free-trade deal between Vietnam and the European Union. Vietnamese business leaders and experts believe the two sides will reach a face-saving deal over Mr. Thanh, who is accused by Vietnamese officials of enriching himself while running a state construction firm. But the episode illustrates Vietnam’s quandary. It’s a rising Southeast Asian power under growing pressure to seek new alliances as China’s rise and America’s shifting politics reshape the global trade order. But Vietnam’s secretive, authoritarian government, and its checkered history with human rights and worker protections, can make striking those alliances tricky. Vietnam could lose more than a beneficial free-trade agreement if it does not improve ties with Germany, said Doan Xuan Loc, a research fellow at the Global Policy Institute in London who studies the European Union’s relations with Southeast Asian countries.

1093,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Sayfullo Saipov, 29, started planning a year ago for the attack that killed eight and injured 12 others, choosing to carry it out on Halloween because more people would be on the streets, federal prosecutors said. Mr. Saipov, who came to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010, led a rootless life that eventually turned to radical Islam. “He did not learn religion properly,” one imam said. Although the charges Mr. Saipov faces describe him as a student of Islamic State propaganda, the militant group has not claimed responsibility for the rampage. Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS for The Times, explains why. • Our video shows how quickly Tuesday's attack unfolded, and a map traces the truck’s path. • President Trump declared late Wednesday that the suspect in the New York attack should be executed. The comment could hurt the prosecution of Sayfullo Saipov, as it can be used by defense lawyers to argue that their client cannot get a fair trial. "
1094,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Seth Meyers was amused to find out that President Trump is hoping to title the new tax plan “The Cut Cut Cut Act.” House Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly has been working to persuade the president to change his mind. In the wake of this week’s terrorist attack in New York City, the president called for the termination of the so-called diversity visa lottery. Trevor Noah criticized conservative commentators and politicians who, he said, are quick to push their political agenda after an attack by a Muslim man, but who insist that liberals shouldn’t “politicize” mass shootings by white gunmen in service of gun control. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Wednesday that he was going to take half of his daughter’s Halloween candy to teach her about socialism. That inspired some ridicule from Stephen Colbert — and then a complex lesson in socialism, derived from Halloween candy names. "
1095,"MANASSAS, Va. — The voting for Virginia governor on Tuesday, traditionally a referendum on the party in the White House one year into a new administration, is the big political show of 2017. But the real weather vane for the country may be many rungs down the ballot in obscure races for the House of Delegates. Amid the turbulence of the Trump presidency, and under a shadow of indictments of former Trump campaign officials, voters heading to the polls in Virginia’s 100 House races represent the purest test of grass-roots anger at the president, election analysts said. That is because the candidates are little known to voters, largely absent from TV ads, and the races approximate a generic partisan ballot. If the past is a guide, they may also prefigure nationwide congressional voting in 2018. “These House of Delegate districts are mini versions of congressional districts around the country,” said Quentin Kidd, the director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. “I would expect Democrats to pick up four to six seats,” said Mr. Kidd, echoing other nonpartisan analysts. “If it went to 10, I’d say it sends a loud message across the country about the energy within the grass-roots Democratic base and the lack of energy in the Trump base.” The 40 members of the upper chamber, the State Senate, are not on the ballot. "
1096,"When the discussion warms up in Andrea Cote-Botero’s graduate seminar, English and Spanish flow freely, just as they do amid the afternoon foot traffic across the nearby Ciudad Juárez border. In the country’s only bilingual M.F.A. creative writing program, at the University of Texas at El Paso, students on this day are comparing how F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gabriel García Márquez depict West Egg and Macondo, the respective settings of their classic novels. Many of the students around the table comment in Spanish, sometimes switching languages to highlight a point for the native English speakers. Ms. Cote-Botero hangs back, periodically interjecting in either language. A student from Mexico City consults another from Las Vegas on a passage in Fitzgerald’s “Great Gatsby,” occasionally glancing at Google Translate on a laptop. El Paso’s Masters of Fine Arts program, started in 2006, draws mostly local residents from both sides of the border. A dozen of the 20 students are native Spanish speakers, and all speak at least some English and Spanish. They are motivated by the desire to write and read in another tongue, and to study with professors versed in other cultures. One student, a Texan of Palestinian descent, hopes the program will help her better express herself in Arabic. While El Paso’s program is a unique educational experience, creative writing programs across the country are developing Spanish-based curriculums — a growth reflecting the nation’s changing demographics: Spanish is the primary language of more than 40 million people in the United States, up from 32 million in 2005, according to Census Bureau estimates. Among the emerging programs, California State University in Los Angeles will offer its own bilingual M.F.A. next year. Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., will start a Spanish-language creative writing degree in 2018, similar to one already in place at New York University. Students in the Spanish-language program and its English counterpart at the University of Iowa are now being encouraged to take each other’s classes. And while recovering from Hurricane Harvey this semester, the University of Houston started a Ph.D. with a Spanish-language concentration that emphasizes literary scholarship as much as writing (students must include a theoretical analysis with their creative writing dissertation). "
1097,"In discussing the Manhattan truck attack with his cabinet on Wednesday, President Trump denounced the American criminal justice system as “a laughingstock” and “a joke” that is too weak to deter terrorism and too slow to mete out punishment. Experts, however, said the United States is tougher on terrorism than most other nations, and they called Mr. Trump’s claim that extremists who launch attacks on American soil “go through court for years” an exaggeration. But the president barreled ahead in a Twitter post minutes before midnight Wednesday, already assuming the guilt of the suspect in the Manhattan attack, Sayfullo Saipov, and advocating his execution. Earlier in the day, as he sat across the table from Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said he would “certainly consider” transferring Mr. Saipov to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to face a harsher trial than going through civilian courts. “We also have to come up with punishment that’s far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now. They’ll go through court for years,” Mr. Trump said. “We need quick justice, and we need strong justice, much quicker and much stronger than we have right now. Because what we have right now is a joke and it’s a laughingstock. And no wonder so much of this stuff takes place.” "
1098,"Just about every other person you might meet in New York City has come from somewhere else. On the Lower Manhattan street where the truck attack ended Tuesday afternoon, 5,400 students born in other countries attend the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and 600 go to Stuyvesant High School. They are from more than 100 countries. Also there, of course, were people born and raised in the city. One of those natives is a woman who had been a high school sophomore in Stuyvesant on 9/11, fleeing with her classmates from chemistry class as people fell from the burning towers down the block. She was in the school on Tuesday, this time as a teacher, gazing through another window at yet more people felled by fanaticism, comforting students who come from any number of countries. For those who call the city home, there is practically no such person as a foreigner. Even with that sprawl of humanity, New York can be lived as a small town, familiar and compact. Take, for instance, the bicycle path used as a death chute. It runs nearly the full length of Manhattan Island, but is just about 13 miles long. Still, it is said to be the busiest such path in the United States. With so many of us from somewhere else, a group of old friends from Argentina and a family from Belgium were bound to be on it Tuesday, in the autumn sunshine, riding alongside the Hudson River as it flowed to the ocean. “That path is the best thing to happen to New York City in the last 50 years,” said Adrian Benepe, a native of the city. “It’s possibly New York’s happiest place.” "
1099,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday backed off his threat to send the suspect in this week’s New York terrorist attack to the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but once again called for the man to be executed, a public intervention that could come back to haunt prosecutors in any future trial. In response to questions from reporters, Mr. Trump on Wednesday had said he would be open to transferring Sayfullo Saipov, the immigrant from Uzbekistan charged with plowing a pickup truck into passers-by in Manhattan and killing eight people, from the civilian justice system to the military system at Guantánamo. But after his offhand remark, aides sought to walk back the idea, saying it was merely notional. And the president was evidently briefed or saw something on television afterward about how the civilian courts have been more effective at convicting terrorism suspects than the troubled military tribunal system installed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The argument that Mr. Saipov should be tried in the same place where the terrorist attack that killed eight was committed mirrored the contention that President Barack Obama’s administration made when it sought to put Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, on trial in a civilian court in New York. But an uproar among city officials and business leaders at the time forced Mr. Obama’s Justice Department to abandon the plan and keep Mr. Mohammed at Guantánamo. "
1100,"Almost immediately after the Manhattan terrorist attack on Tuesday, President Trump faulted the “diversity lottery” visa program under which the Uzbek immigrant suspected in the attack entered this country, and laid the blame for the program’s existence on Senator Charles Schumer and other Democrats. As is often the case, he is wrong on his facts — here, about political responsibility for the program, which has been supported by both parties for over 25 years (though Mr. Schumer has backed getting rid of it). But Mr. Trump is right that these visas are bad policy and that the program should be canceled. Better still, they should be used for other, wiser purposes. First, the facts. Of the roughly one million permanent resident visas — commonly known as green cards — issued each year, 50,000 are awarded through a lottery process with few preconditions other than that applicants come from countries with little immigration to the United States during the previous five years. Congress made this program permanent in 1990 after several years of experimentation. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, both Democrats, invoked a “diversity” rationale in noting that the program would help the many Irish in the United States who had overstayed their temporary visas. Despite the numerous people of Irish background already in the country from earlier waves of migration, Ireland was an eligible country under the program because, at the time, its economy was doing well and few people were emigrating. So much for actual diversity. Today, lottery winners with little education, job skills, English fluency and work experience can hit the jackpot and promptly come (or stay) here permanently, while millions of American citizens and legal residents must wait years for their family members to be allowed to join them, dividing families and motivating illegal immigration. (Even citizens must now wait for sometimes 20 years for their unmarried children to get a visa.) The same challenge faces would-be immigrants who have skills needed here but can’t qualify for an employer-sponsored visa. Even the State Department, which runs the lottery program, acknowledges that it is rife with fraud. "
1101,"It would be hard to find a better example of the “corrupt Washington establishment” that President Trump calls “the swamp” than Ed Gillespie. The Republican nominee in Virginia’s gubernatorial election, Gillespie is an insider’s insider, a founder of Quinn Gillespie and Associates, one of the most successful lobbying firms in Washington. He has been moving in and out of government service for 35 years. Gillespie is not, of course, presenting himself to Virginians as a swamp creature. Instead, with the election just five days away, Gillespie is showing two different faces to voters. In the first of these, he appears to be the politician that he is at heart: a traditional, Main Street, “big tent” Republican — a consistent proponent of racial reconciliation and a supporter, as recently as 2013, of granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants. Gillespie’s other face, however, shows him as a hard-line campaigner in the Trump mold, warning that Democrats will coddle immigrant gangs and restore voting and Second Amendment rights to sex offenders. In 2002, his firm, Quinn Gillespie, boasted on its website that Notably, Gillespie’s campaign bio does not use the word “lobby.” During the early 2000s, Gillespie served on the de facto executive committee of the K Street Project, a major initiative designed to force Washington lobbying firms to hire Republican staffers, to donate to Republicans, and to work hand in glove with the Republican House and Senate leadership in order to win passage of highly partisan legislation. When it comes to money and politics, Gillespie is a player at the highest level. Together with Karl Rove, Gillespie capitalized on the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision to form the second-largest super PAC of 2012, American Crossroads, and the largest “dark money” 501(c)4 organization, Crossroads GPS. "
1102,"MOSCOW — In December 2011, demonstrators took to the streets of Moscow to protest President Vladimir Putin and his corrupt parliamentary election. At one of these rallies, a crowd listened to several speakers — activists, writers, prominent government critics — castigate the Putin government for its authoritarianism. Then Ksenia Sobchak, a socialite and TV personality, took to the podium. The crowd whistled in disapproval. But Ms. Sobchak, who was known for appearing in films like “The Blonde in Chocolate” (which bestowed her a nickname) and “Thieves and Prostitutes,” persisted. “I am Ksenia Sobchak, and I have something to lose,” I remember her saying, as she insisted on being heard. She said that she did not want revolution, but she demanded political changes — and this position coincided with the opinion of the majority of the protesters. What was Ms. Sobchak doing at this rally, talking about subjects that had little to do with her best-selling book “How to Marry a Millionaire” or the reality TV show she hosted, “House-2”? She was there because I was one of the organizers of the protest and I had invited her. We needed celebrities who would appeal to people who mistrusted politicians, and I felt that Ms. Sobchak, who had a strong following among teenagers thanks to “House-2,” would attract her fans to the protest. I put considerable effort into recruiting her. At the time, I didn’t know that for her this protest would be more than a passing episode. It would start her on a completely new path. That path reached a major turn on Oct. 18, when Ms. Sobchak declared her intention to run for president against Mr. Putin in the election next March. She has committed herself to the opposition now. Sort of. "
1103,"Donald Trump is a new kind of old-school American man. In some ways, he’s a throwback to days when authority and power were exclusively white and male by definition, when displays of masculine entitlement were overt and unapologetic. But he’s also a thoroughly modern man-child, the kind of overgrown adolescent you expect to find on internet forums dedicated to video games or anti-feminism: a tweeter of juvenile threats, a crass name-caller, an id unrestrained. Trump-style masculinity, in other words, is less John Wayne and more Tucker Max — and a revealing insight into American male anxiety. American manhood is reshaping itself in two opposing directions, and both archetypes are ones we’ve never seen before. If Barack Obama embodied the new ideal of the progressive man — a hands-on dad and a self-identified feminist married to a high-achieving woman who was once his boss, who is also well mannered and protective of his family — then Mr. Trump is his antithesis, an old-school chauvinist embracing a new code of adolescent anarchy. He is a paradigm of feckless male entitlement, embracing male power while abnegating the traditional masculine requirements of chivalry, courtesy and responsibility. Almost a year ago, he won the presidential election by presenting this version of aggrieved manhood in opposition to Hillary Clinton’s hand-raising Hermione Granger feminism. White American men loved it. This happened while, in homes across America, the Obama model of manhood had increasingly taken root. Yes, powerful men do abuse their positions to extract sexual services from women or to remind us that no matter how mighty and successful we are, we can be reduced to simple objects of predatory male sexuality. The past few weeks have been a stark reminder that these abuses don’t fall along partisan lines, with the Harvey Weinstein revelations and stories across industries and continents still unfolding in their wake. Most men also continue to fall short when it comes to household responsibilities, and men still tend to out-earn women. But, in much of America, men’s and women’s lives look more similar than they ever have: Women do more work for pay, and men do more care work than they previously have done. Feminists have insisted that women and men alike can and should embody the characteristics we positively associate with both masculinity (power, respect, dependability, providing) and femininity (caregiving, devotion, compassion), and many of our lives have crept closer to this ideal. To Mr. Trump and many of his increasingly nihilistic supporters, this is a threat to their fantasy of masculinity. We could have guessed that men who believe in gender equality would do more housework than men with conservative views, and it is not news that white conservative men overwhelmingly vote Republican. What is different from generations before is that many of the men making up Mr. Trump’s base are less attached to the institutions that offered respect and required responsibility — unions, church, marriage, school, even independent living. In the face of women’s success, many of them have fallen behind on adult obligations and fallen back on misogyny. "
1104,"Silicon Valley, once a force for good, is now a threat to democracy. At least that’s the impression you’d get from the flood of news and commentary about social media’s role in the presidential election. This week, representatives of Twitter and Facebook, along with Google, testified before Congress about how Russia exploited their platforms to interfere with the election. But while Russian meddling is a serious problem, the current sentiment toward Silicon Valley borders on scapegoating. Facebook and Twitter are just a mirror, reflecting us. They reveal a society that is painfully divided, gullible to misinformation, dazzled by sensationalism, and willing to spread lies and promote hate. We don’t like this reflection, so we blame the mirror, painting ourselves as victims of Silicon Valley manipulation. At the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, squarely blamed the tech companies for Russian interference. “You bear this responsibility,” she said. “You’ve created these platforms.” But we, the users, are not innocent. Some of the Russian propaganda on social media was cribbed from content that was posted by Americans. Yes, social media helps propaganda spread farther and faster. But Facebook and Twitter didn’t force users to share misinformation. Are Americans so easily duped? Or more alarming, did they simply believe what they wanted to believe? In the last few months of the presidential campaign, a BuzzFeed News analysis concluded, fake news stories got more Facebook engagement than the most widely read stories from major news outlets. The Russians didn’t single-handedly create this situation; they just jumped into the fray. The real crisis is Americans’ inability or unwillingness to sift fact from fiction, a problem that is worsened by the mainstream media’s loss of credibility when it comes to setting the record straight. Some blame social media for Donald Trump’s rise to power. The election “shook Silicon Valley’s belief that the internet always fosters societal good,” Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed essay, “Trump used the tools of technology to win.” Twitter remains the perfect vehicle for Mr. Trump’s nuance-free missives. But it’s not Twitter that is making Mr. Trump go viral; it’s Twitter’s users. They include all the citizens and journalists who follow, retweet and reply to Mr. Trump — even when we do so out of shock or outrage or because his statements have news value. If it weren’t for all of us, the president would be shouting into a void. "
1105,"Conservative lawmakers have long touted the idea that cutting corporate tax rates spurs economic growth. Proponents point to many mechanisms; a central one is that lower tax rates attract investment that might otherwise go to other countries. President Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, recently highlighted this goal when discussing the Republican plan to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, below the world average of 22.5 percent. This idea seems like a simple way to attract investment: If the tax rate is lower in the United States, corporations might prefer to invest here. But it turns out the situation is not so straightforward. By using game theory — the science of strategic interaction — we can see that America may be contributing to a problem that ultimately harms us economically. This is because the United States is not the only country seeking to attract investment by lowering corporate taxes. This rivalry among countries is known as tax competition. Tax competition occurs when nations compete to attract investment by imposing ever lower tax burdens on corporations. Mechanisms such as lower corporate income taxes, favorable tax-base definitions and tax holidays encourage multinational corporations to repatriate assets held overseas. This competition is an example of what game theorists call a collective action problem. These problems no doubt are familiar to many of us: In joint projects at work, every member of a team stands to benefit if the project is completed on time. But if individuals think they can avoid their share of the work, they will, leaving others to pick up the slack. Without some mechanism like good management to enforce shared norms, everyone on the team will shirk their responsibilities and the team will fail. This is the core feature of a collective action problem: All members of a group would do better if everyone chose to work together, but each member has an incentive to abandon the cooperative approach and pursue its own interests. These problems occur throughout our economic and political lives, in situations as diverse as arms control treaties and the management of fisheries. Absent some kind of extra incentive to cooperate, collective action problems typically lead to outcomes that are worse for all. Globally, corporate taxation is ripe for collective action problems. If nations didn’t have to compete with one another, they would all benefit from imposing higher corporate taxes. But they do have to compete, so each individual country has a self-interested reason to lower its corporate tax rate, undercutting other countries to attract investment. Even if all other states agree to coordinate (or “harmonize”) to maintain higher rates of taxation, individual countries will still face an incentive to lower their tax rates to attract greater investment. "
1106,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s leader, visited Rakhine State for the first time since the country’s military unleashed a campaign of violence against Rohingya Muslims two months ago, driving hundreds of thousands into Bangladesh. She showed little sign of acknowledging ethnic cleansing, as critics have urged. “I hope everything will go fine as local villagers handle the rebuilding process,” she said in one village. “We all have to try our best to live peacefully.” _____ • Conditions are deteriorating for more than 600 men barricaded inside Australia’s now-closed Manus Island detention center in Papua New Guinea. The U.N. warned of an “unfolding humanitarian emergency.” Here’s an explainer on the crisis. "
1107,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will promote coal, natural gas and nuclear energy as an answer to climate change at a presentation during a United Nations global warming conference this month, the White House confirmed Thursday. The program is billed as a discussion of how American energy resources, particularly fossil fuels, can help poor countries meet electricity needs and drive down greenhouse gas emissions. Entitled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” it will feature speakers from Peabody Energy, a coal company; NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter. “As the world seeks to reduce emissions while promoting economic prosperity, fossil fuels will continue to play a central role in the energy mix,” a preview of the Nov. 13 presentation says. The program is likely to provoke strong reactions at the United Nations conference gathering in Bonn, Germany, beginning on Monday for two weeks of negotiations on ways to keep rising global temperatures from reaching catastrophic levels. Most climate experts contend that the world must shift from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives to meet emissions targets. Nuclear power, which does not produce earth-warming emissions, is viewed with skepticism by many environmental activists, who say its dangers outweigh its benefits. No major funding announcements are expected during the event. Delegates from 195 countries will gather in Bonn from Nov. 6-17 to work on a “rule book” for implementation of the Paris agreement. "
1108,"Unless the pollsters have all taken leave of their senses, Bill de Blasio is about to win re-election as New York’s mayor, probably by a wide margin. So it is not too soon for New Yorkers to focus on what they expect for his second term, the last one he is allowed under the city’s term-limits law. While they’re at it, they may want to think hard about their own commitment to civic life. Democracy functions only if its citizens make it work. They do that by showing up on Election Day. But far too many of the city’s nearly 4.5 million registered voters are AWOL. Only 26 percent of them went to the polls in the 2013 mayoral election, and that turnout was spectacular compared with the dismal 14 percent in this year’s primaries. Even allowing that this campaign has hardly been rousing, the apathy is troublesome. We supported Mr. de Blasio for the Democratic nomination in the September primaries because the city in the main has been well run on his watch. Nothing on that score has changed. Obviously, serious problems remain, with unrelenting homelessness and tottering mass transit high on the list. But, over all, Mr. de Blasio has been an able mayor who can point to an impressively low crime rate, sound municipal finances and progress on revivifying schools and on creating reasonably priced apartments. And so we give him our endorsement in the general election on Tuesday. His principal opponent is Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican who represents slices of Staten Island and Brooklyn. An unfamiliar figure in wide swaths of the five boroughs, Ms. Malliotakis has run a spirited campaign and deserves credit for it. But her ambition seems to outpace her vision for the city. And her resolute conservatism puts her out of sync with most New Yorkers — and us — on pivotal matters like raising the state minimum wage (she opposed it), legalizing same-sex marriage (she voted no on that, too, though she later expressed regret) and immigration policy (she is tepid on the “sanctuary city” concept). Catching up to the mayor is not Ms. Malliotakis’s only Election Day concern. Bo Dietl, the showboating former police detective who’s running as an independent, could take center-right votes from her. Sal Albanese, a respected former city councilman who has the Reform Party line, lives on Staten Island and might cut into her support there. "
1109,"Stocks on Wall Street closed mainly unchanged on Thursday as the financial markets digested new details of an ambitious Republican plan to cut taxes. Major stock indexes initially plunged as lawmakers circulated a set of talking points covering the House’s highly anticipated $1.51 trillion package on Thursday morning. Although the markets recovered by midday, investors reacted to proposed caps on the popular mortgage-interest deduction by sending shares in home-building companies lower. Lennar ended the day 3.3 percent lower, and PulteGroup lost 1.1 percent. The tax plan would crunch the number of individual tax brackets to three from seven and slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Homeowners are now able to deduct mortgage interest on loans up to $1 million. Under the proposal announced on Thursday, that cap would drop to $500,000 for new mortgages. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which fell as much as 0.5 percent when the tax details were first released, ended the session unchanged, at 2,579.85. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.4 percent, at 23,516.26. The Nasdaq composite was flat, at 6,714.94. Under their tax plan, House Republicans also want to end a program that offers buyers of electric-powered vehicles a tax credit of up to $7,500. Shares of the electric-car maker Tesla, which tumbled in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company announced a larger loss than expected for the third quarter, fell further after details of the tax plan were released on Thursday. Tesla shares closed 6.8 percent lower. Shares of General Motors, which recently announced plans for 20 new all-electric models by 2023, dipped 1.2 percent. But shares of Ford, which has said it plans to add 13 electric vehicles in the near future, increased 0.6 percent. “A lot of what’s in this plan are bargaining positions; we have to see how the final bill morphs as time goes forward,” Steven Blitz, chief United States economist with TS Lombard, said. “There’s a lot of horse trading to come, so an overreaction doesn’t make a lot of sense.” The prospect of business-friendly tax cuts have helped pushed stocks up in recent weeks as the tax bill took shape amid delays and intense debate. Republicans hope to deliver a finished plan to President Trump by Christmas, but will first have to contend with objections from Democrats and special interests. The 10-year Treasury yield was trading at 2.35 percent. Wall Street is also waiting for Mr. Trump to officially nominate Jerome H. Powell as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, an announcement that was scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Mr. Powell, a current Fed governor, would succeed Janet L. Yellen once her term ends in February. In other notable market developments, Newell Brands stock tumbled 27 percent after the company, which owns Rubbermaid, slashed its annual forecasts following a shaky third quarter, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the largest generic drugmaker in the world, lowered its financial outlook for the year on Thursday, sending shares down 20 percent.

1110,"To the Editor: Re “White House Chief’s Remarks on the Civil War Elicit an Angry Response” (news article, Nov. 1): I have taught American history for 27 years at a university, and I open every class with a standard lecture that focuses on the three kinds of history: what actually happened, what we are told happened and what we come to believe happened. This is important because we live in a world in which what people believe happened is all that matters, and trying to get to the facts sadly appears less relevant. John F. Kelly’s assertion that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War baffled me, and I found myself having to tell my students that it’s this kind of opinion-based knowledge that is reckless, and why we must strive for fact-based knowledge. The facts reveal that much of our early federal history was about political conflict and compromise. The Civil War came about not for lack of an ability to compromise, but rather precisely because of compromise, and those who grew tired of it. STEPHEN D. ENGLE

1112,"FORT BRAGG, N.C. — Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s day of reckoning is fast approaching. A military judge will soon decide his punishment for desertion and endangering the troops who searched for him after he walked off his base in Afghanistan in June 2009. Sergeant Bergdahl pleaded guilty to both charges, and prosecutors have asked the judge to sentence him to 14 years in prison, along with a punitive discharge and reduction in rank. Now that both sides have finished presenting evidence at the sergeant’s two-week sentencing hearing, here are the main takeaways. While he was running for office last year, Mr. Trump called Sergeant Bergdahl a traitor who should be executed, a view he appeared to endorse again on Oct. 16, saying: “I think people have heard my comments in the past.” But Mr. Trump’s apparent disgust and hatred for Sergeant Berdaghl — and his seeming inability to resist talking about him even after Army officials warned the administration, as documents suggest, that doing so could foul up the case — may now work to Sergeant Bergdahl’s advantage. After the president’s latest comments, the sergeant’s lawyers asked the judge to dismiss the case or limit his potential punishment, arguing that Mr. Trump’s statements had prejudiced the case because everyone in the military justice system ultimately reports to the president as commander in chief. The judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, denied that request. But he said he would consider the president’s comments as a mitigating factor when deciding on the sergeant’s sentence. That means Colonel Nance will weigh them along with other evidence presented by both sides at the sentencing hearing, though how much weight he assigns them is anyone’s guess. "
1113,"Last week the venerable Hudson Institute, a think tank founded in the early 1960s by the nuclear game theorist Herman Kahn, invited three speakers to discuss foreign policy. Leon Panetta and David Petraeus, both former C.I.A. directors, fit comfortably in the establishment mold in which Hudson has long operated. Not so the third speaker, Stephen K. Bannon. Donald Trump’s former chief strategist has proudly declared “war” on the Republican Party establishment. And yet that very establishment had laid down the welcome mat to this self-described “Leninist.” The event offers a snapshot of the dilemma facing conservative think tanks in the era of Trump: How much should they engage not just with this administration, but with the increasingly powerful Bannon wing of the Republican Party? Think tanks are chiefly supposed to provide independent expertise to policymakers. But they also seek to be politically relevant. To be relevant, you need access. And, of course, they also must answer to well-heeled donors, like the Mercer family, whose political loyalties are sometimes vehemently pro-Trump. This reality leaves these institutions with an uncomfortable choice: fellow-travel with Mr. Trump or let the Trump train pass your station and risk diminishing influence in a Washington where he is boss. In the past two weeks, I spoke to more than a dozen employees and former employees of the most well-respected think tanks on the center-right: the Manhattan Institute, known for its expertise on local and state policies; the Hudson Institute, the home of foreign-policy heavyweights like David Satter and Walter Russell Mead; the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where researchers are largely focused on Iran, North Korea and terrorism; and the American Enterprise Institute, which defends classical liberalism and free markets. "
1114,"WASHINGTON — Democrats from the House Oversight Committee, stonewalled by the Trump administration and fuming at their Republican colleagues, sued the General Services Administration on Thursday to try to force the release of documents relating to its lease with the Trump International Hotel here. The suit, which has little legal precedent, is likely to be a key test of Democrats’ ability to force oversight of the Trump administration without control of committees or subpoena power in either chamber of Congress. They have accused Republicans who control both of neglecting their responsibility to hold the administration to account. A victory in court would grant the lawmakers immediate access to government documents related to the hotel’s operations and lease that they say would shed light on its finances, possible foreign payments to the hotel and the G.S.A.’s ruling that the hotel did not violate the terms of its lease when President Trump took office. A favorable ruling would also open a fruitful avenue for Oversight Committee Democrats to use on other issues. “The lawsuit is not just about a hotel in Washington, D.C.,” Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said at a news conference on Thursday. “This is about the president defying a federal statute and denying our ability as members of Congress to fulfill our constitutional duty to serve as a check on the executive branch.” Mr. Cummings was joined in the suit, filed in United States District Court here, by 16 other Democrats on the committee. A spokeswoman for the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, said he had no immediate comment. A spokeswoman for the G.S.A. said the agency did not comment on pending litigation. "
1115,"A day after President Trump threatened to send the suspect in the Manhattan truck attack to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday said the administration would “use all lawful tools at our disposal,” including the federal courts and military system, to prosecute terrorism suspects. He also touted the Justice Department’s recent terrorism prosecutions, remarks that may not have been notable if Mr. Trump had not, a day earlier, denounced the American criminal justice system as “a joke” and “a laughingstock.” Mr. Sessions’s remarks on Guantánamo Bay reiterated a long-held position in favor of continuing to detain terrorism suspects without trial there and to prosecute some before a military commission. He said earlier this year that he would advise Mr. Trump to send newly captured terrorism suspects to the wartime prison, which he called a “very fine place,” rather than to bring them to civilian court for prosecution by the Justice Department he runs. But his comments took on new urgency when Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he was open to transferring the Manhattan truck attack suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, from civilian courts into the military system set up for foreign terrorists. A short time later, just more than 24 hours after the attack, federal prosecutors filed charges accusing Mr. Saipov of being inspired by Islamic State propaganda videos to carry out the plot and of timing it to inflict maximum damage. By Thursday morning, the president backed off his threat to send Mr. Saipov to the military prison. He once again called for Mr. Saipov to be executed, a public intervention that could make it more difficult for prosecutors to secure a capital punishment in any future trial. “Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantánamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!” "
1116,"THE SEQUOIA DRESS from the New York-based independent fashion label Creatures of Comfort is not the kind of garment one might refer to as “sexy.” Dun-colored, ankle-lengthed, high-necked and voluminous-sleeved, this seemingly innocuous $450 number became an unlikely lightning rod this summer, when the writer and editor Doree Shafrir shared a screenshot of it on Twitter, writing: “Bless everyone who is pretty enough, skinny enough and rich enough to wear this dress.” This rapidly summoned a number of droll, liked-in-the-thousands responses from other women. “Adding this to my Amazon Amishlist,” one wrote; “It’s a party dress! A Donner party dress,” another tweeted; “The sister wives and I all decided to go with turd brown,” added a third. Considering our current moment’s heart-poundingly swift, frequently terrifying news cycle, the Sequoia affair hardly made for the most momentous or enduring story. And yet it touched on a puzzling phenomenon: the significant turn in fashion over the past couple of years toward almost aggressively non-provocative dressing, and the complicated feelings women have about it. To judge from Shafrir’s tweet — and those that came after it — many women would appear to be skeptical of the current vogue for conservative, covered-up fashions. Only those blessed with the privileges money and slim good looks bring, these women seemed to suggest, could get away with wearing a dress that evokes virginal drabness at best and cult-style patriarchal oppression at worst; a dress which, with its sacklike silhouette, looks like a cross between a 1880s homesteading smock and the so-called bankruptcy barrel archetypically worn by old-timey hobos. And still, the look persists, even thrives. This past spring, The New York Times’s chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, declared modest fashion a defining trend of the 2010s, with brands as varied as Céline, with its enveloping, cocoon-like garments, Erdem, with its long-sleeved, high-collared Victoriana dresses, and Vetements, with its almost comically outsize getups, all promoting the look. As Friedman argued, in a vulnerable, volatile time — perhaps one particularly so for women — figure-obscuring clothing serves as a kind of armor, as well as a retort to a reality-TV-inured culture apparently intent on exposing any private moment, any intimate body part, for public consumption. Once we’ve seen it all — from Emily Ratajkowski’s fabulous breasts to Kim Kardashian’s monumental butt — it now seems as if the most radical gesture could only involve donning a baggy jumpsuit or a generously cut midi-skirt. This is a look not seen only on the runways. It’s there in the television adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian but all-too-timely “The Handmaid’s Tale,” where the long red gowns and severe white bonnets worn by the show’s subjugated women serve as visual markers of oppression, while also managing to appear suddenly, disconcertingly fashion. (Indeed, the young American label Vaquera produced a special collection early this summer, inspired by the show’s costumes, which Katy Perry called “very retro pilgrim” in her MTV Video Music Awards opening monologue this August.) It’s in the recent movie “Ingrid Goes West,” where the height of contemporary California style is embodied by Instagram influencer Taylor Sloane (played by Elizabeth Olsen), with her figure-blurring linen shifts and long, rich-hippie skirts; it’s in many of Solange’s recent outfits (the Thom Browne puffer coat the singer wore to the 2017 Met gala, or the long-sleeved turtleneck and high-waisted pleated pants she performed in at Glastonbury this year); and it’s in the prairie-chic togs found in any collection from, say, Rachel Comey (the independent New York label whose patrons, as a fashion-forward friend of mine tweeted recently, could very easily be mistaken for worshipers emerging from a “cool church”). Modest fashion might come across as a humblebrag: You have to be a pretty stylish, pretty good-looking woman to claim ownership of such radical dowdiness. (The style seems especially popular among women in their 20s and 30s — trumping the received wisdom that one should flaunt one’s body before it is marked by the supposed scourges of childbearing or menopause.) It can also sometimes seem like an elitist project of sociocultural self-positioning: By embracing the covered-up look, you declare yourself part of a particular psychographic tribe, one whose members don’t just dress for other women, but for a particular subset of other women — those who get it, who are sophisticated enough to understand that opting out of conventional beauty standards makes for its own kind of conceptual, better-than-thou fashion. It also, however, has the feel of a real dare. Observing this version of feminist signaling, which conflates the rebel, haphazard spirit of a Bloomsbury Group-like smockishness with traces of early ’90s grunge and a dash of post-bellum Sunday best, we might begin to ask ourselves: What happens when women start dressing in ways that are less than conventionally flattering? Why are they doing it? And what does it look like when fashion choices that might have been linked to female oppression perform in the service of liberation? "
1117,"Perhaps not surprisingly, President Trump seemed to treat the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve — arguably the most important personnel decision he has faced — a bit like a season of “The Bachelor,” dangling tantalizing hints before handing the rose to Jerome H. Powell. In doing so, Mr. Trump, more surprisingly, picked by far the better suited of his two semipublic finalists. That’s because Mr. Powell, a current member of the Federal Reserve Board, resides firmly in the camp of supporters of the Fed’s policy of maintaining its low interest policy as long as inflation stays muted and wage increases remain stubbornly small. The other candidate — the economist John B. Taylor, the reported choice of Vice President Mike Pence and other hard-line conservatives — is openly hawkish, having warned for years that the central bank’s easy money policy was stoking future inflation. Most prominently, in November 2010, Mr. Taylor was among 24 signatories to an open letter to Ben Bernanke, then the chairman, attacking a signature aspect of the Fed’s efforts to stimulate a sluggish economy, its “quantitative easing” program of purchasing debt in the market to keep interest rates low. These purchases “risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed’s objective of promoting employment,” the group wrote. "
1118,"WASHINGTON — A former Trump campaign aide dropped out of the running on Thursday for a senior position at the Department of Agriculture three days after his name was tied to a former campaign foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. over his contacts with Russia. The campaign aide, Sam Clovis, told President Trump that he decided to withdraw from consideration to be the chief scientist at the Department of Agriculture, the White House said. “The political climate inside Washington has made it impossible for me to receive balanced and fair consideration for this position,” Mr. Clovis wrote in a letter on Wednesday to Mr. Trump. Mr. Clovis’s qualifications to be the chief scientist at the department have been questioned, as he is not a scientist himself. “The relentless assaults on you and your team seem to be a blood sport that only increases in intensity each day.” Mr. Clovis’s request to drop out of consideration is the latest blow to the Trump administration that for months has been dogged by the special counsel investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Clovis, an early campaign adviser, has met with the special counsel’s team. On Monday, it was disclosed that Mr. Clovis discussed the Trump campaign’s priorities for relations with Russia with the foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last month to lying to the F.B.I. about his communications with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to interviews and court papers. Mr. Clovis was among the Trump campaign officials who knew that Mr. Papadopoulos was developing contacts in Moscow and trying to to arrange a meeting for Mr. Trump in Russia. "
1119,"Jerome H. Powell will come to the chairman’s job at the Federal Reserve with a wide-ranging résumé. He has worked in investment banking, in law and in government as an under secretary in the Treasury Department. He would also be one of the wealthiest individuals to lead the Fed, thanks to his years in private equity. One thing he’s missing: He would be the first Fed chief in more than four decades who did not have an economics degree. Mr. Powell, 64, was born in Washington, the son of a lawyer, and studied politics at Princeton University. He earned a law degree from Georgetown University, where he was editor in chief of the Georgetown Law Journal. After working a few years as a lawyer, he embarked in 1984 on a career in investment banking, starting at Dillon, Read and Company in New York. A year later, he married Elissa Leonard, a filmmaker. They have three children. In 1990, during first President George Bush’s term, he moved back to Washington to become the Treasury Department’s under secretary for finance. The Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, had been chairman of Dillon Read. Mr. Powell was responsible for policy on financial institutions and the Treasury debt market. After Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Mr. Powell joined Bankers Trust, but decided to leave a couple of years later after several clients suffered large losses as a result of derivative deals they did with the bank. "
1120,"GREENWICH, Conn. — In a stately home set back on one of this town’s wandering roads lined with mansions and shaded by a canopy of trees, the women formed a circle around a dining room table and introduced themselves to their neighbors as political newcomers, asking for their vote. There was a stay-at-home mom, a media and technology consultant and a businesswoman whose career included manufacturing men’s swimsuits designed to prevent chafing, all describing their involvement in town politics as a relatively recent development. A retired public-school teacher said, simply, “I just can’t be a bystander anymore.” The women are part of a sudden surge in interest in seats on the council that handles town business, having collected the 25 signatures needed to join the ballot. The swell of candidates, most of whom are women, has created competition in a race where there is often none and stirred controversy in a process that has a reputation for being staid. A so-called Trump effect has drawn some of them in, with disappointment over the presidential election fueling a desire to become more civically engaged. For others, it has been issues closer to home that ignited their interest — public education and concern over town spending, among them. But the unusual infusion of political neophytes has set off a tempest, stoking fears of a bitter partisan debate on national issues infiltrating the business of running the town and provoking some incendiary reactions. One well-known blogger in town who describes himself as a “pot stirrer” published a widely shared post in which he labeled some of the newcomers as “angry women, all suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.” “It’s a very unusual thing,” Lucy B. Krasnor, a longtime member of the council, known as the Representative Town Meeting, said of the campaign. “But we’re living in very unusual times.” "
1121,"When it comes to dinner parties, the conversation is one thing that can’t be set up in advance. But that doesn’t mean you can’t be prepared. With the holiday season imminent, we asked Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download,” for some dos and don’ts on how to spark memorable conversation during your dinner party. These tips are part of the magazine’s latest food issue all about the art of the dinner party. Check it out for more inspiration and recipes to help you host your own dinner parties this season. Small talk gives guests a chance to get to know one another, and to take one another’s measure, before the conversation turns to weightier matters — e.g., sex, the lonely meaninglessness of existence and Trump’s latest tweet. It’s like stretching before a jog. Don’t leave some guests nodding their heads and pretending they know what’s going on. Often, clarification is required. If a guest is mumbling, restate a phrase for people who couldn’t hear what was said. If a guest makes an inside joke, go ahead and laugh — and then put it in context for everyone. The sad truth is, no one cares what you have to say; they care about what they have to say. Deep down, people want to feel they’ve been heard. They will if you let them talk. "
1122,"Republicans’ botched pitch for tax cuts could cost them dearly. Their revised plan, disclosed on Thursday, deals only partly with earlier criticism that it benefits the rich. And the chief lieutenants responsible for selling it to the public for the White House, Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, have fumbled their way through their own script. G.O.P. House leaders have, at least, ditched the idea of scrapping the top rate of tax of nearly 40 percent, for the highest earners. But they’re cutting to 25 percent the rate for so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships. Many wealthy people, including President Trump and some members of his cabinet, have made liberal use of these. And they’re doubling the estate tax exemption and then repealing the tax over the next six years. In September, Mr. Trump claimed this so-called death tax would “protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer.” Yet it affects only about 0.2 percent of the population — ultra-wealthy families, in other words. Its repeal would save Trump’s family and the offspring of rich cabinet members billions of dollars, Democrats argue. Comments made by Trump administration officials are not helping. Mr. Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, claimed in September that the typical American family earns $100,000 a year. He’s vastly overstating it: The median annual American household income in 2016 was about $59,000. The Pew Research Center tallies an annual middle-class income as low as $40,000, depending on where you live. Mr. Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, listed at least $250 million in assets in his financial disclosure. Mr. Mnuchin, another Goldman alumnus, has also garbled his tax message. After saying for months that the wealthy would not get a tax cut, he recently changed his tune. He told the website Politico that it was difficult to avoid giving a break to the rich because “the top 20 percent pay 95 percent of the taxes.” It’s actually more like the top 50 percent of earners. His own wealth presents a conflict of interest, too: He reported about $500 million in assets in financial disclosures. Such abysmal marketing is already falling flat with voters: Only 25 percent of Americans like the plan and just 14 percent believe they will get a tax cut, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll. If that translates into problems pushing the cuts through Congress, it will put the Trump administration’s goals of sustained 3 percent economic growth and rising wages in jeopardy. That would be a dismal failure going into an election year. "
1123,"WASHINGTON — The House Republican tax bill is a clear windfall for corporate America and a roll of the dice for the middle-class families that President Trump promised would be the centerpiece of his economic agenda. Early projections suggest the bill would cut taxes for an average middle-class family. But the typical cut could be relatively modest, compared with the benefits for businesses and high earners. More important, the myriad changes in the code would actually raise taxes on nearly 13 million tax filers who earn $100,000 a year or less, according to preliminary calculations using the open-source economic modeling software TaxBrain. Those changes also include limits on, or the elimination of, what might be called tax breaks for middle-class aspirers. The bill would no longer allow Americans to deduct interest on student loans they took out to attend college. It would limit mortgage interest deductions to $500,000 on newly purchased homes, a provision that would hit middle-class teachers or office workers looking to buy starter houses in high-priced, economically vibrant areas such as New York City and Silicon Valley. One of the bill’s biggest lifts to working families would vanish after five years — though Republicans would certainly push to extend it — and another would be diluted by the bill’s changes to how the tax code calculates inflation. It is difficult to see those provisions as the unambiguous gift to American workers — the “major, major tax cut,” in the words of Mr. Trump — that Republicans promised. Instead, the bill effectively asks those workers to put their faith in a sort of bank-shot theory of income growth, where corporate tax cuts turn into profits that are passed on to workers in the form of higher wages. If those benefits do not accrue, many workers could face higher taxes while companies keep their savings or pass them on to shareholders in the form of higher dividends. "
1124,"When I tell people that I was born in Uzbekistan, they usually say I am the first Uzbek-American they have ever met. Just as often, they admit they can’t even name a single Uzbek. I worry that the horrific terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday by Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek native, has changed that for the worse. President Trump placed blame for the attack on the State Department’s “diversity lottery” visa program, through which Mr. Saipov entered this country, and he called for its end. The lottery has few preconditions, but applicants must come from countries with little immigration to America. It would be a shame to eliminate it. The program has allowed my family and countless other immigrants to thrive. Moreover, such a craven move would mean America loses a chance to fight extremism across the world by defining its values on its own terms rather than letting its enemies do so. I was only 2 years old when my family started a new life in an Atlanta suburb. Our household was quintessentially American, reflecting a hodgepodge of cultures. Like many other boys, I loved nothing more than playing in Saturday afternoon baseball games at our local park and waking up early on Sundays for extra batting practice with my dad. But kids also belittled and taunted me, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks, because of my Muslim-sounding name. I kept this to myself, which nearly two-thirds of children who are bullied also do. I had always wanted to be a college baseball player and was thrilled when recruiters from Oberlin College in Ohio came knocking. I was a student-athlete there and achieved the most coveted prize among immigrants: an American college education. Through hard work and more than a little bit of luck, I was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship and I’m in my last year of graduate study at the University of Oxford. My parents laid the foundation for my success. They have dedicated their lives to public service, spending a vast majority of their careers, absent a few years when they were learning English, working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, they even traveled to Sierra Leone, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, to help slow the spread of the virus. "
1125,"Within hours after the American public found out that his most senior campaign official was under an indictment that described him as a secret agent of Russian interests, President Trump declared on Twitter: “There is NO COLLUSION!” A forceful statement if there ever was one. But what exactly was he denying so categorically? We have no idea. For one reason or another, “collusion” has become the term of choice for discussing what the Trump campaign may or may not have done with Russians. Those in the Trump camp use it regularly: “I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,” Jared Kushner told Congress this summer. “I did not collude with any foreign government,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “I deeply resent any allegation that I would collude with the oppressive Russian state,” the Republican strategist Roger Stone harrumphed. It isn’t just those in the Trump camp, though, who have settled on using this word. Among the first to refer to collusion was John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, who raised the specter on “Meet the Press”: “I would argue that there’s very, it’s very much unknown whether there was collusion.” In that same week, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said of Trump campaign connections to WikiLeaks, “So there is collusion there, clearly.” The term has been a touchstone ever since. Mr. Trump and his inner circle have benefited enormously from this coalescing around the word “collusion” — a term with a legalistic feel but with close to “no legal meaning whatsoever” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and now a defense lawyer who has written a dissection of every public statement that a Trump associate has made to congressional investigators. If we care about the law — and about holding public figures accountable for their false denials — the impassioned disavowals of collusion by members of the Trump circle mean nothing. Donald Trump Jr.’s utterances to Congress, for example, were “not denying that he committed a crime,” Mr. Mariotti said. “Whether his denial is broader or more narrow than that depends on what exactly is meant by ‘collude’ in this statement — which we don’t know.” What might the term “collusion” actually mean? Mr. Mariotti and I may disagree on a small technicality; it does have some legal meaning. It is found in one place in the federal code, in the area of antitrust law, concerning practices such as price-fixing. But that’s no help. To transpose the antitrust framework onto issues of election interference would require metaphor gymnastics. "
1126,"WASHINGTON — Standing before reporters in February, President Trump said unequivocally that he knew of nobody from his campaign who was in contact with Russians during the election. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has told the Senate the same thing. Court documents unsealed this week cast doubt on both statements and raised the possibility that Mr. Sessions could be called back to Congress for further questioning. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, unsealed his first charges Monday in a wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to disrupt the presidential election and whether anyone close to Mr. Trump was involved. Records in that case show that George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser, had frequent discussions with Russians in 2016 and trumpeted his connections in front of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions. For months, journalists have revealed evidence that associates of Mr. Trump met with Russians during the campaign and the presidential transition. But the court documents represent the first concrete evidence that Mr. Trump was personally told about ties between a campaign adviser and Russian officials. At a March 31, 2016, meeting between Mr. Trump and his foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos introduced himself and said “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin,” according to court records. “He went into the pitch right away,” said J. D. Gordon, a campaign adviser who attended the meeting. “He said he had a friend in London, the Russian ambassador, who could help set up a meeting with Putin.” "

1128,"To the Editor: Re “After Terrorism, Presidential Posturing” (editorial, Nov. 2): The editorial board rightly condemned President Trump’s use of the tragic terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan as an opportunity to launch a baseless assault on the American criminal justice system and a sitting senator. Against the backdrop of Russian efforts to influence our electoral process and further fracture our country along cultural and political fault lines, and attacks by terrorists seeking to shake the American psyche and undermine confidence in our government, one has to ask: Why does Mr. Trump launch unfounded attacks that aid our enemies in their efforts to sow dissension and discord? More important, when will the American people come together and say enough is enough? The greatest long-term threat to this country is not a physical attack on our people but an internal assault on our institutions that undermines our system of governance. MICHAEL CURRY, AUSTIN, TEX. To the Editor: It is infuriating to hear about yet another terrorist attack claiming the lives of innocent people. My deepest condolences go to the victims and their families. As a Muslim, I find it very demoralizing to see these types of attacks being associated with my faith. I find it utterly disgusting that a terrorist organization has succeeded in influencing so many individuals to commit such atrocities. As an Ahmadi Muslim, I will continue to categorically condemn these attacks. And it is important that other Muslim communities around the world also collectively speak out against toxic ideologies that shed the blood of the innocent. FASIH MALIK, CALGARY, ALBERTA To the Editor: Sayfullo Saipov came to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010. Like most immigrants he sought a better life. Did our immigration policy fail us, as President Trump asserts? Did we admit a sleeper agent, calmly preparing to wreak havoc some seven years later? "
1129,"SAN FRANCISCO — After years of trying unsuccessfully to build a social network to rival Facebook, Google finally got something out of all of its failures: cover. Members of Congress grilled the executives of Google, Facebook and Twitter this week in a trio of hearings focused on the role that social media played in advancing a Russian disinformation campaign before the 2016 election. Google’s representative at two of the hearings, Kent Walker, the company’s general counsel, made a point of distinguishing the search giant from its internet brethren. Repeatedly and unequivocally, he answered questions at the hearings by saying, “We’re not a social network.” Tech companies have taken a pounding in the court of public opinion in recent months. In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week’s congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry’s growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling. “Without sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,” said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. “The people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they’ve designed.” Not surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry’s biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don’t blame us. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company’s technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.

It tilts the country toward a tax system long championed by businesses. The bill includes several land mines that could complicate its passage, like limits on deductions for mortgage interest and for state and local taxes. Here are six charts that help explain the plan. A spokesman for the homebuilding industry said, “They are picking rich Americans and corporations over small businesses and the middle class.” _____ "
1131,"Condé Nast, a company once known for its lavish spending and its visually rich glossy magazines, continues to move away from its former identity. Condé Nast, the publisher of The New Yorker, Vogue and Vanity Fair, plans to cut roughly 80 employees across the company. It will also publish one fewer issue per year of the now-monthly magazines GQ, Glamour, Architectural Digest and Allure. The company will also close the quarterly print edition of Teen Vogue, which emerged this year as a voice of resistance against President Trump. In a statement released on Thursday, Condé Nast said the end of Teen Vogue’s regularly published print edition did not mean the end of Teen Vogue. “We are aggressively investing in the brand and all of its consumer touchpoints,” the statement said, “including events like the upcoming inaugural Teen Vogue Summit next month in Los Angeles.” "
1132,"Update, Feb. 2018: This lesson plan was created to accompany a student challenge we ran in 2017 that invited teenagers to explore their relationships with news. The results of that challenge have now been published, and can be found here: 10 Things We Learned About Teenagers and the News: The Results of Our Student ‘News Diet’ Challenge . _________ A May 2017 Times article, “Trying Not to Drown in a Flood of Major Breaking News,” begins: That was six months ago, and the pace this fall has been even more relentless: Political news vied for the front page with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the earthquake in Mexico, nuclear threats from North Korea, the Las Vegas shootings, the attack in Manhattan and more. Add to that the problem of “fake news,” and we certainly understand why anyone might simply want to ignore current events entirely. But in a connected world, information comes at us constantly, whether we choose it or not, and we must each figure out a way to navigate it. Not for a school assignment, but for our real lives. So we’ve proposed an experiment. We’re running a challenge that invites students to think deeply about their own relationships with news, and devise personal “news diets” that work for them. It runs from Nov. 2 to Dec. 22, 2017, and any teenager anywhere in the world can participate. The challenge has three steps: 1. Do a personal “news audit” to observe the role of news in their lives right now. 2. Experiment with their “news diets” in some way to find new sources that address any lacks they found. 3. Write a short essay or produce a short video that reflects on the process and what they learned. What did they discover about their news habits before and after they did the challenge — and what can they say about the role of news in their lives in general? "
1133,"WASHINGTON — Veterans of previous efforts to rewrite the tax code warn that overhauling the tax code is hard because it creates winners and losers — and the losers fight harder than the winners to make sure the legislation fails. The tax plan released by House Republicans on Thursday did not disappoint, cutting taxes and erasing popular deductions in ways that would reorient big chunks of the American economy. The bill loses revenue in some areas and raises it in others, and those are where the battle lines will be drawn in the coming weeks, as members of Congress scramble pass a law that President Trump wants to sign by Christmas. Slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would be a boon to firms that for years have complained of being shackled by high taxes. It remains to be seen if the benefits of this lower rate would be felt more by shareholders or workers. In selling the plan, Republicans have said that employees of companies would see their salaries rise because of a lower corporate tax rate. “Anything that brings down corporate tax rates in the right way here in the United States would be helpful,” Kevin P. Clark, chief executive of Delphi Automotive, said on the company’s third quarter earnings call. American multinational companies fare well under the plan, which calls for shifting toward a more territorial tax system, albeit with caveats. The plan levies a 10 percent global minimum tax on overseas earnings, but that’s still far below the current 35 percent they need to pay on income that’s returned home. In theory, the new system will reduce the “lockout” effect that encourages firms to stash cash abroad. "
1134,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “We will not be cowed.” That was Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, one day after a truck attack that killed eight people. Among those killed were five Argentines celebrating their 30th high school reunion and a Belgian mother of two. The suspect, an Uzbek immigrant named Sayfullo Saipov, has been charged with carrying out the attack in the name of the Islamic State. The group has not claimed responsibility, but our correspondent notes that it often does not when a recruit is captured alive. We delve into Uzbekistan’s repressive politics and economic failures and examine again when an attack is deemed “terrorism.” Adding to national dismay, there was a mass shooting at a Walmart in Colorado. Three people were confirmed dead. "
1135,"A week ago, reporters and editors in the combined newsroom of DNAinfo and Gothamist, two of New York City’s leading digital purveyors of local news, celebrated victory in their vote to join a union. On Thursday, they lost their jobs, as Joe Ricketts, the billionaire founder of TD Ameritrade who owned the sites, shut them down. At 5 p.m., a post by Mr. Ricketts went up on the sites announcing the decision. He praised them for reporting “tens of thousands of stories that have informed, impacted and inspired millions of people.” But he added, “DNAinfo is, at the end of the day, a business, and businesses need to be economically successful if they are to endure.” All other articles promptly vanished from the sites; an official at DNAinfo said they would be archived online. Mr. Ricketts wrote that he founded DNAinfo in 2009 “because I believe people care deeply about the things that happen where they live and work,” and he thought he could build “a large and loyal audience that advertisers would want to reach.” DNAinfo and Gothamist, which Mr. Ricketts bought in the spring, attracted more than 9 million readers a month, in New York and other cities where they operate satellite sites, DNAinfo said. But in the financially daunting era of digital journalism, there has been no tougher nut to crack than making local news profitable, a lesson Mr. Ricketts, who lost money every month of DNAinfo’s existence, is just the latest to learn. In New York City, the nation’s biggest media market, established organizations such as The Village Voice, The Wall Street Journal and The Daily News have slashed staff or withdrawn from street-level reporting. The Voice stopped publishing its print edition in September. "
1136,"At the Waldorf Astoria, she caught glimpses of Donald J. Trump, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. That’s to name just a few of the politicians Regina Gatewood spotted in her 16 years as a banquet waitress at the Waldorf, on Park Avenue in Manhattan. One time, Phillip C. McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, asked her for directions to the restroom. “I feel like I know you,” she recalled telling him. “And he said, ‘You do know me.’” Ms. Gatewood has come far since her mid-30s, when she entered New York City’s shelter system with her two sons after their father left. She worked long hours as a waitress and in temporary jobs until she could afford public housing, and eventually her own home on Staten Island. She started at the Waldorf in 2000 and worked her way up, becoming a full-time employee in 2010. “I never thought about retiring,” Ms. Gatewood, 62, said. “I thought I would die in the Jade Room.” But when the luxury hotel closed its doors on March 1 for years of renovations, Ms. Gatewood found herself without a job, along with more than 1,200 unionized hotel employees. Although they had known the closing was coming, Ms. Gatewood said, there was still an atmosphere of disbelief. Her work at the Waldorf was highly specialized — waiters served in pairs and did not use a computer-ordering system — and Ms. Gatewood worried such specialization would make it difficult for her to find employment elsewhere.

1137,"Q: You mentioned that having the state fully fund its share of school spending is your main way to address property tax relief, but that’s a $9 billion commitment. How do you get to that? A: Well It’s nine billion dollars cumulatively over eight years, so it’s a six to seven hundred million dollars we’re going to come up with. Q. Where will that money come from? A. It’s a combination of three things. One is looking at the priorities of the $35 billion that we’re already spending. You know, Christie miraculously came up with 200 million bucks to fund this opioid thing. He’s not saying from where, but he’s taken from Peter to pay Paul. And I’m not saying that’s necessarily a bad thing, but the fact of the matter is, you can make decisions within the budget already. Secondly, the very wealthiest, the big corporations have had loopholes, hedge funds have loopholes, they’ve had a really good ride. We’re going to tighten up, to do some good housekeeping. By the way, we’re hardly George Washington on this. I think 28 or 30 states have done it. The carried interest loophole is the most egregious loophole on the tax books, and if they’re not going to close it federally, we’re going to close it. Closing the out-of-network health care loophole. You add a bunch of those things up, it gets to $1.3 billion. And then we’ve got to grow again. We haven’t grown. We left $20 billion to $50 billion of economic activity on the table. Q. Your campaign has been filled with promises, from fully funded schools to pensions and New Jersey Transit. Do you anticipate being able to fulfill all those promises in four years? "
1138,"With their new bill that would slash taxes on the wealthy and blow up the federal budget deficit, House Republicans and President Trump are making it absolutely clear whom they are working for — the top 1 percent — and whom they consider dispensable. Well, that’s pretty much everybody else. The bill, which House leaders unveiled on Thursday after weeks of back-room negotiations that only Republicans were privy to, contained multibillion-dollar gifts for corporations, Wall Street titans and rich families. While there are a few peanuts thrown at lower-income and middle-class families, many people of modest means who take advantage of deductions and credits for things like housing, state and local taxes, medical expenses and education costs could end up paying more in taxes. At the same time, the bill would add $1.51 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade. In coming years, Republicans will surely point to that inflated debt to argue that it is imperative that Congress slash spending on infrastructure, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Where to begin? The primary goal of this bill is to slash taxes on corporate profits to 20 percent, from 35 percent. Mr. Trump’s minions in the White House and Congress are mouthing the same old stale arguments: that businesses will take the money saved on taxes and hire more people and hand it over to employees in raises and bonuses. If only. Credible economists believe the benefits of the cuts would accrue nearly exclusively to shareholders and executives. In fact, about $70 billion a year, or 35 percent of the benefits, would flow to foreign investors who own shares in American companies, according to Steven Rosenthal at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The bill would also lavish benefits on real estate partnerships, hedge funds and other pass-through businesses, which send their profits directly to their owners without taxes being withheld. Republicans want those business owners to pay taxes of just 25 percent on that income, rather than ordinary rates, which go up to 39.6 percent. Republicans argue that this will benefit small businesses. In fact, a large majority of small-business owners already have personal tax rates below 25 percent. This provision would aid a small group of developers, investors and other tycoons who work in professions or industries where it is relatively easy to set up pass-through businesses. Like, yes, Mr. Trump and his family, who make their money from one such industry: real estate. Let’s not forget that Mr. Trump has not released his tax returns, something every other major-party presidential nominee has done for nearly 40 years. "
1139,"SHANGHAI — President Trump is looking to President Xi Jinping to “do something” about America’s opioid epidemic, for which he blames China. That won’t be easy. Buying opioids from China, despite legal prohibitions, remains as easy as providing money and a shipping address. A drug bazaar thrives on Chinese websites, providing one-stop shopping for users around the world. On Weiku.com, a website based in the eastern city of Hangzhou, close to 100 Chinese companies say they sell fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. Vendors on one Beijing-based website, Mfrbee.com, sell chicken nuggets, basketball jerseys and carfentanil, the elephant tranquilizer that is 10,000 times as potent as morphine. A Shanghai-based chemical company, Shanghai Kaiwodun Biochemical, says it offers the designer drug U-47700 for $1,450 a pound. A Kaiwodun sales agent said over a Skype text message that the company had many customers in the United States and time-tested methods for shipping, sending photos of brown sugar and monosodium glutamate packets and a fuel filter. Weiku removed the search results for fentanyl on its website after The New York Times called the company for comment. A Weiku representative, Liu Congjuan, said that the company banned the advertising of fentanyl on its website but that sellers circumvented the prohibition by making slight tweaks to the forbidden search term. A representative for Mfrbee.com said the company was unaware of the listing and would delete it if it was illegal. Kaiwodun did not immediately respond to questions sent via email and Skype text. "
1140,"The long take has a special mystique, the most famous examples (“Touch of Evil,” “Goodfellas”) being among the most celebrated moments in movie history. But as with any ostentatious technique, the challenge is to incorporate it alongside the other elements without breaking the spell of the story. “Mr. Robot” solved that dilemma this week by making a take seemingly last an entire episode — there were camouflaged edits throughout — in effect making its spell and the story’s one in the same. From the opening moments with Elliot and Angela in the elevator to the final one when they reunited, after a very busy 43 minutes or so for each of them, the camera tracked an unbroken path through an E Corp headquarters thick with skulduggery, rioting and panic. The result was one of the year’s most electric episodes of television. While some of its tricks have fallen flat, “Mr. Robot” has a pretty good track record when it comes to long takes. The first season included evocative sequences like Elliot’s dark and woozy morphine withdrawal fantasy. A few weeks ago a four-plus minute shot took Elliot and Darlene down into the hacker Olympics and a Dark Army confrontation, a descent that carried viewers along with Elliot into the underworld he’s been trying to negotiate since. Similarly, though the camera moves and choreography Sam Esmail and the director of photography Tod Campbell dreamed up for this week’s episode were technically stunning, the approach succeeded because it added new layers to the story. Long takes stress out the audience by withholding the cutaways our minds crave, making us feel the anxiety wracking the characters. On Wednesday this intensified the show’s radically subjective perspective in an episode in which both Elliot and Angela were not only under the gun, but were so in opposition to one another. Their race to the hardware security modules — with Elliot aiming to prevent the destruction of the recovery building, and Angela trying to ensure it — was apparently won by Angela, though the emotional costs were substantial. The nervy visuals also brought to full boil a number of subplots that have been simmering all season or longer. The scope of Elliot’s conflict — with not just Mr. Robot and the Dark Army but also Wellick and Angela — finally came out into the open. Angela was forced to prove herself to her Dark Army overlords, and also face the fact that she is in league with killers, her protestations about building evacuations notwithstanding. (R.I.P. Lydia Riley, probably.) "
1141,"ASBURY PARK, N.J. — Philip Dunton Murphy bounded onto the stage here in early November amid rapturous cheers, though they were not all for him. His good friend, Jon Bon Jovi, had just blitzed through a three-song set, mixed with a brief endorsement of Mr. Murphy spoken over the chords of “Who Says You Can’t Go Home.” For Mr. Murphy, it was a note-perfect moment: irrefutable testimony of his New Jersey bona fides and of his progressive, working-class roots from a native son revered as a balladeer of the New Jersey working stiff. But over more than 500 days of relentless campaigning, such moments did not always come easily or naturally for Mr. Murphy, whose setting for much of his professional life has been rarefied corporate boardrooms and ornate European salons rather than rowdy campaign scenes. As he prepares to take office in January as New Jersey’s next governor, Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, is propped up by a fragile coalition unsure of a man who is largely unknown to most residents. His task is to convince a wary Democratic electorate that he is more than what his resume proclaims — a wealthy, longtime establishment political donor whose insider connections helped him land an ambassadorship — and that his brand of pragmatic-yet-progressive politics is both sincere and able to yield results. With his election, Mr. Murphy becomes the first Democrat to occupy the governor’s office in eight years, further cementing New Jersey’s shift to a decidedly blue state and giving a man who spent years on the periphery as an influential financial contributor his first chance at the political spotlight. He takes over a state where many are disillusioned and angry at the way the outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, has left New Jersey, riddled with debt, schools bereft of funding, exorbitant property taxes and a dismal public transit system. Politically inexperienced (his only other foray into elected office was a failed attempt at a seat on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange) and irrepressibly social (his tenure as the American ambassador to Germany was chronicled as much by the local tabloids as by Foreign Policy magazine), Mr. Murphy was able to take himself from banking executive to the doorstep of Drumthwacket, as the governor’s mansion is called, thanks in part to a family finely attuned to Democratic politics.

Here’s what you need to know: • Voters delivered a forceful rebuke of President Trump and his party on Tuesday, with Democrats winning the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey and making inroads in suburban communities that once favored the Republicans. Here’s a roundup of results, the key takeaways, and a look at the challenges facing Bill de Blasio, who won a second term as mayor of New York. New Jersey rejected Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and the Chris Christie administration, electing Philip Murphy. He’s a political newbie with progressive roots, our  profile shows. Ralph Northam, who kept the governor’s seat blue in Virginia, told supporters, “We will not condone hatred and bigotry.” • Our analysis of the  Virginia race looks at the perils of a Trumpist platform. “We now know what a lot of us in the party already knew: The Trump message is a big loser in swing states,” one Republican strategist said. • Devin Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people in a Texas church, once escaped from a psychiatric hospital but was able to buy weapons later.

1143,"Great wealth in America primarily comes from two sources: entrepreneurship and inheritance. In any age, how people work and create great wealth and how others put to use money they inherited, sometimes many generations removed, speak to the complicated feelings people have around wealth. Entrepreneurs range across every industry, from the esoteric to the fascinating. For a time, tech entrepreneurs who took industry-changing ideas hatched in their dorm rooms and rode them to vast and quick wealth were lionized. Now many in that group are seen as selfishly fixated on the wealth itself. Society’s view of inheritors has always been complicated. Some have been president, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, George and George W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. Other inheritors have used their great wealth to endow museums, universities or charities, like the Whitneys, Vanderbilts and Rockefellers. Some, of course, have just had tremendous fun with their inheritance, not always to society’s approval. To better understand how the sources of wealth might change one’s view of it — and life — I reached out to the multimillionaires Blaine Vess, 36, an entrepreneur, and Mitzi Perdue, 76, an inheritor, who bring equally complicated views to their wealth. In August, Mr. Vess sold the online study-aid company he founded, Student Brands, in his college dorm to Barnes & Noble for $58.5 million in cash. His dorm was at San Jose State University, not Stanford or Harvard. It took him 17 years to build the company. And during that time it was always profitable, growing from $60,000 in revenue when he graduated in 2004 to over $20 million in 2016. He also owned an estimated 80 percent of the company. Last year, he started a second company, Solve, an airport concierge service, and this fall sold it to Blacklane, a global chauffeur service. At age 26, Mrs. Perdue and her siblings inherited Ernest Henderson’s controlling stake in Sheraton hotels, which he had founded during the Great Depression. In 1968, the family sold the company to the conglomerate ITT. She had already lived a privileged life, growing up in Boston, traveling widely and attending Radcliffe College, formerly the all-women’s college at Harvard University. She has had a career as a science writer and public speaker. While her first marriage ended in divorce, her second to Frank Perdue, the chicken king, lasted until his death in 2005. It also gave her great insight into another publicly known but private family dynasty. The result is a recently published book on family business, “How To Make Your Family Business Last.” Here are edited and condensed excerpts from my interviews with them.  What did you want do when you were young? "
1144,"FUQING, China — Cao Dewang saw his impoverished mother nearly die of starvation more than 50 years ago, during a famine driven by Mao’s mismanaged push to industrialize China. Today, Mr. Cao is a billionaire auto glass magnate, and he wants to give back. He has given a large chunk of his fortune toward construction of an enormous public library near his hometown and numerous Buddhist temples. He has paid for the medical care of distant relatives of employees who fall seriously ill. He entreats his fellow Chinese billionaires to give as well. “I started from the very bottom of society, so I understand the wants and needs of those at the very bottom,” said Mr. Cao in an interview this year. “We should take care of the needs of our employees as part of a family.” Now, in a factory with roughly 2,000 workers in Moraine, Ohio, 7,600 miles away, Mr. Cao’s paternalistic attitude is facing a deep test. Workers at the plant — owned by Mr. Cao’s company, Fuyao Glass — began two days of voting on Wednesday on whether to unionize. Officials at the United Automobile Workers union say that frustration with highhanded and arbitrary treatment by supervisors has generated support for a union. “They have been very arrogant to the workers,” said Rich Rankin, the U.A.W.’s director for the region. He added that the environment remained challenging, but that organizers had seen rising enthusiasm for their efforts since a rally late last month. "
1145,"BEIJING — [Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] Amid the pomp that President Xi Jinping of China is bestowing upon his visiting American counterpart, President Trump, it’s hard not to see two leaders — and two countries — heading in very different directions. Mr. Xi emerged from last month’s Communist Party Congress the undisputed master of the Middle Kingdom. “Xi Jinping Thought” was enshrined in the party constitution — an honor previously granted only to Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Breaking with precedent, Mr. Xi neglected to anoint a successor — a big hint that he feels emboldened to extend his rule beyond the second five-year term he has just begun. The Economist heralded Mr. Xi with an honorific usually reserved for America’s president: the world’s most powerful man. Mr. Trump stepped off Air Force One in Beijing on Wednesday with historically low job-approval ratings, just hours after suffering a shellacking in off-year elections. His credibility is cratering abroad — polls have shown a drop in confidence in American leadership. As the personal trajectories of Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi diverge, so too does the focus of their leadership. While Mr. Trump is obsessed with building walls, Mr. Xi is busy building bridges. At the World Economic Forum in January, Mr. Xi proclaimed China the new champion of free trade and globalization. His “One Belt, One Road” initiative — with funding from the made-in-Beijing Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank — will invest $1 trillion in linking Asia with Europe through a network of sea routes, roads, railways and, yes, bridges. China will gain access to resources, export its excess industrial capacity and peacefully secure strategic footholds from which to project power. While Mr. Trump shuns multilateralism and global governance, Mr. Xi increasingly embraces them. The Trump administration has belittled the United Nations, withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, jettisoned America’s commitment to the Paris climate accord, tried to renege on the nuclear deal with Iran, questioned America’s core alliances in Europe and Asia, disparaged the World Trade Organization and multicountry trade deals, and sought to shut the door on immigrants. "
1146,"By any measure, Tuesday was a big night for Democrats, especially in Virginia, where they swept the top offices, including governor, and made strong gains in the General Assembly. Here are some key takeaways from the biggest election night since President Trump’s victory a year ago. It was largely a suburban rebellion, where more moderate voters rejected Mr. Trump and embraced Democrats. Be it New Jersey, Virginia or Charlotte, N.C., Democrats rode a miniwave of victories that will give them energy for candidate recruitment and fund-raising heading into the midterm elections next year. In addition to winning the top races, for governor of New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats also captured the mayoral post in Manchester, N.H., the State Senate in Washington, along with other important victories in statehouse elections.

1147,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert highlighted recent reports that Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s golf resort in Florida, received government permission to hire 70 immigrant workers. Mr. Trump has criticized companies that don’t “hire American.” On “Late Night,” Seth Meyers pointed out some questionable hiring practices within Mr. Trump’s administration — specifically in the Department of Agriculture. The Trump ally Sam Clovis recently withdrew from consideration for the job of chief scientist within the department — a job Mr. Trump had nominated him for — after he was linked to the Russia election-meddling scandal. Mr. Clovis is not in fact a scientist. Conan O’Brien is filming his shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem this week, and he’s trying to reclaim his former identity as a New Yorker. Jon Stewart showed up to keep him honest with a “citizenship test,” administered with some help from Andy Richter. Somehow, Mr. O’Brien passed with flying colors. He turned the crowd against himself with this exchange: But won them back with this: "
1148,"Donald Trump has been trying to celebrate his one-year anniversary as president, and all he gets is terrible political news. His party got skunked in Tuesday’s elections, his associates keep getting tied to the Russians and the Republicans in Congress are flailing around like a bunch of panicked gerbils. Hehehehe. In the latest episode of Cabinet Members off the Rails: the sorrows of Wilbur Ross Jr. A new investigative report detailed connections between Ross and a shipping group linked to Vladimir Putin’s son-in-law. Even worse, Forbes announced it was taking Ross off its list of richest Americans, concluding that most of the $3.7 billion Ross told the magazine he owned was fictional. Something must be done. If there is anyone who doesn’t belong in the top levels of American government, it’s a guy pretending to be a billionaire when he really isn’t. The Trump campaign adviser Carter Page made quite a splash with his rambling, six-hour-plus testimony before a congressional committee that demonstrated not only that he had been in contact with Russians during the campaign, but also that the man Trump picked to be one of his top coaches on foreign policy issues is … sort of nuts. “I am not a smooth Russian speaker. Maybe you could say that about my English as well,” explained the former college lecturer with a doctorate from the University of London. One committee member described the whole performance as “really eccentric behavior.” And then came the elections! The biggest race was for governor of Virginia, where Trump had done robocalls and tweeted for the Republican, Ed Gillespie. When his candidate got trounced, Trump quickly and supportively announced that it was Gillespie’s own fault for having failed to “embrace me or what I stand for.” "
1149,"On Oct. 22, 2016, Donald J. Trump made his own history in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he was holding a campaign rally just weeks before his election. “AT&T is buying Time Warner, and thus CNN,” he told his audience, calling the proposed merger an example of a media “power structure” that was working to suppress his vote and the voices of his supporters. It was, he said, “a deal we will not approve in my administration.” He specifically cited media concentration. But his singling out of CNN in the context of an alleged plot against him was lost on no one. Now, CNN is at the heart of a dispute between the Justice Department and AT&T and Time Warner. Three people from the companies said Wednesday that the department insisted that AT&T divest either CNN’s parent company, Turner Broadcasting, or its valuable DirecTV service in return for approval. This raised the chilling possibility that Mr. Trump was making good on his threatening statements in Gettysburg. Adding to the chill was the lack of a compelling legal justification for the department’s conditions, which appeared to come out of the blue. Asking AT&T to divest DirecTV seems to be a non-starter, given how essential DirecTV is as a satellite distributor of content, and the Justice Department had to know that. So in effect, AT&T’s only choice would be to jettison Turner. "
1150,"RICHMOND, Va. — The American suburbs appear to be in revolt against President Trump after a muscular coalition of college-educated voters and racial and ethnic minorities dealt the Republican Party a thumping rejection on Tuesday and propelled a diverse class of Democrats into office. From the tax-obsessed suburbs of New York City to high-tech neighborhoods outside Seattle to the sprawling, polyglot developments of Fairfax and Prince William County, Va., voters shunned Republicans up and down the ballot in off-year elections. Leaders in both parties said the elections were an unmistakable alarm bell for Republicans ahead of the 2018 campaign, when the party’s grip on the House of Representatives may hinge on the socially moderate, multiethnic communities near major cities. “Voters are taking their anger out at the president, and the only way they can do that is by going after Republicans on the ballot,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. The Democrats’ gains signaled deep alienation from the Republican Party among the sort of upscale moderates who were once central to their coalition. Democrats not only swept Virginia’s statewide races but neared a majority in the House of Delegates, a legislative chamber that was gerrymandered to make the Republican majority virtually unassailable. They seized county executive offices in Westchester and Nassau Counties, N.Y., and carried bellwether mayoral elections in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Manchester, N.H., all races that appeared to favor Republicans only months ago. In Washington State, Democrats won a special election to take control of the State Senate, establishing total Democratic dominance of government on the West Coast. Democrats took council seats in vote-rich Delaware County, Pa., in the Philadelphia suburbs, a perennial congressional battleground. "
1151,"It seemed like a match made in media heaven. AT&T is a telecommunications giant whose reach stretches to millions of people all over the country, and Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros., has content galore. Together, the two companies would create a colossus straddling the worlds of internet access, news and entertainment. Until last week, AT&T’s pending $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner seemed destined to close by the end of the year. On Wednesday, however, tensions between the Justice Department and executives at the two companies spilled out into the open. Now it seems possible that the Justice Department and AT&T will end up battling each other in court. The ongoing negotiations have also demonstrated how the Trump administration may regulate big-ticket mergers and acquisitions, representing the first major test for the government’s antitrust strategy. A central component of the dispute, according to people from both companies and the Justice Department, is CNN — the network that Mr. Trump has frequently attacked as a purveyor of “fake news.” Late last week, AT&T called the Justice Department to request a meeting between top antitrust officials and AT&T’s chief executive officer, Randall L. Stephenson. On Monday, at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, Mr. Stephenson and AT&T’s general counsel, David McAtee, met with Makan Delrahim, the new assistant attorney general for the department’s antitrust division, and other Justice Department officials. In one account of the meeting, Justice Department officials called on AT&T to sell Turner Broadcasting — the group of cable channels under the Time Warner banner that includes CNN — as a potential requirement for gaining government approval, according to three people from the companies involved, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because of the delicacy of the negotiations.

Mollie Hemingway in The Federalist: Ms. Hemingway acknowledges that “everything went Democrats’ way” in the Virginia election. It was a tidal wave that had a number of causes she points to in her piece, including the weakness of the Republican candidate Ed Gillespie, and the carefully crafted statewide campaign from the Democratic National Committee. She also warns against pundits who claim that this race is predictive of the 2018 midterms. She admits, however, that for Republicans to hold on to their House majority, they are going to “have to make the case for their survival” with legislative wins. Read more » _____ Joel B. Pollak in Breitbart: Over at Breitbart, Mr. Pollak argues that the Virginia election for governor is not so much a repudiation of the president but, rather, a rejection of the establishment. Moreover, he sees the results as a reflection of voters’ concerns over health care, writing that Virginia voters “continue to prefer the insurance they do not have to the insurance Republicans will give them.” And while he places most of the blame on the Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul D. Ryan, he concedes that when it comes to legislative accomplishment, “the buck stops with Trump.” Read more » _____ Jim Geraghty in National Review: According to Mr. Geraghty, those on the right who blame Mr. Gillespie’s establishment ties and those on the left who emphasize his Trump-inspired campaign strategy are both right. In a sense, he writes, “Gillespie’s getting the worst of both worlds.” And however you choose to explain his loss — and the Republican Party’s statewide losses in Virginia and elsewhere — “Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration should feel slapped in the face.” Read more » "
1153,"WASHINGTON — China has been a tricky economic partner for the United States, offering both lucrative opportunities for collaboration and a minefield of security risks. That tension was on display this week as President Trump arrived in Beijing with a coalition of American industry leaders who plan to announce new deals with Chinese companies. At the same time, a group of bipartisan lawmakers in Washington introduced legislation on Wednesday that would subject Chinese investments to greater scrutiny through a significant expansion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a panel that reviews foreign mergers and acquisitions for potential threats to national security. The dual approach highlights the challenge facing the Trump administration as it tries to articulate a clear strategy for dealing with China. Mr. Trump campaigned on a get-tough approach to China — a view that is shared by many Republican and Democratic lawmakers who see the country as a growing threat — but he must now balance that position with preserving the business ties that much of the United States economy depends on. On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, introduced legislation that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced on Wednesday by Representative Robert Pittenger, a Republican from North Carolina. The legislation is aimed at preventing China from taking advantage of the United States’ open approach to foreign investment to access sensitive technology. Policymakers and lawmakers in the United States have grown increasingly skeptical of China’s investments in advanced technology industries like robotics, self-driving vehicles and artificial intelligence. Beijing has explicitly laid out a strategy for its companies, called Made in China 2025, of acquiring foreign technologies to build homegrown giants. Chinese investment in the United States and elsewhere has surged in recent years as the Chinese government encouraged companies to acquire technology and know-how abroad, and as Chinese companies and wealthy individuals sought safer refuges for their money. "
1154,"In 2006, the endowments of Indiana University and Texas Christian University invested millions of dollars in a partnership, hoping to mint riches from oil, gas and coal. The partnership was formed by the Houston-based Quintana Capital Group, whose principals include Donald L. Evans, an influential Texan and longtime supporter of former President George W. Bush. Little more than a year earlier, Mr. Evans had left his cabinet position as commerce secretary. Though the group had an impressive Texas pedigree, presidential cachet and ambitions for operations in the United States, the new partnership was established in the Cayman Islands. The founders promised their university and nonprofit investors that the partnership would try to avoid federal taxes by exploiting a loophole called “blocker corporations,” which are typically established in tax havens around the world. A trove of millions of leaked documents from a Bermuda-based law firm, Appleby, reflects some of the tax wizardry used by American colleges and universities. Schools have increasingly turned to secretive offshore investments, the files show, which let them swell their endowments with blocker corporations, and avoid scrutiny of ventures involving fossil fuels or other issues that could set off campus controversy. Buoyed by lucrative tax breaks, college endowments have amassed more than $500 billion nationwide. The wealth is concentrated in a small group of schools, tilting toward private institutions like those in the Ivy League and other highly selective colleges. About 11 percent of higher-education institutions in the United States hold 74 percent of the money, according to an analysis in 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. "
1155,"WASHINGTON — A Senate hearing on nominees for two top environmental posts on Wednesday quickly turned testy over the Trump administration’s ambivalence on climate change science. Andrew R. Wheeler, a lobbyist for Murray Energy, which is owned by Robert E. Murray, an Appalachian coal mining magnate and prominent backer of President Trump, has been nominated to be the deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Kathleen Hartnett White, a former Texas environmental regulator who has described belief in global warming as “a kind of paganism,” has been tapped to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Democratic members of the Environment and Public Works Committee focused much of their hostility on Mrs. White, a fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the former chairwoman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Democrats assailed her past writings on climate change, including articles in which she called carbon dioxide “the gas of life” and described renewable energy as parasitic. “Your positions are so far out of the mainstream, they are not just outliers, they are outrageous,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. “You have a fringe voice that denies science, economics and reality.” "
1156,"BEIJING — China on Wednesday released fresh details about a new financial regulatory body intended to calm a financial system that in recent years has endured a stock market crash, a huge exodus of money outside the country and the rapid accumulation of debt. But the details may raise more questions than they answer, and could disappoint those looking for a strong hand to rein in the financial system underpinning the world’s second-largest economy. Official Chinese media reported late Wednesday that a new Financial Stability and Development Committee had held its first meeting, nearly four months after President Xi Jinping ordered its creation. It said the meeting was led by Ma Kai, a 71-year-old vice premier. At the meeting, Mr. Ma stressed that China’s financial system should serve the real economy, according to the official Xinhua news agency — namely, making money available to businesses that need it. He also stressed financial security, the report said. The new committee’s mission appears to fall short of what many in China has expected. Many had speculated that Mr. Xi might combine the country’s central bank with the agencies regulating securities, banking and insurance to create a financial superregulator. Previous problems, like a stock market crash two years ago, were worsened by lack of coordination among different government agencies. But the commission that emerged seemed more a minnow than a whale. None of the current agencies disappeared, and the commission was merely assigned a small office in a corner of the central bank. "
1157,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday tightened the economic embargo on Cuba, restricting Americans from access to hotels, stores and other businesses tied to the Cuban military. A lengthy list of rules, which President Trump promised in June to punish the communist government in Havana, came just as Mr. Trump was visiting leaders of the communist government in Beijing and pushing business deals there. Wednesday’s announcement was part of the administration’s gradual unwinding of parts of the Obama administration’s détente with the Cuban government. Americans wishing to visit Cuba will once again have to go through authorized tour operators, and tour guides will have to accompany the groups — making such trips more expensive. People who already have booked and paid for a trip on their own will be allowed to go, and transactions with businesses on the barred list can be completed, the administration said. The new rules, which go into effect Thursday, apply only to future travel and commerce. Eighty-three hotels are on the banned list. While the rules will discourage some travel and business dealings between the countries, they do not ban them. Indeed, much of Mr. Obama’s opening to Cuba remains in place, including diplomatic ties. In a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said the new rules were intended to direct money and economic activity away from the Cuban military and security services, and toward businesses controlled by regular Cuban citizens. Officials said the widespread practice of renting rooms and eating meals in private homes in Cuba would continue to be allowed, as would renting cars from private citizens. "
1158,"Two years after his 24-year-old girlfriend was shot and killed on live television, a Virginia Democrat on Tuesday defeated an opponent who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association for a seat in the State Legislature. Chris Hurst, a former news anchor whose girlfriend and colleague, Alison Parker, was killed on air in 2015, overtook Joseph Yost to win the 12th House District seat in the state’s Legislature. He will be one of two Democrats to represent the state’s deeply conservative southwest region in the House. In an interview Wednesday morning, Mr. Hurst, 30, described himself as humbled and awe-struck by his victory. He said that before Ms. Parker’s death, he had not had political aspirations. “Our campaign has really tried not to focus on what happened to me,” he said. “Only inasmuch as I needed to explain to voters why I was running and leaving a good-paying job and a career that I loved.” Though the victory was still fresh, he said that he had briefly considered what Ms. Parker might have thought of his new career. “I think that she would be very proud,” he said. “And I continue to be proud of her.” Ms. Parker and a cameraman, Adam Ward, were filming a live news segment when they were fatally shot by Vester Lee Flanagan II, who had been a reporter at the station where they worked, WDBJ in Roanoke, Va. The graphic footage was widely viewed, rocketing around social media after Mr. Flanagan, who later shot and killed himself, posted it on Facebook. "
1159,"For decades, Saudi Arabia was a stable and reliable economic and strategic partner of the United States. That country no longer exists. The Saudi Arabia that preferred caution to confrontation in international affairs, that emphasized stability at home and that kept royal family disputes private, has been disassembled by the ambitious young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has seized control of all instruments of policy and power in the kingdom. With a flurry of arrests of princes and business tycoons over the weekend, the crown prince jettisoned the longstanding practice among Saudi rulers of seeking consensus, or at least acquiescence, from all branches of the family and from the country’s business elite. Can the consensus of the family and the business leadership that they forged survive? If the Saudis are looking at their own history, they should be worried. After the 1953 death of the country’s founding king, Abdul-Aziz al-Saud, Saudi Arabia was crippled for a decade by a power struggle between his successor, the profligate King Saud, and Crown Prince Faisal, a leader respected for probity and self-discipline. Surrounded by sycophants, King Saud emptied the national treasury while a frustrated Prince Faisal sought to rally other princes to his side; critical development projects were put off. King Saud’s ruinous reign ended when the family forced him into exile in 1964 and Faisal took over. The ruling family learned harsh lessons from that experience. From then until now, it has kept family differences inside the family. In fact, in the years when he was governor of Riyadh before becoming king in 2015, Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud was known as the mediator and conciliator of family disputes. "
1160,"In May 2016, a Facebook page called Heart of Texas urged its nearly 254,000 followers to rise up against what it considered to be an urgent cultural menace. A mosque in Houston had opened up a new library, and Heart of Texas planned to protest. “Stop Islamization of Texas,” it warned. Word of the protest spread quickly, but supporters of the mosque were also ready to mobilize. “Bigots are planning to intimidate through weaponized fear this Saturday at noon,” one of them wrote on Reddit. The post linked to a Facebook page for United Muslims of America, a group that said it was planning a counterprotest for the same time and place. By now you might be able to guess the punch line here. Heart of Texas wasn’t a real group, as Business Insider later reported. United Muslims of America is a real organization, but the Facebook page promoting the counterprotest was not run by the actual group, as The Daily Beast found. Instead, according to documents made public last week by the Senate Intelligence Committee, both the pro- and anti-mosque protests had been planned and promoted by Russian trolls. We may never know for certain if Russia’s campaign to influence American society through social networks changed the course of history in big ways — if it altered the election results, say. But it is already clear that Russia’s efforts did change the world in countless small ways. A few dozen real Americans did protest that Saturday in Houston. Videos of the protest show real emotion — people on opposite sides of the street screaming, swearing and truly angry to have to share the country with the bozos on the other side. As I watched these videos recently, I had an epiphany about the Russia influence campaign. The Houston protest videos depicted a bunch of Americans duped into fighting each other in public, all at the whim of an unseen force that, through expert and surreptitious cajoling, had gotten them to lose control of themselves on camera. I’d seen this show many times before, and you probably have, too. It’s called “The Bachelor.” "
1161,"“Poetry Reading, 6 p.m.,” read the sign taped outside the doorway of the Bethune Street townhouse where Otis Kidwell Burger, 93, has lived for nearly 60 years. Inside, from a rocker cushioned with red velvet, Ms. Kidwell Burger presided over the dozen or so poets gathered in her parlor, a cozy haven with Oriental rugs, a working fireplace and shelves of old books and general clutter. Ms. Kidwell Burger, a writer and sculptor, lives with her two cats in the 1836 building that she and her then-husband, the late literary agent Knox Burger, bought in 1959. Its upper floors served as a rooming house, with rooms starting at $8 per week, she said. “It was full of strange folks,” she said. The room next to the magician was rented as a writing space by the author and activist Jane Jacobs, who worked on her seminal book “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” there, Ms. Kidwell Burger said. “Jane lived around the corner on Hudson Street, but she had a house full of teenagers and it was quieter here,” said Ms. Kidwell Burger, who joined forces with Ms. Jacobs in the ’60s to resist projects threatening the small-town character of the neighborhood. She recalled being with Ms. Jacobs at a 1968 public hearing for Robert Moses’s plan to build a downtown expressway. "
1162,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. President Trump’s critics and admirers have both often wondered whether most of the normal rules of politics apply to him. Trump, in his own graphic way, may have summarized the view best: “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, O.K.?” But it turns out that the normal rules of politics do indeed apply to Trump. With his approval rating at a paltry 38 percent, Trump’s Republican Party took a whupping. It’s not just that the Democrats easily won the highest-profile race — the Virginia governorship. Democrats enjoyed a stunningly good night across the country. Consider: • Defying virtually all expectations, Democrats flipped more than a dozen of the 100 seats in Virginia’s house of delegates and, pending final vote counts, may have won control of it. • They won full control — legislature and governorship — in both New Jersey and Washington State. • Maine’s Republican governor has repeatedly vetoed Medicaid expansion. Maine’s voters effectively overrode his veto, by referendum, in a landslide. • Democrats won two traditionally Republican legislature seats in special elections in Georgia. • Last night’s results continue a trend. Democrats have done startlingly well in special elections this year, often in conservative districts. As significant as all these wins are in their own right, they will also help shape the political future. Already, multiple House Republicans have announced their retirement, including two more yesterday. Idaho and Utah may now follow Maine and hold referendums on expanding Medicaid. Progressives will be energized to find candidates to run in traditionally Republican areas. "
1163,"BEIJING — Three U.C.L.A. men’s basketball players, including LiAngelo Ball, the brother of the Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball, will not play in an exhibition game on Friday in Shanghai. Multiple news media accounts said the players were detained on suspicion of shoplifting. Coach Steve Alford announced the decision to bench the players, but would not elaborate on the nature of the circumstances. Both U.C.L.A. and the Pacific-12 Conference used the term “situation” to describe what was going on with the players. “We are aware of a situation involving U.C.L.A. student-athletes in Hangzhou, China,” U.C.L.A. said in a statement. “The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time.” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said: “Yesterday in Hangzhou, China, U.C.L.A. student-athletes were involved in a situation, and U.C.L.A. is cooperating fully with local authorities. We are directing all inquiries about the specifics of this matter to U.C.L.A. We are very disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about. Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation.” The other players involved were Cody Riley and Jalen Hill. All three are freshmen. Ball’s father, LaVar, who is in China, told ESPN that he was “going to wait until I get more intel on what’s going on” before making a comment. The Ball family is being followed by a reality television crew for the Facebook Watch program “Ball in the Family.” "
1164,"HONG KONG — China does not allow its people to gain access to Facebook, a powerful tool for disseminating information and influencing opinion. As if to demonstrate the platform’s effectiveness, outside its borders China uses it to spread state-produced propaganda around the world, including the United States. So much do China’s government and companies value Facebook that the country is Facebook’s biggest advertising market in Asia, even as it is the only major country in the region that blocks the social network. A look at the Facebook pages of China Central Television, the leading state-owned broadcast network better known as CCTV, and Xinhua, China’s official news agency, reveals hundreds of English-language posts intended for an English-speaking audience. Each quarter, China’s government, through its state media agencies, spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy Facebook ads, according to a person with knowledge of those deals, who was unauthorized to talk publicly about the company’s revenue streams. China’s propaganda efforts are in the spotlight with President Trump visiting the country and American lawmakers investigating foreign powers’ use of technology to sway voters in the United States. "

1166,"Good morning on this nippy Wednesday. Mayor Bill de Blasio cruised to a second-term victory yesterday. (And Philip D. Murphy, a former Wall Street banker, will replace Chris Christie as New Jersey governor.) Among Mayor de Blasio’s promises in the next four years: the creation of thousands of affordable housing units, a friendlier police force, and free, full-day preschool for 3-year-olds. We asked New York Today readers: What do you want our next mayor to accomplish in the next four years? Here’s what a few of your neighbors said: “Focus on making New York City a place where all residents can safely walk, bike and use fast and reliable transit anywhere in the city.” — Avinoam Baral, 24, Manhattan “Improve the subway system, it’s really frustrating.” — John White, 27, Brooklyn “Improve the traffic flow in Manhattan and ease the congestion.” — William J. Fleming, 78, the Bronx “Support a congestion pricing plan that’ll charge drivers, taxis and ride-shares entering Manhattan’s busiest district (south of 59th Street), and toll bridges and tunnels appropriately.” — Brennan Ortiz, 25, the Bronx “New York is a hard city to live in without money, and the next mayor needs to continue policies in education, housing, access to health care, and the minimum wage to ensure it becomes the highest ranking city in America for economic mobility, which is how we measure the American dream.” — Eóin Cunningham, 37, Brooklyn "
1167,"The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience. We have asked our standards editor, Phil Corbett, to explain our use of honorifics. Readers occasionally express concern about articles referring to the president as “Mr. Trump.” They believe it is disrespectful to call him “Mr.” rather than “President” Trump, and some suggest that our doing so is a sign of political bias. “It’s President Trump, not Mr. Trump,” wrote one reader who uses the name Batman (you read that right) in the comments section. “If we’re really going to bad mouth the President of the United States, why don’t we at least learn his title.” The complaint isn’t new to me. For years, we got complaints that our references to “Mr. Obama” betrayed our disrespect for him. And before that, “Mr. Bush” made some readers suspect that we were showing our disdain for that president. I’m not sure whether one of my long-ago predecessors got similar complaints about The Times’s references to “Mr. Lincoln.” But I can assure readers that we have been consistent for many years in how we refer to an incumbent president: It’s “President Trump” (or President Obama, or President Bush) on first reference, and “Mr. Trump” or “the president” (lowercase) thereafter. No disrespect is intended. In fact, most news organizations dispense with the “Mr.” altogether and simply call the president “Trump” after the first reference. The Times is among the few outlets still using courtesy titles like “Mr.” or “Ms.” (with exceptions in our sports coverage and a few other areas). Some readers (me included) like the tone of civility and seriousness the titles convey; others find them old-fashioned and stodgy. And still others are just confused. "
1168,"After a year of high-profile moral victories in special congressional elections, Democrats finally got actual victories on the board, and more. They won big in Virginia, took full control of state government in New Jersey and Washington State, prevailed on an important ballot measure in Maine, and generally posted strong results across the nation. Together, it was the clearest sign yet that college-educated white voters’ unhappiness with President Trump would jeopardize suburban Republicans in next year’s midterm elections. But the biggest difference between Tuesday’s Democratic wins and the earlier Republican wins is deceptively simple: This time, elections were held on neutral or even Democratic-leaning terrain. For that reason, it is not obvious that Tuesday’s performance represents a significant improvement over the Democrats’ showings earlier in the year. In 2018, they won’t always get the luxury of competing in such favorable districts. To take the House next November, they might have to do even better than they did on Tuesday. Make no mistake: The results Tuesday are fully consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that brought Democrats to power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010. All of the conditions for a 2018 wave are in place. The president’s approval rating is stuck in the mid-to-high 30s. The Democrats hold nearly a double-digit lead on the generic congressional ballot. The president’s party nearly always struggles in midterm elections. "
1169,"PONCE, P.R. — Almost two months after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, there were more signs of how unsettled the situation remains here and how grievous the toll of the storm was. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said that it was finalizing extraordinary plans to fly about 3,000 residents of Puerto Rico still living in shelters to New York and Florida. “Transportation assistance is something that I don’t think we have done previously,” Will Booher, a FEMA spokesman, said. “But this is unique to what’s going on in Puerto Rico.” The agency said the relief effort was being undertaken at the request of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. FEMA regularly finds housing for hurricane victims, often at hotels or motels nearby. But because there is so little available lodging on the island, and no easy way to get people from shelters to safe housing, the agency is arranging charter flights for residents, beginning with those still in shelters. On Wednesday, Puerto Rico officials, facing increasing questions about the accuracy of the official death toll from the storm, acknowledged for the first time that 472 more people died this September compared with the same month last year. The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. The government’s official death toll is 55. The numbers confirmed what had been speculated for weeks: After the waters receded and the roads were cleared, people here continued to die at rates far beyond normal. "
1170,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Xi Jinping of China showered President Trump with hospitality, leading him on a tour of the Forbidden City on Wednesday, but experts say the personal contact may not alter their divisions on pressuring North Korea. The two meet again today, and are expected to give a joint statement. Our reporters in China and Washington note that business deals are likelier outcomes than policy shifts, and our video team tracks how Mr. Trump has shifted over time from targeting China’s trade policy to praising Mr. Xi. In a bit of unfortunate timing, three U.C.L.A. basketball players were reportedly detained in China on suspicion of shoplifting and will not play an exhibition game in Shanghai on Friday. _____ • President Rodrigo Duterte ordered a halt to construction on a sandbar in an area of the South China Sea that was putting the Philippines into conflict with China.

1171,"BERLIN — Germans normally wait about six weeks after an election for a government to be sworn in. That benchmark quietly came and went a week ago, an indication of the challenge facing a politically weakened Angela Merkel. Since her party won just 30.2 percent of the vote in the Sept. 24 election, the chancellor has found herself struggling to bridge a yawning gap between prospective coalition partners, rendering a normally painstaking process even more protracted and difficult. The four parties in the talks — her conservative Christian Democrats; their Bavaria-only sister party, the Christian Social Union; the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens — span the political spectrum. This week the chancellor set a deadline of next Thursday for the parties to decide whether they can make a government work — and these are just the preliminary talks. Should the parties decide to move to the next step, only then will they start hammering out what could be the longest, most detailed coalition agreement Germany has seen to date. One analyst, Uwe Jun, a professor of political science at the University of Trier, gave the four-way coalition talks a 2-to-1 chance of success. That’s better than the odds given by some involved in the negotiations. Such a coalition is untried at the federal level and only recently attempted in two of the country’s less populous states. The chancellor’s governing partner of the past four years, the center-left Social Democrats, have vowed to remain in the opposition. So if Ms. Merkel’s search for new partners fails, Germans would be forced to hold another election. "
1172,"The N.F.L., the $14 billion-a-year sports juggernaut that dominates TV ratings as well as the national conversation most Sundays, has ascended to its position of supremacy in recent years with an ownership group that often works in lock step. The men and women who control the league’s 32 teams might disagree sometimes, but rarely do they publicly reveal any discord. Now the league, already wobbling under the strain of presidential and public aggravation over players’ kneeling during the national anthem, is coping with what amounts to an all-out war between one of its most powerful owners and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, who has been rewarded for the N.F.L.’s success with annual compensation that has topped $40 million. Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, has escalated a feud with Goodell, threatening to sue the league and some fellow team owners over negotiations to extend Goodell’s contract, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation. Jones told the six owners on the league’s compensation committee last week that he had hired David Boies, the high-profile lawyer under fire in the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment case, according to the people, who declined to speak publicly about internal league matters. Through a team spokesman, Jones declined to comment. An N.F.L. spokesman declined to comment, and a spokesman for Boies’s law firm referred all questions to the Cowboys. The dispute between Jones and Goodell stems from Jones’s anger over the commissioner’s suspending of Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys’ star running back, who was accused of domestic violence by his former girlfriend. Goodell gave Elliott a six-game suspension, though no charges were filed in the case. "
1173,"What goes around comes around, and on Tuesday, karma came for President Trump and his Republican acolytes. From Washington to Maine, New Jersey to North Carolina, Trumpist ugliness was met and vanquished, sometimes by the very targets of right-wing scorn. In January, a local New Jersey Republican politician, John Carman, mocked the anti-Trump Women’s March by asking on Facebook whether the protest would be “over in time for them to cook dinner.” That so upset Ashley Bennett, a 32-year-old health care worker, that she challenged Mr. Carman for his seat on the Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders. “Elected officials shouldn’t be on social media mocking and belittling people who are expressing their concerns about their community and the nation,” she said during her campaign. If Mr. Carman does it again, it will be as a private citizen. Ms. Bennett defeated him on Tuesday. In Hoboken, N.J., Ravi Bhalla became the state’s first Sikh mayor by triumphing over an ethnic smear campaign using fliers with his turbaned image and the message, “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our town!” Plagued by division over a law that restricted transgender people’s access to public restrooms, and anger over the police shooting of a black man named Keith Lamont Scott, Charlotte, N.C., elected Vi Lyles, a 66-year-old former city administrator, as its first black female mayor. In New York, Nassau County Republicans have seen their fair share of corruption and controversy, but Jack Martins was unable to overcome that legacy with race-baiting tactics in which he accused his Democratic opponent for county executive, Laura Curran, of wanting to “roll out the welcome mat” for the vicious MS-13 gang. Ms. Curran will be only the third Democrat in 80 years to hold the post. "
1174,"Fresh off a decisive re-election victory, Mayor Bill de Blasio strode into the ceremonial Blue Room of City Hall on Wednesday with a message aimed at New Yorkers and elected officials in Albany: I have a mandate. A mandate. Mr. de Blasio repeated the word several times during a 36-minute news conference, brandishing it as a kind of rhetorical cudgel to beat back critics of his progressive agenda and potential opponents to it in the state Capitol. He used the opportunity to reiterate the themes of his campaign, newly ratified by voters, and for the first time declare that his energy in the second term would be principally focused on issues of education. He said his next four years would be dedicated to creating greater “fairness,” a focus that has long shaped his view of policy. “Yesterday, the people of New York City delivered a message loud and clear and delivered a mandate, a mandate for fairness, to make this the fairest big city in America,” Mr. de Blasio said at the start. Mr. de Blasio got 66 percent of the vote on Tuesday, far more than his Republican opponent, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who received about 28 percent. Turnout was low, similar to the election four years ago that swept Mr. de Blasio to City Hall. The mayor said that opposition in New York to President Trump energized voters in the city and helped propel his victory. “I say with humility, I have been a leading anti-Trump voice,” he said. "
1175,"WASHINGTON — The election results in Maine and Virginia have energized supporters of expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in several holdout states. After months of battling Republican efforts to repeal the law, they now see political consensus shifting in their direction. Groups in Idaho and Utah are already working through the process of getting Medicaid expansion initiatives on next year’s ballots, hoping to follow Maine’s path after failing through the legislative route. And the outlook for legislative approval has brightened in Virginia after Democrats picked up at least 15 seats in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates and could potentially control the chamber once all the votes are counted. Advocacy groups are also hoping the decisive victory in Maine, and exit polls suggesting health care was the top issue in Virginia, will add momentum to efforts in Kansas and North Carolina. “The results from Maine and Virginia send a very clear signal that the public is interested in moving past the type of obstruction we’ve seen from policymakers in some states,” said Katherine Howitt, associate director of policy at Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group. The expansion debate in many states has been a political stew, with opposition a mix of fiscal concerns, philosophical resistance and stiff political opposition to Obamacare, which made Medicaid expansion possible. But many advocates hope growing public support for expansion and the fading of the Obama era will mean a softening of opposition among some governors and legislators who have long resisted the idea. Expanding Medicaid was a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, meant to ensure that all Americans below or somewhat above the federal poverty line would qualify for government health insurance. But a Supreme Court decision in 2012 made the choice to expand coverage optional for states. Before Election Day, 31 states and the District of Columbia had chosen to accept federal funding to expand coverage. "
1176,"After all the postcard-writing parties, the back-porch fund-raisers and the sidewalk and door-to-door volunteer work, there was always the nagging doubt: What if this wasn’t enough? What if all this suburban anger toward President Trump still couldn’t unseat Republicans in the New York suburbs? On Wednesday, after a nearly clean sweep of races from Long Island to northern New Jersey, doubt among local Democrats had been replaced wholesale by optimism. Now nearly nothing is off the table in the 2018 midterm elections. Republican congressional seats once thought to be almost unassailable are now being examined for signs of vulnerability, with their ties to Trump-backed policies a telling guide. In New York, Democrats have focused on unseating six Republican members of the congressional delegation, with an emphasis on Representatives Chris Collins of western New York and Tom Reed, who represents a large portion of the Southern Tier, for their support of the Republican tax plan that would do away with the deduction for state and local taxes. In New Jersey, the northern suburbs have traditionally been Republican, and are key bases of support for Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance. With Philip D. Murphy’s victory in the race for governor on Tuesday, however, that support began to fracture: Mr. Murphy outperformed expectations in the region, Republican incumbents were ousted and candidates in otherwise fairly safe districts had some of the closest elections of their careers. And in Albany, the election results heightened pressure to dismantle the Independent Democratic Conference, the coalition of rogue Democrats who have partnered with Senate Republicans to help give them control of that chamber, despite the Democrats’ numerical majority. But, one perennial question remained: How much capital would Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City invest in those efforts? "
1177,"If what people do is any reflection of who they are, then Devin P. Kelley, who slaughtered 26 churchgoers on Sunday in Texas, surely was a madman. Before the atrocity, he had attempted to sneak weapons onto an Air Force base after making death threats to his superiors, according to a local police report. In 2012, he had escaped from a mental hospital in New Mexico to which he had been sent after assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson’s skull. A video of the church killing reportedly shows Mr. Kelley working his way methodically through the aisles, shooting some parishioners, even children, at point-blank range. “I think that mental health is your problem here,” President Trump told reporters on Monday. It is true that severe mental illnesses are found more often among mass murderers. About one in five are likely psychotic or delusional, according to Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of 350 mass killers going back more than a century. The figure for the general public is closer to 1 percent. But the rest of these murderers do not have any severe, diagnosable disorder. Though he was abusive to his wife, Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub, had no apparent serious mental illness. Neither did Stephen Paddock, who mowed down 58 concertgoers from a hotel window in Las Vegas. Ditto for Dylann Roof, the racist who murdered nine African-American churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, and Christopher Harper-Mercer, the angry young man who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon the same year. "
1178,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, under pressure to pass a sweeping tax rewrite before year’s end, are expected to unveil legislation on Thursday that would eliminate the ability of people to deduct state and local taxes but would stop short of fully repealing the estate tax, according to lobbyists and other people familiar with the bill. The Senate plan is taking shape as Republicans digest the drubbing they suffered on Tuesday night in affluent suburbs across the country, many of them represented by Republicans in the House. Those areas are stocked with well-off voters who would be disproportionately hit by the elimination of state and local tax deductions. But in the Senate, those high-tax areas are often represented by Democrats, which puts less pressure on Republican leaders to keep the state and local deduction, in any form, in their version of the bill. Each of the bills reflects delicate political and fiscal calculations as Republican leaders seek to deliver on President Trump’s campaign promises to cut taxes on the middle class and on businesses — but also find the money to pay for them. Eliminating the state and local tax deduction would increase tax receipts and therefore lessen the overall cost of the legislation, which by congressional budget rules cannot exceed $1.5 trillion over the next decade if it is to pass without Democratic support. After the elections, Republicans understand they have to pass a tax bill in order to show a significant accomplishment. Big losses in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday exposed their vulnerabilities going into next year’s midterm elections. But in the Senate, the emerging bill suggests party leaders are less concerned with the potential fallout of eliminating breaks that benefit upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-tax states such as New York and California.

arrived in Manus on Tuesday morning, and within an hour I’d met a handful of the refugees who have been stuck on this sweltering, remote island in Papua New Guinea for nearly five years. To many, it feels like an eternity in limbo. I met one man from Iran who got on a boat at age 20 to flee political persecution and now wonders if he’ll be able to study, work or leave Papua New Guinea before he’s 30. I met another who is 29 and who has come to accept that Manus may have to become his lifelong home. Australia exiled these men to Manus and an even more distant island, Nauru, to keep them and others from trying to reach Australia by boat, and the boats have mostly stopped. But there are other long-term consequences that have yet to be fully understood. Both the refugees (and their families) and this island (and this country) have been forever changed because of Australia’s detention policy. I’ll explain more in a coming story, and I’d love to hear what you think I should be looking into while I’m here, which is why I’m keeping this introduction shorter than usual — to maximize on-the-ground reporting time.

1180,"Five countries: Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Eleven days — no, make that 12; the trip was extended by a day at the last minute. And for me and other news photographers, countless chances to capture one of the most famous faces in the world in new settings. President Trump and his entourage went wheels-up from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Friday, Nov. 3, making a stop in Hawaii before heading to Tokyo. The days have been long. Reporters and photographers covering Mr. Trump have generally started work early in the morning, finishing around 10 at night. Then there was that morning in South Korea when we were told to be ready at 5:45 for a mystery-shrouded venture. But the destination — the DMZ at the border with North Korea — turned out to be shrouded, too. In fog. So the trip was canceled. The president left the Philippines on Tuesday to return to Washington. "
1181,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats pressed Kirstjen Nielsen, President Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, during her confirmation hearing on Wednesday about her inexperience and how she would carry out his immigration agenda. But she faced a mostly deferential Senate Homeland Security Committee, a sign that she is likely to be easily confirmed as the sixth person to lead the agency. Ms. Nielsen pledged to be tough on border security but acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall across the entire southern border was unrealistic. “There is no need for a wall from sea to shining sea,” she said, adding that, as the secretary, she would push for technological solutions and consult the Border Patrol and other agencies about where a wall made sense. Ms. Nielsen would be the permanent replacement for John F. Kelly, who was homeland security secretary until he left in July to serve as the White House chief of staff. Elaine C. Duke, his deputy, has held the post in the interim. Ms. Nielsen was Mr. Kelly’s top aide at the Department of Homeland Security, and he brought her to the White House to serve as deputy chief of staff. The harshest lines of questioning Ms. Nielsen faced at Wednesday’s hearing came from Democrats. Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware asked Ms. Nielsen about her lack of experience leading a department that employs 240,000 people and is responsible for border and aviation security, counterterrorism, immigration and recovery from natural disasters. "
1182,"During the nearly five years that I was secretary of defense, 2,621 immigrants serving in the United States military became naturalized citizens while deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. More than 100 immigrant troops have made the supreme sacrifice in combat during those wars. In that same period, from 2006 to 2011, a total of 45,700 immigrants who wore the uniform of the American military all across the world became American citizens. I was honored to serve alongside all of them, and humbled by their sense of duty, by their willingness to risk life and limb for a country they yearned to call their own. I attended a number of naturalization ceremonies for these soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors. At one ceremony, in October 2008 at Fort Bragg, N.C., 41 immigrant service members, men and women from 26 countries, became citizens. I told them it was one of the true glories of our country that when it comes to being an American, you don’t have to be a descendant of the founders or the colonists who came on the Mayflower. What counts is whether you believe in America’s ideals, follow its laws and pitch in for the common good. Quoting Abraham Lincoln, I said that immigrants can read the phrase “all men are created equal” in the Declaration of Independence and feel that “they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration.” The United States faces extraordinary security challenges that are placing growing pressure on our armed forces. Those forces are stronger when they embody the nation’s diversity, drawing from a large pool of willing young people able to adapt to changing threats. That is why we need legislation that will provide a pathway to citizenship for those immigrants who, among other attributes, are serving or have served in the military, whether they are in America legally or were brought here illegally as children. That kind of policy will help the military recruit new service members and improve readiness. "
1183,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Call it the suburban rebellion. It was largely suburban voters who embraced Democrats in yesterday’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere, sending a strong message to Washington about the 2018 midterms and the power of socially moderate, multiethnic communities surrounding major cities. Voters propelled a diverse slate of candidates to victory, including a Liberian refugee elected mayor in Montana, the first Sikh elected mayor in New Jersey, and a transgender woman elected to Virginia’s State Legislature. Our political correspondents outlined key takeaways from Tuesday’s races, and we collected reactions from writers on the right and left. Above, supporters of Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam celebrated his victory in the Virginia governor’s race. _____ "
1184,"WASHINGTON — It is an unwritten rule that if a former Treasury secretary has nothing nice to say about one of his successors he does not say anything at all. But in the nation’s capital these days, the rules of political comity are meant to be broken. Raising eyebrows in economic circles, Lawrence H. Summers, the mercurial Treasury secretary for President Bill Clinton, has leveled a barrage of increasingly personal criticism at the current Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. In podcasts, blog posts, op-eds and on Twitter, Mr. Summers, the former president of Harvard and a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, has accused Mr. Mnuchin of damaging the credibility of Treasury by making “irresponsible” economic assessments of the administration’s tax plan and acting as a “sycophant” to President Trump. The attacks have alternately amused and angered those who run in economic circles, with some saying it is Mr. Summers who is damaging the credibility of the office by leveling public attacks on a sitting Treasury secretary. “For me we have a tradition for people who have been in the position not to criticize current secretaries,” said Paul H. O’Neill, who served as President George W. Bush’s first Treasury secretary. “That doesn’t mean we don’t have an opinion, but we don’t tell people what we think.” But, he added: “Larry is his own guy.” While Treasury secretaries have all had varying degrees of success and influence, those who have held the job generally agree that heckles from predecessors are not helpful. "
1185,"Federal prosecutors are looking into the role played by Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, in advising the Trump administration on regulatory issues that had the potential to affect the finances of a company he owns. Mr. Icahn stepped down as an unpaid adviser to President Trump in August, after scrutiny from members of Congress about whether he was influencing regulations on ethanol to benefit his financial investments. One of Mr. Icahn’s main investment companies, Icahn Enterprises, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had served a subpoena seeking information about “Mr. Icahn’s activities relating to the renewable fuels standard and Mr. Icahn’s role as an adviser to the president.” The filing said Icahn Enterprises was cooperating with the prosecutors’ demand for information. When Mr. Icahn took on the advisory position this year, critics complained that it was a conflict of interest because he owns a big stake in an oil-refinery business called CVR Energy. Indeed, The New York Times reported in March that Mr. Icahn was pressing for a change in a requirement that refiners be held responsible for ensuring that corn-based ethanol is mixed into gasoline. The Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees that renewable fuels standard, ultimately decided not to make changes that might have benefited CVR and other small refiners. Mr. Icahn could not be reached for comment Wednesday. In the filing, Icahn Enterprises said prosecutors working for Joon Kim, the acting United States attorney for Manhattan, had “not made any claims or allegations against us or Mr. Icahn.” A spokesman for Mr. Kim’s office declined to comment. Mr. Icahn’s role as a special adviser was amorphous. Aside from working on ethanol policy, he met with some candidates for top regulatory posts, including Jay Clayton, who became Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. "
1186,"If the 2016 presidential election reflected a primal roar from disaffected white working class voters that delivered for President Trump and Republicans, Tuesday’s results showed the potential of a rising coalition of women, minorities, and gay and transgender people who are solidly aligning with Democrats. A black transgender activist, Andrea Jenkins, was elected to the Minneapolis City Council. A Hispanic woman won the mayor’s race in Topeka, Kan. A Sikh man was elected mayor in Hoboken, N.J. Latina, Vietnamese and transgender female candidates won state legislative races. Black candidates were elected lieutenant governor in New Jersey and Virginia. A Liberian refugee in Helena, Mont., was elected mayor. Mark Keam, a Korean-American Democrat who was re-elected on Tuesday to his seat in Virginia’s House of Delegates, said the wave of first-time minority candidates was a direct response to feeling snipped out of the American picture by Mr. Trump’s policies and divisive language. “In Trump’s America, people are getting screwed and those getting screwed more than others are people who’ve never had a voice in the government,” Mr. Keam said. “Those are motivations a white guy wouldn’t have.” Some are skeptical of reading too much into one off-year election. And even Democrats have had heated disagreements over whether identity politics help the party or drive people away. But David Ramadan, a Republican who served in the Virginia General Assembly from 2012 to 2016 said the warning for his party was clear. "
1187,"BERKELEY, Calif. — Jaron Lanier is the most unusual person I’ve ever met. And I’ve met a lot of unusual people. A barefoot Buddha with dreadlocks, perched in a crazy fun house in the leafy hills of Berkeley, Mr. Lanier is a founding member of the digerati. The 57-year-old computer scientist, musician and writer has been christened the father of virtual reality. “I’m a professional illusionist,” he says. “In some ways, I might know more about making illusions than anybody.” Mr. Lanier is one of the few prophets who admits that the spawn of Silicon Valley could become evil, but he tries to stay on the sunny side. It helps that he avoids all social media. “The popular ones are designed for behavior modification,” he says, wearing his usual black T-shirt and black pants. “It’s like, why would you go sign up for an evil hypnotist who’s explicitly saying that his whole purpose is to get you to do things that people have paid him to get you to do, but he won’t tell you who they are?” At this moment when dark clouds loom over Silicon Valley, Mr. Lanier is able to talk about the Lords of the Cloud with affection yet candor, as he worries that these tech gods creating new worlds may be getting “high on their own supply.” "
1188,"A cold driving rain could not put out the candles in the wind. They looked real as they flickered on the steps of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, for the black-tie benefit for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. The weather and the fact that it was election night could dampen spirits only so much. “We live in strange times,” said Elton John, sighing, who arrived in an embroidered Gucci dinner jacket. “But you have to be an optimist, because if you aren’t hopeful, you lose everything.” It seemed an appropriate sentiment from the singer of “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” and “I’m Still Standing.” And never mind “Rocket Man.” The gala celebrated the foundation’s 25th anniversary, attracting a starry crowd that included Judith Light, Marina Abramovic and John Waters, who, with others, recalled his despair over last year’s elections. But this event, which raised $4.4 million, was more about uplift than anything else. “There’s always hope,” Billy Joel said during the cocktail hour. “Even when sometimes that’s all there is.” Since Mr. John (or as some would say, Sir Elton because he was knighted) started his foundation at a kitchen table in Atlanta in 1992, it has raised almost $400 million. And while AIDS deaths have declined among white gay men, many populations are still at risk, including minorities, drug addicts and people in developing countries. “But there is nothing we can’t achieve when we bring good people together,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo told the crowd of 700 over dinner in a speech that seemed campaign ready. Former President Bill Clinton gave a tribute as well. He said the impressive charity work of Mr. John and his husband, David Furnish, was like a beautiful song. “All our lives are like candles in the wind,” he said, adding that what matters is “what they’re burning for.” He sat at the head table with Governor Cuomo, Sting, Lily Safra, Lynn Wyatt and Donna Karan, and gamely posed for selfie requests throughout the night. There was plenty of turbo-mingling, of course. Glenn Close in a black velvet dress chatted with Mike Ovitz at one table, Susan Lucci and Nelson DeMille at another. During the live auction, when gubernatorial election results were being checked on phones, Alec Baldwin encouraged upward bidding with an imitation of both Mr. Clinton and President Trump. And even though Neil Patrick Harris, as master of ceremonies, did his best to move things along, Mr. John didn’t finish a final, teary speech until late into the night. “We need more humanity, more love,” he told the crowd. Close to 11, Aretha Franklin, who has battled illness recently, took to the stage in an embroidered dress and white stole. Although she seemed a little fragile, she prevailed, singing in sweet, straining and soulful tones about troubled waters, prayer and hope. "
1189,"To the Editor: Re “Democrats Score Two Big Victories in Trump Rebuke” (front page, Nov. 8): I awoke Wednesday morning on the anniversary of the worst day in American political history, immediately grabbed The Times, turned on the television and broke into my happy dance! In the first major election since Donald Trump was elected, the Democrats stormed back, not only in Virginia and New Jersey, but in races all across the country. One of the most striking examples of this tsunami was the erasing of a 32-seat Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates. These results were a stunning rebuke of the president, and a signal to all potential Democratic candidates, donors and voters to redouble their efforts toward the 2018 midterm elections. This was also a wake-up call to all Republican members of Congress that they may not have to follow or be loyal to Mr. Trump, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. With the new facts exploding every day about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, there is a great new hope for the Democratic Party to take back control of Congress and the White House, and reverse the horrible debasement of our democracy initiated by Donald Trump. HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Fool me once, shame on me. But fool me twice? That will never happen. I generally vote for any and all Republicans, except Donald Trump. However, on Tuesday I voted a straight Democratic ticket in Virginia. Why? First and foremost, because I do not like the debased and degraded tone that President Trump has set for our nation and the Republican Party. Second, and very important, because I never thought that I would see the day when Republicans sold out their loyal, hardworking blue-collar workers, salary earners and white-collar professionals in favor of corporate interests and the uber-rich. The lock step Republican support and enthusiasm for President Trump’s shameful, proposed tax plan — a plan that undercuts every single class except the 1 percent and corporations — are incomprehensible. What became of the party of lower taxes and fiscal responsibility? While I dislike the rifts of identity politics, and I do not like increased taxes, if the Republicans are going to tax me more in any case, then I might as well receive the Democrats’ safety net and social services. "
1190,"To the Editor: Re “In a Democracy, There Can Be No Bystanders” (Op-Ed, Nov. 7): If Jeff Flake truly believes that “to have a vital democracy, there can be no bystanders,” then he and other Republican senators who hold similar views on the dangers of Donald Trump should change their party affiliation to independent and caucus with the Democrats, placing that party in control of the Senate and giving the Democrats the power to restrain President Trump. Mr. Flake and other Republicans could make a deal with the Democrats to use that change not to undermine their conservative beliefs; instead, by changing their affiliation, they would act to defend “the things we hold dear”: democracy itself. Mr. Flake, action, not just words — as brave as they are — is required. BILL MITCHELL, NEW YORK "
1191,"To the Editor: Re “Slouching Toward War,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, Nov. 5): If people are complacent about a high chance of a war in which there would be 300,000 predicted deaths in the first few days if nonnuclear, and a million in the first day if nuclear, then we have reached a state of madness. Many are concerned about the state of mind of our president, who has control of the nuclear arsenal. You will hear little from organized psychiatry on this matter, because of the warning to its members that it is unethical to state a professional opinion about the president’s behavior without a personal examination or his consent. Most of my fellow psychiatrists are not aware that there is an exception to this ethics code: the extended analyses of world leaders under controlled conditions of scholarship. Jerrold Post founded the Central Intelligence Agency’s personality analysis center, and I witnessed him speak at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, where he said it is unethical for mental health professionals not to contribute during these perilous times. Earlier this year, Dr. Post, who studied Kim Jong-un and his father, warned in a Washington Post article that Kim’s capacity for brutality and his apparent spontaneity could be compounded by President Trump’s own impulsive acts. Common sense suggests that a small, impoverished country should not be allowed to cause a nuclear war and that the world powers can together use their heads and find a way to prevent this — that is, assuming that our leaders don’t want war. JEFFREY B. FREEDMAN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Nicholas Kristof says the Congressional Research Service estimates that as many as 300,000 people could die in the first few days of war with North Korea. He quotes a Stanford security expert who thinks that number could easily be a million if it were a nuclear exchange. Senator Lindsey Graham then relays a conversation he had with President Trump, in which he says Mr. Trump insisted: “If thousands die, they’re going to die over there. They’re not going to die here.” That seems to be a particularly chilling calculus. Apparently this president believes that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents would be acceptable, as long as they are not American deaths. That may play well with his base, but history might think otherwise. MITCHELL KAPNER, CARY, N.C. "
1192,"Hoboken, N.J., is a city of firsts, its proud residents like to say. Some historians say the first organized baseball game was played there in 1846. The first zipper was believed to have been invented there, too. And now the city of some 55,000 people on the Hudson River can boast another first: Councilman Ravi Bhalla on Tuesday became the first Sikh elected mayor in New Jersey, and one of only a few Sikhs to become mayor of an American city. “I feel exhilarated,” Mr. Bhalla, 44, said in an interview on Wednesday. “I didn’t have any expectations one way or another of victory or defeat, I was prepared for both. And I feel very grateful to have the opportunity to serve Hoboken.” Mayor-elect Bhalla, a 17-year resident of the city, had won elections in 2009 and 2013 to the City Council and twice served as its president. He was endorsed for mayor by the incumbent, Dawn Zimmer, who announced in June that she would not seek re-election. Mr. Bhalla and Ms. Zimmer are both Democrats, though Hoboken’s mayoral elections are nonpartisan. But even his deep roots and prior success among the city’s voters did not make Mr. Bhalla immune from racist attacks. On Friday night, doctored campaign fliers appeared on car windows in Hoboken featuring a picture of Mr. Bhalla, who wears the turban that is traditional to his faith. Above his picture was the message: “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” The implication was one that is familiar to many Sikhs, who are part of a separate, monotheistic faith that is neither Hinduism nor Islam, but who are often mistaken for being something that they are not. Particularly after Sept. 11, Sikhs have found themselves the target of hate crimes that often appear to be based in a belief that they are Muslim. "
1193,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia ordered its citizens to leave Lebanon on Thursday, escalating a bewildering crisis between the two Arab nations and raising fears that it could lead to an economic crisis or even war. The order came after Saudi Arabia had stepped up its condemnations of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shiite militia that is the most powerful political and military force in Lebanon, and asserted that Lebanon had effectively declared war on Saudi Arabia. The developments plunged Lebanon into a state of national anxiety, with politicians, journalists and even parents picking up their children at school consumed with the question of what could come next. While analysts said a war was unlikely — because Saudi Arabia was not capable of waging one and Israel did not want one now — they worried that with so many active conflicts in the region, any Saudi actions that raised the temperature increased the risk of an accidental conflagration. “There are so many fuses, so little communication, so many risks of something exploding, that there’s little chance of something not going wrong,” said Robert Malley, the former director of Middle East policy in the Obama White House and now vice president for policy at the International Crisis Group. “Everything needs to go right to maintain calm.” The backdrop to the crisis was a series of steps by Saudi Arabia in recent days to confront its ascendant regional rival, Iran, and the surprise arrests of about 200 Saudis, including 11 princes, in what the government describes as an anti-corruption campaign but which critics see as a consolidation of power by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. "
1194,"No surprise here: Pete Souza is big in Brooklyn. On the anniversary of Donald J. Trump’s election victory, in a college auditorium steps from Hillary Clinton’s former campaign headquarters, hundreds of New Yorkers lined up to meet Mr. Souza, the chief White House photographer who captured many of the waking moments of President Barack Obama, the president who came before. As emotional Brooklynites streamed in to hear him speak — and to collectively reminisce about life before the Trump era — Mr. Souza, 62, sucked on a lozenge and fretted about the projector’s ability to perfectly display his photos. “I’m exhausted,” he said just before the event began. He hadn’t been sleeping well. “I’d better start getting wired in 10 minutes.” Life as a headliner makes him uneasy. For decades, Mr. Souza’s life has been about observation. Toggling between a career as a photojournalist and a White House photographer — he was also a photographer in the Reagan White House — Mr. Souza has honed an ability to crouch and shrink to capture the details no one else sees. He is still not quite sure why his Instagram feed has ballooned into a nostalgic haven for millions mourning the end of the 44th presidency, or why his book, “Obama: An Intimate Portrait,” which was released this week, has rocketed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list and sold out speaking events from this corner of New York to the Tate Modern in London. "
1195,"According to news reports, Donald Trump wanted the House Republican tax “reform” bill to be called the Cut Cut Cut Act. Alas, he didn’t get his wish, and it was instead given a boring name nobody can remember. But there’s still time to change it! So let me propose, as one reader suggested, that it be renamed the Leona Helmsley Act, after the New York hotelier convicted of tax evasion, who famously declared that “only the little people pay taxes.” That, after all, is the main thrust of the bill. It hugely favors the wealthy over the middle class, which is pretty much always true of Republican proposals. But it’s not just about favoring high incomes: It also systematically favors people who live off their assets, especially inherited wealth, over the little people — that is, poor shlubs who actually have to work for a living. To get an idea why, consider four hypothetical taxpayers and how they would fare under the G.O.P. bill. First is the poster child family Paul Ryan keeps talking about, a family with two children making $59,000 a year. In the first year of the Cut Cut Cut Act, such a family would indeed receive a tax cut. But this cut comes from several special tax credits that are basically loss leaders to help sell the plan; they all either expire in later years or will get eroded by inflation. By 2027, with the plan fully phased in, that exemplary family would actually be facing a significant tax increase relative to current law. Second, consider someone who is much further up the scale, but still works for a living. In the movie “Wall Street,” Gordon Gekko sneers at “a $400,000-a-year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being comfortable.” What would happen to that guy? Well, I’ve done some back-of-the envelope calculations: If you ignore deductions, he’d end up paying a few hundred dollars less in taxes. But once you take lost deductions into account, especially reduced deductions for state and local taxes, he almost certainly ends up facing a tax hike, not a cut. And of course it’s not just Wall Street stiffs who would find themselves in that situation: So would doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other well-paid professionals. Overall, the Tax Policy Center estimates that more than a quarter of the population would see taxes go up, not down, under the G.O.P. proposal; for those with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000, that fraction rises to more than 40 percent.

1196,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief. Even as California declared itself the center of Democratic resistance to President Trump and Congressional Republicans, there was a sense (or hope) among California conservatives that the state had a protector in Washington: Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies. But the tax bill being pushed through by Mr. Trump and House Republicans is testing one of the most interesting political dynamics of the year: Does Mr. McCarthy’s loyalties rest more with his home state, or with fellow Republicans in Washington? The Republican tax bill has drawn opposition from Republicans in other blue states because it would eliminate or restrict reductions for state, local and property taxes — a change that would be particularly expensive to residents of California. In the latest bit of bad news for California, it turns out that the bill would eliminate deductions for personal losses from natural disasters like wildfires and earthquakes, according to The Los Angeles Times. But members of the Republican delegation from California, whose opposition could scuttle the legislation, and who have displayed strong loyalty to Mr. McCarthy, have been either silent or tepid about the bill, with some notable exceptions. Mr. McCarthy said in a statement Wednesday that the tax bill was filled with provisions, such as eliminating the alternate minimum tax and raising the standard deduction, that would ease the tax burden on Californians, who already endure high state income taxes. He noted that the Democratic-controlled state legislature had just raised gas taxes. "
1197,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Trump administration on Thursday imposed sanctions against 10 more Venezuelan officials, including members of the country’s election commission and several government ministers, accusing them of undermining democracy through their use of corruption and censorship in support of President Nicolás Maduro’s tightening grip on power. At least five of the officials were singled out by Treasury Department officials for their roles in recent regional elections, which were marred by numerous irregularities and charges of fraud. Other officials were identified for their aggressive efforts to control the news media and for their involvement in a state food program that opposition leaders say was riddled with graft. “As the Venezuelan government continues to disregard the will of its people, our message remains clear: the United States will not stand aside while the Maduro regime continues to destroy democratic order and prosperity in Venezuela,” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement. “We will maintain our vigorous efforts to sanction Venezuelan government officials who are complicit in Maduro’s attempts to undermine democracy, violate human rights, inhibit the freedom of expression or peaceful assembly, or engage in public corruption, unless they break from Maduro’s dictatorial regime,” Mr. Mnuchin added. As a result of the Treasury Department’s designation, the government froze all the assets under the United States’ jurisdiction belonging to the 10 officials and prohibited Americans from doing business with them. "
1198,"BEIJING — President Trump’s $250 billion in Chinese business deals probably won’t be enough to stop a trade fight. Mr. Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, offering personal praise and qualified criticisms of China’s trade practices. China, in return, offered modest concessions on some thorny trade issues. The two sides also pointed to what they claimed were billions of dollars of deals between Chinese and American companies to show face-saving progress. But behind the scenes, Washington and Beijing are gearing up for what may well be months of contentious relations between the world’s two largest trading partners. After initially focusing this year on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States’ free-trade pact with South Korea, Trump administration officials plan to pursue previous promises to investigate what they call Chinese theft of American intellectual property. Lawmakers also plan to intensify scrutiny of Chinese investments in sensitive areas of the American economy. Mr. Trump hinted at coming tensions on those fronts on Thursday, saying he hoped to address “the chronic imbalance in our relationship as it pertains to trade.” “This includes addressing China’s market access restrictions and technology transfer requirements,” he said, “which prevent American companies from being able to fairly compete within China.” "
1199,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. At first, people talked about the Republicans’ plan for tax reform. Once most of the plan’s reform elements disappeared, a more appropriate name seemed to be “tax cut.” But now that the bill’s details are coming out, it’s time to update the name again. Here’s my suggestion: Paul Ryan’s 2017 Tax Increase on Middle-Class Families. Amazingly, the bill released by House Republican leaders last week would increase taxes, on net, for families that have at least one child and make less than $100,000. That conclusion comes from a rigorous independent analysis of the bill, released yesterday afternoon by the Tax Policy Center. It was one of two damaging evaluations of the bill that came out yesterday; the other came from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. The budget office projected that the plan would increase the deficit by $1.7 trillion over the next decade, even more than Republican leaders had claimed. Ultimately, Congress will need to find a way to pay those costs, and the most likely strategy will involve tax increases or benefit cuts for the middle class and poor. Put it all together, and this bill is a middle-class tax increase. In effect, Ryan and other House leaders are proposing an enormous tax cut for the wealthy and then trying to hold down the bill’s cost by raising taxes on middle-class and poor families. On average, households making at least $5 million would receive an annual tax cut of almost $300,000 once the bill was fully phased in. The situation for the middle class is quite different. A big reason is that personal exemptions — the $4,000 in income, per person, that families can write off — would disappear. The bill would increase standard deductions that all taxpayers can take, but the increase isn’t large enough for many families to make up for the disappearance of per-person exemptions, as Michael Linden of the Roosevelt Institute explained to me. A Times editorial breaks down other parts of the bill that hurt the middle class. "
1200,"On Oct. 21, a body was found off a county road west of Corpus Christi, Tex., with bullet wounds to the chest, abdomen and shoulders. The victim was Stephanie Montez, a transgender woman. But because the police misidentified her as a man, it was not until last week that Ms. Montez, 47, was known to be among the more than two dozen transgender Americans killed this year. Even as transgender people have scored political victories and turned public opinion in favor of more protections, violence has risen, especially against black and Hispanic transgender women. And Ms. Montez’s case shows the difficulties advocates face in tracking killings and other hate crimes. The full death toll is impossible to determine, but by rights groups’ estimates, each of the past three years has become the deadliest on record. The Human Rights Campaign has documented the killings of 25 transgender people in the United States so far in 2017, compared with 23 last year and 21 in 2015. Other organizations, like Glaad and the Transgender Law Center, have slightly different tallies, but the trend holds. "
1201,"I’m proud to announce the redesign and reimagining of DealBook, the multi-platform news group I founded at The New York Times in 2001. More on that below. But first, we held our annual DealBook conference on Thursday, which featured a lineup of some of the biggest newsmakers in business and policy. Here is what stood out. — Andrew Ross Sorkin • AT&T’s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, said that selling CNN to push through his company’s acquisition of Time Warner has not been and never will be on the table. “I have never offered to sell CNN,” he said repeatedly. “There is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN.” • “The culture went wrong, the governance went wrong, the board went in a very bad direction. I think winning gives some excuses for bad behavior,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, speaking publicly for the first time since he became Uber’s chief executive in August. His aim now: to move Uber past the series of scandals that has shaken the company to its core. • Mellody Hobson, the president of Ariel Investments, noted the corporate environment remains overwhelmingly white and male. “I’ve been asking myself one question over and over again,” she said. “Where is the corporate Kaepernick?” She added: “Who else will be willing to use their high-profile position to call attention to inequality?” • Is the country ready for another billionaire reality-TV star to be president? Mark Cuban said that he was “considering” a presidential run. "
1202,"LEWISTON, Me. — This week Maine voted to become the 32nd state to expand Medicaid despite opposition by Gov. Paul LePage, who had vetoed five previous expansion bills passed by the state legislature and has now threatened to block the results of the ballot initiative. Unless Mr. LePage succeeds, about 80,000 more Mainers will be eligible for coverage, a victory in an unsettling year for health care in America. With the Affordable Care Act under constant threat from the Trump administration and out-of-pocket costs rising faster than wages, health care topped the list of the most important issues facing Americans this year. However, Maine and other rural states face a health care crisis that Medicaid expansion can’t fix on its own. It’s not about affordable coverage; it’s about access: For too many rural areas, doctors and hospitals are scarce. In the postwar era, America made hospital construction and modernization a priority. On Aug. 13, 1946, Harry Truman signed the Hill-Burton Act, giving communities grants and loans for hospital construction. By 1975, almost one-third of American hospitals owed their creation to the law. Financing for Hill-Burton health care construction ended in 1997, but one rule from the original bill still applied: These hospitals had to give free or reduced care to people who couldn’t afford services. As rural areas aged and the population shrank because of manufacturing’s decline and the rise of a technology-driven economy centered on urban areas, hospitals struggled to stay in operation. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals started shutting down at worrisome rates because of an increase in financial penalties for noncompliance with A.C.A. mandates, the cost of tighter reporting standards and smaller reimbursements for certain procedures. Since the A.C.A. became law in 2010, over 80 rural hospitals have closed nationwide. Maine alone has lost three hospitals in that time, about 10 percent of its rural total. If closings continue at this rate, 25 percent of America’s rural hospitals will have disappeared in the decade after Obamacare’s passage. This does not take into account facility deterioration, doctor departures or department closures. "

1205,"Most theories for the great crime decline that swept across nearly every major American city over the last 25 years have focused on the would-be criminals. Their lives changed in many ways starting in the 1990s: Strict new policing tactics kept closer watch on them. Mass incarceration locked them up in growing numbers. The crack epidemic that ensnared many began to recede. Even the more unorthodox theories — around the rise of abortion, the reduction in lead or the spread of A.D.H.D. medication — have argued that larger shifts in society altered the behavior (and existence) of potential criminals. But none of these explanations have paid much attention to the communities where violence plummeted the most. New research suggests that people there were working hard, with little credit, to address the problem themselves. Local nonprofit groups that responded to the violence by cleaning streets, building playgrounds, mentoring children and employing young men had a real effect on the crime rate. That’s what Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, argues in a new study and a forthcoming book. Mr. Sharkey doesn’t contend that community groups alone drove the national decline in crime, but rather that their impact is a major missing piece. “This was a part that has been completely overlooked and ignored in national debates over the crime drop,” he said. “But I think it’s fundamental to what happened.” "
1206,"BEIJING — They call him “Donald the Strong.” They heap praise on his family. They fawn over his rapid-fire tweets. They have even created an online fan club. In America, President Trump faces a feisty press corps, damaging investigations into associates and sagging approval ratings. But in China, where Mr. Trump arrived Wednesday, he has acquired a legion of admirers who hail him as a straight-talking politician and business mogul with a knack for deal-making. “He’s true to himself,” said Dai Xiang, a resident of the eastern province of Jiangsu who belongs to an online group of more than 23,000 people that exchanges news and commentary about Mr. Trump. “He’s real, unlike other politicians.” As in the United States, Mr. Trump can be a polarizing figure in China. He has his share of critics, who mock him as egoistical and erratic, and for fanning the war flames with North Korea. But he also has many ardent supporters, which is perhaps a surprising development for the leader of China’s biggest geopolitical rival. They refer to him as “Uncle Trump,” “Grand Commander” and “Donald the Strong.” After Mr. Trump’s visit to the Forbidden City on Wednesday with President Xi Jinping, one fan wrote on social media, “Long live Emperor Trump!” "
1207,"As it stands now, the proposed House tax bill would give the undeserving rich — legatees who will inherit multimillion dollar estates — a $172.2 billion tax break over the next ten years. In doing so, the measure would further entrench the super rich, a class that in recent years has acquired a growing share of both income and wealth. Conservative estimates published by the Brookings Institution show that from 1992 to 2013, the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent rose from 27 percent to 32 percent, and their share of income swelled from 12 to 18 percent. Looking at a century of data in “Wealth Inequality in the United States since 1913,” the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman found that the share of household wealth held by the top 0.1 percent recently climbed back over 20 percent, a figure it hadn’t reached since the 1930s. (Their findings are demonstrated in the accompanying chart.) There are a host of provisions in this year’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that disproportionately reward the rich, but the estate tax is one area where we can see the intentions of its sponsors most clearly. The House legislation, backed by the Republican leadership and President Trump, would, starting in 2018, double the size of estates exempt from taxation to $10.98 million from the current level of $5.49 million. It would repeal the tax altogether at the end of 2023. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, for the tiny percentage of the population that benefits from such immense estates, the value of the tax cut would grow steadily from $1.3 billion in 2018 to $38 billion in 2027. Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard’s Kennedy School who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2013 to 2017, emailed his response to my inquiry about the impact of the bill on households with different incomes: The House bill would repeal the estate tax, Furman wrote, and it “would also retain the step-up-basis loophole that even” President George W. Bush’s The estate tax has been under assault by Republicans in Congress for more than four decades. According to a paper published on Nov. 2 by Isabelle Sawhill and Eleanor Krause of the Brookings Institution, the estate tax currently applies to “a tiny fraction of American estates — about 2 out of every 1000 deaths,” compared with “the 1970s, when there were over 70 taxable estates for every 1000 deaths.” "

Europe’s Crises and the Fate of the West
By William Drozdiak
Illustrated. 298 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95. The collapse of the Soviet Empire left Europe more united than ever before. Most of its countries shared a political (democratic) and economic (capitalist) system; Germany and Russia — the great powers that had caused so much instability in the past — were no longer threats, and the European Union was on the verge of incorporating much of Eastern Europe and creating a single currency. At the end of the 20th century, the view that a “united Europe” was on its way to becoming “the next global superpower,” and the West was at the dawn of a new golden era, was widespread. Could history prove itself any more unpredictable? Today, there are growing fears that Europe and the West have entered a period of terminal decline. How did we get from there to here? How did the unified, peaceful Europe of the late 20th century turn into the fractured, discordant continent of the early 21st? William Drozdiak, a former editor and chief European correspondent for The Washington Post, has written a book examining the current crisis from the vantage point of various European capitals — providing a colorful narrative of how it is being experienced differently in each place. From Berlin, the international aspects of the crisis appear front and center. Drozdiak finds in Germany a reluctant hegemon, unsure how to repair the postwar liberal international order now so disdained by the Trump administration. In Riga, Drozdiak discovers Europe’s increasingly precarious security situation. Russia threatens countries on Europe’s periphery and the conflicts in Syria, Libya and elsewhere are spilling over into its borders. Whether Europe can protect itself — again particularly with the Trump administration’s ambivalence about NATO — is an open question. "

Looking at the results in the election for Virginia governor on Tuesday, Trevor Noah and Stephen Colbert were both surprised to see President Trump distancing himself from the defeated Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, who had embraced many elements of Mr. Trump’s platform. On “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee discussed the need for gun control legislation. She told some jokes, then turned things over to a gospel choir, which sang a very nontraditional hymn — about what prayer alone can’t achieve. Mr. Noah pointed out that after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, both Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey headed straight to Gentle Path at the Meadows, a high-end rehabilitation facility for men with sexual addiction and other issues. Mr. Noah wasn’t so sure that’s where they belong. "
1210,"Sheriff Joe Arpaio used to require pregnant inmates in the Arizona jails he controlled to get a court order before being allowed out of their cells to obtain a desired abortion. Needless to say, he was sued, and needless to say, he lost. (The sheriff appealed to the Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.) So he switched tactics to require any inmate who wanted an abortion to prepay the transportation and security costs, something not required for any other off-site medical procedure. The American Civil Liberties Union took the sheriff back to court and won again. That seemed to be that. Following President Trump’s pardon of Mr. Arpaio three months ago for an unrelated contempt of court conviction, the 85-year-old former sheriff, a right-wing hero for his years of abusing immigrants, seemed finally about to fade from the scene. But guess what? It turns out that we’re all living in Sheriff Joe country now. I’m referring to the deeply disturbing events of the past few weeks as the Trump administration pulled out all the stops to keep a pregnant 17-year-old, an “unaccompanied minor” in federal custody as an undocumented immigrant, from exercising her constitutional right to an abortion. The administration persisted even after a Texas judge ruled in September that the girl was sufficiently mature to make her own decision about her pregnancy. Known in court papers only as Jane Doe, she finally got her abortion on Oct. 25, thanks to a 6-to-3 ruling by the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. The abortion came after weeks of delay, after Jane Doe was forced to attend a counseling session at an anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy center” and as the pregnancy was approaching the 20-week limit for a legal abortion in Texas. The teenager is being held in Texas in a shelter run by a private contractor for the Department of Health and Human Services. Refusing to give up even after Jane Doe’s abortion, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco now wants to make sure the Trump administration can deter other pregnant teenagers in federal custody from terminating their pregnancies. Last week, he filed a wildly improbable Supreme Court appeal, asking the justices to vacate as moot the appeals court’s decision and, while they’re at it, to impose sanctions on Jane Doe’s A.C.L.U. attorneys for getting their client her abortion before the Trump administration could run to the Supreme Court with an emergency appeal. That’s a bizarre complaint; even the three dissenting appeals court judges, in an opinion by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, wrote that “the majority’s order today necessarily means that the government must allow an immediate abortion while Jane Doe remains in government custody.” (The mootness claim itself is shaky: Jane Doe filed her lawsuit as a class action, and she also has claims for damages still pending against the officials who blocked her path.) I gather that the decision to go to the Supreme Court was extremely controversial within the solicitor general’s office, staffed almost entirely by lawyers who are career civil servants and who serve from one administration to the next, sometimes for decades. Not a single career lawyer signed the solicitor general’s Supreme Court petition, a sure indication that something isn’t right in the office. If the recent trickle of resignations becomes a flood, we can assume that the talented lawyers who left their prestigious positions hadn’t signed up to work in what is becoming a Justice Department outpost of the National Right to Life Committee. Even if the Supreme Court ignores the administration’s appeal, no one who cares about the rule of law should assume that this story has had a happy ending. Far from it. What we see here is not an ending, but a beginning. We see the future of abortion in America. "

1212,"BEIJING — President Trump heaped praise on President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, blaming past American administrations for China’s yawning trade surplus with the United States and saying he was confident that Mr. Xi could defuse the threat from North Korea. Mr. Trump’s warm words, on a state visit to China replete with ceremony but short of tangible results, showed a president doubling down on his gamble that by cultivating a personal connection with Mr. Xi, he can push the Chinese leader to take meaningful steps on North Korea and trade. In public, Mr. Trump projected an air of deference to China that was almost unheard-of for a visiting American president. Far from attacking Mr. Xi on trade, Mr. Trump saluted him for leading a country that he said had left the United States “so far behind.” He said he could not blame the Chinese for taking advantage of weak American trade policy. Behind closed doors, American officials insisted, Mr. Trump forcefully confronted Mr. Xi about the chronic trade imbalances between the two countries. He also pressed China to take tougher measures toward North Korea, including a suspension of oil shipments. In neither case did the Chinese make significant concessions, nor did Mr. Trump express dissatisfaction with their response. It was a remarkable moment in the story of China’s rise and America’s response to it, with Mr. Trump’s performance suggesting a tipping point in great-power politics. By concluding that the United States can better achieve its goals by flattering a Chinese leader than by challenging him, Mr. Trump seemed to signal a reversal of roles: the United States may now need China’s help more than the other way around.

1214,"When Hurricane Irma swept through the Florida Keys in September, it brought a vivid preview of the damage that climate change could inflict on the region in the decades ahead. The storm washed out two sections of the highway connecting the Keys, leaving residents stranded for days. With ocean levels rising around these low-lying islands, however, that interruption could end up seeming minor: By 2030, almost half the county’s roads could be affected by flooding. “We know that the water isn’t going away,” said Rhonda Haag, the sustainability director for Monroe County, which is preparing to elevate vulnerable roadways in the Keys. But the task is so costly, up to $7 million per mile of road, that the county may ultimately require outside help. In Washington, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is leading recovery efforts that could cost taxpayers more than $50 billion after devastating storms hit Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. At the same time, the agency is wrestling with an even harder problem: how to help communities prepare for future flooding disasters that could be far more severe than anything seen this year. Complicating that task is the fact that the Trump administration has largely been hostile to discussions of global warming. In August, a week before Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, President Trump rescinded an Obama-era executive order that urged federal agencies to take into account climate change and sea-level rise when rebuilding infrastructure. Climate change remains a polarizing topic in the nation’s capital, and FEMA is caught in the middle. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office warned that rising sea levels and heavier downpours fueled by global warming could increase flooding costs in coastal communities by $23 billion per year by midcentury unless they start adapting now.

Republicans in both the House and Senate believe they can ultimately prevail — though the end result might cost some Republicans their congressional seats next year. But they are not 100 percent certain, and are well aware that the slightest adjustment in the tax proposal to win one vote can just as easily drive off a few others. “I think it will go through, but who knows?” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who was around for the last major tax fight in 1986. “We will have to wait and see.” The two Republican plans — no Democrats are actively engaged in the negotiations — differ in substantial respects but share major elements, such as doubling of the standard deduction, increasing the child tax credit and trying to spur economic growth through a cut in the corporate tax rate. One difference presents a huge political problem. The Senate would eliminate the ability of individuals to deduct state and local taxes while the House includes a compromise that would allow taxpayers to take deductions of up to $10,000 in property taxes. That issue was already an obstacle in the House, and House Republicans say no final plan can survive the House if state and local tax deductions are fully prohibited. "
1217,"“Big smile for the camera,” begins a barbed new song from the dissident Russian band Pussy Riot about state surveillance and police brutality. Released on Wednesday, the video for “Police State” shows three children in pastel-colored masks — a Pussy Riot trademark — who are being forced to watch looped videos of President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia shaking hands. A booted and uniformed Chloë Sevigny tosses children’s stuffed animals into a fire, and crushes others with a police baton. A ballerina blithely pirouettes in the background as lyrics proclaim: “No problems in paradise/We’ll lock them up.” Pussy Riot gained widespread attention in 2012 after three of its members were charged with “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” for staging an anti-Putin demonstration in Moscow at the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Christ the Savior. In the video for “Police State,” the band’s members also wear ski masks, which have the added benefit of conferring anonymity: The group’s membership is rotating and sometimes obscure. Only one member of Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, is clearly identifiable in the video. She said in a telephone interview from Berlin on Thursday that other members of the group needed to remain anonymous for their protection. Ms. Tolokonnikova said she hoped the video would highlight “how difficult and dangerous it is for political activists to spread new information.” She added, “We’ve been attacked several times and people around us have been attacked and even killed — killed just because of political participation.” The video was released a year after Mr. Trump’s presidential victory. Ms. Tolokonnikova called it a “sad anniversary,” adding “lots of people in the United States decided to choose this not-very-smart and pro-authoritarian person who is attacking women’s rights, trans rights and independent press.” She said Mr. Trump “treats critics as treasonous which is the first sign of being an authoritarian leader.” Ms. Tolokonnikova lives in Moscow, where she assumes, she said, that she is under surveillance, but “I’m not anything special in this regard. Every person who decides to be politically involved, they are under surveillance in Russia.” She said it was “something you get used to.” The song’s title, “Police State,” is not just an empty phrase for her. “It’s not just words for me,” she said. “I know what it means.” But she added: “If you constantly think about fear, about being beaten or one or another thing, you will never do anything. I prefer to think about things that can be changed.” "
1218,"Tuesday night’s election results were a major shot in the arm for the anti-Donald Trump resistance and a major slap in the face for all the Democrats who caterwauled last November about how the party had focused too much on courting women and minorities, and ignored angry white men. After Trump’s election, there seemed to be a surge in coverage of these men, like The Guardian’s “Trump’s Angry White Men” and Time’s “The Revenge of the White Man.” Mark Lilla, a professor at Columbia, lamented “identity liberalism” on the cover of The New York Times’ Sunday Review, writing: “In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism’s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing. One of the many lessons of the recent presidential election campaign and its repugnant outcome is that the age of identity liberalism must be brought to an end.” These angry white men — who have shown little strong allegiance to liberalism — were being prioritized above people who have shown an undying devotion to liberalism: college-educated whites (particularly women), people of color and passionate progressives, which of course can be overlapping labels. These people take identity politics to mean recognizing, listening to and trying to satisfy the particular needs of particular groups of people who have very different lived experiences in this country. Objecting to identity politics is just a guise for objecting to politics for and about people who are not white, because as the British feminist author Laurie Penny explained to Salon in August: “All politics are identity politics, especially the politics of the far right. They’re about this idea of white identity, this idea of male identity that feels so under attack at the moment. When people attack identity politics, they are attacking politics that prioritizes or even includes women, people of color, queer people.” "
1219,"BRUSSELS — Nearly three months after President Trump announced his new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, the United States and its international allies are still trying to come up with the troops required to carry it out. The relatively few American and international troops in Afghanistan are charged with training the Afghan military and with helping them beat back Taliban forces. With the militants at their strongest level since the start of the war in 2001, the issue of troop levels has renewed importance. “We’ve fought most of the year,” Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commanding officer of American and international forces in Afghanistan, told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday, “however, at the lowest level of capability that we’ve ever had in the past 16 years.” Since February, General Nicholson has requested several thousand  additional troops for the mission, to break what he calls a stalemate in the Afghan conflict. Mr. Trump announced the new strategy for Afghanistan in August, and authorized an American troop increase of roughly 3,000. Though military officials deem that increase necessary, the Pentagon has also stressed that for the American-led mission to succeed, more international forces, chiefly from NATO members, would be required. For most of this year, General Nicholson said, the mission in Afghanistan has had only 80 percent of the troops it required. He said he had asked NATO members and other countries involved in the conflict to send more soldiers, but, “We’re still waiting for this to all play out.” "
1220,"Opposition from France and Italy doomed a European Union vote on Thursday to reauthorize the world’s most popular weedkiller, glyphosate, a decision that came hours after Arkansas regulators moved to ban an alternative weedkiller for much of 2018. The decisions are a double blow to the agrochemical industry and particularly to the chemicals giant Monsanto. An appeals committee of European officials will convene this month, though, to weigh again whether to continue to allow glyphosate just weeks before its registration expires. The chemical is the main ingredient in Roundup, one of Monsanto’s flagships, but its patent has ended and it is now made by much of the industry. The effort to reauthorize the weedkiller failed to receive a majority even though regulators were seeking only a five-year reauthorization instead of the typical 15, amid controversy and disputes about cancer risk that have made glyphosate’s future in Europe uncertain. Its approval in the region expires in mid-December. The vote on Thursday, which was weighted based on the population of the various European Union member states, was nearly 37 percent in favor of renewing the chemical and a little over 32 percent against, with nearly 31 percent abstaining. France and Italy opposed the renewal; Spain was in favor, along with Britain, which is due to leave the union. Germany and Poland abstained. In Arkansas, regulators voted on Wednesday to ban the use of another major weedkiller, dicamba, for more than six months of next year, including the summer, amid widespread reports of crop damage. Dicamba has been around for decades, but new versions have been developed by Monsanto, BASF and DuPont as an alternative to Roundup. The regulatory recommendation is now being sent to a state legislative panel. Taken together, the decisions reflect an increasing political resistance to pesticides in Europe and parts of the United States, as well as the specific shortcomings of dicamba, whose tendency to drift has given pause even to the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency, which has otherwise largely acceded to the wishes of the chemical industry. Dicamba has damaged more than 3.6 million acres of soybean crops in 25 states, roughly 4 percent of all soybeans planted this year in the United States. "
1221,"WASHINGTON — With their hopes of repealing the Affordable Care Act dashed for now, deep-pocketed conservative activists have turned their attention to a smaller but still potent new effort: allowing private health care to compete with Veterans Affairs hospitals for the patronage of the nation’s veterans. Concerned Veterans for America, a little-known advocacy group backed by the conservative billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, is pressing Republicans to make it easier for veterans to see private doctors at government expense. The group’s voice had been lonely until recently, when a raft of Koch-connected advocacy organizations and other conservative allies joined the effort. That has in many cases pitted conservative advocates against congressionally chartered, old-line groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion that have long guarded the Veterans Affairs system that they helped build. “We actually have members that guide our advocacy and our voice as opposed to a small partisan think tank of ideologues,” said Louis Celli, the national director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation for the American Legion. “We get our voice from our two-million-person membership base that actually use V.A. services and tell us what they are looking for.” Dan Caldwell, the executive director of Concerned Veterans, pushed back, citing the Koch group’s volunteer membership numbers and the influence of veterans in its network. “What, in effect, those people are saying is that the military service of our staff and our members and our ideas mean less than theirs simply because we don’t have a congressional charter and we don’t wear hats,” he said. "
1222,"Performance art is in some ways like stand-up comedy. Both are often acutely personal and both can cause wincing discomfort (along with maybe a few good laughs). But while stand-up thrives on late-night TV, the scrappy, ad hoc kind of performance art that flourished in the 1970s is often said to have faded, eclipsed by big-budget productions. This month’s presentation of the multivenue biennial program  Performa 17 proves again there’s a thriving middle ground. Founded by RoseLee Goldberg, who still directs it, Performa arrived in 2005 as a revelation, presenting little-known artists whose work, even when rough, was visually arresting, emotionally gripping and technically sophisticated. Keeping the energy going has required varying the focus by region and theme. In this year’s iteration, which runs through Nov. 19, the emphasis is on African artists — particularly those from South Africa (Ms. Goldberg’s birthplace) — and the “historical anchor” is Dada. Emerging amid the wholesale slaughter of World War I, Dada was the heading for a series of incendiary acts at various clubs and cabarets — noise as music, nonsense as poetry — that managed to be both utopian and nihilistic. It suggested that yowling hilarity is the best revenge against an incomprehensibly violent world. Performa 17’s participants responded to the Dada cue in wildly varying ways. Among the standouts in the 19-day program’s first week, in various locations around the city, was the quietly grave, thoroughly devastating “Black Paper” by Teju Cole, the Nigerian-American writer, photographer and photography critic for The New York Times Magazine. It began with Mr. Cole entering in natty professional attire — crisp white shirt, porkpie hat, stylish glasses, pressed slacks — and promptly replacing it with the shapeless clothes of the dispossessed. Lying down on a cot at the center of the theater, he pulled a blanket over himself as six screens lit up, surrounding the audience. The first projected image, of a nondescript hotel room, appeared on every screen. A mingled soundtrack of crickets and traffic, nearly inaudible voices, and percussive music — pings, chimes, and a low piano note struck repeatedly — circulated on speakers behind the audience. Soon the front page of The Times from the morning after Trump’s victory appeared on several screens, with its banner headline, “Outsider Mogul Captures the Presidency.” Read a year later, it can be seen to brand him an unwelcome, even un-American, intruder. Subsequently, superimposed newspaper pages blurred, but a message had been delivered: alienation would be Mr. Cole’s tonic note, played up and down the keyboard. "
1223,"After the billionaire investor Warren Buffett exposed the unfairness of a federal tax code that assessed his secretary at a higher rate than him, it was hard to imagine a tax reform plan that would be even less fair. House Republicans have come up with one. That’s not because the plan indiscriminately favors the rich. It’s because to a degree unprecedented in American tax history, it favors the investor class, Mr. Buffett prominent among them, at the expense of people who work for a living, like his secretary. It favors Donald Trump and his fellow real estate developers and investors, who already benefit from numerous loopholes in the tax code. “I wouldn’t call this tax reform,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. There is no more glaring example of the House Republicans’ indifference to the inequities embedded in the tax code than the treatment of so-called carried interest. For decades, the carried interest provision has enabled wealthy private equity managers, hedge fund managers and real estate investors to pay the lower capital gains rate (20 percent, not counting the Obama health care surcharge of 3.8 percent) on their income rather than the rate on ordinary income (a maximum of 39.6 percent). The former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was excoriated for taking advantage of the loophole in 2012, and as a candidate Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to close it. "
1224,"NASA’s new heavy-lift rocket will not get off the ground until December 2019 at the earliest, and its maiden flight could easily slip to the middle of 2020, the space agency announced on Wednesday. The rocket known as the Space Launch System would succeed the Saturn 5 that took astronauts to the moon more than four decades ago. NASA says it plans to use the vehicle to take astronauts not only to the moon — one of the goals of the Trump administration — but someday Mars. Earlier this year, NASA acknowledged it would not be able to make the previously announced launch date of November 2018 for the first flight, which will not carry any astronauts. The completed review indicates a launch date of June 2020, but NASA said it might be possible to move up the launch date by six months. “This earlier launch date is reasonable and challenges the teams to stay focused on tasks without creating undue pressure,” William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said at a hearing of the House space subcommittee on Thursday. “Furthermore, NASA is taking additional steps to reduce schedule risks for both known and unknown issues and protect for the earliest possible launch date.” "
1225,"ATLANTA — Republicans in Washington seemed near panic Thursday in the light of a news report in which four women said Roy S. Moore, the Republican nominee for a United States Senate seat in Alabama and an evangelical Christian, had made sexual or romantic overtures to them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, said Mr. Moore should step aside ahead of the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations were true. But in Alabama, the fallout was uncertain for a candidate who is considered a hero in some circles for his conservative cultural stances. Mr. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, was twice removed from that office for his positions on gay marriage and a Ten Commandments display. On Thursday, he strenuously denied the allegations the women made about him in on-the-record interviews included in the report, published by The Washington Post. And it was clear that many in his conservative base were in no mood to desert him in a race for a Senate seat Republicans consider crucial to maintaining their majority in the upper chamber. John Skipper, 66, a former chair of the Mobile County Republican Party, declared the allegations “total contrived media garbage.” Mr. Skipper said that he would still support the candidate and that he figured most of the Alabama Republicans he knew would probably do the same. “Most of them will not be shocked,” he said, “and will rather be expecting these shenanigans being pulled by the Democrats as standard operating procedure.” Whether Mr. Skipper’s prediction proves true remains to be seen. But the report unquestionably introduced new waves of uncertainty and turmoil into a race for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. "
1226,"WASHINGTON — The White House unsuccessfully tried to pressure the Homeland Security Department to end a program that allows hundreds of thousands of people from countries affected by natural disasters or violence to live in the United States without fear of being deported, according to people familiar with the discussions. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, made an 11th-hour plea to Elaine Duke, the acting Homeland Security secretary, ahead of a deadline this past Monday to decide about the status of immigrants in the program from Honduras and Nicaragua. Ms. Duke ultimately delayed for six months a decision on the status of immigrants from Honduras, saying she had concluded after an internal department review that she did not have enough information about conditions in the country to decide. But she ended the protected status for thousands of immigrants from Nicaragua who came to the United States illegally after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Accounts of her phone calls with Mr. Kelly laid bare the strains between Trump administration officials trying to reduce both legal and illegal immigration — a campaign promise of President Trump’s — and career immigration officials who see those efforts as overly broad and harsh. The internal tensions over the administration’s immigration agenda were on display in discrepancies among descriptions of the calls. A White House official said that Mr. Kelly had encouraged Ms. Duke to make a decision but did not pressure her to end the program. "
1227,"SAN FRANCISCO — On Tuesday afternoon, Twitter added a small blue check mark to the account of Jason Kessler, a move known as verification that indicates a prominent person’s real account. The action was quickly met with outrage. That’s because Mr. Kessler is a well-known white supremacist who has used Twitter to spread his message and organize rallies like Unite the Right’s march in Charlottesville, Va., where torch-wielding protesters marched through the streets chanting racist rallying cries. Across the Twitterverse, people including the comedian Michael Ian Black came down on the company. By Thursday morning, Twitter announced it would be halting its entire general verification program. It was yet another situation that the company has had to make amends on, just a week after the accidental deletion of President Trump’s Twitter account and testimony in Washington on how Russian agents used its service last year to sow discord. “The system is broken and needs to be reconsidered,” Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted on Thursday. “And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster.” When Twitter puts a verified check mark next to a white nationalist’s name, is the company endorsing that person? That was what Twitter was trying to figure out on Thursday. “Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or importance,” the company said on Twitter. “We have created this confusion.” Twitter originally began verifying accounts to give high-profile individuals — celebrities, politicians, journalists and others — a way to distinguish themselves from impersonators. The blue check mark has since become something of a badge of honor, signaling that someone had reached a certain level of importance. “It’s recognition. It’s a simple as that,” Richard Spencer, a white supremacist who was verified by Twitter in 2016, said in an interview. “The blue check mark is useful.” The white nationalist movement has flourished on Twitter, but Mr. Spencer said the platform had been behaving erratically toward his community lately. “It seems to be non-algorithmic now,” he said. “It seems like there’s one person who doesn’t like this tweet or that account one day, and it seems like a judgment. It’s incoherent.” Mr. Kessler’s account — with the handle @TheMadDimension — remains verified. Late Wednesday, he responded to the uproar with a tweet wondering if it was still O.K. to be white, and included a poll for people to answer. As of Thursday afternoon, he had gotten nearly 50,000 responses. "
1228,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — More than 200 people have been summoned for questioning, and most are still detained, in a wide-ranging crackdown that Saudi Arabia says is aimed at rooting out corruption and reclaiming embezzled funds, the government said Thursday. The kingdom’s attorney general, Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb, said in a statement that Saudi authorities believed that at least $100 billion “had been misused though systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades.” The statement provided new details about the crackdown, which has singled out some of the kingdom’s most prominent princes, investors and media moguls, but left many questions unanswered. The government has portrayed the arrests as a crackdown on corruption, but critics see the detentions as an effort by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to neutralize any remaining power centers in the kingdom that could challenge his rule. They also note that in a monarchy like Saudi Arabia, the blurry lines between public and private money make it unclear what exactly qualifies as corruption. In the statement, Sheikh Saud said that 208 people had been summoned for questioning and that seven had been released without being charged. The arrests, he said, were based on three years of investigations that produced “very large” evidence. It was unclear which body had carried out the investigations since the Supreme Anti-Corruption Committee that is leading the campaign was created only hours before the first arrests were made on Saturday. "
1229,"WASHINGTON — Now that the House and the Senate have both released their tax bills, the hard part can begin: getting them in sync. For months, Republican leaders of the “Big Six” working group held weekly meetings so that the tax plans that they unveiled would be largely unified, making it possible for legislation to sail through Congress before the end of the year. But the House and Senate proposals diverge on important provisions that will be challenging for lawmakers to rectify in the coming weeks, in part because of competing political priorities facing lawmakers in each chamber. Republicans originally wanted to collapse the tax brackets to three, from seven, in part to achieve their goal of simplifying the tax code so that people could file on a postcard. That proved difficult. The House plan went with four brackets: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and a top rate that stays at 39.6 percent for millionaires. The Senate bill sticks with seven brackets of 10 percent, 12 percent, 22.5 percent, 25 percent, 32.5 percent and 35 percent but lowers the top rate to 38.5 percent for high-income individuals and couples. Perhaps the thorniest issue thus far has been how to handle the state and local tax deduction, which allows people to deduct their state and local income, sales and property taxes. The House bill limits the deduction to just property taxes and caps it at $10,000. The Senate plan eliminates the so-called SALT deduction entirely, a move that could cause backlash from many upper-middle-class families and spook House members who have already objected to the more generous scaled-back version in their chamber. "
1230,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “You’re a very special man,” President Trump told President Xi Jinping at a news conference in Beijing, showing uncharacteristic deference on a state visit that has been heavier on ceremony than tangible results. Mr. Trump may hope that cultivating a personal connection with Mr. Xi will help push him on North Korea and trade, but so far, the Chinese have made no significant concessions. Nor have American pleas quelled China’s online drug market, which Mr. Trump blames for contributing to the U.S. opioid epidemic. Here are photographs from Mr. Trump’s tour so far. He heads to Vietnam today, where he may meet President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He returns to the U.S. Tuesday, after the East Asia Summit meeting in Manila. _____ "
1231,"Richly seasoned lamb curry, chana masala and saag paneer fill the chafing dishes. Cases display confections like gulab jamun and rasgulla, sweet milk and cheese dumplings. Overhead a television broadcasts images of Bollywood stars. These features so define Pakistani and Bangladeshi restaurants in New York City that, at first glance, such places appear almost indistinguishable. But make no mistake: Everyone has a favorite. For goat pulao, Amanet Khan, a taxi driver of 25 years, goes to Lahori Chilli, on a stretch of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn known as Little Pakistan. The dish is also a favorite at Chandni, a floor above the Ar-Rahman mosque in Manhattan. Go a few blocks east to Haandi in Curry Hill for lamb nihari, a stew of slow-cooked shanks and bone marrow. Jackson Heights, Queens, a few drivers say, is where to get beef Bihari kebab, either at Dera or Kababish, where meat sits on a charcoal grill with spices boiling underneath. By quirk of demographics, taxi drivers will be at any of these South Asian restaurants. According to New York City officials, about 62,000 people in the five boroughs identify as Bangladeshi, and about 51,000 as Pakistani. Of the 148,168 drivers licensed by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission in 2015, 19,354 reported that they came from Bangladesh; 12,536 from Pakistan. "
1232,"WASHINGTON — The federal government on Thursday made public more than 13,000 additional documents from its files on President John F. Kennedy’s assassination as it seeks to finally release the last papers from its once-secret collection related to the 1963 murder. The release was the fourth since summer and primarily includes documents that were released in the past, but with sensitive information redacted. The versions posted online on Thursday were for the most part supposed to reveal the previously withheld portions in keeping with a 1992 law mandating the maximum release possible by 2017. The documents released so far this year have cast fresh light on one of the most sensational and still-debated events in modern American history. But as scholars and conspiracy theorists have combed through the files, they have not yet reported discovering conclusive evidence that definitively changes the previous understanding of the assassination or the weeks and months surrounding it. President Trump, who has dabbled in conspiracy theories himself, has expressed great interest in ensuring that the government finally divulge virtually everything it has kept out of the public eye for more than a half-century. Mr. Trump once asserted that the father of his Republican rival last year, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the assassination, and his sometime adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., published a book in 2013 asserting that President Lyndon B. Johnson was complicit in the assassination, which resulted in his ascension to the Oval Office. The 1992 law required the government to make public the last of the Kennedy assassination documents by Oct. 26, 2017, unless the sitting president opted to withhold any for national security reasons. After protests by the F.B.I. and C.I.A. in the days leading up to the deadline last month, Mr. Trump reluctantly agreed to hold back tens of thousands of the documents for another review, but ordered the agencies to make public everything by April 26 except the names and addresses of people still living. In keeping with the president’s order, the agencies are releasing some documents in periodic batches even before re-reviewing them, so some of what was posted on Thursday on the website of the National Archives and Records Administration may still have redactions that do not comply with Mr. Trump’s standard and will have to be rereleased by April. After the 13,213 documents were disclosed on Thursday, the archives still has about 17,465 that remain to be released in the months to come. "
1233,"In November 2014, the married actors Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka attended a dinner party at the Chiltern Firehouse after the London premiere of “Horrible Bosses 2,” in which Mr. Bateman starred. The Chiltern, an 1889 fire station turned luxury hotel and restaurant, is owned by André Balazs, who built a hospitality empire with his boutique chain the Standard, the Mercer in SoHo and Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, Calif. The movie’s other stars, including Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, were also there with their guests. After dinner Mr. Balazs offered to take the group on a tour, leading them to an upstairs room with a view of London accessible by a firehouse-style ladder. Ms. Anka was wearing a burgundy leather dress and was hesitant to climb the ladder, according to witnesses. But Mr. Balazs insisted. As she navigated the steps, these people said, Mr. Balazs slipped a hand under her skirt and grabbed her crotch. Ms. Anka told the group what Mr. Balazs had done. Her husband and colleagues were visibly upset. “I witnessed behavior by André Balazs that was inappropriate and offensive,” said Mary Elizabeth Ellis, the wife of Mr. Day, in a statement. Downstairs, Mr. Bateman confronted the hotel owner, spitting gum in Mr. Balazs’s face. The Batemans hastily left the hotel, waving as they waded through paparazzi as if nothing had happened. Last week, the couple confirmed the incident in a statement released by their publicist. “On behalf of Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka, we can confirm that the account of André Balazs’s outrageous and vile behavior on that night in London is factual,” the statement said. “His actions were dealt with at the time.” Since transforming his industry with the Standard brand he created nearly two decades ago, Mr. Balazs, 60, has expertly navigated channels of celebrity, fashion and business in New York, Los Angeles and beyond. The son of Hungarian immigrants, he dated the actress Uma Thurman for years and also dated the television host Chelsea Handler. He turned the sleepy Chateau Marmont into a hangout for members of the hip Hollywood set, like Johnny Depp and the singer Florence Welch. He has bragged of employing Ivanka Trump as an intern one year when she was a student. "
1234,"WASHINGTON — More than 600,000 people signed up last week for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, significantly beating the pace of prior years as consumers defied President Trump’s assertion that the marketplace was collapsing. In a report on the first four days of open enrollment, the Trump administration said Thursday, 601,462 people selected health plans in the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov. Of that number, 137,322 consumers, or 23 percent, were new to the marketplace and did not have coverage this year through the federal insurance exchange. “It’s the biggest start to open enrollment ever,” said Lori Lodes, an Obama administration official and a founder of Get America Covered, a nonprofit group helping people get information about insurance options. “It shows that people really want to get health insurance and value it.” The surge in sign-ups came after Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress had repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, warning that markets were imploding and rates exploding. “Obamacare is finished,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting last month. “It’s dead. It’s gone. It’s no longer — you shouldn’t even mention. It’s gone. There is no such thing as Obamacare anymore.” The numbers tell a different story. Sign-ups averaged more than 150,000 a day last week. By contrast, they averaged 66,000 a day in the first week of open enrollment in November 2014 and 77,600 a day in the first week of enrollment in November 2015. The Obama administration reported data every other week last fall, and the first report showed that sign-ups averaged 84,000 a day. "
1235,"It was the statue that never was: a bronze, bejeweled monument to a British queen intended to rise five stories high on the Queens side of the East River across from the United Nations in the 1990s. Backed by millions of dollars in privately raised funds and plenty of hype, the project was more than a decade in development and construction. But in 1998, it became mired in racially and politically charged protest that ended with the project scrapped and the nearly completed bronze statue melted down for scrap. Though largely forgotten, the statue controversy was something of a forerunner to the current controversy, swirling nationally and in New York City, over statues deemed offensive because of the histories of the figures they depict. In the late 1980s, a Portuguese group proposed a statue to honor Catherine of Braganza, a 17th-century Portuguese princess who married King Charles II of England and became, many believe, the eponym of the borough of Queens. In 1992, the artist Audrey Flack won a competition for the commission to create a 35-foot figure atop a 15-foot base. She spent a decade creating smaller models and then a full-size clay figure to cast in bronze. "
1236,"DUBLIN — Every era gets the Lenny Bruce it deserves. Ours is Kathy Griffin. On Wednesday night, Ms. Griffin, 57, delivered a wild two-hour-and-15-minute performance that brought to mind Bruce’s late period, when that comic’s compelling if exhausting shows featured blow-by-blow analysis of his legal battles with the government. At the start of Ms. Griffin’s performance, which included raucous cheers, disarming boos and a premature finale when she fainted, she warned: “I’m not going to stop talking until I’m arrested.” A bit dramatic, sure, but not as much as you might think. Ms. Griffin embarked on this international tour, “Laugh Your Head Off,” after her American dates were canceled when she was photographed holding a Donald Trump mask smeared in ketchup. TMZ’s headline: “Kathy Griffin Beheads President Trump.” Even though Mr. Trump has picked fights with everyone from Meryl Streep to the cast of “Hamilton” since being elected, he has gone after no artist as hard as Ms. Griffin. He wrote a blistering tweet, his wife released a strongly worded formal statement and his son Donald Jr. harshly criticized her on Fox News. While Ms. Griffin joked on Wednesday, “For two hours I had to convince my mom I wasn’t in ISIS,” her stories about the resulting furor were dark and even chilling. As a result of this tasteless photo, Ms. Griffin didn’t just receive death threats, lose gigs and sponsorship money, and get fired as a host of CNN’s annual New Year’s Eve special. She was also put on the no-fly list and became the subject of a Secret Service investigation for, she says, “conspiracy to assassinate the president.” When she asked the federal agent why the government was going to such extremes, the woman pointed upward, indicating, Ms. Griffin interpreted, that this came from the president himself. "
1237,"Randall L. Stephenson, chief executive of telecommunications giant AT&T, said selling CNN in order to push through his company’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has never been and will never be on the table. “I have never offered to sell CNN,” he said repeatedly. “There is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN.” Speaking at The New York Times’s DealBook conference in New York — a day after tensions over AT&T’s negotiations with the Justice Department spilled into the open — Mr. Stephenson said that selling the cable news network, which President Trump has accused of bias, “doesn’t make sense in the context of what we’re trying to accomplish.” Mr. Stephenson said Thursday that the Justice Department had never told AT&T that selling CNN was the price of getting the deal done. Since the election, Mr. Stephenson has met with Mr. Trump several times. But he said he has not, to the best of his recollection, had conversations with people inside the administration about the deal. To a question — posed by a CNN reporter in the crowd — about whether the pall over the deal can be attributed in part to a “Trump factor,” Mr. Stephenson said no. If completed, the acquisition of Time Warner — the owner of HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN — would transform AT&T into a colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions of people via its wireless and satellite services. But on Wednesday, negotiations between the companies and the Justice Department appeared to be mired in politics. Accounts of AT&T’s meeting with antitrust officials on Monday — which Mr. Stephenson said was “very productive” — have differed. In one, Justice Department officials called on the company to sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or DirecTV — the satellite television provider that AT&T purchased two years ago for nearly $49 billion — for the Time Warner deal to proceed. Another version involved Mr. Stephenson’s offering to sell the news channel. Mr. Stephenson on Wednesday and again on Thursday denied making such an overture. “This is a classic vertical merger,” Mr. Stephenson told The Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. “There are no overlaps of competition. There are no competitors being taken out of the competition. There hasn’t been one of these challenged in the courts and defeated in 40 years.” The deal is designed to help AT&T counter slowing growth in its core wireless, internet and satellite businesses while fending off online video upstarts like Netflix and Hulu. “The idea that somehow we’re going to take distribution and content and create something so powerful that it would disrupt Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, it’s comical to be honest,” he said. “We’re trying build a platform that allows us to compete with those guys.” "
1238,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans outlined their vision on Thursday for overhauling the tax code, proposing a one-year delay in President Trump’s top priority of cutting the corporate tax rate while reinstating some prized tax breaks used by middle-class families. The Senate bill differs significantly from the House version approved by the Ways and Means committee on Thursday: It would preserve some popular tax breaks, including ones for mortgage interest and medical expenses, and would maintain a bottom tax rate of 10 percent for lower earners. But it would also jettison the state and local tax deduction entirely and delay the enforcement of a 20 percent corporate tax rate until 2019, which could rankle the White House and mute the economic growth projections that Republicans are counting on to blunt the cost of the tax cuts. The disparate bills show the competing pressures that Republican lawmakers are facing and the calculations that Senate and House leaders are making to ensure passage of the bills through their respective chambers. While both bills share the main priorities of cutting corporate and individual taxes, they diverge on matters of high political sensitivity, particularly for vulnerable House Republicans from high-tax states and for Senate Republicans concerned about adding to the federal budget deficit. Senate staff members said their draft would require changes, likely major ones, to survive procedural rules that allow it to pass on a party-line vote. Those changes could include setting some of the tax cuts to expire after a period of years. A retiring senator, Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, raised concerns that the legislation could add more to federal deficits. “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt,” Mr. Flake said, “by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.” Senators Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the bill did not go far enough in increasing the child tax credit, which rose to $1,650 per child in the Senate version, from $1,600 in the House bill, and would now be available to families making up to $1 million a year, a leap from a current income limit of $110,000. “The Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn’t clearly pro-family,” they said in a joint statement, “so we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there.” "
1239,"Russia’s Parliament approved legislation on Wednesday that could require foreign media organizations operating in Russia to label news they produce the work of a “foreign agent,” the latest step in the unraveling of relations since the United States accused Russia of meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The measure will become law if passed by the Russian Senate and signed by President Vladimir V. Putin. Over the weekend, however, Mr. Putin expressed some doubts, saying the rule may go too far. The proposed new regulation is evidently intended as retaliation for reporting requirements imposed by the Department of Justice on the American affiliate of RT, the Russian state-run TV news outlet that American intelligence agencies say is a propaganda tool of the Kremlin. Last week, acting in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a 1938 law that was aimed at Nazi propaganda organs, the Justice Department required RT to identify itself as a “foreign agent.” Under that law, foreign agents are required to file reports on the sources of their funding and on all activities intended to influence a lawmaker or other government representative. It is not clear what that would mean for RT’s reporters. The law is typically applied today to lobbyists representing foreign governments or state-owned companies, though some foreign state-run news outlets have been required to register. Pressure to take action against RT grew after American intelligence agencies accused it of playing a role in what they say was a Kremlin-directed campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton and elect President Trump in 2016. The proposed Russian law appears far broader in its potential application, covering all foreign media organizations, not only state-run outlets. That has news organizations scrambling to see how it would affect their operations, and Russian rights groups are fearful of another crackdown on freedom of speech. "
1240,"LONDON — “Reality is actually harder to work with, because it’s less believable,” the composer Nico Muhly said in a recent interview at the Coliseum theater here. Mr. Muhly’s first two operas, “Dark Sisters” and “Two Boys,” were based on real-life events. But his new one, “Marnie,” which opens at English National Opera on Saturday and comes to the Metropolitan Opera next season, takes its inspiration from a novel: Winston Graham’s story about an enigmatic, identity-changing, kleptomaniac young woman, the source for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1964 film with an icy Tippi Hedren. “This was the first time I was adapting from fiction,” said Mr. Muhly. “ ‘Marnie’ was so attractive because you could make a psychological profile without the constraints of a real person.” Directed by the Tony Award winner Michael Mayer (“Spring Awakening”), with a libretto by the playwright Nicholas Wright and starring the elegant mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, “Marnie” has high stakes for Mr. Muhly and the two companies producing it. New operas are artistic and financial risks, and the gamble is particularly significant for English National Opera, which has suffered funding cuts and major management upheaval over the last two years. But Mr. Muhly, 36, has built a reputation and fan base that stretch across traditional genre lines. In college he worked as an assistant to Philip Glass, and he has collaborated with pop artists like Björk and Anohni, the songwriter and singer formerly known as Antony Hegarty, while producing a considerable and well-regarded oeuvre of orchestral and chamber works, as well as numerous scores for dance. "
1241,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — As an evangelical Christian, an Alabamian and a Republican, I’m ashamed of Roy Moore and upset that so many people are determined to defend him against sexual assault allegations, no matter what. I’m even more bothered, however, by what Mr. Moore’s popularity says about the sorry state of evangelical Christianity. Evangelicalism is a Christian movement committed to the authority of the Bible, the necessity of personal conversion and evangelism and the exaltation of Jesus Christ, especially his death on the cross. (I’m paraphrasing a definition offered by the British theologian Alister McGrath.) Evangelicals believe, among other things, that Jesus offered himself as a “full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice” for the sins of the world. After his resurrection, he ascended into heaven, and he will come again to judge the living and the dead, and he will reign “forever and ever.” What does this have to with Roy Moore, the Republican running for Senate in Alabama? To begin with, sin is a problem from which no one is exempt. If God’s love required the suffering and death of the Son of God in order to redeem us, we should not underestimate the consequences of sin in our own lives. The world is not divided into “good people” and “bad people”; to quote St. Paul, “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Or, as the Russian novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote, “the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either, but right through every human heart, and through all human hearts.” It is thus wrong to attack one’s critics, as Mr. Moore did recently on Twitter, as “the forces of evil” and attribute their questions about serious allegations to “a spiritual battle.” It is wrong to excuse one’s own moral failings while rushing to judgment over the sins of others, as he also did. We are to love and forgive our enemies, as God has loved and forgiven us. "
1242,"The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said on Wednesday that he would leave the federal agency this month, removing a major opponent to the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle business regulations and unfetter Wall Street. As the bureau’s first director, Richard Cordray, a Democrat appointed by President Barack Obama, has been an active watchdog whose role took on outsize significance in an increasingly partisan Washington. To many Republicans, he embodied the kind of overaggressive policing that they contend hamstrings businesses and quashes innovation. To Democrats, he was a champion of the public, fighting predatory companies and abusive practices that rip off ordinary people. Established six years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the agency has unusually broad power to combat abuses in a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans. Mr. Cordray, 58, pursued that mission with zeal. Under his leadership, the bureau extracted nearly $12 billion in refunds and canceled debts for 29 million consumers. It cracked down on abusive debt collectors, strengthened protections for mortgage borrowers and created a complaints system that helped hundreds of thousands of people resolve disputes with financial companies. Just hours after Mr. Cordray told his staff of his planned departure, the agency sued a debt collector that it said had broken state usury laws by charging illegally high interest rates. “The agency has gotten a lot done,” said Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a liberal advocacy group. “The mission of the bureau and the work it has done is incredibly popular, across party lines, with the public.” "
1243,"WASHINGTON — Uncertainty gripped the Senate on Wednesday over efforts to pass a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut after a Wisconsin Republican became the first senator in his party to declare that he could not vote for the tax bill as written, and other senators expressed serious misgivings over the cost and effect on the middle class. The House is set on Thursday to pass its own version of the tax bill, which would cut taxes by more than $1.4 trillion over 10 years and broadly rewrite the business tax code. But as with the health care debate earlier this year, the Senate emerged as the inconstant ally in President Trump’s pursuit of a major legislative accomplishment in his first year. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, came out against both chambers’ tax plans on Wednesday, saying that the bills favored corporations over small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities, whose owners pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals. “These businesses truly are the engines of innovation and job creation throughout our economy, and they should not be left behind,” he said in a statement. “Unfortunately, neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current versions.” Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee have voiced their own concerns about the tax overhaul and have not committed to voting for the tax bill. “I’m still working with folks to see if there’s some way to be assured as it relates to the deficit issue that we’re not going to create harm,” Mr. Corker said. “There’s other senators who themselves want to ensure that we’re doing something to strengthen our country relative to the deficits.” "
1244,"President Trump appeared to offer his condolences for the wrong mass shooting on Tuesday in a late-night Twitter post, which was later deleted. “May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived,” Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post at 11:34 p.m., soon after arriving back in the United States from his 12-day trip through Asia. That attack occurred more than a week ago, on Nov. 5, when a gunman opened fire at a church, killing 26 and wounding 20 others. Another mass shooting took place early Tuesday, as a gunman in California opened fire at an elementary school and other locations, killing at least four people and injuring several others before he was fatally shot by the police. It was not immediately clear whether the error was caused by a sloppy cut-and-paste job by a jet-lagged president or some other issue. A spokesman for the White House did not respond to emails seeking an explanation. But Tuesday’s tweet was very similar to a Twitter post by Mr. Trump on the day of the Texas shooting. Critics on Twitter pointed out that the F.B.I. and law enforcement were in fact needed in California. Tuesday’s shooting in Northern California was the 17th mass shooting this month, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. "
1245,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • China is sending a top diplomat to North Korea for the first time in two years. There was no guarantee of a meeting with the leader, Kim Jong-un, but Chinese experts said the envoy would have been sent to urge the North to enter nuclear negotiations and to convey the discussions President Xi Jinping held with President Trump during his Beijing visit last week. We also looked at the so-called truce village, above, where a North Korean defector on Monday made a bold dash through gunfire. _____ • Rex Tillerson, the U.S. secretary of state, speaking in Myanmar, called the Rohingya crisis “horrific” and said it involved “crimes against humanity.” Mr. Tillerson urged the nation’s military leader and Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of its civilian government, to conduct a credible investigation into the violence that has driven more than 615,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh since late August. "
1246,"After the financial crisis in 2008, the Obama administration turned one of the banking industry’s friendliest regulators into one of its toughest. But that agency is now starting to look like its old self — and becoming a vital player in the Trump administration’s campaign to roll back regulations. The regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the nation’s biggest banks, has made it easier for Wall Street to offer high-interest, payday-style loans. It has softened a policy for punishing banks suspected of discriminatory lending. And it has clashed with another federal regulator that pushed to give consumers greater power to sue financial institutions. The shift, detailed in government memos and interviews with current and former regulators, is unfolding without congressional action or a rule-making process. It is happening instead through directives issued at the stroke of a pen by the agency’s interim leader, Keith A. Noreika, who — like the nominee to fill the post going forward — has deep connections to the industry. Even in his few months on the job, Mr. Noreika has made the new direction clear. At a meeting with staff members over the summer, he declared that the agency was returning to what he called its natural state, according to one of those who attended. The shift could help revive some of the policies and practices that arose on the agency’s watch amid the financial crisis and banking scandals of a decade ago — and that led congressional investigators to accuse it of “systemic failures.” The recent changes under Mr. Noreika are part of a concerted effort by the Trump administration to unwind Obama-era rules and install a set of regulators who come from the financial industry itself.

BONN, Germany — If world leaders are angry at the United States for rejecting the Paris climate change agreement, few at United Nations climate talks here are openly showing it. Delegates from the largest industrial countries to the smallest island states are tiptoeing around the single largest topic of discussion here — the American retreat from leadership on climate change and the Trump administration’s moves to undermine domestic global warming policy and international climate diplomacy. President Emmanuel Macron of France on Wednesday challenged Europe to “replace America” in financing the United Nations climate change science body, though he did not directly criticize President Trump’s decision to eliminate American contributions to it. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, praised a coalition of American governors and mayors who, in contrast to the White House stance, are still working to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Leaders of other nations, from the island of Nauru to landlocked Niger, barely alluded in public remarks to the new posture of the United States, historically the world’s largest emitter of planet-warming gases and now the only country to reject a global solution to climate change. "
1248,"The three U.C.L.A. men’s basketball players who were entangled in an international incident in China that compelled President Trump to get involved admitted on Wednesday that they had shoplifted in Hangzhou. They were suspended from the team indefinitely. “They will have to earn their way back,” Coach Steve Alford said of LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill. The players, who returned to the United States on Tuesday after President Trump interceded with President Xi Jinping of China, apologized for their actions at a news conference. Ball, the highest-profile player involved, said: “I’d like to start off by saying sorry for stealing from the stores in China. I’m a young man, but it’s not an excuse for making a really stupid decision.” The team said the players had stolen from three stores, not just one as originally reported. Earlier Wednesday, President Trump tweeted about his intervention, saying: “Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!” "
1249,"Many of our loftiest ideals — like love, or honesty — seem relatively straightforward until the moment we try to define them and their baffling complexity is revealed. It was in this spirit that the American philosopher Josiah Royce attempted, early in the 20th century, to pin down the true meaning of loyalty. Royce believed loyalty to be the cornerstone of human goodness, the quality that allowed us to rise above individual squabbles and gather together with communal purpose. It required, in his estimation, “the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause.” This is an interest the current president may share: Loyalty and devotion are among his most persistent fixations. In his ghostwritten memoir, “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” he valorizes the loyalty of his mentor Roy Cohn and complains indignantly about disloyal people — those who “think only about what’s best for them and don’t think twice about stabbing a friend in the back if the friend becomes a problem.” In his remarkable address to the Boy Scouts’ National Jamboree in July, he even singled out this quality from among others in the Scout Law — “thrifty,” “brave,” “reverent” — for special praise: “We could use some more loyalty,” he said. “I will tell you that.” The cause to which Trump desires such devotion, of course, generally seems to be the success and popularity of Donald Trump. This was clearest during his presidential campaign, when he asked audiences at rallies to raise their right hands and solemnly swear that they would vote for him. At one rally, in Vermont, people were required to profess their support before even being allowed inside. “I’m taking care of my people, not people who don’t want to vote for me or are undecided,” he said in a statement. “They are loyal to me, and I am loyal to them.” When you ask someone to be loyal to you personally, as Trump does, what you’re concretely requesting is that they choose your cause over other, competing interests. This is what Jesus was describing when he said, “You cannot serve two masters” — loyalty is revealed only in conflict, when you have to pick one thing over another. Loyal people aren’t just devoted. Their allegiances are durable — and as a consequence, their options are limited. But Trump himself prefers to keep his options open, and his allegiances can be quite malleable. His tendency to wash his hands of ties is widely noted, running all the way back to the 1980s, when, according to a secretary employed by Cohn — the mentor whose loyalty Trump so praised — Trump responded to Cohn’s learning of his own H.I.V. infection by severing professional ties. Trump’s ideology is just as famously flexible. Sixteen years before he ran for president as a Republican, he nearly ran under the flag of Ross Perot’s Reform Party, telling Larry King that his desired vice-presidential pick was Oprah Winfrey. He may vow to end DACA in one conversation and to work to salvage it in another. There’s no clear pattern to his changing sympathies, which means that when he demands your loyalty, you cannot quite know what it is that you’re signing up for. You can’t even count on his disloyalty: In August, he cashed in a good deal of political capital to extend a pardon to Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. — partly out of what seemed, to genuinely surprised observers, like an earnest sense of obligation to an ally. "
1250,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s isolationist approach to trade is rattling what little uneasy peace remains within the Republican Party as the White House pursues policies at odds with longstanding conservative orthodoxy about the benefits of free and open markets. Republicans have long championed free trade, believing that by allowing markets to operate unhindered, nations can boost domestic industries, lift their wages and improve living standards. That view is not shared by Mr. Trump, who has taken a much more critical approach to trade, sowing concern among many Republicans and business groups that the United States will wind up on the losing end of an integrated global economy. The divergence was on display last week, with Mr. Trump proclaiming during a trip to Asia that the United States will no longer enter into the type of multination trade agreements that America has long led the world in creating. “I will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade,” the president said in Vietnam on Nov. 10. “What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible.” In a speech at the White House on Wednesday, the president recounted the warning he had given to other leaders as he traveled across Asia about exploiting America’s open trading system for their economic gain. He proclaimed that his tougher approach to trade had begun to take effect, and that nations around the world have renewed respect for the United States. “The days of the United States being taken advantage of are over,” Mr. Trump said. But despite the president’s declarations of progress and his promises to make one-on-one deals, he appeared to have returned from the trip empty-handed, without any new trade deals in process. At the same time, several of the nations he visited announced they were moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an 11-country trade deal that had support from Republicans but which Mr. Trump jettisoned during his first days in office. "
1251,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has pledged to take a tougher stance toward China’s purchases of American know-how in its quest to compete more forcefully with the United States. So few people expected that, during Mr. Trump’s visit to Beijing last week, a major Wall Street bank would announce it had teamed up with an arm of the Chinese government to make up to $5 billion in deals in the United States. That deal — between Goldman Sachs and China’s sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation — illustrates the deep divisions in Washington over China’s trade and investment practices, as well as the complexities of policing the flow of Chinese money into the United States. On Wednesday, a week after some Trump administration officials praised the deal as one of many that would help American businesses, a congressional commission recommended that lawmakers consider prohibiting entirely the acquisition of United States assets by Chinese state-owned entities — a move that could stop buyers like C.I.C. from reaching major American deals. “I don’t think any of us expected that easing the way for China to participate in the acquisition of U.S. companies was going to be part of the president’s plans,” said Michael R. Wessel, a member of that group, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. “It seems directly counter to the policies he was promoting and, quite frankly, the interests we have.” The commission, which is charged by Congress with monitoring the security implications of trade with China, released a more than 600-page report Wednesday criticizing activities by Chinese entities in the United States. "
1252,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Ligaya Mishan, a food writer for The Times. As an Asian-American born in Los Angeles and raised in Honolulu, I’ve thought a lot about what it means to grow up in multiple cultures at once — my Filipino mother’s, my British father’s, and my America. For a recent piece on how Asian-American chefs are changing the American palate, I spoke with some two dozen chefs and restaurateurs of Asian descent from across the country — many in California — who came to the U.S. as children or were born here to parents who were immigrants or refugees. The details of their biographies are different, but the sense of duality is shared. And for many, that sense was heightened, early on, by food. “When friends came over and it smelled like sour fishy things, it was weird,” said Chase Valencia, a Filipino-American who runs Lasa in Los Angeles with his brother Chad. Niki Nakayama, the Japanese-American chef of n/naka in Los Angeles, remembers lifting the lid of her bento box in the school cafeteria to find little neck clams staring up at her, “with eyes it felt like,” she said. Some chefs resisted the claims of their heritage. Corey Lee, the Korean-American chef of Benu in San Francisco, once threw out his mother’s painstakingly made stores of kimchi when he was a teenager. Now he ferments his own kimchi at Benu — then transforms it into a membrane-thin, crispy glass to hold a single bite of pork belly and oyster. Is this “authentic”? It’s a question Asian-American chefs often have to field, as if “we’ve been sullied by American culture,” said Diep Tran, the chef of Good Girl Dinette, a Vietnamese diner in Los Angeles. More important to many chefs is a commitment to season and place: Chad Valencia of Lasa makes sinigang (a Filipino soup) with local rhubarb and pickled Fresno chile peppers. Preeti Mistry, whose Indian-inflected restaurants include Juhu Beach Club in Oakland, adds nectarine to her chaat sev puri in summer and sweet potato in the fall. “When people ask what region of India the food is from, I say Oakland,” she said. For Deuki Hong, who makes Korean fried chicken at Sunday Bird, a pop-up in San Francisco, the question of what to cook is entirely personal. “I cook Korean food not because I have to or because it’s my heritage,” he said. “I have to cook what I love to eat.” "
1253,"NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson briefly visited Myanmar on Wednesday and urged its two most influential leaders to investigate “credible reports of widespread atrocities” by the country’s security forces against Rohingya Muslims. In a five-hour visit in Myanmar, Mr. Tillerson met with Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the nation’s military commander, and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and head of the country’s civilian government. He urged both to investigate and halt the violence that has driven more than 615,000 Rohingya to flee over the border to Bangladesh since late August. Less than one-third of the 1.1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar last year are thought to remain in the country. Mr. Tillerson called the situation “horrific,” and at a news conference after the meeting said that there had been “crimes against humanity.” And while he said he advised against “broad-based economic sanctions” against Myanmar, he said targeted sanctions against individuals might be called for. Members of the mostly stateless Muslim minority are still flooding into Bangladesh from Myanmar’s Rakhine State. They bring with them accounts of villages burned to the ground, women raped and children flung into fires. The accounts have been borne out by human rights investigators and, in the case of the villages, satellite evidence. A senior United Nations official has called the campaign against the Rohingya a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” And on Sunday, Pramila Patten, a special representative of the United Nations secretary general, accused the Myanmar military of systematic sexual violence against the Rohingya, noting that rape is a weapon of genocide. “The key test of any democracy is how it treats its most vulnerable and marginalized populations,” Mr. Tillerson said in Naypyidaw, the capital. “It is the responsibility of the government and the security forces to protect and respect the human rights of all persons within its borders and to hold accountable those who fail to do so.” "
1254,"WASHINGTON — President Trump got an early start on his first day back from his Asia trip, criticizing his longtime foe CNN before 6 a.m. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he had been “forced” to watch CNN while in the Philippines and was reminded “how bad, and FAKE, it is. Loser!” During Mr. Trump’s 12-day trip to Asia, it was disclosed that CNN is a central component of a dispute between the administration and AT&T, which is seeking approval to buy Time Warner. Accounts of the negotiations vary; in one, the Justice Department urged AT&T to sell Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of cable channels including CNN, or to sell DirecTV, the satellite television provider. While it is normal for the Justice Department to be involved in antitrust issues, the fate of CNN in this particular case raises questions about whether the president is trying to influence the outcome, given his very public opinion of the news network. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump said his administration would not let such a deal go through. Shortly before criticizing CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Trump promoted an upcoming report about his Asia trip on Fox News Channel, a network much more to his liking. "
1255,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Republican leaders in the Senate somehow needed to find an extra few hundred billion dollars. They needed to find that money because they want to cut taxes on the wealthy — and cut them deeply. By the time the Senate leaders had finished coming up with all of their top-end tax cuts last week, their bill was projected to cost more than the House had previously committed to spending. So how could the Senate solve its shortfall? One option would have been to cut taxes a little less for the wealthy. That is not the option the Senate leaders chose. Instead, they said yesterday that they would be getting rid of the individual mandate — the federal rule, in the Affordable Care Act, that requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine. The politics of scrapping the mandate have long been tempting. Many people don’t like being required to buy anything. But health economists believe the mandate to be important. Without it, more people will choose to risk not having insurance. Others won’t even realize they are eligible for Medicaid or federally subsidized insurance plans, because they won’t be nudged to look for a plan. The net result will be fewer middle- and low-income people signing up for insurance. Because fewer of them will sign up, the federal government will spend less money on their medical care. And because the federal government will spend less on them, it will have more money to spend on — you guessed it — tax cuts for the wealthy. "

It was the biggest corporate proxy fight in history. The activist investor Nelson Peltz wanted a seat on Procter & Gamble’s board, arguing that the company should be broken up. He and the company waged very expensive campaigns to sway investors to their point of view. Last month, after a nail-biting vote, the company announced that Mr. Peltz did not get enough votes to prevail. He disputed the result, leaving unresolved his bid to bring about change at a company whose share price has lagged that of its peers for a decade. On Wednesday evening, the fight gained another level of intrigue.

1257,"Back when congressional Republicans were rolling out one unpopular health care bill after another, it was a challenge to come up with constructive advice on how to fix their efforts. That’s because Republicans had set themselves an impossible task with health reform: They were trying to do something sweeping enough to be called “repeal,” modest enough to keep most of Obamacare’s beneficiaries on the insurance rolls and also money-saving enough to provide some extra budget room for the eternal dream of tax cuts. No plan could satisfy all three requirements; as they say in Susan Collins’s Maine, you can’t get there from here. With the tax reform that the House and the Senate are now considering, though, the task of advice-giving is easier. For one thing, this time there is no longstanding “repeal” promise that the base demands Republicans fulfill; there’s just the generic promise to cut taxes that every Republican politician makes. For another, the party has decided not to even try to for deficit-neutrality (taking my advice, so send your angry deficit-hawk missives to my address in, ah, Manitoba), giving themselves $1.5 trillion over 10 years to play with and no inherent requirement to offset any of their cuts. Sadly, despite this simplifying improvidence, the G.O.P. still ended up with a pair of bills that look, once again, like the caricature of Reagan-era Republicanism the party has become: heavy with tax cuts for corporations and the heirs of millionaires, lighter on relief for the middle class, lighter still for the working class, with a complicated slew of provisions and score-gaming expiration dates that have made it hard to discern whether lots of non-rich Americans (including the plan’s supposed model beneficiary, a family making $60,000 with multiple kids) even get a tax cut at all. But if the initial House and Senate bills were flawed, it’s also been very easy to see what would make them better. The Republicans seem to be trying, in their none-too-competent and ideologically straitjacketed way, to cut taxes for two major constituencies, employers and middle-class families, while paying for some of these tax cuts by goring well-off professionals in high-tax liberal states. This would not be a bad way to design a right-of-center tax bill. There’s nothing wrong with going after the other party’s constituencies if those constituencies enjoy unearned privileges, which professionals in blue states (this columnist included) emphatically do. Yes, in an ideal world there would be a grand bipartisan tax reform that gores everyone’s ox, but that world ain’t this one, and the fact that the Republicans are trying to cut the home-mortgage deduction and the state and local tax deductions is a good thing because those deductions are bad — subsidies for the rentier class, benefits that flow overwhelmingly to the affluent, an obvious place for a limited-government egalitarianism to seek reform. The (much more modest) Republican proposal to tax the richest university endowments is admittedly more of a targeted culture-war jab — but it’s also a good idea, notwithstanding the complaints from some conservatives that it’s a tax on academic excellence.

Here’s what you need to know: • In their effort to rewrite the U.S. tax code, Republican senators announced changes to their proposals on Tuesday to address two problems: math and politics. The alterations would repeal the Affordable Care Act’s so-called insurance mandate, which would save hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade. (Our health care correspondent explains the reason for the mandate, one of the most unpopular parts of Obamacare.) The Senate bill’s tax cuts for individuals would expire at the end of 2025, a provision that could secure the votes of the most conservative senators. The plan’s deep cut in the corporate tax rate would be permanent. Separately, we examined every cut and increase in the House tax plan, and what they would cost. A vote on that proposal is expected on Thursday. • TimesTalk today: Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, will talk with The Times about the withering of bipartisanship.

1260,"A Democratic victory in an Alabama Senate race would rank as one of the most improbable, astonishing outcomes in the last few years of improbable, astonishing political events. So, yes, this could happen. The Roy Moore-Doug Jones contest can be seen as a mad experiment to test the limits of Republican strength in Alabama, perhaps the toughest for Democrats in the country. It might be reasonable to say that if Democrats can’t win it here and now, they just can’t win it as long as the country remains so divided by race, religion and education. Mr. Moore, the Republican, was an electorally weak nominee even before allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls led Republican leaders to call for him to leave the race. He’s running at a moment when the president’s approval rating is in the 30s and when the state Republican Party remains bruised from the resignation of Robert Bentley as governor last spring because of a sex scandal. Perhaps most concerning for Republican hopes, this is a special election. Mr. Moore will be the only reason for Republican voters to show up and vote. A Republican defeat in Alabama would jeopardize the party’s Senate majority in the midterms in 2018. Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take the chamber, but in 2018 they have only two good opportunities, in Arizona and Nevada, and must defend 10 seats in states that voted for Donald J. Trump. A Democratic victory in Alabama would hand the party that third, tough-to-find state even before the beginning of the cycle. It is probably far too soon to get a good sense of where the race will end up, especially since it is not clear whether a write-in candidate will enter the race. Recent polls have not been of the highest quality, but they suggest a tight race. There’s a simple reason Mr. Moore is still very competitive: Alabama is just that conservative. Alabama voted for Mr. Trump by 28 percentage points in 2016, but even this doesn’t do justice to the Republican strength there. "
1261,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Stephen Colbert devoted a full segment of Tuesday’s “Late Show” to the sexual misconduct allegations that have been lodged against Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Alabama’s open Senate seat. Mr. Colbert focused on reports that when Mr. Moore was in his 30s, he was known to spend time in Alabama shopping malls, chatting with teenage girls. Mr. Colbert was especially outraged when he heard that Mr. Moore had reportedly flirted for years with a young woman who dressed up as Santa’s helper at a mall, eventually asking her out when she was 16. Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified on Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee as part of the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election. As he had in testimony in October, Mr. Sessions often said that he could not answer questions being posed to him because he could not remember the issue in question. Mr. Colbert parodied Mr. Sessions for repeatedly saying that his memory had failed him. President Trump on Tuesday concluded his 12-day tour of Asia. On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah took the opportunity to discuss the region’s geopolitics. He pointed out that Mr. Trump has not only refused to sign onto the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a Pacific Rim trade deal that he has long opposed; he’s refused to fashion a replacement for it. Mr. Noah said this opened up opportunities for China to take a leading role that the United States historically would have occupied. "

We’re Lisa Friedman and Brad Plumer, two writers for The New York Times covering climate change. It’s a giant topic that touches on everything from science to global politics to energy markets to the way we eat and drive and plan our cities. Our hope here is to make climate issues more accessible, bit by bit. Each week, we’ll discuss ideas, trends and news that help make sense of our warming planet and what humanity plans to do about it. We’ll answer reader questions, interview experts in various fields and share things we find interesting — and think will interest you. Send us your thoughts on what’s working, what isn’t and what you’d like us to write about at climateteam@nytimes.com. This week, we’re in Bonn, Germany, for the latest round of United Nations climate talks, where nations are hoping to start turning their gauzy promises to halt global warming into something a bit more meaningful. Most countries say they’re pushing forward on the issue even without the Trump administration (which has rejected the Paris climate deal). But as we found this week, that’s easier said than done. One of the strangest dynamics at the Bonn climate talks so far has been the fact that everyone is trying to pretend the Trump administration doesn’t really exist. A whole bunch of American politicians, like Al Gore and Michael R. Bloomberg, have showed up this week to loudly insist that Mr. Trump’s dismissal of climate policy doesn’t really represent the country writ large, that plenty of cities and states are still doing their part to cut emissions and that Americans still very much want to tackle this problem. "
1263,"Minutes after winning re-election to a third term as Manhattan district attorney last week, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a celebratory drink in hand, was asked how he would rebuild the trust of voters angry about large donations to his campaign from defense lawyers with cases before his office. “It’s very important that we address this public concern,” he said. “And we will. We will institute sensible, progressive and effective fund-raising policies and limits.” Much had changed in Mr. Vance’s world since his campaign sent out an invitation last May for his last big fund-raiser, a “Women for Cy” luncheon. Mixed in among the boldface names of politicians, actors, socialites and real estate developers on the host committee were two criminal defense lawyers who often represent people in Manhattan. Donations to district attorney candidates from defense lawyers are legal in New York and have been going on since the 19th century. Yet the practice has drawn new scrutiny in recent weeks, after critics raised conflict-of-interest questions about Mr. Vance’s decisions not to prosecute Harvey Weinstein and members of the Trump family in separate cases. The defense lawyers in the two cases were big contributors to Mr. Vance’s campaign. So fierce was the public reaction that two write-in candidates jumped into the race and took a combined 9 percent of the vote — some 18,000 protest votes that marred what was supposed to be an unopposed glide to re-election. "
1264,"WASHINGTON — Tax overhaul, Russian election meddling and whether Republicans and Democrats might ever reach a political détente during the Trump presidency were among the top topics on Wednesday during a TimesTalks conversation with Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. The two traded good-natured barbs as they discussed the era of waning compromise in Washington. Here are the takeaways. As Southern senators who were used to cutting deals when they were businessmen, Mr. Corker and Mr. Warner have as good a reason as any to have faith in bipartisanship. But their forecasts on Republican and Democratic compromise were far from rosy. High-priority policies like health care and tax overhaul have been handled by Congress in way that has been anything but bipartisan. “I know people back home don’t like to hear this,” Mr. Corker said. “But Washington, more fully than people want to think, reflects the country and the country is divided.” Their theories for the split included the news media and activists on the extremes of both parties. “We’ve ended up concentrating too much power in respective Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate,” Mr. Warner said. But, the senators agreed, President Trump has served to unify lawmakers in both parties in some cases — including whether to impose economic sanctions on Russia. “In some ways — I want to be careful about my comments — but there isn’t really the kind of direction coming out of the White House that would typically come out of a White House,” said Mr. Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. “I see the Senate kind of rising to the occasion.” "
1265,"WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers have largely dismissed concerns about how their $1.5 trillion tax cut would add to the federal deficit. Now, some Democrats are warning that the tax rewrite would ultimately be financed by gutting entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The possibility of cuts to safety net programs appeared more likely on Tuesday, as the Congressional Budget Office warned that the tax bill could set off an arcane budget rule that would make deep cuts to Medicare over the next decade. Republican lawmakers have turned a blind eye to the effect of the tax bill on the deficit, saying the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves through increased economic growth. But the party of deficit hawks is beginning to once again complain about the ballooning federal deficit, suggesting that spending cuts must be enforced to reduce the national debt, which has surpassed $20 trillion. At a town hall-style event in Virginia on Tuesday night, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, said the most important steps that could be taken to reduce the national debt were spurring economic growth and making changes to entitlement programs. “You cannot get the national debt under control, you cannot get that deficit under control, if you don’t do both: grow the economy, cut spending,” said Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.

1267,"To the Editor: I’m shocked by “President Trump’s Thing for Thugs” (editorial, Nov. 14). Not by your central thesis, with which I agree. But by the casualness with which you seem to have seen fit to group together and label — dismissively and contemptuously — as “thugs” a rather diverse group of foreign leaders with quite different track records. Do you really believe that Xi Jinping should lead off your list of villains? We Americans have every right to prefer a different way of organizing our society to the Chinese domestic system, whatever our current travails. And when China conducts itself externally in a manner that we consider unhelpful or even hostile to our own national interests, we have the right to assert ours. But your labeling Xi Jinping a “thug” struck me as outrageous. Consider the damage you may be doing by extending this epithet so seemingly offhandedly to the leader of the nation making, arguably, faster progress for its people than any in human history. ANDY ZELLEKE, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. "
1268,"Seven and a half years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and five years after the Supreme Court gave its central provision a stamp of legal approval, America is still fighting over the individual mandate. The debate over the requirement to maintain health coverage or pay a penalty has become a permanent feature of American political life — a debate from which we seemingly cannot escape. At the moment, much of the debate revolves around the mandate’s potential impact on tax reform: Senate Republicans, prodded by President Trump, will include a repeal of the mandate in their tax legislation. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is reportedly at work on an executive order to weaken the mandate if Congress does not take action. Democrats are warning that to do so would be to undermine the health care law and end coverage for millions. The accuracy of the Congressional Budget Office model estimating the provision’s cost and coverage effects is a major point of contention. To the sort of casual observer who is blessed to not follow legislative markups and daily Twitter skirmishes over C.B.O. scores, these debates might look both predictably partisan and boringly technical — and often they are. But they also serve as recurring reminders of the many ways in which the mandate has inserted itself into our national political consciousness, its ripple effects touching not only health care but also tax legislation and federal debt and deficit calculations. Why has the mandate become so central to our politics? And why has the debate about it persisted with such intensity? To answer those questions, it helps to understand how its supporters and opponents view the provision. To its supporters, the mandate is the linchpin of a comprehensive regulatory framework intended to improve the national health care market — and, in particular, to increase the number of people with health insurance. More than anything else, the goal of Obamacare was to expand the ranks of the insured, and supporters see the mandate as one of the keys to that goal. "
1269,"ALBANY — It had not even been a week since the Democratic Party scored wins across New York on Election Day, and already pressure was building. What was Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo going to do about the eight rogue Democrats who collaborate with Republicans to help give that party control of the State Senate? It’s an alliance that has threatened Mr. Cuomo’s own popularity with New York liberals and national progressives, which are demanding that he broker an accord between the warring Democratic factions to give the party full control over one of the nation’s biggest and bluest states. And it is clear that efforts to dismantle the so-called Independent Democratic Conference — either forcing its eight members to rejoin the mainline Democrats, or attempting to defeat them in primaries next year — are building, and with them pressure on the governor. On Sunday, the leader of the mainstream Democrats, Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, helped headline an event in the Bronx district of the leader of the I.D.C., Senator Jeffrey D. Klein. On Monday, Mr. Cuomo’s new pick as executive director of the state Democratic Party, Geoff Berman, went to Harlem for a town-hall meeting and heard an earful of frustrations about the I.D.C. from attendees. "
1270,"BEIJING — China announced on Wednesday that it would send a high-level diplomat to North Korea for the first time in two years, in a move less than a week after President Trump’s visit that is likely to resume pressure on the North to curb its nuclear arms program. The head of the Communist Party’s external affairs department, Song Tao, is scheduled to leave for Pyongyang on Friday, China’s state-run news agency, Xinhua, reported. The official announcement said that Mr. Song would inform North Korea of the results of the 19th Communist Party congress last month that reappointed President Xi Jinping to a second term. Xinhua also reported that Mr. Song would “visit” the north, a phrasing that Chinese specialists on international relations called an oblique way of saying that Mr. Song would carry a message from Mr. Xi. They said the message would most likely urge the North to join negotiations to halt its nuclear program, and convey the contents of Mr. Xi’s discussions with Mr. Trump about North Korea. Last week in Beijing, the talks between President Xi and Mr. Trump focused heavily on North Korea. After he left Beijing, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was impressed with China’s efforts to push for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But it was unclear whether Mr. Xi had promised to take any new steps, as denuclearization has long been China’s policy goal there. “I believe Song Tao will take a very clear message on the Trump summit with Xi Jinping,” said Cheng Xiaohe, professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing. “He will focus on North Korea needing to talk about denuclearization.” North Korea’s KCNA news agency on Wednesday confirmed Mr. Song’s trip, a signal that after month’s of rebuffing Chinese attempts to send envoys to Pyongyang, the government of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had agreed to Mr. Song’s visit.

1271,
1272,"An F.B.I. report leaked in October and scrutinized during an oversight hearing of the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday warns of an emergent domestic terror threat sweeping the nation and threatening the lives of law enforcement officers: the “Black Identity Extremist” (“B.I.E.”) movement. This designation, just recently invented by the F.B.I., is as frightening and dangerous as the bureau’s infamous Cointelpro program of the 1960s and ’70s, under which J. Edgar Hoover set out to disrupt and destroy virtually any group with the word “black” in its name. Today, entirely nonviolent black activists face violations of their civil liberties and even violence if they’re deemed part of B.I.E. The 12-page report, prepared by the F.B.I. Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August, and later made public by foreignpolicy.org, both announces the existence of the “Black Identity Extremist” movement and deems it a violent threat, asserting that black activists’ grievances about racialized police violence and inequities in the criminal justice system have spurred retaliatory violence against law enforcement officers. It links incidents of violence by a handful of individual citizens like Michael Johnson, who shot 11 Dallas police officers in July 2016, to “B.I.E. ideology” and predicts that “perceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement.” This is fiction. Daryl Johnson, a former Department of Homeland Security intelligence agent, when asked by Foreign Policy in October why the F.B.I. would create the term “B.I.E.,” said, “I have no idea” and “I’m at a loss.” Michael German, a former F.B.I. agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice’s liberty and national security program, said the “Black Identity Extremists” label simply represents an F.B.I. effort to define a movement where none exists. “Basically, it’s black people who scare them,” he said. “Could you name an African-American organization that has committed violence against police officers?” Representative Karen Bass asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions at Tuesday’s hearing. “Can you name one today that has targeted police officers in a violent manner?” It’s no surprise that he could not. Mr. Sessions, who confessed that he had not read the report, said he would need to “confirm” and would reply in writing at a later time. The F.B.I. itself admits in the report, that, even by its own definition, “B.I.E. violence has been rare over the past 20 years.” The Black Identity Extremist designation erroneously presumes a broad and disparate group of organizations with concerns about the criminal justice system represent a movement with a unifying ideology. This reflects ignorance — or denial — of the reality on the ground: There are dozens if not hundreds of groups with primarily black members that take issue with racial injustice but have distinct areas of focus, mandates, missions and memberships, and which are just as likely to conflict with one another as they are to overlap. "
1273,"WASHINGTON — The director of the National Counterterrorism Center will step down next month, the Trump administration said on Wednesday. The director, Nicholas J. Rasmussen, is one of the few individuals in the American government who has served continuously in counterterrorism jobs since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Rasmussen, 52, had served three years as the country’s top counterterrorism official. He had previously worked to combat extremism while at jobs at the White House and at the counterterrorism center, where he served as deputy director from 2012 until taking over as director in December 2014. “Nick is deeply committed to the counterterrorism mission and has skillfully guided the nation through an evolving and complex terrorism threat environment,” Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement on Wednesday announcing the departure. “His deep understanding of the intelligence needed to support senior decision makers has been invaluable.” Friends and associates said Mr. Rasmussen told colleagues that he decided to remain in the job for about another year after the Trump administration had asked him to stay. Mr. Rasmussen has served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, and 27 years in government overall, and he has not decided what to do next, colleagues said. Russell Travers, the deputy director of the counterterrorism center, will serve as acting director upon Mr. Rasmussen’s departure in late December and until President Trump nominates a successor, Mr. Coats said. "
1274,
1275,"President Trump’s hostility toward the news media, and CNN in particular, has been so extreme that it is calling into doubt whether his appointees at the Department of Justice can fairly evaluate a merger involving the cable news channel’s parent company, Time Warner, and AT&T. The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division has reportedly asked AT&T to sell the Turner Broadcasting division of Time Warner, a unit that includes CNN, or sell its DirecTV unit to gain approval for the deal. On its face, this is not an unreasonable request. Combining AT&T and Time Warner in their present form would create a vertically integrated telecom-media goliath. It would have the market power to hurt competitors and consumers by raising prices of popular shows like “Game of Thrones” and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT. Smaller rivals like Dish Network and regional cable-TV companies might have no choice but to pay or risk losing their customers to AT&T. For these and other reasons, experts and lawmakers have been saying for months that a merger raises serious problems, and some sort of divestment seems necessary before it can be approved. But asking Time Warner to sell Turner Broadcasting and its CNN unit raises its own questions. Given Mr. Trump’s repeated attacks on CNN, there’s ample cause to suspect that the Justice Department scheme is a ploy to force a sale of the news organization to owners that will strip away its editorial independence and turn it into a house organ of the Trump administration. Officials at the White House and the Justice Department insist they haven’t discussed the case with one another. They also say that political considerations have played no role in the department’s review. But it’s interesting, and to some people suspicious, that the chief of the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has changed his mind about the deal. In October 2016, he said he did not see a “major antitrust problem” with an AT&T-Time Warner marriage. Now he does, and he supports the divestiture of Turner and CNN. Reasonable people are bound to ask if he changed his mind because economists and lawyers at the Antitrust Division persuaded him, or because he was influenced by Mr. Trump’s tweets and public statements. Justly or not, Mr. Delrahim suffers from the same suspicions that attach to just about all of Mr. Trump’s appointees. By firing a director of the F.B.I., by demanding that the Justice Department investigate his political opponents and by attacking judges, Mr. Trump, unlike other presidents of the modern era, has shown little but contempt for the independent, honest judgment of government departments and agencies. In a more insidious fashion, he has undermined the integrity of public service by appointing people to important jobs who have glaring conflicts of interest. He has stacked the Environmental Protection Agency with officials who have long ties to the fossil fuel and chemical industries; a similar bias infects the Interior Department. "
1276,"SEATTLE — Amazon and the tax man are back at it again. For years, the company and state governments scuffled over Amazon’s resistance to charging state sales tax, which helped keep prices low on its e-commerce site and angered politicians and other retailers. Eventually, Amazon began adding the tax in states across the country. But there was a loophole. Amazon added the tax only when the item came from its own inventory, not from the millions of independent merchants who sell products through Amazon’s website. Amazon left it up to those sellers — who account for half of all items sold on the site — to collect sales tax on their own. But, according to sellers, tax lawyers and accountants who work with them, most do not. Now states, thirsty for the millions of dollars in unpaid sales taxes revenue, are coming for their money. Amazon recently warned its sellers that the company, as of Jan. 1, would be collecting sales tax from merchants who ship orders to its home state, Washington, as it seeks to comply with a state law signed in July. That will be the first time Amazon has collected a state sales tax for the merchants known as marketplace sellers on its site. It is a grudging concession by the online retail giant. In South Carolina, the company is fighting an effort by the state’s Department of Revenue to use existing laws to force Amazon to collect tax on marketplace sales. The state is arguing that Amazon owes it $57 million in such taxes from last year. A judge’s decision in the case is pending. Other states are going after Amazon’s sellers, a much less powerful target, for unpaid sales taxes. In Massachusetts, a judge in late September ordered Amazon to give the state information about merchants who stored goods in the state. Sellers have reported receiving letters from tax investigators in California, too. "
1277,"It is so hard to be a billionaire these days! A new yacht can cost $300 million. And you wouldn’t believe what a pastry chef earns — and if you hire just one, to work weekdays, how can you possibly survive on weekends? The investment income on, say, a $4 billion fortune is a mere $1 million a day, which makes it tough to scrounge by with today’s rising prices. Why, some wealthy folks don’t even have a home in the Caribbean and on vacation are stuck brooding in hotel suites: They’re practically homeless! Fortunately, President Trump and the Republicans are coming along with some desperately needed tax relief for billionaires. Thank God for this lifeline to struggling tycoons. And it’s carefully crafted to focus the benefits on the truly deserving — the affluent who earn their tax breaks with savvy investments in politicians. For example, eliminating the estate tax would help the roughly 5,500 Americans who now owe this tax each year, one-fifth of 1 percent of all Americans who die annually. Ending the tax would help upstanding people like the Trumps who owe their financial success to brilliant life choices, such as picking the uterus in which they were conceived. Now it’s fair to complain that the tax plan over all doesn’t give needy billionaires quite as much as they deserve. For example, the top 1 percent receive only a bit more than 25 percent of the total tax cuts in the Senate bill, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. "
1278,"A year ago, I was finalizing plans to leave a chemical engineering Ph.D. program and join the tech sector. But as Inauguration Day approached, I became so disgusted by President-elect Donald Trump’s behavior that I felt it would have been negligent to remain a bystander. So I traveled from Baltimore to join hundreds of thousands of protesters at counterdemonstrations around Mr. Trump’s swearing-in. Little did I know that I would be swept up into a legal nightmare that demonstrates how prosecutors intimidate and manipulate defendants into giving up their rights. Minutes after I got to downtown Washington on Jan. 20, police officers used pepper spray, “sting-ball” grenades and flailing batons to sweep up an entire city block in a mass-arrest tactic known as “kettling.” I was among the more than 230 people confined at 12th and L Streets with no access to food, water or bathrooms for up to eight hours. That much can be gleaned from public legal filings connected to our criminal prosecutions, as well as a lawsuit filed on behalf of me and three other plaintiffs by the American Civil Liberties Union. (One of this case’s many paradoxes is that I’ve been advised not to talk publicly about what happened before my arrest.) Next, prosecutors at the United States Attorney’s Office in Washington took the highly unusual step of indicting more than 200 of those arrested. Most of the people in the group, which includes journalists, legal observers and volunteer medics, face charges of engaging in a riot, inciting a riot, conspiracy to riot and property damage. In addition to seizing the contents of at least 100 cellphones, prosecutors secured broad warrants for Facebook pages and records relating to a political organizing website. "
1279,"WASHINGTON — President Trump marked his return from a five-country tour of Asia by recounting on Wednesday its “tremendous success” and that of his other trips abroad. Deterred only by a struggle to quench his thirst, Mr. Trump listed numerous achievements against terrorism and for United States workers in claiming that “America is back.” But some of those statements don’t hold much water. Here’s an assessment. In detailing his May trip to Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump said he spoke about “our strategy to defeat terrorists by stripping them of financing, territory and ideological support” and urged Arab states to drive terrorists from their societies. It is true that the Islamic State has lost significant territory, including its de facto capital in Syria, “since that time,” as Mr. Trump said. But the extremist group had begun losing territory well before Mr. Trump’s trip to Riyadh, and he has largely kept to plans laid out under President Barack Obama. After repeatedly criticizing other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for not paying their fair share to the military alliance, Mr. Trump has since claimed credit for changing the trend. He said on Wednesday that “NATO, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.” Under NATO guidelines, member states agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product to the organization’s defense efforts, but few nations actually do so. The secretary general of the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said in July that five countries contributed at least 2 percent of their G.D.P. He said he expected Romania to reach the benchmark this year, and Latvia and Lithuania to next year. "
1280,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. House Republicans are poised to pass their $1.4 trillion tax cut bill on Thursday, but the Senate version of the bill is encountering significant roadblocks. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, came out against the plan, saying that it favored corporations over other businesses. Three other Republican senators voiced concerns. This evening, our director of live journalism discussed the withering of bipartisanship with Senators Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, at the Newseum in Washington. You can watch video of the entire conversation here. _____ "
1281,"Donald Trump is back from Asia. What do you think he’ll be doing next? A) Pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey. B) Urging Congress to pass a clean, simple, middle-class-friendly tax bill. C) Pardoning Sean Hannity. The answer is A, obviously. Turkey gets a reprieve on Tuesday. And rumors that the president has ordered the execution of all turkeys previously pardoned by Barack Obama are not true. It was a joke on a website. Stop telling people that! But about the tax bill — things are getting a whole lot grislier than they are on the turkey front. Republicans desperately need to pass some kind of tax cuts, just to prove their majority is capable of doing something more exciting than renaming post offices. Voting starts this week, but now they’ve really muddied up the game. People, if you were advising the Republicans on how to get a tax bill passed despite their infinitesimal majority in the Senate, would you suggest they: A) Get Roy Moore to endorse it. B) Add an assault on Obamacare. C) Get rid of the part where you raise taxes on teachers who buy supplies for their classes. O.K., you’re a terrible politician. Republican leaders thought carefully and decided the best strategy was to attack Obamacare. Which worked so well for them last time around. "
1282,"Time Inc. is said to be in talks to sell itself to the Meredith Corporation, in a deal backed by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers known for supporting conservative causes. Talks between Time Inc., the publisher of Time and People, and Meredith, the publisher of Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens, fizzled this year. The new round of negotiations, motivated by the surprise entry of the Kochs, could lead to a quick deal, according to people involved in the discussions. The Kochs have tentatively agreed to back Meredith’s offer with an equity injection of more than $500 million, the people with knowledge of the talks said. A spokesman for the brothers’ business, Koch Industries, declined to comment on Wednesday. Time Inc. also declined to comment. Meredith did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have been negotiating over the past several days, and Meredith is reviewing the latest Time Inc. financial information. Although it is unclear whether the proposed deal will reach fruition, both sides hope to move quickly enough to be able to announce a transaction soon after Thanksgiving. "
1283,"Like the best mimics, John Leguizamo administers large but precisely calibrated doses of exaggeration to make his impersonations pop. In “Latin History for Morons,” a panoptic survey of two millenniums of oppression in the Americas, he tosses off dozens of quick character sketches that feel exactly as true as they are likely inaccurate. I rather doubt, for instance, that his prissy, nail-filing Moctezuma has any basis in fact. But who cares whether the Aztec emperor really lisped at Cortés, “You leave me no choice ’cause you’re so butch”? What matters is that the laughs are real, in this case suggesting familiarity with the accommodations that proud people make to an overwhelming force. And so it is with almost every character brought to life in Mr. Leguizamo’s long and often hilarious parade of injustice, stretching from Peru under the Inca to Texas under Trump. At their best, his jokes get at something deep, whether he is serving up a Rat Pack Christopher Columbus, a French poodle de Tocqueville, a sassy, cross-dressing Cuban-American Civil War soldier or a deaf uncle with an idiosyncratic way of signing. If only the character at the center of this frenetic one-man show were as convincing. But for the first time in his solo Broadway career, which began with “Freak” in 1998 and reached peaks with “Sexaholix” in 2001 and “Ghetto Klown” in 2011, Mr. Leguizamo is unable to make a convincing cartoon of himself. That’s a big problem in a show that, more than the others, depends on our buying an unlikely conceit that’s presented as fact. When an eighth-grade schoolmate slurs his son as a “beaner” — a Mexican, that is, though Mr. Leguizamo is Colombian — he gives himself the task of buttressing the boy’s Latino pride with a look at the empires and achievements left out of the textbooks. “Latin History for Morons,” which opened on Wednesday evening, is supposedly the record of his research and self-re-education. So on a book-strewn classroom set by Rachel Hauck, the play intercuts cockeyed lectures about the past — from the decimation of the Taíno to the Trail of Tears — with an unlikely current-day family drama. "
1284,"In this year’s Editorial Cartoon Contest, more than 800 students submitted cartoons on issues that matter to them — from immigration and gun violence to Harvey Weinstein and standardized testing. You can see the eight winners, 12 runners-up and 22 honorable mentions here. But one topic — one individual, in fact — dominated this year’s submissions: President Trump. By our count, over 40 percent of all submissions included an image of Mr. Trump or his tweets. Students were clearly excited to try their wit in making a commentary on the president’s actions, whether they focused on his exchanging insults with North Korea’s president, calling climate change a hoax, throwing paper towel rolls in Puerto Rico, or grumbling about national anthem protests. But as judges, we also regretted the president’s overwhelming presence in this year’s contest since we worried that it pushed other issues important to young people aside. One of the challenges students have to confront in our editorial cartoon contest is how to make a point, or prompt a realization, primarily through a visual illustration. Though the artistic ability of our 42 finalists varies widely, their skill at providing insightful commentary or criticism does not. You’ll notice, if you scroll through the wonderful collection, that any deficits in artistic ability are more than made up for in cleverness and originality of message and execution. Thank you to all the students who participated in this year’s editorial cartoon contest, and to the teachers who helped. We run student contests all year, so visit our 2017-18 contest calendar to learn more. "
1285,"After nearly 100 applications to renew permits that let immigrants stay and work in the United States legally were rejected because they had been delayed in the mail, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services agency last week said nothing could be done; the decisions were final. But on Wednesday, the agency reversed its position. In light of the delays, it agreed to allow those rejected because of mail delays to resubmit their renewals for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The Department of Homeland Security’s acting director, Elaine C. Duke, told the immigration agency to allow applicants to resubmit their paperwork if they have proof that they mailed their renewal in a timely manner and that the reason it missed the Oct. 5 deadline was because of Postal Service delays. Homeland Security issued the guideline in a statement Wednesday night. Immigration advocates and elected officials were pleased with the turnabout. “We’re glad to see U.S.C.I.S. do the right thing by accepting these applications,” said Camille Mackler, the director of legal immigration policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, an immigrant advocacy group. “This news will come as a huge relief to DACA recipients who had been living with enormous anxiety for weeks now.” The rejection of the delayed applications was reported by The New York Times last week. At least 74 applications from the New York area and Chicago were known to have been rejected as a result of mail problems in Chicago, for which the Postal Service took responsibility. The immigration agency said it was “not responsible” for mail delays. In New York, lawyers reported that 18 out of 34 applications had actually arrived at the Chicago location on Oct. 5, according to postal receipts, and yet they were not accepted by the immigration agency until the next day. "
1286,"We all beat ourselves up from time to time. But Elliot took that phenomenon to a brutal new level this week on “Mr. Robot,” throwing himself down stairs and into walls as he worked through the stages of grappling with your alter ego. Season 3 has been largely about denial, as Elliot and Mr. Robot have each thought he could function independently from, or even thwart, the other. Wednesday brought lots of anger in the form of self-abuse, before moving on to bargaining. Help me, Elliot wrote in a message to Mr. Robot. “You’re being played.” Of course at that point Elliot didn’t realize that he had been played, too. Or rather in addition to the way he had already been played, but as his other half. (Yeah I agree — this is confusing.) Because the true goal of Stage 2 turned out to be not the New York recovery building, but at least 71 other E Corp facilities that were targeted in a coordinated Dark Army attack, killing thousands. Which is to say: Everyone was played, by Whiterose and her minions. Angela, so concerned about evacuating the New York E Corp employees, now finds herself an accomplice to an even greater slaughter. Tyrell Wellick is in custody, forced to abandon his Ukrainian dreams and godly aspirations and instead play the chump in New York. Phillip Price’s global currency scheme would seem doomed now that E Corp’s vulnerability has been demonstrated on such a grand scale. Whiterose’s slap on the hand turned out to be more of a hammer to the jaw. For Elliot, the Dark Army blitz is the final confirmation that “your revolution,” as Angela put it, is totally out of his hands. Even after he accepted that Mr. Robot had been working against him, Elliot still believed that he had the ability to counteract the efforts to push it farther, jeopardizing lives. He believed he had forestalled it, in fact, until he realized that he’d been duped. "
1287,"WASHINGTON — Another woman went on national television this week to press her case of sexual assault by a powerful figure. But the accused was not Roy S. Moore or Harvey Weinstein or Donald J. Trump. It was Bill Clinton. “I feel like people are starting to believe and realize that I was truly sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton,” Juanita Broaddrick said on Fox News nearly two decades after first going public with her story. “All victims matter. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican. Who cares if you’re straight or you’re gay, or if you believe in God or not. We all have a right to be believed.” The cultural conversation about women, power and sexual misconduct that has consumed the United States in recent weeks has now raised a question that is eagerly promoted by those on the political right just as it discomfits those on the political left: What about Bill? While Fox News and other conservative outlets revive years-old charges against Mr. Clinton to accuse Mr. Moore’s critics of hypocrisy, some liberals say it may be time to rethink their defense of the 42nd president. Matthew Yglesias, a liberal blogger who once worked at the Center for American Progress, a pillar of the Clinton political world, wrote on Vox.com on Wednesday that “I think we got it wrong” by defending Mr. Clinton in the 1990s and that he should have resigned. Chris Hayes, the liberal MSNBC host, said on Twitter that “Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.” Caitlin Flanagan, a social critic who calls herself a “lifelong Democrat, an enemy of machine feminism and a sexual assault survivor,” wrote on The Atlantic’s website that “the Democratic Party needs to make its own reckoning of the way it protected Bill Clinton.” Michelle Goldberg wrote a New York Times column headlined, “I Believe Juanita.” David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official, said Monica S. Lewinsky “deserves an apology from many of us she has never received.” The emerging revisionism may influence a historical legacy that Mr. Clinton and his allies have spent the past 17 years scrubbing of scandal. Despite his impeachment on perjury and obstruction for covering up sexual liaisons with Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Clinton until lately had made progress in framing the national memory of his presidency as a time of peace and prosperity. "
1288,"WASHINGTON — President Trump boasted on Wednesday that nearly 10 months of his “America First” foreign policy had restored strength and respect to the United States on the world stage after years of what he called failed leadership under his predecessors. Hours after returning home from a 12-day, five-country excursion to Asia with few concrete achievements, Mr. Trump made no significant announcements in a speech that he had hyped on Twitter as “a major statement” to be delivered upon his return. Mr. Trump nonetheless declared the trip a resounding success, saying that he had made real progress by uniting the world against North Korea and insisting on reciprocal trade from Asian nations. “America’s renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now,” he said. “This is exactly what the world saw: a strong, proud and confident America.” The speech also provided a made-for-Twitter moment in which a clearly parched president interrupted his broadcast to reach for a bottle of water, struggling until an aide told him where to look. And when he finished speaking, Mr. Trump ignored questions from journalists seeking comment on the sexual assault scandal swirling around Roy S. Moore of Alabama, the Republican nominee for Senate in a special election next month. Announced with little notice and delivered midafternoon from the Diplomatic Room of the White House, the president’s speech was designed to be what his critics have never offered him: a sweeping and positive assessment of his own performance as the nation’s commander in chief and top diplomat. "
1289,"WASHINGTON — Sometimes, you just get thirsty. Never mind that you’re on national television, having hyped a midafternoon speech. Or that you’re the president of the United States, delivering the remarks from the Diplomatic Room in the White House. And just set aside for a moment your past, snarky criticism of other politicians for sneaking a sip during a speech. Whether any of that went through President Trump’s mind or not during an address to the nation on Wednesday afternoon, he clearly was parched. And so he stopped, after speaking for about 11 minutes, reaching down to his left for the water he expected to be there. He came up dry. “They don’t have water. That’s O.K.,” the president said, taking about a 20-second pause from his remarks extolling his own achievements during his recent visit to Japan. “What? No, it’s O.K.” Flummoxed for a moment, an aide told him to look on the other side, and he finally found his refreshment. The big swig from the iconic, squarish Fiji Water bottle seemed to hit the spot, and Mr. Trump continued delivering his remarks on the success of his “America First” foreign policy. He no doubt hoped that the interruption would not detract from his message. Twitter had other ideas. The medium that Mr. Trump has long embraced was quick to poke fun — and to note the irony. It was not that long ago, after all, that Mr. Trump, then just a real estate tycoon and reality TV star, mocked Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, for a similar television water episode during a State of the Union response in 2013. At the time, Mr. Trump did not give Mr. Rubio any benefit of the doubt. He also frequently raised the issue of Mr. Rubio’s parched-mouth moment when the two of them were running against each other for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Now, having been likewise afflicted, the president may know what Mr. Rubio felt like at the time. One person who noticed? Mr. Rubio, who took a mild, good-humored shot at his onetime rival. Mr. Trump continued to take a few sips of the water throughout the rest of the speech on Wednesday, though none interrupted his rhythm quite like the initial search for the water bottle. But everything a president does reverberates far and wide, and a made-for-television gaffe like the water episode is no exception. Within seconds, the Wikipedia page for Fiji Water was edited by someone to include the fact that the water is “the official thirst quencher of Donald Trump.” It was removed a few minutes later. "
1290,"GADSDEN, Ala. — Alabama’s increasingly bizarre Senate race was convulsed again as four more women came forward on Wednesday to describe encounters with the Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, and Mr. Moore’s campaign sharply questioned the credibility of another accuser. The newest accusations came from women who ranged in age from about 18 to 28 at the time. They complained of being groped, forcibly kissed or subjected to unwanted advances. One of them, Becky Gray, now 62, a retired teacher living in Gadsden, Ala., said in an interview that she was puzzled by Mr. Moore’s repeated overtures when she worked in the Gadsden Mall. “I just couldn’t figure out why a man of his age spent every Friday and Saturday at the mall,” said Ms. Gray, who was then in her late teens or early 20s. She said she frequently saw Mr. Moore, then in his 30s, talking with young women and did her best to avoid him. Ms. Gray said she eventually complained to her manager that he would not leave her alone and was later told that Mr. Moore had been banned from the mall. Nine women have now come forward with accusations, and state Republican leaders were pondering increasingly baroque mechanisms that have the potential to deny their own candidate a Senate seat. Party leaders met Wednesday evening, but no decision was announced. "
1291,"WASHINGTON — The moment the last of Fred Vautour’s five children walked across the stage as a Boston College graduate was priceless. Not only did Mr. Vautour have the rare distinction of handing each of his children their diplomas, but he was also able to pay for their nearly 18 years of schooling by collecting trash, scrubbing toilets and mopping floors while the campus slept. “As much as I struggled, it was incredible to be able to do that for them,” said Mr. Vautour, 64, who has worked the graveyard shift as a custodian at Boston College for 17 years. “I took this job for benefits, but never imagined this would be one of them.” It may not be one for long — or at least could be severely curtailed. The sprawling House tax bill, set for a vote on Thursday, would tax the value of college tuition benefits conferred on thousands of university employees like Mr. Vautour, one of several provisions that would hit colleges, universities and their students, hard. Republicans drafted the bill with the premise that it would simplify the nation’s tax code and cut rates for middle-income Americans. To help pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut, lawmakers eliminated many individual tax breaks, arguing the overall plan would compensate for any lost benefits. The result: while many families and businesses would see tax cuts, a large percentage of undergraduates and graduate students would see their tax bills increase, some dramatically. In addition to campus employees, many doctoral students would see huge tax increases, since the tuition that universities waive for them in exchange for working on campus as researchers and teaching assistants would be deemed taxable income. At expensive research universities like Stanford and Harvard, the new tax bills could swamp graduate-student stipends. "
1292,"TOKYO — The first time Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, met President Xi Jinping of China, the body language told the story. Mr. Xi looked dour and stiff, turning away from Mr. Abe with pursed lips, as if someone had forced him into it after months of escalating tensions between their two nations. In the years since, relations have improved but the two leaders have always kept at a distance. This past weekend, they met again on the sidelines of a regional summit meeting in Vietnam. This time, they shook hands and Mr. Xi flashed a grin. It was a sign, the Japanese news media suggested, of a potentially momentous shift in the region, with two longtime adversaries drawing closer as the United States under President Trump has created unease among allies about the role the United States will take in the region. To compensate, Japan and China are inching toward a possible reconciliation as they recognize the altered dynamics around the Pacific Rim. But with the two Asian powers long divided by disputes over history and territory, as well as testiness over influence in the region, it will take more than a few handshakes — or a smile — to cement a genuine realignment. In gesturing toward a new friendliness, Japan is motivated in part by the recognition that as the United States retreats, it needs stronger trade with China. Having watched Mr. Trump heap praise on Mr. Xi in Beijing last week, Japan is also propelled by fear that the United States may develop a closer rapport with China that would exclude Japan. "
1293,"HARARE, Zimbabwe — A day after the Zimbabwean Army detained President Robert Mugabe, representatives of South Africa and the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday sought to defuse the crisis in closed-door negotiations aimed at producing some kind of transitional settlement. President Jacob G. Zuma of South Africa told lawmakers in his own country that the situation “very shortly will be coming clear,” as an array of activist groups and political opponents of Mr. Mugabe urged him to step aside peacefully. Feeling their way through uncharted territory after the military placed Mr.  Mugabe under house arrest, Zimbabweans ventured into streets patrolled by armored vehicles and awaited some kind of signal of what a new era might bring. Many in this country of 16 million people have known no president other than the 93-year-old Mr. Mugabe, a onetime leader of the country’s anticolonial struggle who traded the liberator’s mantle for the iron fist as one of Africa’s most enduring autocrats. Early Wednesday, the military announced that soldiers had confined Mr. Mugabe and his flamboyant and ambitious wife, Grace Mugabe, to their home. "
1294,"Happy Thursday. The Justice Department’s new antitrust chief Makan Delrahim laid out the principles that could guide a suit to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner.

A note to readers: Many of you have written to us about the blue hyperlinks. We’ve heard you and are working on the issue. It’s not the first time that the Goldman Sachs chief has referenced Britain’s plans to leave the European Union on Twitter. (See this and this.) But today’s tweet was his most open yet about his unease over how Brexit is shaping up. This probably won’t make him feel better: The E.U.’s top Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, believes that Britain’s only hope for a trade deal with the political bloc is a Canada-style deal that is undeniably inferior from an economic and trade standpoint than what it has now, according to Politico. — Michael de la Merced The Justice Department hasn’t sued to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner — not yet, anyway. But its antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has laid out the principles that would guide that lawsuit when, or if, it is filed. "
1295,"Dravosburg, Pa., is a small — population 1,746 — working-class suburb that lies along the Monongahela River 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. If we want to understand what actually propelled Donald Trump to victory last November, presidential voting patterns there provide a vital clue. In 2012, Dravosburg backed Barack Obama over Mitt Romney 441 to 312, or 53.4 percent to 44.8 percent. Four years later, the men and women of Dravosburg abandoned their Democratic loyalties and backed Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, 56.3 to 41.1. What is so interesting about this working-class community, with its strong ties to organized labor? It is one of thousands of white enclaves across the nation that provided Trump with his margin of victory. The election of Donald Trump revealed that in some of the nation’s whitest municipalities and counties — the communities arguably most insulated from urban crime, immigration and gangs — Trump did far better than Romney had done four years earlier. The 2016 results suggest that residents of a diminishing number of decisively white American towns and small cities — even those which supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 — can now be politically mobilized around race, ethnicity, multiculturalism and immigration. "
1296,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. An important, and often overlooked, part of the Republican tax plan is the change to the tax code’s inflation adjustment. I realize that “inflation adjustment” may not be one of the more exciting phrases you will find in your inbox this morning, but stick with me for a moment. The federal government calculates a handful of different inflation measures, the best known being the Consumer Price Index. The other measures tend to show a slower rate of economywide inflation than the Consumer Price Index does. With a slower inflation rate, real incomes — that is, incomes after adjusting for inflation — rise more quickly. (An example: If you got a 4 percent raise last year and inflation was estimated to be 2 percent, your real income rose about 2 percent. If inflation was only 1 percent, your real income rose about 3 percent.) Tax brackets are based on inflation-adjusted incomes, and they currently use the Consumer Price Index. But the tax bill in Congress would switch to one of the other measures, which tends to show less inflation. By doing so, the Republicans’ plan makes incomes appear to be rising faster than they otherwise would — and pushes more households into higher tax brackets over time. This change is effectively a tax increase on families who are not already rich enough to be in the top tax bracket. In the latest version of their tax plan, Senate Republicans have made the change in the inflation measure permanent. But all of the plan’s middle-class tax cuts are temporary. To summarize: The middle-class tax cuts vanish, while the middle-class tax increases (and an enormous tax cut for corporations) remain. "
1297,"To the Editor: Re “Alone and Adrift in a Warming World” (editorial, Nov. 10): President Trump lies about climate change. Unlike the rest of us, he dismisses the obvious changes in the climate we all experience. Based on misguided ideology and a commitment to protect failing economic interests, his appointees dismantle actions that could reduce the climate-altering gases we are adding to the atmosphere. By contrast, beginning in the 1980s, scientists predicted that rising emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and other gases would cause most of the recent changes we have experienced: record heat, sea-level rise, intensified hurricanes and precipitation events, and more droughts and wildfires. Whose approach provides us with the information we need to develop effective means for slowing climate change and creating resilient cities, agricultural systems and economic opportunities? Mr. Trump and his powerfully positioned climate deniers are harming billions of people and the natural world upon which we depend by defending the indefensible. WILLIAM R. MOOMAW

1299,"WASHINGTON — A growing national outcry over sexual harassment reached the Senate on Thursday, when a radio newscaster accused Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of kissing and groping her without consent during a 2006 U.S.O. tour of the Middle East before he took public office. Mr. Franken, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, almost immediately released an apology to the newscaster, Leeann Tweeden, who said that Mr. Franken forcibly kissed her during a rehearsal and groped her for a photo as she slept. After initially apologizing without fully acknowledging all of her accusations, he then released another lengthier, more contrite statement that contested nothing. “The first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,” Mr. Franken wrote. “I respect women. I don’t respect men who don’t,” he continued. “And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.” "
1300,"NEWARK — The federal corruption trial of Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey ended in a mistrial on Thursday after jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict, leaving Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, free to return to Congress but injecting uncertainty as he faces re-election next year and his party faces a difficult battle to retake the Senate. After interviewing jurors individually in his chambers, Judge William H. Walls emerged to tell the court that, after nine weeks of testimony, the jury was deadlocked and that, as a result, “there is no alternative but to declare a mistrial.” One juror told reporters that 10 of the 12 jurors supported finding Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, not guilty, saying that prosecutors had not made the case that the favors and gifts exchanged between the senator and a wealthy eye doctor went beyond what good friends do for each other. Following the ruling, Mr. Menendez seemed both relieved and defiant, denouncing prosecutors who pursued criminal charges against him. “The way this case started was wrong, the way it was investigated was wrong, the way it was prosecuted was wrong, and the way it was tried was wrong as well,” he said. The decision leaves Mr. Menendez, 63, safely in the Senate, denying Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey the opportunity to appoint a replacement and further tip the scales for Republicans in the Senate. But Mr. Menendez, who has been in the Senate for 12 years, emerges from the trial politically wounded as he prepares to campaign for a usually safe Democratic seat. Now, whoever challenges him will surely make Mr. Menendez’s ethics a key attack line. Throughout the trial, poll after poll found that his approval numbers were plummeting, and a Quinnipiac poll released in September showed that 50 percent of likely New Jersey voters said that Mr. Menendez did not deserve to be re-elected.

1301,"The question has transfixed classical music for months: Who would the Los Angeles Philharmonic tap to fill the very large shoes of Deborah Borda, who helped make it one of the nation’s most vibrant and financially sound orchestras? A member of her team? An outsider from the world of business — or Hollywood? The question was answered on Thursday, when the Philharmonic announced that it had reached beyond its ranks — but not beyond the orchestra field, or even the West Coast — for its next chief executive: Simon Woods, the innovative president of the Seattle Symphony. Mr. Woods said in a phone interview that he hoped to build on the accomplishments of Ms. Borda, who left Los Angeles to lead the New York Philharmonic, and that he looked forward to working with his new orchestra’s music director, Gustavo Dudamel. “I think that everybody has watched over the past 20 years as this organization evolved into this extraordinary artistic entity which is redefining how we think about orchestras,” said Mr. Woods, 54, who was born in London. Since his arrival in 2011, the Seattle Symphony has raised its artistic profile, commissioning and presenting the premiere of “Become Ocean” by John Luther Adams, which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize. It established its own recording label, and worked with the city’s homeless. It raised some eyebrows in classical circles by performing the bawdy anthem “Baby Got Back” with Sir Mix-A-Lot. And after one of President Trump’s travel ban proposals this year, it responded with a free concert, “Music Beyond Borders,” that highlighted works by composers from nations that were targeted. "
1302,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to allow a single company to own a newspaper and television and radio stations in the same town, reversing a decades-old rule aimed at preventing any individual or company from having too much power over local coverage. The Republican-led F.C.C. eliminated the restrictions, known as a media cross-ownership ban, in a 3-to-2 vote along party lines. As part of the vote, the agency also increased the number of television stations a company could own in a local market. A company will more easily be able to own two of the four largest stations in a market, instead of only one. The vote was the latest action in a deregulatory blitz at the agency cheered on by media, broadband and cable corporations, but opposed by many Democrats and consumer advocates, who say Americans will be hurt from greater consolidation in those industries. In April, the agency relaxed other limits on television ownership. Shortly after, Sinclair Broadcast Group reached a deal with Tribune Media for a $3.9 billion merger that would allow Sinclair to reach 70 percent of American households. Some lawmakers have called for an investigation into the relationship between the agency’s chairman, Ajit Pai, and Sinclair. Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump, has said the media ownership rules — including the cross-ownership ban between newspapers and television and radio stations — was outdated. He said most Americans get their news from a variety of sources and, most prominent among them, online platforms like Facebook and Google. Local media organizations, he has argued, would have a greater shot at competing against those internet giants by combining resources in local markets. "
1303,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Marc Tracy, who covers college sports for The Times. The U.C.L.A. sunglasses-stealing saga concluded Wednesday, not with a bang, but with a whimper. Last week, three Bruin freshman basketball players — including LiAngelo Ball, the middle son of a famous and aptly named basketball-playing family — were arrested in Hangzhou, China, apparently for stealing designer sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store. This happened two days before they were to play in an annual showcase game in Shanghai put on by the Pacific-12 Conference. The players’ passports were revoked, U.C.L.A.’s athletic director, Dan Guerrero, said Wednesday, and U.C.L.A. dictated that they stay in the team hotel while their teammates left for Shanghai, beat Georgia Tech and departed the continent. President Trump, who was in China on diplomatic business, raised the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping, asking, according to John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff: “Do you know anything about these knuckleheads that got caught allegedly stealing?” Mr. Trump’s intervention appeared to work. The players admitted they had broken the law, according to Mr. Guerrero, and were told that the charges had been dropped. Paparazzi gave them a Los Angeles welcome when they arrived at L.A.X. Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, at a time when many in the sports world have been outspoken in opposition to him, Mr. Trump asked on Twitter whether credit would be given where it seemed to be due: "
1304,"I have lived my whole life with a Republican Party with which I disagreed, but at least understood. The first election I can remember was the presidential election of 1980. I was 10 years old. I didn’t know much about politics or party platforms. I only knew that the former peanut-farmer president, Jimmy Carter, was running against a former actor, Ronald Reagan. But it was in that election that Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority reintroduced religious activism into American politics. Speaking at a Dallas convention of Christian fundamentalists, Falwell proclaimed: “During the 1980s, preachers, we have a threefold primary responsibility. No. 1: Get people saved. No. 2: Get them baptized. No. 3: Get them registered to vote.” The religious activism was in many ways a direct response to the strides made in the 1960s and 1970s on racial equality, women’s rights and gay rights. In a way, their driving motivation was to make religious law into American law, really not so unlike the Shariah law they so fear and despise. My brothers and I stayed up late with my mother to watch the returns on election night in 1980. When it was clear that the actor had beaten the farmer, my mother quietly left the room, and an air of solemnity and sadness filled it. For the three decades that followed, I could count on one thing: the conservative right was the religious right. That was its branding, if not always its behavior. It was as if the foot soldiers for the conservative right had read only half of the Bible they thumped. They were harsh and vindictive like the God of the Old Testament, not generous and inclusive like the Jesus of the New Testament. "

1307,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. On this week’s edition of “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee used the Roy Moore controversy as a jumping-off point to talk about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in industries across America. “Each community has to kick out their own creeps,” Ms. Bee said. She added that in Hollywood, outing Harvey Weinstein should be seen as only the beginning of a larger effort. Upon returning to the United States after a 12-day tour of Asia, President Trump took to Twitter to criticize a longtime favorite adversary: CNN.

1308,"SIERRA CITY, Calif. — The fragrant firs had given way to jagged, rocky peaks, and the composer John Adams climbed a vertiginous metal staircase to a fire lookout high atop the Sierra Buttes, an aerie perched 8,587 feet above sea level. “All this was heavily mined,” Mr. Adams said, surveying a seemingly serene landscape of glacial lakes and Ansel Adams evergreens that had once been torn apart by frenzied prospectors during the Gold Rush. “There were shafts into the interiors of the mountains.” These days Mr. Adams is mining some of the real-life tumult that churned beneath the oft-mythologized surface of the California Gold Rush of the early 1850s — the ethnic tensions, ugly bursts of nativism and brutality toward women — for his latest opera, “Girls of the Golden West,” which will be given its premiere Nov. 21 at the San Francisco Opera. The opera’s mid-19th-century setting (its title archly evokes Puccini’s more melodramatic “La Fanciulla del West,” or “The Girl of the Golden West”) is a departure for Mr. Adams, whose pathbreaking operas “Nixon in China,” about a 1972 presidential trip, and “The Death of Klinghoffer,” his still-controversial exploration of a 1985 hijacking, were so contemporary that some critics initially sniffed that they were “CNN operas.” But Mr. Adams said that the new work, with a libretto assembled from historic texts by Peter Sellars, his longtime collaborator, had come to feel disturbingly of the moment — especially its scenes of white miners whipped into anti-immigrant frenzies. “They all came here looking for gold,” he said at one point during a drive through the Sierras along State Route 49, which links many of the old mining sites of the 49ers. “And when it became not so easy to find gold, they all started sounding like Donald Trump.” "

1310,"WASHINGTON — With 227 Republican votes, the House passed the most sweeping tax overhaul in three decades on Thursday, taking a significant leap forward as lawmakers seek to enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals and deliver the first major legislative achievement of President Trump’s tenure. The swift approval came two weeks after the bill was unveiled, without a single hearing on the 400-plus-page legislation and over the objections of Democrats and 13 Republicans. The focus now shifts to the Senate, where Republicans are quickly moving ahead with their own tax overhaul, which differs in substantial ways from the House bill. After four days of debate, members of the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 12 along party lines to approve their version of the tax package late Thursday night. The approval helps clear the way for the full Senate to consider the bill after Thanksgiving, although it remains to be seen whether it has the support to pass the chamber. “We’ve taken a big step today, but of course there are many more steps ahead,” Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said after the vote. Several Senate Republicans have expressed concerns about the legislative effort, and if Democrats are unified in opposition, Senate leaders can afford only two Republican defections in order to win passage through the narrowly divided chamber. In a blow to Senate Republicans, an analysis of their plan released Thursday projected the bill would actually raise taxes on low-income Americans within a few years. "

1312,"Updated on Dec. 11. That a Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama would cruise to victory seemed almost a foregone conclusion. But after a series of women came forward to accuse that candidate, Roy S. Moore, of sexual misconduct, less is certain in an unlikely nail-biter of a race that could have major implications for the party’s ability to govern in Washington. President Trump has gone from largely avoiding mention of Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, to unequivocally endorsing him. Many Senate Republicans distanced themselves from the candidate, and some called on him to withdraw from the race. Democrats, for their part, are contemplating the near-impossible: flipping a seat in a deeply red state that last elected a Democratic senator in 1992. As voters prepare for the special election on Tuesday, here is a breakdown of The New York Times’s coverage on the race since the accusations emerged. On Nov. 9, The Washington Post reported that four women said Mr. Moore had pursued them sexually or romantically when they were 18 or younger and he was in his 30s. One of them said that he touched her sexually when she was 14, below the state’s age of consent. Over the next several days, a woman accused Mr. Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 (read her statement here), and four more women accused him of sexual misconduct or unwanted overtures. "
1313,"WASHINGTON — There are tough choices at the heart of the Republican tax bills speeding through Congress, and they make clear what the party values most in economic policy right now: deep and lasting tax cuts for corporations. The bill that sailed through the House on Thursday chooses to take from high-tax Democratic states, particularly California and New York, and give to lower-tax Republican states that President Trump carried in 2016, particularly Florida and Texas. It allows for tax increases on millions of families several years from now, if a future Congress does not intervene, but not for similar increases on corporations. The version of the bill that the Senate Finance Committee approved along party lines late Thursday chooses to give peace of mind to corporate executives planning their long-term investments. That comes at the expense of added anxiety for individual taxpayers, particularly those in the middle class, who could face stiff tax increases on Jan. 1, 2026. A consistent conservative philosophy underpins all those decisions. So does a very large bet — economically and politically — on the power of business tax cuts to deliver rapid wage growth to United States workers. There is also the appearance, to liberal critics in particular, of Republicans seeking to reward their prized constituencies first, while leaving others to bear the consequences if their most optimistic scenarios do not play out. The tax plans have evolved rapidly since House leaders first introduced their bill at the beginning of the month. Amendments in the Ways and Means Committee restored some cherished tax breaks that had been targeted for elimination, including those for adoptive parents, and expanded the bill’s tax breaks for owners of businesses that are not organized as traditional corporations. "
1314,"As Republicans and the Trump administration continue trying to chip away at the Affordable Care Act, the Internal Revenue Service has begun, for the first time, to enforce one of the law’s most polarizing provisions: the employer mandate. Thousands of businesses — many of them small or midsize — will soon receive a letter saying that they owe the government money because they failed to offer their workers qualifying health insurance. The first round of notices, which the I.R.S. began sending late last month, are being mailed to companies that have at least 100 full-time employees and ran afoul of the law in 2015, the year that the mandate took effect. Large companies, defined in the law as those with 50 or more workers, are required to offer their employees affordable insurance or pay stiff tax penalties. The I.R.S. held off for years on assessing those fines, saying that it needed more time, and money, to build its compliance systems. Now, the agency says it is finally ready to go after scofflaws. “As the I.R.S. has publicly stated, the agency is obligated to enforce the Affordable Care Act’s employer shared responsibility provision,” said Bruce Friedland, an agency spokesman. Ten months ago, in his first executive order, President Trump directed government agencies to waive, defer or delay carrying out as much of the law as possible. This week, the Treasury Department said that it objected to the employer mandate but was legally compelled to enforce it. “Treasury lawyers see no ground for the secretary to direct the I.R.S. to not collect the tax,” the agency said in a written statement. “The A.C.A.’s employer mandate unfortunately remains the law of the land.” "
1315,"Though much has been made of the glowing glances with which Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and his wife, Louise Linton, ogled the first sheets of $1 bills with his signature during a trip to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on Wednesday, for my money it was Ms. Linton’s choice of dress that really made a statement. Actresses of a certain fame are generally pretty canny about their visual messaging: They understand that every time they step out of their doorway they are potentially on show, and they tend to dress accordingly, as if every moment is a potential photo op. Certainly, Ms. Linton, a former actress (guest appearances on “CSI: NY,” “Cold Case” and the like), should understand this, especially given her last major public appearance, in August. At that time she came under fire for Instagramming a photo of herself on a trip with her husband to Kentucky stepping off a government aircraft in lots of Hermès, and got into a social media spat in which she appeared to brag about her ability to buy such designer names while denigrating those who could not. So what does it say that for her recent close-up Ms. Linton dressed in black, with long leather dominatrix gloves, a long leather skirt, wide black belt, black blouse and black stilettos? That either she is the most tone-deaf image maker in the administration or its most Machiavellian. Black leather, after all — unlike, say, brown leather — is one of the most emotive sartorial symbols in the wardrobe, imbued with a host of cultural and historical associations for almost everyone. It is the de facto outfit of villains everywhere, from generic Nazis with their black leather trench coats to Hermann Goering’s black leather boots, The Terminator (Version 1), Darth Vader and assorted Disney witches.

1316,"Yemen would suffer “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims” if Saudi Arabia did not immediately allow food and medicine to be offloaded at all of Yemen’s seaports, and permit the resumption of air services to the cities of Sana and Aden, the United Nations official Mark Lowcock warned Security Council diplomats last week. Saudi Arabia tightened its blockade against Yemen on Nov. 5 after Iran-backed Houthi rebels threatened Riyadh with a ballistic missile. The Saudis have since partly lifted the blockade, but only of ports controlled by its allies. That is not nearly enough to get urgently needed food to nearly seven million Yemenis facing famine. Misery has been Yemen’s lot after more than three years of unrelenting war. At least 10,000 people have been killed, many by Saudi-coalition bombings carried out with military assistance by the United States. A raging cholera epidemic has sickened some 900,000 people, and 17 million Yemenis are now completely dependent on humanitarian aid for survival. Ships and cargo planes ferrying food, medicine and vital fuel to Yemen’s war-ravaged civilians are inspected by the United Nations to make sure they are not transporting arms. Impeding humanitarian assistance and using famine as a weapon are war crimes, and Saudi Arabia must realize that the world is finally taking notice. On Monday, the United States Congress passed a resolution denouncing the targeting of Yemeni civilians and calling for all parties involved to “increase efforts to adopt all necessary and appropriate measures to prevent civilian casualties and to increase humanitarian access.” The vote should serve as a warning to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is intent on expanding Saudi Arabia’s regional influence, that while he may have the unreserved blessing of President Trump, American lawmakers are less tolerant of flagrant violations of international law and of basic humanity. The only way to end the Yemeni people’s hell is for Congress and the United Nations to keep pressing all parties for a political solution. "
1317,"This essay has been updated to reflect news events. I still remember my sense of indignation when my high school French teacher told us about the rule: French nouns have a gender, even seemingly sexless ones like “table.” And if you had a mixed group of masculine and female nouns — say, a bunch of male students (étudiants) and female students (étudiantes) — you had to describe them, as a group, in the masculine. “What if there are 99 female students and one male student?” I demanded. It didn’t matter, the teacher said. What’s more, if you wrote a sentence about attractive (beaux) étudiants and attractive (belles) étudiantes, the adjective used to describe them had to be masculine, too: “Les étudiants et les étudiantes sont beaux.” That was just the way French was, she said. The sexism of that stung. And that was even before I discovered that one of the rationales for this rule in which one man trumped an infinite number of women was that “the masculine gender is deemed more noble than the feminine gender because of the superiority of man over woman.” That line, from a 1767 grammar book, was cited this month in a declaration signed by 314 teachers in France that they would no longer teach the rule that “the masculine prevails over the feminine” when it came to plural nouns. The teachers’ objection was not just philosophical; it was philological. The rule, they said in the French version of Slate, was a parvenu (it was enunciated in the 17th century and became widely taught only in the 19th century) and politically motivated (it buttressed French laws that denied women equal rights). Besides that, they said, the rule encourages children “to accept the domination of one sex over the other” to the detriment of women. In its place, the teachers suggested using “the rule of proximity,” in which the adjective matches the gender of the noun closest to it, which was common practice for centuries. Or they said, people could use “majority agreement,” with the adjective matching the gender of the noun with the biggest number of members. Or even, they said, writer’s choice. "
1318,"The pending merger of AT&T and Time Warner has attracted a significant amount of attention, for precisely the wrong reasons. Politics have apparently intruded on a transaction that until recently was considered relatively uncontroversial. Combining AT&T, which distributes digital content over its wireless networks, with a news and entertainment provider like Time Warner is what economists and antitrust experts consider a classic vertical merger. Because the companies don’t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries. For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one. Typically more problematic for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy. Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies — benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days — including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones — the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat. If anything, it would create an attractive set of new options for the viewing public. "
1319,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Consumers here at first did not believe the health insurance premiums they saw when they went shopping for coverage this month on HealthCare.gov. Only five plans were available, and for a family of four with parents in their mid-30s, the cheapest plan went typically for more than $2,400 a month, nearly $30,000 a year. With the deadline for a decision less than a month away, consumers are desperately weighing their options, dismayed at the choices they have under the Affordable Care Act and convinced that political forces in Washington are toying with their health and well-being. “I believe in the Affordable Care Act; it worked for me under the Obama administration,” said Sara Stovall, 40, who does customer-support work for a small software company. “But it’s not working as it was supposed to. It’s being sabotaged, and I feel like a pawn.” Ms. Stovall said she might try to reduce her hours and income, so her family could qualify for subsidies on offer to poorer families to help pay for premiums. Heather Griffith, a 42-year-old real estate broker, said she would put aside much less money for her retirement and the education of her two young children so she could pay the premiums. And even though he does not need an assistant for his work as a developer of mobile apps, Ian Dixon, 38, said he might hire an employee just so he could buy health insurance as a small business, at a cost far below what he and his family would have to pay on their own. "
1320,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Cambodia’s highest court on Thursday dissolved the main opposition party, eliminating the most popular and viable challenger to the country’s authoritarian leader before elections next year. Human rights groups and the United Nations said the decision to shutter the Cambodia National Rescue Party, or C.N.R.P., would render the country essentially a one-party state, ending its post-Khmer Rouge experiment with pluralistic democracy. The ruling followed a lawsuit filed last month by the government against the opposition, asserting that it was involved in a United States-backed plot to overthrow the Cambodian People’s Party and its powerful leader, Prime Minister Hun Sen. In announcing the ruling, Dith Munty, the chief judge of the Supreme Court, said, “It is a serious crime, so the party will be dissolved according to Article 38 of the Law on Political Parties.” The judge is also a high-ranking member of the governing party and a close associate of Mr. Hun Sen. There is no right to appeal. The decision, which will see scores of opposition officials barred from politics and their party stripped of its parliamentary seats, was the culmination of a crackdown in which the opposition leader was jailed, media outlets closed and activists harassed, with a particular focus on groups linked to the United States. The International Commission of Jurists, a nongovernmental rights group, said the hearing and Judge Dith Munty’s role in it made “a mockery of justice.” "
1321,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Attacks Teddy Roosevelt’s Legacy” (editorial, Nov. 7): We are dismayed by the Trump administration’s plans to reduce the areas of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments in Utah, and by the possibility that other national monuments may be in jeopardy as part of the Interior Department’s continuing review. Both areas have long been known for their rich paleontological troves of marine and terrestrial fossil species central to investigations of the history of life. We are therefore keenly concerned about the potential loss to science and our national heritage of species yet to be discovered on lands excised from the national monuments. We stand ready to work constructively with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in safeguarding the natural resources and heritage of the United States.

1322,"NAIROBI, Kenya — A month after the Trump administration formally lifted decades-old sanctions against Sudan, a top official said on Thursday that the United States would consider removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that has been in place since 1993. The step, which is contingent on further cooperation by Sudan with Washington, would further demonstrate the striking turnabout in relations between the countries, a thaw that began under the Obama administration and a rare area in which the Trump administration has continued the approach of its predecessor. Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said the United States was willing to consider removing Sudan from the its list of state sponsors of terrorism if Sudan continued to make progress on counterterrorism cooperation, human rights and other key issues. Syria, since 1974, and Iran, since 1984, are the other countries on the list. Mr. Sullivan said he raised those issues in a two-day visit to Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. He is one of the highest-level officials to visit Sudan in a decade. Revoking the sanctions is the latest in a series of steps the nations have taken to improve relations. In late September, Sudan was dropped from the list of countries affected by the Trump administration’s travel ban. The Sudanese government also affirmed the end of diplomatic relations with North Korea, a move that pleased Washington. Mr. Sullivan said the travel-ban decision was unrelated to the latest moves. “That is an immigration issue,” he told reporters in Khartoum. "

Last in The Weekly Standard: If it were up to Mr. Last, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, would have never won his seat to begin with. Using material from books that chronicle Mr. Franken’s time at “Saturday Night Live,” Mr. Last makes the case that, during his career as a comedian, his casual relationship with drugs and penchant for off-color skits ought to have disqualified him from office. Read more » _____ John Ziegler in Mediaite: Mr. Ziegler disagrees with Mr. Franken “on almost every political issue.” However, despite his personal feelings toward the senator, Mr. Ziegler worries that people online and in the news media are too quick to presume guilt. He wonders, for instance, why Mr. Franken’s accuser, Leeann Tweeden, kept an incriminating photograph of Mr. Franken for so long. “Was it because she was told when she woke up that Franken had ‘assaulted’ her and she wanted evidence of this for future use,” he asks, “or, perhaps more likely, did someone send it to her because it was a funny keepsake from their trip which is now being used to create a completely different impression of what happened?” Read more » _____ Kevin D. Williamson in National Review: This week, before the Franken accusations emerged, Democrats and liberals in the news media were beginning to reassess their feelings about former President Bill Clinton. According to Mr. Williamson, the rejection of the Clintons now, years after Mr. Clinton was accused of rape and a year after Hillary Clinton ran for office, are merely a cynical political ploy: “Our progressive friends have discovered their consciences on the Clinton matter at the precise moment the Clintons ceased to be useful instruments of political power.” The same cynicism, he argues, should be applied to liberals who have been swift to condemn Mr. Franken. It costs them nothing, politically, to remove a Democratic senator from a state likely to put another Democrat in his seat. Read more » "
1324,"Looking at the reactions to Republican tax plans, I found myself remembering what people used to say about former Senator Phil Gramm, whose presidential ambitions never went anywhere but who did help cause the 2008 financial crisis: “Even his friends don’t like him.” So it is with G.O.P. tax “reform,” especially the Senate version, which would raise taxes on most individuals, especially in the middle and working classes, and add around 13 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured, all to pay for big cuts in corporate taxes. The general public strongly disapproves — by a 2-1 majority, according to Quinnipiac, although the majority would be even bigger if people really understood what’s going on. But surely at least C.E.O.s like the plan, right? Actually, not so much. A few days ago Gary Cohn, Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser, met with a group of top executives. They were asked to raise their hands if lower taxes would lead them to raise capital expenditures; only a handful did. “Why aren’t the other hands up?” asked Cohn, plaintively. The answer is that C.E.O.s, living in the real world of business, not the imaginary world of right-wing ideologues, know that tax rates aren’t that important a factor in investment decisions. So they realize that even a huge tax cut wouldn’t lead to much more spending. And with that realization, the rationale for this tax plan, such as it is, falls apart, leaving nothing but a scheme to make the rich — especially those who rake in investment income rather than working for a living — richer at everyone else’s expense. For what it’s worth, here’s the story the Trump administration and its allies are telling. Their claim is that cutting taxes on corporate profits would lead to an explosion in private investment and faster economic growth. Furthermore, the fruits of this growth would trickle down to American workers in the form of higher wages — and rising incomes would raise tax receipts, so the tax cuts would end up paying for themselves. "
1325,"About 5,000 barrels of oil, or about 210,000 gallons, gushed out of the Keystone Pipeline on Thursday in South Dakota, blackening a grassy field in the remote northeast part of the state and sending cleanup crews and emergency workers scrambling to the site. “This is not a little spill from any perspective,” said Kim McIntosh, an environmental scientist with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources. No livestock or drinking water sources appeared to be threatened, Ms. McIntosh said, and no farm buildings or houses are within a mile. The spill, near Amherst, S.D., comes just days before regulators in neighboring Nebraska decide whether to grant the final permit needed to begin construction on a different pipeline proposal, the Keystone XL, which would be operated by the same company. An announcement in Nebraska is expected on Monday. The pipeline company, TransCanada, said in a statement that the South Dakota leak was detected around 6 a.m. local time on Thursday. The pipeline was shut down, and the cause of the leak was under investigation. “TransCanada appreciates the collaborative support of local officials, emergency response personnel and commissioners in Marshall County, as well as the landowner who has given permission to access land for assessment, identification and cleanup activities,” the company said in its statement. A photo of the spill, which was posted to the company’s Twitter account, showed a large, darkened area in a field. The Keystone Pipeline is part of a 2,687-mile system that carries crude oil from Alberta to several points in the United States, including Illinois and Oklahoma. "
1326,"The Trump administration is expected to name Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, as the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a regulator that has emerged as one of the most aggressive banking watchdogs, according to an administration official. Mr. Mulvaney — who as a Republican congressman was the co-sponsor of legislation to shut down the consumer bureau — is expected to remain in his position at the Office of Management and Budget and oversee both agencies until a permanent director of the consumer agency is approved, said the official, who requested anonymity because the decision had not yet been made public. Mr. Mulvaney replaces Richard Cordray, who said on Wednesday that he would step down from his position later this month. Mr. Cordray, a Democrat appointed by President Barack Obama, served as the bureau’s first director. During his tenure, the agency gained a reputation as an active watchdog for the financial rights of consumers. The agency’s actions drew resistance from Republicans, who viewed it as overly aggressive. Before Mr. Mulvaney arrived at the Office of Management and Budget, where he is responsible for guiding the president’s spending requests through Congress, he was a conservative House Republican, representing South Carolina. He is known in Washington as a fiscal hawk. With a new director of the consumer agency, President Trump will be free to make major changes, just as he has done at other federal regulators. Many of those are now run by former industry executives. Established six years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad power to combat abuses in a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans. One of the individuals being mentioned as a candidate for the permanent position is Todd J. Zywicki, a conservative law professor at George Mason University. Democrats have said they would fight any nominee they view as too closely aligned with the financial industry. "
1327,"WASHINGTON — Concerned that the missile defense system designed to protect American cities is insufficient by itself to deter a North Korean attack, the Trump administration is expanding its strategy to also try to stop Pyongyang’s missiles before they get far from Korean airspace. The new approach, hinted at in an emergency request to Congress last week for $4 billion to deal with North Korea, envisions the stepped-up use of cyberweapons to interfere with the North’s control systems before missiles are launched, as well as drones and fighter jets to shoot them down moments after liftoff. The missile defense network on the West Coast would be expanded for use if everything else fails. In interviews, defense officials, along with top scientists and senior members of Congress, described the accelerated effort as a response to the unexpected progress that North Korea has made in developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear bomb to the continental United States. “It is an all-out effort,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who returned from a lengthy visit to South Korea last month convinced that the United States needed to do far more to counter North Korea. “There is a fast-emerging threat, a diminishing window, and a recognition that we can’t be reliant on one solution.” For years, that single solution has been the missile batteries in Alaska and California that would target any long-range warheads fired toward the American mainland, trying to shoot them down as they re-enter the atmosphere. Such an approach, known as “hitting a bullet with a bullet,” remains of dubious effectiveness, even after more than $100 billion has been spent on the effort. Antimissile batteries on ships off the Korean coast and in South Korea protect against medium-range missiles, but not those aimed at American cities. So the administration plans to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the two other approaches, both of which are still in the experimental stage. The first involves stepped-up cyberattacks and other sabotage that would interfere with missile launches before they occur — what the Pentagon calls “left of launch.” The second is a new approach to blowing up the missiles in the “boost phase,” when they are slow-moving, highly visible targets. "
1328,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee has uncovered evidence that Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, was forwarded a document about a “Russian backdoor overture” that Mr. Kushner failed to hand over to the panel’s investigators, according to a letter that the committee released on Thursday. The Senate letter did not say what type of back channel communication the Russians were trying to set up. But it noted that “other parties have produced documents concerning the matter.” Mr. Kushner also failed to provide investigators with a September 2016 email he was sent about WikiLeaks, nor did he hand over other communications with a Russian-born businessman that were forwarded him, according to the letter. The businessman, Sergei Millian, a former head of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, has long claimed to have ties to Mr. Trump and his associates — ties that Mr. Trump’s advisers have said are overstated. WikiLeaks has been identified by American intelligence agencies as acting as a conduit for information that Russian intelligence operatives had stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, had repeated communications with the anti-secrecy group on Twitter. The Senate panel said that Mr. Kushner has also not produced phone records that investigators believe exist, although the letter gave no specifics about the records. The letter was signed by Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, the two senior members of the Judiciary Committee. “We appreciate your voluntary cooperation with the committee’s investigation, but the production appears to have been incomplete,” said the letter, which was sent to Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell.

1330,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The House passed its version of a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut, moving Republicans closer to a signature victory. The bill cuts the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, collapses the number of tax brackets and eliminates deductions for state and local taxes. It would also result in bigger tax bills for many students. We tracked how every member voted. Attention now turns to the Senate, where another version of the bill is struggling. An analysis by Congress’s bipartisan referee on tax policy found it would raise taxes on lower-income people. _____ "
1331,"The Trump administration will begin allowing hunters to bring into the United States “trophy” elephants killed in Zimbabwe, reversing a 2014 ban on a practice that has received intense scrutiny in recent years. Though African elephants are protected under the Endangered Species Act, the law allows the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to authorize imports of trophies if the agency finds that the hunts in which the animals were killed contribute to the survival of the species. The United States banned such imports from Zimbabwe in 2014 because of a lack of data on conservation efforts there. Now the United States agency says it is satisfied with Zimbabwe’s actions and believes such hunts can be beneficial for the species by bringing money to local communities and providing incentives to conserve elephants. “Since our 2014 and 2015 findings, there are strong indications that the efforts of private landowners and consortiums to manage elephants within their areas of control have received greater support,” the federal agency said in a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday. The Zimbabwean government, it added, was contributing to efforts to combat poaching and working with partners to improve elephant management. The reversal of the ban comes less than two weeks after the agency moved to allow imports from Zambia. Both decisions generally apply to elephants hunted in either country between 2016 and 2018. Hunters are allowed two imports per year. "
1332,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The Alabama Republican Party on Thursday offered unqualified support to the embattled candidacy of Roy S. Moore, ignoring the condemnation of national Republican leaders and brushing aside worries that he could lose a Senate race in a solidly conservative state — or be expelled from Congress if he wins. Invoking the need for guidance from God, a statement from the party’s chairwoman, Terry Lathan, referred only indirectly to the allegations of sexual misconduct and unwanted overtures against women that have upended the Senate race here. Ms. Lathan said the party trusted voters to make the right decision and backed Mr. Moore, a former chief justice of the State Supreme Court, as a conservative supporter of President Trump running against the Democrat, Doug Jones. “Judge Moore has vehemently denied the allegations made against him,” Ms. Lathan said in her statement, issued one day after a committee of party leaders opted behind closed doors to reaffirm their support for the Republican nominee. “He deserves to be presumed innocent of the accusations unless proven otherwise.” The state party’s decision was a crucial, if mostly expected, procedural victory for a campaign roiled by the public comments of nine women who described conduct varying from uncomfortable to unlawful. Although Mr. Moore on Thursday called the allegations “scurrilous” and “untrue,” the state party’s statement came minutes after he refused to answer questions here about whether he had improper sexual contact with a 14-year-old or, as a prosecutor in his 30s, dated high school girls. It also came about the time on Thursday afternoon when the White House was offering Mr. Moore little support and Mr. Trump was largely skirting the issue. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, repeated Mr. Trump’s previous statement that said Mr. Moore should drop out of the race if the allegations against him were true. She would not say whether Mr. Trump stood by his previous endorsement of Mr. Moore, but said the president backed the Republican National Committee’s decision to end its financial support of Mr. Moore’s campaign. "
1333,"If the government goes to court to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner, as seems increasingly likely, it may well be the antitrust case of the decade, even without the claims of presidential meddling that have already engulfed the deal in partisan controversy. A lawsuit by the Justice Department, along with its earlier, widely reported demands that AT&T sell either DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting to gain approval for the deal, would mark a radical departure from decades of antitrust enforcement policy, both in defining what is an unlawful anticompetitive merger and in fashioning a remedy to cure the problems. That’s because the combination of AT&T and Time Warner is what’s known as a “vertical” merger, meaning that the two companies don’t compete to any significant degree in their primary lines of business, which are telecommunications (AT&T) and entertainment (Time Warner). There would be the same number of competitors in both fields after the merger as there were before it. This week, two Barclays analysts, Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski, called the government’s threat to block the deal “unprecedented” and said they were “perplexed” given the Justice Department’s longstanding leniency toward vertical mergers. Larry Downes, an antitrust expert and a fellow at the Georgetown McDonough School of Business, told me flatly this week: “If the government goes to court, it will lose. There’s no case law to support them.” Court challenges to vertical mergers on antitrust grounds have been extremely rare in recent decades. (Mr. Downes said the most recent example he could find dated to 1964.) But in the past few years, as the internet has disrupted traditional media companies and prompted some high-profile mergers, there has been a growing sense “that antitrust enforcement has been too lenient,” said Maurice Stucke, an antitrust professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law and a co-author of the article “Antitrust and the Marketplace of Ideas.” "
1334,"To the Editor: Re “House Passes Tax Bill in Major Step Toward Overhaul” (news article, nytimes.com, Nov. 16): I am one of the millions of middle-class Americans who would experience a significant increase in my tax bill under the Republican tax plans. A higher tax bill is disappointing, but what is infuriating is that I will be paying higher taxes and no common good will come from it. My higher taxes are not going to reduce the deficit. My higher taxes will do nothing to invest in the future of our country through education, research and development, infrastructure or health care. My higher tax bill has one purpose only, which is to provide revenue to enable tax breaks for the wealthy while staying within the allowed boundaries for deficit increases. I am happy to pay my fair share of taxes. I am even happy to pay more taxes to invest in education, health care and infrastructure. It is shameful that I am paying higher taxes to give tax breaks to the 1 percent. DONNA NAWALKOWSKY, CINCINNATI To the Editor: The Republicans’ tax proposals seem to indicate that they don’t care if their deficits drive the government toward bankruptcy. But they enable the Democrats to get in the game and lay claim to the populist mantle that is rightly theirs. Democrats should continue to oppose the give-more-to-those-who-need-it-least proposals, including the end of the alternative minimum tax, weakening of the inheritance tax and lower rates for high earners. But the Democrats should make clear what they could support and vote for: Republican proposals for a much higher standard deduction, lower corporate taxes and a simplified tax code. One conclusion from the recent state elections is that voters are desperate for a functioning government. The Republicans’ self-immolation on health care demonstrates the sterility of “just say no.” Saying “yes” to acceptable parts of the Republican tax agenda could focus the debate on the other parts. "
1335,"The Republican tax proposals were bad from the get-go. But they have become steadily worse as they have been turned into bills, which seem so cartoonishly evil they could have been dreamed up by Mr. Burns from “The Simpsons.” Consider the latest changes to the Senate tax-cut bill being championed by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and his merry band. It lavishes generous permanent tax breaks on corporations, while modest tax cuts for the middle class would vanish into thin air after 2025. Millionaires would enjoy average tax cuts of $5,580 in 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, at which point families earning less than $75,000 a year would pay more taxes. Let that sink in. This tax bill would take money from working families and give it to the world’s wealthiest people. The hardest hit would be in high-cost states like California, New Jersey and New York because the bill gets rid of important deductions and the credit for state and local taxes. Further, it calls for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate for most people to have health insurance. This would leave 13 million people without insurance and drive up premiums for many others who are already struggling to afford coverage, all in the interest of reducing spending by $338 billion so Republican lawmakers can cut taxes for big businesses, despite Democratic opposition.

1336,"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. BONN, Germany — The senior American diplomat at the United Nations climate talks here told world leaders Thursday that the United States would remain engaged in global climate change negotiations even as it planned to exit the Paris agreement “at the earliest opportunity.” Judith G. Garber, a State Department acting undersecretary, gave the first official American remarks to the United Nations climate body since President Trump announced in June that he would abandon the Paris deal. It was a far more conciliatory message than a presentation earlier in the week by White House officials promoting fossil fuels, which drew catcalls and a walkout. “President Trump has made clear the U.S. position with respect to the Paris agreement,” Ms. Garber said. “Although he has indicated that the United States intends to withdraw at the earliest opportunity, we remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people.” Ms. Garber’s address made no mention of coal while promising to help other countries “adapt to the impacts of climate change.” It was the only mention of climate change in the three-minute presentation, but that was one more than many Trump administration critics had expected. And in contrast to the noisy protests that greeted the White House fossil fuel event, Ms. Garber’s speech in a tightly-controlled plenary hall was met with polite applause. "
1337,"Supporters and critics of the Republican tax bills argue over their effect on middle-class Americans, but there is one group that everyone agrees would come out ahead: the millionaires and billionaires who have to reckon with the estate tax. As Steven Mnuchin, President Trump’s Treasury secretary, bluntly declared last month, “Obviously, the estate tax, I will concede, disproportionately helps rich people.” As it is now, the estate tax affects a small set of wealthy Americans, applying only when someone leaves assets worth more than $5.49 million to heirs. Together, parents can leave $11 million to their children without paying a penny in estate taxes. Last year, for example, more than 2.6 million people died in the United States. Of the estates filed with the Internal Revenue Service, 5,219 — or 0.2 percent of the total — were large enough to qualify for the tax. The kind of households that could potentially owe money, however, include Mr. Trump’s, Mr. Mnuchin’s, and those of several cabinet members and advisers, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Gary Cohn, chief of the National Economic Council. (An analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund concluded that the estate tax repeal could save Mr. Trump’s estate more than $1 billion, and those of his cabinet members $3.5 billion.) "
1338,"R. J. Barrett is only 17 years old, but he is already a world traveler. Raised in suburban Toronto, he plays basketball for a high school in Montverde, Fla. Last summer, he led Canada to the gold medal in the under-19 world championship in Egypt, and next month, he and his teammates at Montverde Academy, which has one of the nation’s top basketball programs, will travel to Beijing for a high-profile international tournament. But before they go, Montverde Coach Kevin Boyle plans to have a long, serious talk with everyone. And after the recent incident in which three U.C.L.A. basketball players were detained in China for a week, accused of shoplifting and then freed only after the intervention of President Trump, Boyle expects to have his players’ full attention. “It’s definitely going to be a point that we’re going to bring up,” Boyle said in a telephone interview this week. “It’s a different culture and there are expectations of your family and the school, and then, furthermore, you’re in a Communist country. If you do something dumb, you’re not in the United States.” He added, “It’s not the American justice system, so it’s definitely going to be something that you want to point to that this is not a joke, and don’t think you can steal a pack of gum.” In a reflection both of basketball’s increased appeal to China and the way top-tier high school basketball has become big business, Montverde Academy will be joined in Beijing by two other American high school teams: Providence Day School of Charlotte, N.C., and Chaminade College Prep of Canoga Park, Calif. The teams will play in a round-robin format against one another and six Chinese teams from Dec. 6 to 9 at various sites. Montverde’s presence in China is only partly about basketball, though. Like U.C.L.A. and other colleges that have sent teams abroad, Montverde is using the trip to sell itself. A private school housed on a lush campus just west of Orlando, Montverde has an extensive international presence in its corridors, including more than 60 students from China. And like the American college programs that have visited China, or plan to, it hopes to attract even more. "
1339,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — A tycoon was called home to Saudi Arabia from abroad for a business meeting and detained when he returned. A billionaire was ordered to turn himself in or be picked up like a common criminal. An official was called in to discuss an attack that apparently never happened. Now those three are among the more than 200  people detained in luxury hotels in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, as the government tries to seize hundreds of billions of dollars in assets it says they stole through corrupt means. Two weeks after the crackdown began, Saudi officials and their supporters are attempting to justify the indefinite detentions as an ordinary part of a plea-bargaining process, similar to the approach Western prosecutors use with white-collar criminals. But human rights groups say the comparison ignores critical differences, like legal protections for the accused and an independent judiciary to weigh allegations. Instead, such comparisons appear to point to the desire to raise money as a primary motivation behind the sudden arrests. “This appears to be taking place outside anything that resembles a clear legal process,” said Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch who monitors Saudi Arabia. “If the Saudi authorities don’t offer a chance for legal defense, then this is nothing other than a shakedown.” Defenders of the Saudi approach describe its avoidance of court cases as a benefit, not a drawback. “If you are facing a situation where you have to take in as many people as you do, and of such prominence, if you are going to have a legal process, it will drag on for years, assuming that you have the legal bandwidth to do it,” said Ali Shihabi, executive director of the Arabia Foundation, a research organization in Washington that is close to the Saudi government.

Here’s what you need to know: • Germany is facing the prospect of new elections after negotiations to form a new government collapsed. The breakdown comes less than two months after the last elections seemed to assure that Angela Merkel, above, an icon of Western democracy and values, would remain Germany’s leader for a fourth term.

1341,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s charitable foundation increased its fund-raising and giving during his campaign last year, even as it became the subject of criticism that prompted a decision to dissolve it, according to paperwork submitted this month to the I.R.S. The Donald J. Trump Foundation raised $2.9 million in 2016 — almost as much as it had raised in the preceding four years combined — according to its annual tax filing for 2016. It also showed that the foundation donated $3 million last year, more than it had given in the previous three years combined. Most of the money came from a pair of $1 million donations from leading supporters of his presidential campaign — the Las Vegas gambling investor Phil Ruffin and Laura Perlmutter of Lake Worth, Fla., whose husband, Isaac Perlmutter, is the chairman of Marvel Entertainment. They donated in connection with an event that Mr. Trump staged to benefit military veterans, which set off scrutiny of his foundation for giving away only a fraction of the money it raised to charities, and for making payments in a manner that appeared to benefit Mr. Trump. The foundation also attracted scrutiny from the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who found it had violated fund-raising rules and ordered it to cease soliciting contributions the month before the election. After Mr. Trump won, he directed his lawyers to begin the process of closing the foundation to avoid conflicts of interest. This month’s I.R.S. filing indicates that the foundation finished last year with more than $970,000 in the bank, and that it “is seeking approval to distribute its remaining funds to highly qualified and important” charities. "
1342,"WASHINGTON — Maybe it was the memory of a long-ago childhood visit to the zoo. Maybe it was a sense of loyalty to the symbol of his political party. But President Trump’s surprise intervention to try to save the elephants of Zimbabwe has drawn praise from across the political spectrum — and the question of why he did it has now become the, well, pachyderm in the room. In what may be one of the most curious moments of his first year in office, Mr. Trump put a sudden halt to a new federal government ruling that would have allowed hunters to bring “trophy” elephants killed in Zimbabwe into the United States, calling big-game hunting a “horror show” that he did not believe helped conservation. “There’s a lot of shock that this president and this administration would roll back a decision on trophy hunting like this,” said Tanya Sanerib, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, which fights to protect species threatened with extinction. “But there’s something about elephants that just crosses party lines. They get to people.” Aides said it was no more complicated than that. The president likes elephants, they said. He did not know about his administration’s decision to lift the trophy ban until learning it from the news media and was annoyed to be criticized for a move he had no part in. So he made his displeasure known in the way he has so many other times this year, through his Twitter feed. As it happened, his decision also coincided with the sentiments of conservative media personalities like Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham and Mike Cernovich, who have defended Mr. Trump through a cascade of controversies this year but protested the administration’s initial announcement. "
1343,"LAST week, the editors of GQ named the quarterback Colin Kaepernick its Citizen of the Year for his work protesting racial injustice. Mr. Kaepernick has been heavily criticized by people like President Trump, who claims that an N.F.L. player who kneels during the playing of the national anthem “disrespects our flag” and should be fired; others argue that he is out of bounds as an activist who mixes sports with politics. The problem is that Mr. Kaepernick’s critics, and most of America, don’t really understand how protests work. Our textbooks and national mythology celebrate moments when single acts of civil disobedience, untainted by political organizations, seemed to change the course of history. But the ideal of the “good” protest — one that materialized from an individual’s epiphany — is a fantasy. More often, effective protest is like Mr. Kaepernick’s: it’s collective and contingent and all about long and difficult struggles. Consider what most Americans would agree were two “good” protests: Rosa Parks’s refusal to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Ala., and the student sit-ins at a Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C. Parks, the story goes, was exhausted from a day’s work and took a seat in the “whites only” section. To the astonishment of onlookers, she refused to give up her seat when asked. In Greensboro, black college students decided to eat at the local five-and-dime and initiated the first sit-in at a segregated Southern restaurant. They were idealistic and perhaps naïve. These stories follow a set narrative. They are “firsts”: the first time a black woman refused to give up her seat or the first time students staged a sit-in. They seemed to arise spontaneously when someone fed up with unfair treatment couldn’t take it anymore. Good protesters act as individual citizens, untainted by associations with suspect political organizations. The trouble is that these stories are historically inaccurate and obscure just how protest in the 20th century forged a more democratic country. A narrative with greater accuracy would allow us to better evaluate protests against racial discrimination. Earlier protests, similar to the one that Mr. Kaepernick started, sprang from protesters’ associations with activist organizations, were deeply political rather than individual, and played out in unfamiliar venues in new forms. Protests that change history have their own long histories. They are almost never the first of their kind. Successful protesters plan campaigns, rather than respond to oppression in a single, spontaneous act. Protesters often belong to organizations that lend theoretical, moral and logistical support. Protests don’t reveal previously hidden wrongs to an unaware public. Instead, they cast those wrongs in a new light. They fail, time and time again. When they succeed, they win only partial victories. "
1344,"The Trump administration is ending a humanitarian program that has allowed some 59,000 Haitians to live and work in the United States since an earthquake ravaged their country in 2010, Homeland Security officials said on Monday. Haitians with what is known as Temporary Protected Status will be expected to leave the United States by July 2019 or face deportation. The decision set off immediate dismay among Haitian communities in South Florida, New York and beyond, and was a signal to other foreigners with temporary protections that they, too, could soon be asked to leave. About 320,000 people now benefit from the Temporary Protected Status program, which was signed into law by President George Bush in 1990, and the decision on Monday followed another one last month that ended protections for 2,500 Nicaraguans. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, is still struggling to recover from the earthquake and relies heavily on money its expatriates send to relatives back home. The Haitian government had asked the Trump administration to extend the protected status. “I received a shock right now,” Gerald Michaud, 45, a Haitian who lives in Brooklyn, said when he heard the news. He has been working at La Guardia Airport as a wheelchair attendant, sending money to family and friends back home. He said he feared for his welfare and safety back in Haiti now that his permission to remain in the United States was ending. "
1345,"Along the vast rocky desert that stretches from Mexico into rural West Texas, Border Patrol agents like Rogelio Martinez frequently work alone, miles from civilization and from help. Agent Martinez loved the work, said his father, Jose Martinez. He also knew the risks. The job’s two responsibilities were stopping illegal border crossings and halting drug trafficking. Around 3 a.m. Sunday, Jose Martinez was awakened at home in El Paso with the phone call he had long dreaded. Summoned to the University Medical Center of El Paso, where doctors were trying in vain to resuscitate his son, Mr. Martinez got a sense of what had happened in the desert about 100 miles away when he saw Rogelio’s bloodied head. “It was difficult to look at,” he said. Agent Martinez, 36, was killed, and a second agent who had apparently come to his aid was seriously injured. The F.B.I. was looking into the possibility that the men were attacked, but did not say Monday whether any arrests had been made. Details were thin, but the episode in a remote stretch of Texas quickly made its way into the national conversation on immigration and border security. While Border Patrol fatalities are relatively rare, agents are not infrequently attacked on the job. And despite a dramatic drop in border crossings under the Trump administration, assaults against officers have risen, according to data maintained by the border agency: 720 in the recently-completed fiscal year, the highest number in at least five years. "
1346,"AT&T, one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies,  figures prominently in the annals of antitrust law. Since the late 19th century, under various names and configurations, the entity once known as Ma Bell has often been targeted by regulators trying to rein in its size and keep it from amassing monopoly power. Now, AT&T is facing off against the Justice Department again, this time over its proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. And although the details are different, the current situation is a reminder of the complicated balancing act the government must strike in regulating ever-changing companies. “AT&T has been a dominant company from the very beginning and has sought to maintain its dominance through varying government interactions,” said Gerald Brock, a former Federal Communications Commission staff member who is a professor of public policy at George Washington University. “That’s been the sense of AT&T through the ages — that they seem to have a lot of power, but people also want to be able to communicate in a way that AT&T allows them to do.” Alexander Graham Bell receives two patents for his telephone. A year later, the Bell Telephone Company, the precursor to AT&T, issues stock to seven shareholders. In 1881, the company acquires Western Electric Company, a supplier of telephone equipment. "
1347,"As he raised estate tax rates to fund work programs during the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, “The transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes by will, inheritance or gift is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people.” It’s plenty consistent with the ideals and sentiments of President Trump, who began lying about the merits of an estate tax repeal on the day he began the tax overhaul effort. “To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax,” Mr. Trump said in late September. Congressional Republicans echoed Mr. Trump’s whoppers. “You actually create jobs by getting rid of this death tax,” said the House speaker, Paul Ryan. “Because you know what kills one family business from passing their business on to the next generation? The estate tax.” “For too long, this tax has threatened family-owned businesses — including women- and minority-owned businesses — from being passed down to their children and grandchildren,” said Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which produced the tax legislation. "
1348,"Driving on Long Island in August, Denis Guerra Guerra was stopped by the police in Nassau County for failing to signal when changing lanes, a traffic infraction punishable by a ticket. Two weeks later, he was deported to El Salvador. A police officer had taken his identification — a passport from El Salvador — and discovered a pending order of removal from immigration authorities. On Monday, lawyers from the Central American Refugee Center, a Long Island immigrant legal services organization commonly known as Carecen, and the Hofstra Law Clinic filed suit against Nassau County in state Supreme Court, saying that the county police department was cooperating with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in ways that break state law. Elise Damas, a lawyer for Carecen, announced the suit at a news conference at Hofstra University. “Carecen seeks an ironclad assurance that Nassau County will act in accordance with New York State law, and not just with federal immigration policies,” she said. “Nassau County police are tasked with ensuring the safety of all communities countywide, a goal which cannot be achieved until immigrants feel protected.” Peter L. Markowitz, a professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, called the lawsuit significant, saying: “New York State laws strictly define when it is O.K. and not O.K. for a state officer to make an arrest. And that does not include the authority to make civil immigration arrests.” Mr. Guerra Guerra, 30, is not named in the lawsuit. He is a client of Ms. Damas’s, though, and she said he was the impetus for the suit. But since he is in El Salvador, the lead plaintiff in the case is “Jane Doe,” a 26-year-old undocumented immigrant living in Nassau County. The woman has had no interaction so far with local police but, the suit claims, is at risk because of county policies; the lawyers declined to name her because she is applying for asylum. "
1349,"One thing you can count on in 21st-century U.S. politics is that Republicans will lie about taxes. They did it under George W. Bush, they did it under Barack Obama and they’re still doing it under Donald Trump. Yet this time is different. It’s not just that the lies have gotten even more brazen. There’s now a combination of incoherence and rage that we, or at least I, haven’t seen before. These days, they can’t even seem to get their fake story straight — and they literally start yelling obscenities when someone tries to point out the facts. G.O.P. lies about taxes generally involve two issues: who is hurt or helped by tax changes, and what these changes will do to the budget. Thus, when George W. Bush cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, he and his party repeatedly insisted that the tax cuts were primarily for the middle class. In fact, while there were some middle-class tax breaks in the package, such as an increase in the child tax credit, these were dwarfed by cuts in tax rates on high incomes, reduced taxes on dividends and repeal of the estate tax. Over all, the richest 1 percent saw a much larger increase in after-tax income than middle-class families did. At the same time, the Bush administration used a series of gimmicks to hide the true fiscal cost of the plan, such as delaying the implementation of some tax cuts while pretending that others would expire when the actual intention was to make them permanent. When Obama took office, these tricks were simply flipped on their head. Republicans insisted, falsely, that Obama had imposed a “massive tax increase” on the middle class; in fact, for the most part he actually cut middle-class taxes. Meanwhile, they insisted that the surge in the budget deficit caused by the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis was permanent, and ridiculed the Obama administration’s claims that deficits would fall sharply once crisis spending ended and tax receipts recovered; in fact, that’s exactly what happened. "
1350,"President Trump accomplished his unlikely rise to the White House powered in large part by an embrace of economic and cultural populism. Yet one year after this victory, the Republican Party still has no idea how to address or incorporate those populist elements into a coherent agenda. Nor, despite their best intentions, do Mr. Trump and his former adviser Steve Bannon. This populism does not sit easily within the Republican Party’s business conservative wing (think Mitt Romney) or its “liberty” conservatives (think Tea Party) faction. So it’s not too surprising that virtually all of Mr. Trump’s signature populist ideas have been watered down or ignored, or are in limbo. Instead, Republicans push tax plans that overwhelmingly benefit their donor and executive class. It’s as though Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz won after all. But they didn’t win, and they didn’t win for a reason. Republican voters want something different from anti-government or establishment Republicanism. And the voters who made Mr. Trump president, the millions of largely white men and women without college degrees who voted for Barack Obama before backing Mr. Trump, definitely do not want Romneyism with a human face. The traditional Republican policy agenda is a political zombie, a relic that once served our nation well but is out of touch with what Americans want today. It doesn’t have to be this way. Mr. Trump and some of his supporters had good ideas for a reformed Republican Party that fuses conservative and populist elements into an alloy stronger than either on its own. This fusion may now seem like a dream, but it can still walk among us if Republicans will it to be so. They need only look back to the man they purport to revere, Ronald Reagan, to make it happen. We tend to forget that the Reagan coalition of the same three groups — non-Republican populists, fiscal conservatives and business Republicans — united behind coherent policy change. "
1351,"WASHINGTON — The fast-moving Republican effort to overhaul the tax code now rests in the hands of a small number of fence-sitting senators with disparate concerns, like how small businesses are taxed and whether health insurance costs will spike after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s requirement to have coverage or pay a penalty. Lawmakers face a challenge in navigating those competing priorities without rankling other members or running afoul of budget rules. For instance, dropping the repeal of the individual mandate from the bill would mollify the concerns of some but could alienate others who wish to see it included, while also upending the delicate fiscal math behind the Republican plan. On Sunday, President Trump fired off a Twitter broadside against one of those undecided senators, Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who is not seeking re-election next year. The president referred to him as “Sen. Jeff Flake(y),” declared him “unelectable” and offered a prediction: “He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is ‘toast.’ ” Mr. Flake, an unapologetic Trump critic, seemed unmoved by the declaration. “What the president says or does or feels has nothing whatsoever to do with how I will vote on that tax bill,” Mr. Flake said during a radio interview on Monday. “That’s just not how I operate.” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, wants the full Senate to consider the tax bill next week. Because Republicans hold a narrow 52-to-48 majority, party leaders can afford only two defections, assuming Democrats are unified against the bill and Vice President Mike Pence provides the tiebreaking vote. The math would grow even tighter if Democrats gain a seat in the special election for Senate in Alabama next month. The concerns expressed by Republican senators are hardly monolithic, and Mr. McConnell will have to walk a delicate line to resolve the issues without setting off additional objections from other lawmakers.

1352,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Showdown: The Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. Above, the company’s headquarters in Dallas. Federal officials argue that the deal would create a communications behemoth unrivaled in its ability to reach American homes. But a central component of the dispute is CNN — which President Trump has frequently attacked as a purveyor of “fake news.” AT&T said it would defend its merger in court. _____ 2. At the White House, President Trump returned North Korea to a list of state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea was on the list from 1987 to 2008 — but was taken off by President George W. Bush, when he was trying to salvage a nuclear deal. The designation will be accompanied by tougher sanctions. "
1353,"Last Thursday, after a photograph emerged of Senator Al Franken either groping or pretending to grope a sleeping woman, Leeann Tweeden, with whom he’d been traveling on a 2006 U.S.O. tour, I wrote that he should resign. Almost as soon as it was published I started having second thoughts. I spent all weekend feeling guilty that I’d called for the sacrifice of an otherwise decent man to make a political point. Then I saw the news that a woman named Lindsay Menz accused Franken of grabbing her butt while they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010, when he was a senator, and I read Franken’s lame non-denial: “I feel badly that Ms. Menz came away from our interaction feeling disrespected.” Yet I am still not sure I made the right call. My thinking last week, when the first accusation emerged, was: cauterize the wound. It doesn’t matter that Franken’s transgression wasn’t on the same level as the abuses that the Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore or Donald Trump have been accused of. That photo — the unconscious woman, the leering grin — is a weight Democrats shouldn’t have to carry, given that they’ve lately been insisting that it’s disqualifying for a candidate to grab a woman sexually against her will. It seemed cruel to expect Democratic women to make Jesuitical arguments that the shadows under Franken’s hands meant he wasn’t really touching Tweeden’s chest. Especially since, with a Democratic governor in Minnesota, the party would maintain control of Franken’s seat. But even as I made the case for resignation, I was relieved that it seemed as if Franken might stick around, because I adore him as a public figure. It’s easy to condemn morally worthless men like Trump; it’s much harder to figure out what should happen to men who make valuable political and cultural contributions, and whose alleged misdeeds fall far short of criminal. Learning about all the seemingly good guys who do shameful things is what makes this moment, with its frenzied pace of revelations, so painful and confounding. Personally, I’m torn by competing impulses. I want to see sexual harassment finally taken seriously but fear participating in a sex panic. My instinct is often to defend men I like, but I don’t want to be an enabler or a sucker. I try not to be a hypocrite, while being aware that the right plays on the media’s desire to seem fair-minded, which is part of what led to wildly excessive coverage of Hillary Clinton’s emails during the presidential campaign, among other distortions. It’s not a coincidence that the post-Harvey Weinstein purge of sexual harassers has been largely confined to liberal-leaning fields like Hollywood, media and the Democratic Party. This isn’t because progressive institutions are more sexist than others — I’m confident there’s at least as much sexual abuse in finance as in publishing. Rather, organizations with liberal values have suddenly become extremely responsive to claims of sexism. Feminists, enraged and traumatized by Donald Trump’s election, know they can’t expect accountability from Republicans, but they’ve forced it from people who claim to share their ideals. As a result, it sometimes feels as if liberal institutions are devouring themselves over sex while conservatives, unburdened by the pretense of caring about gender equality, blithely continue their misrule. "
1354,"WASHINGTON — American and Afghan warplanes conducted a series of strikes on Sunday night at what American officials said were Taliban drug depots, as part of what is expected to be a sustained campaign targeting the group’s $200 million-a-year opium trade. Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of the United States operations in Afghanistan, said that B-52 bombers and F-22 warplanes took part in the strikes, the first such attacks under new authorities granted by President Trump to officials conducting the war in Afghanistan. “Heroin’s become a global issue,” General Nicholson told reporters on Monday during a teleconference news briefing from Afghanistan. “These criminals living in Afghanistan who are closely linked to the Taliban are responsible for 85 percent of the world’s opium.” He said that the campaign against Taliban drug labs, which he said numbered about 400 to 500 across the country, would continue into the foreseeable future. The United States alone spends more than $8 billion to fight the drug trade. Regional experts suggest that the campaign is necessary, as the drug trade, estimated to make up at least 60 percent of the Taliban’s income, has helped sustain the war. The Taliban have recently turned to refining heroin from the country’s vast poppy production, which greatly increases their profits. For years, most of the harvest was smuggled out in the form of bulky opium syrup that was refined in other countries. But officials say that now, at least half of Afghan opium is processed in the country. "

1356,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump’s re-designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism may have dashed cautious hopes in the region that talks and diplomacy would replace escalating tensions and bellicose threats, analysts said on Tuesday. Despite a two-month hiatus in North Korea’s weapons tests, Mr. Trump has held to his policy of “maximum pressure,” restoring North Korea on Monday to Washington’s list of terrorism-sponsoring states, along with Iran, Sudan and Syria. The move, he said, would be followed by “the highest level of sanctions.” On Tuesday, Treasury Department officials announced a new round of sanctions aimed at disrupting the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. They were levied against Chinese trading companies and several North Korean shipping vessels and companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting Americans from engaging in transactions with them. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had described the sanctions on Monday as extensions of existing prohibitions. “It may, though, disrupt and dissuade some third parties,” he said. “This will close a few additional loopholes off.” Analysts said they doubted that new sanctions would make any real difference on the already heavily penalized country. If anything, they said, the designation will make diplomacy more difficult without increasing Washington’s leverage, warning that North Korea will probably take the naming and shaming as another reason to stick to its hard-line policy of developing and testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. “It’s hard to see any real impact on North Korea, which has lived through all manners of sanctions for seven decades,” said Paik Hak-soon, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization. “What it does instead is to send a clear message to North Korea that Trump is not interested in talks, another sign and reconfirmation that the Americans remain a hostile force.” "
1357,"Bret Stephens: I know we won’t end this conversation without a discussion of a certain candidate for the United States Senate from the Yellowhammer state. And yes, that’s a “Jeopardy!” answer for our readers. First, though, I wanted to mention how impressed I was by three recent columns by our colleagues Maureen Dowd, Ross Douthat and Michelle Goldberg. Each of them has written a powerful reappraisal of the pass that many liberals gave to Bill Clinton during his impeachment saga, and the consequences of that pass as we enter the #MeToo era. What do you think? Were liberals too soft on President Clinton back then, and how has that shaped the culture since? Gail Collins: Totally agree about the great writing by Michelle, Maureen and Ross. And I’ve been thinking about the Clinton-to-Roy-Moore matter constantly. Particularly about the bottom line when it comes to private versus public behavior. Imagine there’s a big election coming up, and one of the candidates is a guy with a terrible reputation for sexual misdeeds. And the other is a family man who spends his spare time building housing for the poor, who never even dated anybody before his wife of 35 years. But the hound dog is as close as a politician has ever come to supporting your exact hopes and dreams when it comes to both domestic policy and international affairs. And the man of honor is running on all the ideas you hate: say, a platform of doubling domestic spending and paying for it with new taxes on business. Plus he hangs out with every foreign leader who gives you nightmares. Which way would you go? Bret: I’m a big believer in the importance of character when it comes to any executive position, the presidency most of all. It’s one of the reasons I’ve opposed President Trump so strenuously. This is particularly true in my arguments with the conservatives who have shrugged at most of the president’s character defects because they agree with him on court nominees, or the Iran deal, or tax cuts or whatever. Policy decisions are always reversible. Trump’s moral defects are a permanent stain on the presidency itself. "
1358,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Sitting cross-legged on the floor of a sparsely decorated Kabul apartment, the young, bubbly woman told me why she lies to her neighbors. She tells them she’s a nurse when they inquire, as they always do. She leaves the house in civilian clothes and changes into her crisp uniform only when she’s on base. This Afghan woman in her 20s, who asked that her name not be used for her safety, is part of a small, brave group of women serving in Afghanistan’s security forces. If her neighbors found out, she says, they’d surely kill her. Sixteen years into a controversial United States-led war in Afghanistan — one billed in part as a mission to liberate Afghan women — the United States is pouring millions of dollars into bolstering the ranks of women in the police, the army and other branches of the security forces. Last fiscal year, the United States budgeted an additional $93.5 million to help increase recruitment of women and support them with suitable facilities, training and equipment. It’s a worthy cause: Research shows that more women in security forces, generally speaking, means more stable societies. And in Afghanistan in particular — a country where women and girls are still routinely killed for “offenses” as minor as refusing a marriage proposal — the idea of supporting measures that expand gender equality seems like an easy call. And yet as the young woman’s fears demonstrate, bolstering the ranks of women in security forces in a country like Afghanistan is not a simple numbers game. Through its hiring policies, the United States is trying to manufacture gender equality from the top down. In doing so, it is asking women to serve as the leading edge of change — a role that comes with great risks — often without providing adequate protection and support. This month, Afghans expressed their disgust and fury on social media over a graphic video in which a woman in the Afghan Air Force is pressured into having sex with a colonel whom she had asked for a promotion. Women in the security forces routinely face requests for sex, female Air Force members told me last week. If they want to keep their positions, they can almost never turn them down — and this colonel, in particular, was known for his predatory behavior. In this case, however, the woman, remarkably, surreptitiously recorded her encounter and leaked the video herself — even though taking a stand against harassment can itself result in death threats. "

Here’s what you need to know: • That’s the top antitrust regulator at the Justice Department, which sued on Monday to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. AT&T, which has a long history of run-ins with the government, defended the deal, arguing that the companies aren’t direct competitors and that the government hasn’t challenged a similar kind of merger in decades. • If allowed, the deal would create a media and telecommunications behemoth. AT&T is one of the largest internet and telephone providers in the U.S., and Time Warner’s properties include HBO, Warner Bros. and Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN. • About 59,000 people who arrived in the U.S. after an earthquake in Haiti in 2010 will be expected to leave by July 2019 or face deportation, Homeland Security officials said on Monday. Separately, President Trump announced that the U.S. would impose the “highest level of sanctions” against North Korea beginning today. He returned the country to a list of state sponsors of terrorism to try to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons. "
1360,"Update: The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday announced plans to dismantle net neutrality regulations, clearing the way for companies to charge more and block access to some websites. Read more here » WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission is preparing a full repeal of net neutrality rules that require broadband providers to give consumers equal access to all content on the internet, putting more power in the hands of those companies to dictate people’s online experiences. Ajit Pai, the chairman of the F.C.C., plans to reveal a sweeping proposal to scrap the net neutrality rules on Tuesday, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are not public. The rules, created during the Obama administration, prohibit broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or charging more for the delivery of certain internet content. The proposal will be presented in a December meeting of F.C.C. commissioners and is expected to pass in a 3-to-2 vote along party lines. A rollback of net neutrality regulations would represent a significant victory for broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast and would amount to a strike against consumers. When the rules were passed in 2015, they underlined the importance of high-speed internet to the lives of Americans and the need to more strongly regulate the communications service like a utility, as essential as electricity and the telephone. But under a repeal, companies like AT&T and Comcast may be able to charge people higher fees to access certain websites and online services. The companies may also be able to prioritize their own services while disadvantaging websites run by rivals. Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said. "

I would also welcome recommendations of a couple of free publications you particularly like. Email me at leonhardt@nytimes.com. I’ll share the results later this week. The middle-class tax hike. Each time Congress makes major changes to its tax bill, the independent tax experts who analyze bills need to do another analysis. Yesterday, the Tax Policy Center came out with a new overview of the Senate bill, and it was brutal. You can see a summary in the chart below. In brief, 98 percent of households making at least $5 million (roughly the top 1/1,000th of the income distribution) receive a tax cut by the time the bill is fully implemented. Only about 26 percent of those making less than $150,000 a year (roughly the bottom 4/5ths of the distribution) get a tax cut. The tax bill has a few decent ideas scattered in it. But it is, at root, an enormous tax cut for the very rich, financed by a combination of middle-class tax increases and deficit increases. "
1362,"A little more than a year ago, Cubans were exulting in the normalization of relations between their country and the United States after decades of trade and travel barriers. But on a recent trip to Havana, I found Cubans dismayed by President Trump’s reversal of the détente started by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Mr. Trump had appealed to older Cuban-Americans by taking a tough stance against the Castro regime on the campaign trail, and they helped him carry the Florida in the 2016 election. In August, reports surfaced of American and Canadian diplomats in Havana experiencing mysterious ailments that resulted in hearing losses and cognitive problems. The illnesses, which the United States government has suggested were caused by a “sonic weapon,” appear to have given Mr. Trump the pretext to fulfill his campaign promise and take a harder line on Cuba. The result is a return to a Cold War mentality and a set of failed policies that will do little to improve human rights in Cuba or to hasten the end of the Castro regime. The embargo imposed by the United States for more than 55 years only strengthened Cuba’s authoritarian government by restricting people’s access to opportunities to better their lives. With a return to Cold War-era policies, it is the Cuban people — not their government — who will suffer. Nearly two dozen American diplomats returned to the United States for medical treatment for ailments that included dizziness and nausea. The cause remains a deep mystery. Mr. Trump, providing no evidence, said he believed that the Cuban government was responsible. Yet many experts say it is unlikely that a sonic device could have caused the variety of symptoms experienced by the diplomats. The Cuban government has denied involvement in an attack. In a speech in Miami in June, Mr. Trump had promised that his administration would restrict travel to Cuba and prohibit financial transactions with businesses owned or managed by Cuban security services and the military. At the time, Mr. Trump’s critics held out hope that diplomatic relations, which Mr. Obama had upgraded to the embassy level, would continue and ensure a stable relationship. But in August, following the reports of the illnesses among diplomats, relations rapidly deteriorated. Hard-line Cuban-Americans, led by Senator Marco Rubio, pressured the administration, which later reduced the American Embassy staff in Havana by more than half and ordered an equivalent drawdown of staff at the Cuban Embassy in Washington. The State Department issued a warning advising Americans not to travel to Cuba. "
1363,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) When Scott Michaels began the “Helter Skelter” tour about eight years ago, he offered it roughly once a month. Now, he guides people around the sites of the Manson family murders at least once a weekend, often selling out weeks in advance. The three-and-a-half-hour tour is often filled with middle-age adults who were children during the murder spree that Charles Manson, who died Sunday, orchestrated in the summer of 1969. “There’s seemingly no end to it,” said Mr. Michaels, who runs several other tours through Dearly Departed, his company and museum. “A lot of it has to do with the feeling that this scared us all. Up until then you thought you were safe in your own bed.” The fact that the murders happened “in the sanctuary of the home” contributed to much of the fear that captivated people at the time, said Steve Oney, who wrote an oral history of the killings for Los Angeles Magazine in 2009. “It was the modern L.A. noir murder because Manson’s cohorts butchered people in their homes and this is a city of homes,” Mr. Oney said. “Until then, this was a very open city, a very porous city, and people weren’t necessarily guarded.” "
1364,"President Trump’s administration is scrambling its media signals. The Department of Justice on Monday sued to block AT&T’s merger with Time Warner over concerns that the two would use content to stiff rivals. But another agency intends to scrap rules that force internet providers to treat web traffic equally. Trying to stop AT&T’s $85 billion offer for HBO’s parent is an unusual move in itself. The success of M&A transactions based on a similar vertical structure, such as Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, certainly left executives at the two companies convinced that their deal would sail through. A Republican-led White House and Congress ought to have bolstered their chances, too, as the Republican Party usually champions looser rules that favor business. In its complaint, the Justice Department cited fears that AT&T could use its ownership of series like “Game of Thrones” and sports rights to, say, NBA games to force other distributors to pay more to carry the content. Any rival that balked at ponying up, for example, could lose access to the programming; AT&T might then screen it exclusively over its own network in the hope of signing up more customers. By contrast, the Federal Communications Commission is in the process of dismantling regulation known as net neutrality, which prevents providers — like AT&T — from throttling the traffic of other programmers. The telecom company and others like it could give its own TV shows and movies priority over other content. The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, who earlier remarked that he planned to take a weed whacker to previous statutes, is also lifting a ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV stations in the same market and making it easier for broadcasters to gobble up peers. The Trump administration and tight coordination of policy are hardly synonymous, so it’s not surprising that watchdogs are roaming all over the field. It stands in contrast to President Barack Obama’s tenure, when the F.C.C. and the Justice Department looked to the same lodestar for guidance on competition. The commission ushered in net neutrality rules that played a part in the Justice Department’s harsh view of Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable. Under Mr. Trump, though, the confused approach makes for a blurry regulatory picture. "
1365,"In 2010, Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency, bought a controlling interest in Uranium One, a Canadian-based company that owned valuable extraction rights in Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia. These three countries are the world’s largest uranium producers, and Russia’s acquisition of those rights served its ambitions to build and fuel nuclear power plants around the world. In an ancillary part of the deal, Rosatom also bought mining rights in the United States, where uranium production is sparse. These rights were initially estimated to represent 20 percent of American production, but in practice, this figure has averaged less than 10 percent. Overall, Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One transferred control of what now amounts to about 8 percent of world uranium output. The American portion represented about one-thirtieth of the deal. At the time, none of this was considered remarkable or controversial. The governments of Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia approved the transfer as a normal commercial transaction. Similarly, the United States’ part of the deal was authorized by a panel of officials from nine federal agencies — including the State Department, then led by Hillary Clinton. But in 2016, in the run-up to the presidential campaign, the sale became notorious. A growing chorus of Trump supporters claimed that the sale didn’t happen for business reasons, but in exchange for millions in donations by people associated with Uranium One to the Clinton Foundation, led by Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton. The allegation appeared in a 2015 book, “Clinton Cash,” by Peter Schweizer, a collaborator of Steve Bannon, then head of Breitbart News and later Donald Trump’s chief strategist. Mainstream news organizations, including The New York Times, investigated the deal, and it became the subject of near daily attacks from Breitbart News itself. At campaign rallies, Mr. Trump routinely led chants of “Lock her up” in reference to Mrs. Clinton. Now Mr. Trump, whose campaign is under investigation by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, for possibly collaborating with Russia to manipulate voters last year, is calling once more for an investigation of the deal. In response, the Justice Department is examining whether to assign a special counsel to review the case. Two Republican-led congressional committees have also started investigations. "
1366,"The Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites. The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services. The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points. “Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” Mr. Pai said in a statement. “Instead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them.” Mr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14. The two other Republicans on the commission generally vote with Mr. Pai, giving them a majority over the two Democrats. Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington — and directly to the public — as they did when the current rules were adopted. "
1367,"WASHINGTON — United States officials have tried in recent weeks to cool tensions over the North American Free Trade Agreement by extending the timetable for renegotiating the pact and asking top officials to sit out the current round of talks in Mexico City. But as the fifth round of talks concluded in the Mexican capital on Tuesday, tensions were still simmering, with Canada and Mexico telling the United States that it would make little headway with its current approach and Mexico firing its first warning shot with a tough counterproposal. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, took aim at his Canadian and Mexican counterparts on Tuesday, saying “thus far, we have seen no evidence that Canada or Mexico are willing to seriously engage on provisions that will lead to a rebalanced agreement. Absent rebalancing, we will not reach a satisfactory result.” Mr. Lighthizer said while some progress has been made to modernize Nafta, “I remain concerned about the lack of headway. Our teams will be meeting again next month in Washington. I hope our partners will come to the table in a serious way so we can see meaningful progress before the end of the year.” In an indication of how far the talks have to go, Mr. Lighthizer will not meet again with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts until late January in Montreal, while lower-level negotiators will continue to hash out details in Washington next month. During a week of meetings in Mexico City, negotiators hammered out more technical details of the sweeping trade agreement, including those that govern digital trade, telecommunications, anti-corruption, customs procedures and health and safety standards for food. "
1368,"The police in Germany arrested six Syrian migrants on Tuesday, suspected of plotting an attack and having links to the Islamic State, fanning fears that extremists posing as refugees were targeting Europe. Millions of refugees, buffeted by conflict and civil war, have streamed into Europe in recent years, including an estimated one million who came to Germany in 2015. But while many Germans initially welcomed Chancellor Angela Merkel’s embrace of the refugees, viewing it as a powerful emblem of openness and liberalism, a backlash has been simmering after a spate of attacks across the continent. Germans have dark memories of an attack in December, when Anis Amri, a Tunisian who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, hijacked a truck and plowed through a  Christmas market in central Berlin, killing at least a dozen people. On Tuesday, Christian Hartwig, a spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office, said that 500 police officers had stormed eight apartments in the German cities of Essen, Hanover, Kassel and Leipzig in early morning raids, and arrested the suspects. The men, ages 20 to 28, had been posing as refugees, Mr. Hartwig said. He said the men were suspected of acting on behalf of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and were planning an attack using weapons or explosives. They had arrived in Germany between December 2014 and September 2015, he added, a period when millions of refugees were heading to Europe. All six had applied for asylum, though Mr. Hartwig did not say if they had been granted that status. The German newspaper Die Welt said that several cellphones, laptops and documents had been seized during the raids. It said that the suspects had arrived in Germany using fake identity papers and that the arrests had followed a tip from other refugees. "
1369,"WASHINGTON — For two decades, Representative Dana Rohrabacher has been of value to the Kremlin, so valuable in recent years that the F.B.I. warned him in 2012 that Russia regarded him as an intelligence source worthy of a Kremlin code name. The following year, the California Republican became even more valuable, assuming the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee that oversees Russia policy. He sailed to re-election again and again, even as he developed ties to Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia. Then came President Trump. As revelations of Russia’s campaign to influence American politics consume Washington, Mr. Rohrabacher, 70, who had no known role in the Trump election campaign, has come under political and investigative scrutiny. The F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee are each seeking to interview him about an August meeting with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Rohrabacher said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s short-lived national security adviser. At the same time, fellow Republicans — questioning his judgment and intentions — have moved to curtail his power as chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats. And back home in Southern California, where Democrats and Republicans alike smell blood, the 15-term congressman is facing his toughest re-election contest in decades, with well-funded candidates from both parties lining up to unseat him. “I feel like I’m in good shape politically,” he said breezily during an interview last week, a day before he voted against his party’s tax bill. “My constituents couldn’t care less about this. They are not concerned about Russia. They are concerned about the taxes on their home. They are concerned about illegal immigrants coming into their neighborhood and raping people.” Nor is Mr. Rohrabacher, a self-proclaimed veteran of international intrigue, all that perturbed by the interest of federal and congressional investigators. He said he would talk to them when scheduling allows. "
1370,"WASHINGTON — An American military airstrike on Tuesday killed more than 100 people who were identified by the Pentagon as being affiliated with the Islamic militant group Shabab, continuing a stepped-up pace against targets in Somalia, officials said. The United States Africa Command said in a statement that the airstrike was carried out 125 miles northwest of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. The strike comes after President Trump relaxed restrictions on American military commanders in Somalia. Separately, the command also said that it conducted airstrikes in Libya, on Friday and Sunday, against Islamic State militants. Defense officials did not indicate how many people were killed in those attacks. The Trump administration has escalated its campaign to defeat the Shabab, the group responsible for the 2013 attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya. The siege on the upscale mall, where dozens were killed, heightened American concerns that the Shabab’s desire to inflict casualties extended beyond its base in Somalia. For more than a decade, the United States has been trying to fight the Shabab through economic sanctions, missile strikes and commando raids. In 2014, President Barack Obama increased lethal efforts against the extremist group, including an American drone strike that killed the leader of the Shabab, Ahmed Abdi Godane, one of the most wanted men in Africa at the time. But the organization has come back and continues to prove to be a potent and resilient killing force. "
1371,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Thanking Russia for the military intervention he credited for “saving Syria,” President Bashar al-Assad met with President Vladimir V. Putin amid preparations for new talks aimed at ending the civil war. Mr. Assad’s visit on Monday to the Russian resort town of Sochi was made public on Tuesday, a day before a summit meeting there for the leaders of Iran, Turkey and Russia, who have taken an increasingly prominent role in diplomacy with Syria while the United States has put Mr. Assad’s fate on the back burner. Russian officials have said that their aim is to ensure Mr. Assad’s support for a political process to end a conflict that began more than six years ago. But Mr. Assad has consistently resisted compromise with his Syrian opponents, and doubts remain about how much Russia is willing, or able, to push him to accept significant changes like substantive power sharing or reforms. In another signal that political change in Syria is less and less an international priority, in a phone conversation with Mr. Putin on Tuesday that lasted more than an hour and was mostly about Syria, President Trump did not bring up the issue of political transition, an administration official said. Instead, the White House said the two leaders agreed on the importance of stability, ending the war, fighting terrorism and allowing refugees to go home. The declarations of military victory may also be premature: The Islamic State has lost much of its territory, but its fighters remain an insurgent threat and armed opposition groups still hold significant sections of the country. It was Mr. Assad’s second known trip abroad since the civil war in his country began in 2011; he visited  Moscow in 2015, soon after Russia began its pivotal air campaign in support of his forces. The Sochi stop came as his other main allies, Iran and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, declared that they had defeated the Islamic State in its last major Syrian stronghold, Bukamal, near the Iraqi border. "
1372,"BRUSSELS — The European Union has long had to deal with the challenge of being led by a dominant Germany. But suddenly it finds itself facing a different realization — the only thing worse than a strong Germany may be a weak one. Germany is hardly collapsing, but the failure of Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a coalition government presents a profound crisis of leadership for Europe and a protracted period of uncertainty, at a time when it can least afford it. Serious decisions on the eurozone, migration, asylum, defense and other issues — let alone negotiating Britain’s exit from the bloc — were already put off until after the French and German elections this year. Now they will be further delayed, waiting for plodding Germany to work through this new political quandary. The looming sense of paralysis is a credit to the stature Ms. Merkel has gained in 12 years as chancellor. She defined Europe’s response to the euro debt crisis. Along the way, she has borne criticism for German overweening. But she has also earned respect for her ability to forge compromise. She has been central in forcing through stiff sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, winning praise in Europe for standing up to both President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. "
1373,"Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, made a relaxed appearance at New York University on Tuesday night, answering questions about her life in economics and her time at the Fed one day after she announced plans to leave the central bank next year. Ms. Yellen said nothing new about the Fed’s policy plans for the coming months, leaving unaltered the widespread expectation that the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-December. Instead, Ms. Yellen entertained the audience with her description of her first day at the Fed almost four years ago, and a firsthand report on the typical topics of conversation at her dinner table. “We do have a heavier dose of economics in our diet than some might find appetizing,” she said. Ms. Yellen announced Monday in a letter to President Trump that she would step down from the Fed’s board at the same time she ends her term as Fed chairwoman in early February. Mr. Trump has nominated Jerome H. Powell to succeed Ms. Yellen as the Fed’s chairman. On Tuesday, Ms. Yellen kept a longstanding engagement to be interviewed on a stage at the Stern School of Business by Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England. In one of her final public appearances as the Fed’s chairwoman, Ms. Yellen answered questions about policy in her trademark clear and steady style that has eliminated much of the guesswork that was once required to divine the Fed’s intentions. "
1374,"SEOUL, South Korea — Fully armed North Korean troops violated the truce that halted the 1950-53 Korean War when they fired weapons across the border last week while chasing a fellow Communist soldier defecting to South Korea, the United Nations Command said on Wednesday. One of the North Korean chasers briefly crossed the borderline before turning back in a hurry, another violation of the Korean War armistice, the command said. The American-led United Nations Command, which oversees the armistice, notified the North Korean People’s Army of its findings and demanded a meeting to discuss ways to prevent future violations, the command said in a statement. The command also released closed-circuit television footage that illustrated the North Korean’s dramatic defection through the Joint Security Area north of Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Nov. 13. It was a close escape for the soldier, who bolted toward the border line just yards ahead of former comrades who had started to shoot. At the signing of the Korean War armistice, a 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone, or DMZ, was created to keep the warring sides apart, and the heavily guarded Joint Security Area serves as the only point along the DMZ where troops from both sides face off, separated by only a few feet. They could also meet there to discuss enforcing the truce. According to the footage, the defector sped a drab, olive-colored military jeep along a tree-lined road and into the Joint Security Area after crossing a North Korean landmark known as the 72-Hour Bridge. "
1375,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is investigating whether three service members assigned to the White House broke curfew and had improper contact with foreign women while traveling this month with President Trump in Asia, Defense Department officials said Tuesday. The three service members, all assigned to the White House Communications Agency as part of a military unit that sets up secure communications for the president, have been reassigned pending the investigation, the officials said. The allegations of improper contact were first reported by The Washington Post. Laura Seal, a Pentagon spokeswoman, confirmed the investigation. The communications agency serves as a unit dedicated to providing both routine and emergency communications for the president, wherever he may be. The allegations come three months after four service members from the same agency were accused of consorting with foreign women after-hours in a secure area in Panama, as they prepared for a visit there by Vice President Mike Pence. Those service members were flown home before Mr. Pence arrived. "
1376,"David Cassidy, the actor, singer and teen heartthrob best known as the band member with the green eyes and the feathered haircut on “The Partridge Family,” the 1970s television show about a family band, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 67. His publicist, Jo-Ann Geffen, said the cause was liver failure. Mr. Cassidy, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, had recently been admitted to the hospital in critical condition. Mr. Cassidy rose to fame on “The Partridge Family” playing Keith Partridge, the eldest of five children in a family that forms a band and goes on tour in a multicolored bus. His character, a high school student, was swooned over by young women as he learned to navigate his newfound fame. It was 1970, with the turbulent late 1960s of the Vietnam War, race riots, psychedelia, Woodstock and Altamont barely past, when Mr. Cassidy got the lead role on the show. “The Partridge Family” was produced by Screen Gems, which had also been the company behind “The Monkees,” another sitcom about a pop band, which had its own heartthrob in Davy Jones. Mr. Cassidy had a face youthful enough to portray a teenager, a shy smile and friendly eyes, and he could sing well enough to portray Keith Partridge without having to lip-sync someone else’s voice. Even in the FM-radio heyday of Black Sabbath, the Allman Brothers and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, there was a place for a well-groomed, unthreatening young pop singer. Mr. Cassidy became one of the teen idols of the early 1970s, arriving between Bobby Sherman and Donny Osmond and decades before Justin Timberlake or Charlie Puth. He was marketed through Top 40 radio and fan magazines as a wholesome fantasy figure for girls. "
1377,"WASHINGTON — President Trump broke with leading Republicans on Tuesday and voiced support for Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama who has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers and has seen his campaign’s prospects imperiled. In his first extensive remarks on the accusations that date back decades, the president cited the vigorous denials by Mr. Moore, who is facing off in a high-stakes special election against Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate. “He totally denies it,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Moore, who has been accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl and sexually assaulting another teenager. Mr. Trump also said he was “very happy” that women in the United States are now coming forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against lawmakers and media figures, many of them Democrats. Asked by a reporter about whether electing “a child molester” was better than electing a Democrat in the Alabama race, Mr. Trump responded by insisting that Mr. Moore denies the charges against him. “He says it didn’t happen,” the president told reporters at the White House. “You have to listen to him, also.” "
1378,"In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass. Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate. On Monday, the Department of Justice sued to block AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, a deal that would unite one of the country’s biggest internet providers with the company that owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film studio. It was a signal from antitrust enforcers that an era of breakneck consolidation might be coming to an end, and that mergers would be evaluated by a new set of standards. Then on Tuesday morning, the Federal Communications Commission announced plans to dismantle net neutrality rules. The move would let companies charge higher fees and block access to some websites, and was effectively a green light for big internet service providers — including AT&T — to freely wield their influence against rivals. In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies. But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future. "
1379,"WASHINGTON — A second federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s proposed ban on transgender troops Tuesday, saying President Trump’s announcement of the ban in a series of tweets this summer was “capricious, arbitrary, and unqualified.” In a preliminary injunction, Judge Marvin J. Garbis of the Federal District Court for Maryland halted a policy that would have discharged all current transgender troops and barred prospective ones from enlisting, saying it likely violated equal protection provisions of the Constitution. Judge Garbis’s 53-page order went further than a similar ruling last month by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, which also said the ban likely violated the Constitution. “There is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender people would have any negative effective on the military at all,” the ruling said. But while Judge Kollar-Kotelly did not specifically block a Trump administration policy prohibiting gender-reassignment surgery for service members at the government’s expense, Judge Garbis’s order does. The ruling leaves in place an Obama-era policy, announced in 2016, that allows transgender troops to serve openly and receive the required medical care for their gender transition through the military. Shortly after the ruling the Trump administration appealed last month’s decision, signaling it would continue to press for the removal of transgender troops. In July, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the military could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender troops, and that the government “will not accept or allow them to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” A presidential memorandum released in August said all transgender service troops would be discharged. "
1380,"Fox News’s prime time has tilted Trump-ward this year, adding the talk-radio personality Laura Ingraham to the White House-friendly lineup of Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. On Tuesday, the network announced that another hard-line conservative is set to join its ranks: Mark Levin, one of the country’s most prominent right-wing radio hosts, who will host a weekly Sunday show starting in February. Mr. Levin is an influential figure in conservative circles whose radio show is syndicated on more than 300 stations. He rivals his fellow talk-radio hosts, Mr. Hannity and Ms. Ingraham, in audience size, but not in name recognition, a situation that could change with his new perch on Fox News. A champion of tea party politics who also served in the Ronald Reagan administration, Mr. Levin is an idiosyncratic conservative who, in the midst of last year’s Republican primary, declared that he would never vote for Donald J. Trump. By last September, he changed his mind, and in an interview on Tuesday, he acknowledged that he recently visited the president in the Oval Office. “It was very positive, very friendly,” Mr. Levin said of his conversation with Mr. Trump. “No plotting or planning or conspiracy theories of any sort.” Although Mr. Levin may fly below the radar of many liberals, he was in the news in March when he informed radio listeners about a “big scandal”: that President Obama had wiretapped Mr. Trump’s campaign. There was no evidence supporting that claim, but Mr. Trump picked up on it anyway, accusing Mr. Obama of spying on him and setting off a political storm. Speaking by phone on Tuesday from Virginia, where he is based, Mr. Levin spoke admiringly, if wryly, about Mr. Trump. “I don’t wed myself or tie myself to any particular politician,” Mr. Levin said. “On the other hand, I don’t see my role as trying to sabotage the president, either.” Mr. Levin said he had visited the White House at the invitation of Vice President Mike Pence, a longtime friend. “It was a social lunch,” he said, “and then I was told that the president would like to say hello.” His Fox News program, “Life, Liberty & Levin,” will involve “in-depth interviews with people of consequence — some of them will be prominent, some of them won’t be,” Mr. Levin said. “I want to cover history and philosophy and politics and economics, and of course, emphasize Americanism: our founding principles, our constitution and the Declaration of Independence.” Like Ms. Ingraham and Mr. Hannity, Mr. Levin plans to continue his daily radio duties. Asked if he ever expected to host a Fox News show, Mr. Levin said, “I never really envisioned it.” “I just try and do the best I can at what I’m doing,” Mr. Levin added. “That said, I think it’s a wonderful opportunity, for me and for them.” "
1381,"Very few criminal prosecutions in New York have likely drawn as much public criticism from a foreign leader as that of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was charged along with eight other defendants with conspiring to evade the United States sanctions on Iran. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called the charges a plot against the Turkish Republic, and raised the issue in a phone call with President Trump in September. Turkey’s foreign minister claimed that the prosecution’s evidence was concocted by Gulenists, a movement led by an Islamic cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania; the movement has been banned in Turkey as a terrorist group and blamed by Mr. Erdogan for the failed coup in 2016. On Saturday, Turkey opened an investigation of Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan whose office filed the original charges, and of his successor, Joon H. Kim, who is overseeing a trial in the case that starts next week. On Tuesday, Mr. Kim and the judge, Richard M. Berman, took the unusual step of responding publicly to the Turkish officials’ criticism. Mr. Kim, the acting United States attorney, said he was aware of claims that the prosecution was “being driven by domestic Turkish politics” and that his office, the Justice Department and the court had been “infiltrated by Gulenists.” “Needless to say, it’s our view that those claims are ridiculous on their face,” Mr. Kim said. He added, “It displays a fundamental misunderstanding or lack of understanding of how our system of justice works and, frankly, the rule of law works.” "
1382,"The Trump administration’s lawsuit to block AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner not only threatens an enormous corporate deal. It also has ignited a guessing game on Wall Street about whether the booming market for mergers and acquisitions is about to be derailed. Roughly $2.78 trillion worth of deals have been announced worldwide so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters. While that is down 2.7 percent from the same period last year, 2017 ranks as the third-best year for mergers over the past decade. But the Justice Department’s lawsuit on Monday to block the $85.4 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal could rapidly cool the deal-making climate. The fundamental question is this: Is the lawsuit taking aim at one particular transaction, or is it a signal that the White House is opposed to corporate consolidation in general? After all, President Trump specifically denounced the deal on the campaign trail last year. “Is it idiosyncratic, or a different perspective on what the regulatory framework to going to be? We don’t know yet,” said Blair Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a boutique bank that has been an adviser on many deals this year. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump weighed in again on the deal. “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country,” he said outside the White House. “I think your pricing is going to go up.” Nobody expects the lawsuit to shut off the deals spigot. Big companies still have reasons aplenty to pursue mergers and acquisitions — not least, the rapid, technology-fueled transformations of many industries — and the possibility of government opposition is just one factor influencing their decisions. “This event does not eliminate the need for transformational events or scale in these industries,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder of the investment bank LionTree and an adviser on media deals. Yet Mr. Bourkoff and others said the specter of government opposition to mergers had begun to weigh on deal makers’ minds. Investment bankers said they were especially wary of mergers that affected big consumer brands or could lead to job losses. The Justice Department lawsuit, Mr. Bourkoff said, “has created a heightened level of uncertainty in the deal environment.” Few, for example, believe that Comcast — which is in discussions to buy significant portions of 21st Century Fox — would be allowed to complete that potential deal unless the Justice Department was defeated in its AT&T lawsuit. In its suit, Justice Department lawyers argued that AT&T would amass enough power by acquiring Time Warner to undermine competitors and raise prices for consumers. But on a conference call on Monday, a Justice Department official argued that the regulator was not reflexively opposed to so-called vertical mergers, which combine companies from two different industries, as a union of AT&T and Time Warner would do. Mr. Effron said there still were more compelling reasons to pursue mergers than not. But, he added, there is now a greater need to “factor in the downside.” "
1383,"It was just a month ago this Friday that Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican, rose in the Senate to insist that we “must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue,” laying a hefty share of the blame for it on “the tone set up at the top.” He used those remarks to condemn President Trump for “the daily sundering of our country.” He lashed out at the president’s “flagrant disregard for truth and decency” and uttered the syllables “enough.” It was some speech. And if he follows it by handing Trump a victory on tax reform, it was merely that: words. Pretty, yes. But pointless in the end. The House of Representatives has already approved its own legislation to overhaul the nation’s tax code. The Senate’s version could come to a vote as soon as next week. No Democrat in the chamber supports it, so the G.O.P. can afford to lose only two members of its caucus. Along with the votes of a few other Republicans, Flake’s is in doubt, and that colored another chapter of feuding between him and the president over recent days. Flake attended a town hall in Arizona and, apparently unaware that his microphone was still on, said that if Republicans “become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast.” Trump took this in customary stride, which is to say that he fired up his Twitter account and mocked “Sen. Jeff Flake(y),” who, he predicted, would “be a NO on tax cuts.” Flake responded that he had not made up his mind. "
1384,"SPOKANE, Wash. — Six years ago, a police officer in this city in eastern Washington was convicted of beating a disabled man to death and trying to cover it up. After other alarming episodes involving Spokane officers came to light, the city asked federal officials to suggest changes to the police department as part of an Obama-era policing program. Ever since, use of force by officers has declined, as have complaints from residents. “It is a great program,” said Craig Meidl, the Spokane police chief. “As a C.E.O. of a law enforcement organization, you’ll appreciate having an outsider come in and give you advice.” But in September, the Justice Department announced it would significantly scale back the program, known as the collaborative reform initiative, and reorient it toward more hands-off “technical assistance.” The decision to soften what was already a voluntary program was aligned with the Trump administration’s general approach to law enforcement — cracking down on violent crime, not regulating the police departments that fight it. The changes to collaborative reform reflect the administration’s broader effort to overhaul programs that the Obama administration used to ease tensions between communities and the police, according to interviews with current and former law enforcement officials and documents obtained through freedom of information laws. Since President Trump took office, for example, the Justice Department has not entered into a single court-monitored consent decree with a troubled police department, even in towns with widespread constitutional violations, records show. It has also ordered reviews of existing consent decrees — which are a tougher, more punitive alternative to the collaborative reform initiative — negotiated under President Barack Obama’s Justice Department. The changes, designed to ease pressure on law enforcement, have actually encountered some resistance from police chiefs in cities that participated in the programs. And those chiefs work not only in big-city Democratic strongholds, but also in places like Spokane, which has a Republican mayor and is the largest city in a county that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump. "
1385,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The F.C.C. unveiled a plan to repeal net neutrality rules, which require broadband providers to give consumers equal access to all content on the web. The F.C.C. chairman appointed by President Trump, Ajit Pai, above, said the change would allow the government to stop “micromanaging the internet.” It’s expected to be approved on Dec. 14 in a party-line vote by the agency’s five commissioners. But some companies will probably put up a legal fight to prevent it from taking hold. This video explains how net neutrality works. In other business news, Uber announced that hackers gained access to the personal data of 57 million drivers and riders — and the company kept it a secret for a year. It has since fired its top security executive. "
1386,"(Updated: On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality, rules that regulated the businesses that connect consumers to the internet.) For you and me, the repeal of net neutrality can be boiled down to two questions: What might happen? And whom do you trust? Here’s our guide for internet users looking for answers. The net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 during the Obama administration when Democrats controlled the F.C.C. The goal was to adapt regulations in such a way as to acknowledge the essential role of high-speed internet access as a gateway to modern communication, information, entertainment and economic opportunity. So the F.C.C. opted to regulate broadband service as a utility — making the internet the digital equivalent of electricity and the telephone. The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast have argued that utility-style regulation represents unnecessary government meddling that will reduce their incentives to invest and improve service. The result, they say, will be worse service for everyone in the long run. The biggest concern is that the internet will become pay-to-play technology with two tiers: one that has speedy service and one that doesn’t. The high-speed lane would be occupied by big internet and media companies, and affluent households. For everyone else there would be the slow lane. "
1387,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is threatening to sue Harvard University to force it to turn over student and applicant records, as the Justice Department presses forward with an unusual civil rights investigation into whether the university’s affirmative-action admissions practices amount to unlawful discrimination, documents show. The investigation, which came to light in August, centers on a complaint filed in 2015 asserting that Harvard, in seeking to ensure a racially diverse student body, is illegally discriminating against Asian applicants. It mirrors the allegations in a lawsuit against Harvard filed by a group called Students for Fair Admissions, a nonprofit formed to challenge the use of race in college admissions. In August, the Justice Department set up a special project in its Civil Rights Division — run out of its front office, where political appointees work, rather than its education section — to scrutinize race-conscious college admissions practices. After initially refusing to talk about it, the department said it was looking at a complaint filed on behalf of Asian applicants, describing it in a way that clearly matched the Harvard dispute. Letters that emerged Tuesday between Civil Rights Division officials and Seth P. Waxman, a former solicitor general who is representing Harvard, show that little has progressed since then because of an impasse over access to Harvard’s applicant records. In a letter to Mr. Waxman last week, John M. Gore, the acting assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, accused Harvard of dragging its feet on turning over the material and threatened to sue if the university failed to meet a Dec. 1 deadline. “More than two months have passed since our September meeting, and Harvard has not yet produced a single document,” Mr. Gore wrote. “We sincerely hope that Harvard will quickly correct its noncompliance and return to its collaborative approach.” "
1388,"WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority. “Oh, Drumstick, I think, is going to be very happy.” It ended with characteristic introspection. “I feel so good about myself,” the president said softly, appraising his own clemency, laying a hand on the bird after seeking permission to touch it from turkey professionals. Mr. Trump looked upon the crowd in the Rose Garden and announced his decision: The animal was hereby pardoned for the crime of being born a turkey. Such was Mr. Trump’s inaugural take on a Washington tradition that seems to exist mostly because it existed the year before, a sort of “Apprentice” for the long-necked set, superimposed on the White House for a statelier feel. “Very special people, a very special country,” Mr. Trump summarized, a bit mechanically, before heading off to Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday. "
1389,"WASHINGTON — Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, moved swiftly on Tuesday against the House’s longest-serving lawmaker, calling for the House Ethics Committee to investigate sexual harassment charges against Representative John Conyers Jr., the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Conyers, 88, who has represented parts of the Detroit area in the House since 1965, confirmed the settlement of a wrongful termination complaint in 2015 from a staff member who had accused him of sexual harassment. But he denied that the staff member was fired for refusing to have sex with him. The settlement was first reported by BuzzFeed News on Monday. Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats on the Judiciary Committee offered little support, and the Ethics Committee said it had opened an investigation. “Any credible allegation of sexual harassment must be investigated by the Ethics Committee,” Ms. Pelosi said, adding that there should be “zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, bullying or abuse in the House.” President Trump weighed in on the widening sexual harassment scandal on Capitol Hill, saying that Congress should release the names of lawmakers who have settled harassment claims. The president has himself been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, including harassment and assault, and has called his accusers liars. But on Tuesday, he praised women for speaking out. “Women are very special. I think it’s a very special time because a lot of things are coming out, and I think that’s good for our society, and I think it’s very, very good for women,” Mr. Trump said. “And I’m very happy a lot of these things are coming out, and I’m very happy it’s being exposed.” "
1390,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will soon have to decide whether to impose the types of tariffs on imported products that he has long championed after a federal body again recommended stiff levies, this time on foreign-made washing machines. The United States International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial body that rules on trade cases, unanimously recommended that the president take action to limit imports of washers, a move that could help the domestic manufacturer Whirlpool better compete with its foreign rivals Samsung and LG. The trade officials recommended that the United States impose what is known as a “tariff-rate quota” — a tax on imports that would go into effect after a certain number of foreign products entered the American market. In this case, they recommended that the United States impose a tariff starting at 50 percent on all washers imported after the first 1.2 million units for the next three years, with the tariff rate to decrease slightly in the next few years. Two of the four commissioners issuing the decision also recommended an additional charge. The trade body will submit its recommendations on Dec. 5 to Mr. Trump, who will have to make a final decision by February. A decision to impose tariffs could further exacerbate trade tensions with South Korea, which is home to Samsung and LG. While South Korea has typically been a strong economic and strategic partner of the United States, particularly in dealing with North Korea, Mr. Trump has taken a more antagonistic approach to a foreign ally. South Korean officials said they would wait to see whether the result would breach the rules of the World Trade Organization. “We will make our best effort along with the industry to ensure that the final decision minimizes damage to Korean companies by reaching out to the U.S. administration, Congress, local governments and other officials to proactively explain our position,” said Kang Sung-cheon, the country’s deputy minister of trade. "
1391,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Late-night hosts on Monday found easy inspiration in President Trump’s latest Twitter feud. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump helped persuade the Chinese government to release three U.C.L.A. basketball players accused of shoplifting. LaVar Ball, the father of one of the players, has repeatedly expressed skepticism about how important Mr. Trump’s role was in getting his son released — something that appears to have left Mr. Trump incensed. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert revisited a tweet Mr. Trump sent last week, immediately after the players’ release had been secured.

1392,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Robert Mugabe — who once proclaimed that “Only God will remove me!” — resigned as president of Zimbabwe shortly after lawmakers started impeachment proceedings. Jubilant residents poured into the streets at what seemed to be an abrupt capitulation from the world’s longest-serving head of state. Mr. Mugabe, 93, said he was stepping down for “the welfare of the people.” Zimbabwe will have a new leader for the first time in 37 years. This video looks at the mix of hope and skepticism its people have about the future. _____ • The U.S. authorities are holding a former Hong Kong government official and a former foreign minister of Senegal on charges of bribing high-level officials in Chad and Uganda. Prosecutors said the money was meant to secure contracts for a mysterious, private Chinese conglomerate, CEFC China Energy, which has global ambitions and enormous wealth. "
1393,"The Trump administration is making it harder to find government information about climate change on the web. If you searched Google for the words “climate change” a little over six months ago, one of the first hits would have been the Environmental Protection Agency’s website. But that was before April 28, when the agency began systematically dismantling its climate change website, which had survived Democratic and Republican administrations and was a leading source of information on a global problem that the president, as a candidate, labeled “a hoax.” If you search those words today, a link to the E.P.A. site may not appear until the second or third search results page, and sometimes not even then, depending on your browser settings. The site has fallen in Google’s search results because its address, or URL, no longer directs you to the climate change site or a related page. If you click that link, you’ll be redirected to a notice page that says, “We are currently updating our website to reflect E.P.A.’s priorities under the leadership” of President Trump and Scott Pruitt, the agency’s administrator. That page, in turn, contains a link to an archived version of the E.P.A.’s website. Well, you might think, at least the old site has been preserved. But the archive is far from complete. A significant number of pages and PDFs are not available, and entire portions of the site, like the Student’s Guide to Global Climate Change, have been left out. Some of these pages and PDFs can no longer be found anywhere within the government’s web presence. The E.P.A. climate-related web pages that are still live continue to provide valuable information, but many links from those pages to other pages have been removed. And now-broken links that previously led to the E.P.A. climate change pages are scattered across federal and nonfederal websites. Since January, our organization, the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, has monitored changes to tens of thousands of web pages across federal agencies. While we haven’t found examples of altered data, it is clear that the administration is intent on making it difficult or impossible to find information on its web pages about climate change. "
1394,"WASHINGTON — Since getting crushed by the recession a decade ago, the state of Oregon has been on an economic upswing. The jobless rate has dipped below 4 percent from a high of 12 percent in 2009, home values are up and people are flocking to the state. Net migration accounted for roughly 88 percent of Oregon’s population growth between 2016 and 2017, according to a Portland State University study. But state officials worry that all the economic progress is about to be undercut by the $1.5 trillion Republican tax plan sailing through Congress. While lawmakers say the plan will boost growth and strengthen the economy, Oregon officials say the bill could have the opposite effect by making the state a less affordable place to live and putting a squeeze on state and local budgets. “What I am concerned about is that this will impede our forward momentum,” Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said in an interview. “This tax plan will basically burst the balloon that’s happening here.” Oregon is not alone in its concerns. State and local officials in other high-tax, largely blue states like New York, New Jersey and California are warning the tax plan will strain budgets, shake real estate markets and prompt residents to flee expensive coastal states for places with lower taxes. Of primary concern is the Senate’s plan to repeal the state and local tax deduction, which currently allows people who itemize their tax returns to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes paid. The tax break is claimed by people across the nation, but is more heavily utilized in higher-tax states like Oregon, California, New Jersey and New York. Eliminating the deduction has long been a goal of many Republican lawmakers, who view the tax break as a subsidy that poorer red states provide to richer blue ones that spend heavily on government services. "
1395,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise its benchmark interest rate in December despite the concerns of some Fed officials about the persistent weakness of inflation, according to an account of the Fed’s most recent policy meeting. The account, which the Fed published Wednesday, described officials as united in confusion about the reasons that inflation is weak but divided about the consequences. While some officials favored watching and waiting, a majority of Fed officials — including the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen — have made clear that they are inclined to keep raising the Fed’s benchmark rate. At the two-day meeting that ended Nov. 1, those officials were “reasonably confident that the economy and inflation would evolve in coming months such that an additional firming would likely be appropriate in the near term,” the Fed said. The group made no changes to monetary policy at the meeting; it had signaled in advance of the meeting that it would not act before December. It left its benchmark rate in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent, and did not alter the instructions for the gradual reduction of its $4 trillion portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds now underway. But the meeting account, released after a standard three-week delay, is likely to solidify investor expectations that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point at the December meeting. The continued debate about the weakness of inflation has divided officials into two broad camps. Most, including Ms. Yellen, regard slow inflation as somewhat mysterious but not a cause for great concern because they expect tightening labor market conditions to eventually drive up prices. As a result, they want to keep raising interest rates at a gradual pace. "
1396,"The announcement came on his television show, “The Apprentice.” Donald J. Trump would open his second luxury hotel in New York, a “work of art” in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan that would become “an awe-inspiring masterpiece.” That was 11 years ago. The 46-story skyscraper, it turned out, was actually an albatross for Mr. Trump — drawing local opposition soon after its unveiling, partisan protests when he became a candidate for president and political scrutiny because of its early ties to a dubious Russian deal maker. Now, in the latest sign of strain in the president’s family business, the Trumps want no more. The Trump Organization has reached a deal that will allow the company to exit the property by the end of next month, the company said Wednesday. It is the second time this year the Trump name was erased from a hotel development, after a June announcement in Toronto. Located in an upscale neighborhood in a deeply Democratic city, the SoHo hotel has struggled to attract guests at five-star prices and has dropped its rates to keep rooms occupied. The property also includes condominiums that have been slow to sell. And when the building’s main restaurant decided to close in April, a lawyer for the restaurant attributed it to a decline in business “since the election.” Under the exit deal, the Trump Organization will sever its contract with the building’s owner, an investment firm in California that focuses primarily on real estate. As with many of their properties, the Trumps do not own the SoHo hotel, but instead manage the day-to-day operations. The Trump Organization is entitled to a cut of the hotel’s revenue, although the contract also requires the Trumps to pay the owner, CIM Group, if the property fails to meet certain financial performance standards. With years remaining on the contract, CIM will pay the Trumps to end the arrangement early, according to people briefed on the matter, who described the negotiations as amicable. A buyout enables CIM to either rebrand the property, or to buy more condo units and expand the hotel before eventually selling it. The company did not disclose the proposed price of a buyout. "
1397,"IF WISHES WERE BOOKS: It’s holiday time. So in keeping with a loose tradition at Inside the List, I asked a handful of best-selling authors to talk up their favorite reads of 2017, old or new. Granted, not everybody will find a limited 1909 edition of “Gulliver’s Travels.” But we can wish. Jacqueline Woodson, author of “Brown Girl Dreaming”: As someone who doesn’t read a lot of nonfiction, I was pleasantly surprised by David Friend’s “The Naughty Nineties” — basically a sexual history of that decade (and a guidebook for this one!). Friend brings us right back to all the amazing drama of that time: from Clinton and Lewinsky to Lorena Bobbitt to O. J. Simpson. It’s funny, scandalous, whip-smart and infinitely readable. Celeste Ng, author of “Little Fires Everywhere”: In a year that made me furious, Daisy Johnson’s “Fen” was a howl I didn’t know I needed. This linked collection takes place in the marshes, where things that some might wish to keep hidden refuse to stay buried, and resurface in unexpected ways. It’s hauntingly written and full of unabashedly, refreshingly angry women who are hungry — both figuratively and literally — for things long denied them. Kurt Andersen, author of “Fantasyland” and (with Alec Baldwin) “You Can’t Spell America Without Me”: In college, I couldn’t get through Hannah Arendt’s “The Origins of Totalitarianism”; it just didn’t seem applicable to modern America. In this first year of President Trump I finally read its third and final part, “Totalitarianism.” The contemporary relevance is uncanny. “Leaders … could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had all known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.” Neil de Grasse Tyson, author of “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry”: This year I obtained a copy of Jonathan Swift’s 1726 classic “Gulliver’s Travels,” illustrated and signed by Arthur Rackham, in a limited 1909 edition. Most of us know this satire from childhood, via cartoons. But those tend to focus only on Lemuel Gulliver’s voyage to Lilliput, the land of little people, where the animations hardly ever portray how Gulliver actually put out the fire in town — by urinating on the flaming buildings. A possible comment on what big people do to little people, even on the premise of helping them. "
1398,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.N. Command is demanding to meet with officials of the North Korean People’s Army, accusing its troops of violating the truce that halted the Korean War when they fired on and chased a defecting comrade across the border last week. South Korean cameras recorded the escape. And North Korea called the Trump administration’s imposition of new punishments — restoring the North to the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors and yet more sanctions — a “serious provocation.” In the U.S., the death of an American who had been held in harsh conditions by the North in 2010 raised concerns that he had committed suicide. _____ • Security forces in Papua New Guinea stormed a controversial detention center on Manus Island, in an attempt to end a standoff that has drawn international scrutiny to Australia’s refugee policy.

1399,"To the Editor: Re “Bucking National Party, Trump Defends Moore” (front page, Nov. 22): After granting pardons to two turkeys for Thanksgiving, President Trump proceeded to “pardon” Roy Moore. Mr. Trump defended the Senate candidate by saying Mr. Moore had denied the sex charges against him. In effect, Mr. Trump took Mr. Moore’s word over the word of several women accusing him. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump defended Vladimir Putin by saying he was sincere in his denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Our president took the word of the Russian autocrat over the findings of America’s intelligence agencies. Mr. President, you may believe both Roy Moore and Vladimir Putin. But pardon us, sir, if more and more Americans don’t believe in you. FRANK RICHTER, CLAWSON, MICH. "
1400,"SEOUL, South Korea — Two days after President Trump re-designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, the country responded on Wednesday by calling the decision “a serious provocation” and vowed to keep up its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against the “hostile” United States. “The U.S., the kingpin of all kinds of terrorism who cannot even prevent terror in its own territory, is acting like an ‘international judge on terrorism’ while attaching or removing the label of ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ on sovereign countries,” a spokesman of the North’s Foreign Ministry told its official Korean Central News Agency. “This is a serious provocation and a violent infringement upon our dignified country.” The comments were North Korea’s first official reaction to Mr. Trump’s decision on Monday to restore the country to Washington’s list of terrorism-sponsoring states, along with Iran, Sudan and Syria. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department announced a new round of sanctions to impede the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, targeting North Korean companies and ships as well as Chinese trading companies. The re-listing raised fears in the region that North Korea might take it as an excuse to resume weapons tests. It last launched a missile on Sept. 15. On Wednesday, the unidentified North Korean spokesman did not mention any direct threat to launch missiles. But he said that the North’s “deterrence will be further strengthened” — and that the country “must continue to keep the treasured nuclear sword in our hands more tightly” — as long as Washington continued with its “hostile policy” against the North. He said that the re-designation reflected Washington’s “intention to destroy our ideology and system,” and that its army and people were “hardening their will to settle all accounts with those gangsters at any time in any way.” "
1401,"A man who was freed from North Korean imprisonment in 2010 after former President Jimmy Carter interceded was found dead in San Diego last week. The authorities were notified by a witness that the man, Aijalon M. Gomes, 38, had been seen on fire in a field off the Pacific Highway late on Friday. An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer stopped to help him, and the San Diego Fire Rescue responded to a dispatch call, but Mr. Gomes, who had recently moved to San Diego from Boston, was pronounced dead at the scene. The San Diego Police said in a statement on Tuesday that they believed Mr. Gomes’s death had been either an accident or a suicide. A police spokesman, Billy Hernandez, said the cause of the fire was still under investigation. In April 2010, Mr. Gomes was sentenced to eight years of hard labor in a North Korean prison for crossing into the country illegally. Mr. Carter made a special visit to Pyongyang, the country’s capital, to negotiate for his release in August of that year. Mr. Gomes is the second American to have died this year after having been imprisoned in North Korea. Otto Warmbier, an American college student, died in June, a week after he was released in a vegetative state. A coroner determined in September that he had suffered extensive brain damage after his circulation was cut off. "
1402,"At the start of Spike Lee’s 1986 breakthrough debut, “She’s Gotta Have It,” the artist Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) sits up in bed, filmed in cool black and white. “I want you to know,” she says, “the only reason I’m consenting to this is because I wish to clear my name.” At the start of Spike Lee’s series “She’s Gotta Have It,” arriving Thursday on Netflix, the artist Nola Darling (DeWanda Wise) sits up in bed, filmed in bold color. “I would like you to know,” she says, “the only reason I’m doing this is ’cause folks think they know me. They think they know what I’m about, and the truth is, they don’t know me.” It’s the same, but different: sharper, more pointed. “She’s Gotta Have It” is full of quotes, from literature, music, history — above all, from “She’s Gotta Have It,” the film. (The song “Nola,” written for the film by Bill Lee, the director’s father, is not only the series’ title music but also Nola’s ringtone.) But the 2017 model is more than the sum of its references. More expansive than interior, more defiant than dreamy, it’s a vibrant if uneven work in heated conversation with itself. Even in a boom time for remakes and revivals, it’s unusual to see a vaunted director using TV for a do-over. The original film was a low-budget, high-voltage jolt about a free spirit who refused to be judged for her sexuality. It also had its own sexual-representation problems, particularly an ugly rape scene that Mr. Lee has since regretted, saying, “I was immature.” This year’s Nola is still seeing a trio of men. Jamie Overstreet (Lyriq Bent), an investment banker semi-separated from his wife, is mature but paternalistic; Greer Childs (Cleo Anthony), a model and photographer, is gorgeous but vain; Mars Blackmon (Anthony Ramos, “Hamilton”), an update of Mr. Lee’s basketball-obsessed B-boy of Nike commercial fame, is childlike but childish.

1404,"In the early 1980s, Harvey M. Schwartz was working weekends in the cold room of a kosher butcher shop in New Jersey, shaping beef into hamburger patties. Two hundred miles away in upstate New York, David M. Solomon was a frat brother playing rugby and mulling an entry-level banking position. More than three decades later, the two men are competing for what may be the most coveted job on Wall Street: running Goldman Sachs. Longtime managers of separate arms of the company, Mr. Schwartz, 53, and Mr. Solomon, 55, were named co-chief operating officers and presidents of Goldman last December when Gary Cohn, who previously held the titles, joined the Trump administration. The dual promotions made the men overnight adversaries in the race to run Goldman — that is, whenever Lloyd C. Blankfein, its longstanding chairman and chief executive, steps aside. The 63-year-old Mr. Blankfein once joked that he planned to die at his desk. But at 11 years, his tenure exceeds those of his recent predecessors, and guessing his replacement has become a popular Wall Street parlor game. Goldman now faces a choice between two distinct characters. Mr. Solomon, when he isn’t jetting around the world or locked in all-day client meetings, likes to spin electronic-dance records at nightclubs and do yoga with his adult daughter. "
1405,"Good morning. California Today will be taking a brief hiatus for the Thanksgiving holiday. We will return Monday morning. Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, the Times’s Los Angeles bureau  chief. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) As a rule, politicians who are thinking about running for president tend to be coy. It builds the drama and encourages the “Are you running?” speculation. And should that exploration turn up evidence that running for president is a dumb idea — it happens — it’s easier to step away. Not Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles. He is making no secret that he — as unlikely as it may seem, given his lack of national experience — is considering a race for the White House. Mr. Garcetti recently discussed his intentions with The Times. (Here’s my article.) His ambitions drew a somewhat mixed reaction — ranging from incredulity to some saying this is just what the Democratic Party needs — in one decidedly unscientific sampling (a blast of comments on the story on Twitter).

1407,"WASHINGTON — President Trump began his first Thanksgiving vacation in office with an early-morning Twitter rage in which he again vented about some of his favorite targets: sports figures he thinks have defied him. The president called LaVar Ball, the father of one of three U.C.L.A. players arrested in China for shoplifting, a “poor man’s version of Don King,” the black sports promoter. He also called Mr. Ball an “ungrateful fool!” and insisted that “IT WAS ME” who deserved more thanks for rescuing Mr. Ball’s son from the Chinese authorities. Mr. Trump followed the angry rant toward Mr. Ball, who is African-American, with a return to his monthslong demand for football players to be more respectful while the national anthem is played — an issue that has strong support among some Americans. On the idea of asking players to stay in locker rooms during the anthem, Mr. Trump tweeted: “That’s almost as bad as kneeling!” Together, the posts were a reprise of Mr. Trump’s personal attacks against sports figures — many of them African-American — for what he judges to be poor behavior on their part and a failure to demonstrate enough deference to others. White House officials deny that the president is focused on race when he comments about sports and athletes. But to historians and black activists, the tweets are clear evidence of an attempt by the president to send a message of solidarity to many supporters. “President Trump appears to have a peculiar overfascination with African-American athletes and a negative fascination,” said Douglas A. Blackmon, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Slavery By Another Name” and the host of “American Forum,” a weekly show produced by the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. "
1408,"THE HAGUE — It was the closing of one of Europe’s most shameful chapters of atrocity and bloodletting since World War II. With applause inside and outside the courtroom at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Gen. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander, was convicted on Wednesday of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison. It was the last major item of business for the tribunal in The Hague before it wound down, a full quarter-century after many of the crimes on its docket were committed. From 1992 to 1995, the tribunal found, Mr. Mladic, 75, was the chief military organizer of the campaign to drive Muslims, Croats and other non-Serbs off their lands to cleave a new homogeneous statelet for Bosnian Serbs. The deadliest year of the campaign was 1992, when 45,000 people died, often in their homes, on the streets or in a string of concentration camps. Others perished in the siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, where snipers and shelling terrorized residents for more than three years, and in the mass executions of 8,000 Muslim men and boys after Mr. Mladic’s forces overran the United Nations-protected enclave of Srebrenica. Sitting impassively at first in the court in a blue suit and tie, Mr. Mladic seemed much smaller than the burly commander in fatigues who had often appeared before the news media during the war to defend himself and his forces. "
1409,"WASHINGTON — The heightened scrutiny of sexual impropriety on Capitol Hill has swept up a senior House Republican who apologized Wednesday for a sexually explicit photograph that wound up on the internet and raised the possibility that he had been the victim of a crime. Representative Joe Barton of Texas, who was once the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and is now its vice chairman, said that he was reconsidering his political future after the photograph appeared on an anonymous Twitter account. Mr. Barton, who has hired a crisis communications firm, made clear he was ready for a fight. In a statement Wednesday night, he said that he had suffered “a potential crime.” A Texas law, the so-called revenge pornography law, makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally publicize images or videos of someone’s genitals or sexual activity without consent. Hours after his initial apology, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Barton, 68, had threatened in 2015 to report to the Capitol Police a woman with whom he had shared explicit photographs, videos and messages if she exposed him. The woman, who spoke anonymously, shared with The Post a recorded phone conversation in which the congressman confronted her about communications she had with other women connected to Mr. Barton, including sexually explicit material he had shared with her. Mr. Barton did not dispute the woman’s account. But in his statement, he said that she “threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation” when he ended their relationship. "
1410,"In an unpredictable world, it’s always a pleasure to claim vindication for one’s own prophetic powers, and the political crisis in Germany — the inability of Angela Merkel to form a coalition government that keeps her country’s far right sidelined — could easily inspire an “I told you so” from those of us who have criticized the German chancellor and doubted her leader-of-the-free-world mystique. That mystique is undeserved because it is too kind to her decision, lauded for its idealism but ultimately deeply reckless and destabilizing, to swiftly admit a million-odd migrants into the heart of Europe in 2015. No recent move has so clearly highlighted the undemocratic, Berlin-dominated nature of European decision making and the gulf between the elite consensus and popular opinion. And no move has contributed so much to the disturbances since — the worsening of Europe’s terrorism problem, the shock of Brexit and the rise of Trump, and the growing divide between the E.U.’s Franco-German core and its eastern nations. So it’s fitting that the immigration issue has finally come back to undercut Merkel directly, first costing her votes in Germany’s last election, which saw unprecedented gains for the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, and then making a potential grand coalition impossible in part because the centrist, pro-business Free Democrats now see an opportunity in getting to Merkel’s right on migration policy. Yes, thanks to the continued fallout from her rash decision, and just as her critics predicted, Germany stares into the abyss of … … well, actually, no, it doesn’t really stare into the abyss at all. It just has to choose between a new election, which would probably deliver the same divisions but would still leave the nationalists stuck at 10-15 percent of the vote and Merkel’s party with a plurality, and a minority government led by Merkel herself, which would be a novelty in Berlin but which is normal enough in other stable Western countries. Both options promise problems that Germany hasn’t had to deal with in its modern and unified shape, but also problems that are quite routine for developed-world democracies. Neither option is going to suddenly elevate the AfD to power, unravel the European Union, or bring National Socialism lurching back to life. As political crises go, the one Merkel has brought upon her country isn’t exactly a Weimar moment, or even a Trump-scale shock. And for all the pleasures of “I told you so,” those of us who never bought into the Merkel mystique should not pretend that she’s delivered some sort of catastrophe just yet. "
1411,"To the Editor: “The Men We Used to Admire,” by Michelle Goldberg (column, Nov. 21), shows how the earnest and important reckoning with sexual harassment by those on the left is turned against us through false equivalencies (Al Franken/Roy Moore) and lack of established procedures for responding to allegations aired through the press or social media. With liberals readily admitting “mea culpa” to accusations or demanding resignations of other liberals, and conservatives exploiting liberals’ sensitivity and political correctness, I fear that this important moment is turning into a liberal circular firing squad. Will Al Franken and Louis C. K. face real consequences, while we end up having to live with Roy Moore in the Senate, and continuing to live with Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court and Donald Trump in the White House? AMANDA AARON, BROOKLYN To the Editor: I am glad Michelle Goldberg has given more thought to her position on the spate of sexual harassment accusations, including that Al Franken should resign. The rush to judgment does not serve us well. This reader, at least, cares more about how my representatives vote and what policies they back than I do about their personal lives and misdemeanors. As is so often the case, there is a failure to make distinctions: As Ms. Goldberg notes, there is a world of difference between force, violence or intimidation by those in power and obnoxiousness. There is a vast distance between the behaviors of Harvey Weinstein and Louis C. K., and between Roy Moore and Al Franken, and yet we respond as if they were equivalent. Some behaviors are criminal; others are inappropriate, unwelcome and obnoxious. If we destroyed careers on the grounds of obnoxious behavior, I daresay no one, man or woman, would remain employed for long. "
1412,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration declared on Wednesday that Myanmar’s brutal crackdown on its Rohingya minority constituted “ethnic cleansing,” a long-anticipated designation that will open the door to sanctions against the country’s military commanders and intensify pressure on its civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who visited Myanmar last week, said that “horrendous atrocities” by Myanmar’s military, security forces and vigilantes had forced “hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to flee their homes” and seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. “After careful and thorough analysis of the facts,” Mr. Tillerson said in a statement, “it is clear that the situation in northern Rakhine State constitutes ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.” The United States, he said, will pursue “targeted sanctions,” most likely against military leaders implicated in the crackdown. But administration officials continued to rule out broader sanctions against Myanmar’s government because they said it could jeopardize the country’s delicate transition to democracy after decades of repressive military rule. Mr. Tillerson also stopped short of explicitly calling for an international investigation into the atrocities, which disappointed some human rights advocates, though he did call for a “credible, independent investigation.” Critics said that Myanmar’s government had proved itself, through previous investigations, unable to uncover the truth of its persecution of its Muslim minority, which has included executions, gang rapes and burnings of villages.

1413,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Robert Mugabe — who once proclaimed that “Only God will remove me!” — resigned as president of Zimbabwe shortly after lawmakers started impeachment proceedings. Jubilant residents poured into the streets at what seemed to be an abrupt capitulation from the world’s longest-serving head of state. Mr. Mugabe, 93, said he was stepping down for “the welfare of the people.” A new leader could be sworn in as early as today, the state broadcaster said. _____ • For the European Union, the only thing worse than a strong Germany may be a weak one. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s failure to form a coalition government has further delayed serious decisions the bloc faces on the eurozone, migration, asylum and defense, as well as Britain’s exit. "
1414,"The collapse of coalition talks in Germany is not simply a political problem for the Germans; it portends a period of serious uncertainty for all Europe and the West. In a Europe shaken by Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, Russian meddling and much more, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Germany was supposed to be a beacon of prosperity and stability, an indomitable defender of the international liberal order. Suddenly there is talk of new elections and possibly the start of a post-Merkel era. The deadlock was a result of national elections in September that demonstrated that Germany, for all its economic strength, was also vulnerable to the divisive social forces sweeping through the West. The 2015 refugee crisis, in which Ms. Merkel courageously declared “We can do it” and opened Germany’s doors to a million refugees, also shifted votes, especially in the east, to the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which won a stunning 13 percent of the vote. Ms. Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats won the most seats, but they and their former coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party, took a drubbing. The Social Democrats opted out of the coalition, leaving the chancellor to seek the support of two smaller parties — the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats. After four weeks, the talks finally collapsed Sunday night when the Free Democrats’ leader, Christian Lindner, walked away saying, “It is better not to govern than to govern badly.” The Social Democrats have still shown no interest in teaming up again with the Christian Democrats, and Ms. Merkel indicated that she prefers to hold new elections. The politics will play out as President Frank-Walter Steinmeier sounds out the political players. However it ends up, Germany and the West are in for a stretch of considerable uncertainty on a broad range of fronts in which Germany’s leader of 12 years often had the decisive voice: refugees; the stumbling negotiations with Britain on its exit from the European Union; the ambitious plans by President Emmanuel Macron of France to join with Germany in forging a more integrated eurozone and a European military force; European relations with the United States, Turkey, Russia and China; the Greek debt. Optimists in Germany and the union see in new elections a potential opening to a new generation of leaders who could imbue Germany with a fresh dynamism. Others fear even more votes for the far-right and the emergence of leaders reluctant to take bold risks or to follow Ms. Merkel’s lead on refugees. And then there is the possibility that Ms. Merkel will emerge strengthened by the brush with the unknown. For now, she has retained her signature pragmatism, pledging to “do everything possible to ensure that this country is well governed through these difficult weeks ahead.” "

t was early November, the day before Virginia’s elections, and the Democratic cavalry — in the form of four podcast hosts crammed into a Lyft — was coming to the aid of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. “Do you want to kick things off with something light and funny?” Jon Favreau asked Jon Lovett as their ride — an S.U.V. outfitted with neon lights and a disco ball that were a bit discombobulating before 9 o’clock in the morning — took them to a Richmond campaign office. They’d be rallying volunteers canvassing for Northam, the Democratic candidate for governor, who was at the time commanding a perilously narrow lead in the polls. “I want to go toward the end for some earnestness,” Favreau said. “You should do something real message-y,” Tommy Vietor proposed. “I’m expecting the ‘race speech’ for G.O.T.V.,” Dan Pfeiffer chimed in. It was a joke from the podcasters’ past lives. As Barack Obama’s chief speechwriter for eight years, Favreau had a hand in some of his most memorable oratory — none more so than the 2008 campaign speech about race that followed questions about Obama’s relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Whenever a knotty issue arose in Obama’s White House, Pfeiffer and Vietor, who worked in the communications department, and Lovett, a fellow speechwriter, would taunt Favreau: “We need a ‘race speech’ for Simpson-Bowles,” or: “Write a ‘race speech’ for the BP oil spill.” The night before, at the National, an 800-seat theater in Richmond, Favreau and his co-hosts performed a sold-out live taping of “Pod Save America,” a liberal political podcast and the flagship offering from Crooked Media, the media company that Favreau, Lovett and Vietor started in January. “Pod Save America” scored its first million-listener episode within its first several weeks, and it now averages 1.5 million listeners per show — about as many people as Anderson Cooper draws on prime-time CNN. Their podcast has come to occupy a singular perch in blue America; where an NPR tote bag once signified a certain political persuasion and mind-set, in the age of Trump, it’s a “Friend of the Pod” T-shirt. “ ‘Pod Save America,’ ” says the Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, “is the voice of the ‘resistance.’ ” Its hosts have not shied away from making use of their newfound influence. In 2017, “Pod Save America” has pointed its audience toward an array of grass-roots groups on the left, partnering with MoveOn to send nearly 2,000 listeners to Republican town-hall meetings, with Swing Left to raise more than $1 million for challengers to House Republicans next year and with Indivisible to deluge Republican senators with tens of thousands of phone calls in favor of preserving Obamacare. And in Richmond, the hosts were lending their activist cachet and charisma to Northam, a candidate who, Democrats worried, could use a lot more of both. “With Donald Trump winning the presidency, we have decided — we’ve realized — that democracy is not just a job for politicians,” Favreau told the crowd at Northam’s campaign office, amid half-empty doughnut boxes and carafes of coffee. “It’s a job for every single American, and that job doesn’t just end on Election Day — that job is an every-single-day job. It is a fight.” "
1416,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’re asking whether the United States will have a permanent credibility gap with the rest of the world in climate negotiations. Plus, how to talk about global warming at your holiday dinner. Applause greeted Todd D. Stern, former President Barack Obama’s climate change negotiator, when he addressed delegates at a global warming summit in 2009 and declared, “We’re back.” After the George W. Bush administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol, Mr. Stern promised America would “make up for lost time.” Now another president has vowed to abandon another climate pact, the Paris agreement of 2015. But Mr. Stern and other Democrats who traveled to the climate conference in Bonn, Germany, last week said they were certain the United States would stay in the deal in the long run. Even if President Trump makes good on his promise to withdraw from the Paris agreement, they said, a future president will one day rejoin it. "
1417,"Earlier this month, Twitter did something radical: The social network famous for its 140-character limit doubled it to 280. Weirdly, the world didn’t end. There was some whining from old-timers, which quickly died out. Mostly, everything was O.K. Some might even say the change was for the better. There’s a lesson in this for Twitter: It should be bolder in how it manages its network. It can slay more sacred cows. And after a year in which it became blindingly obvious that Twitter was rife with abuse and harassment, and that it has become a haven for propagandists, bots and other manipulators, there’s one sacred cow in particular that deserves to be roasted more thoroughly than your Thanksgiving bird. It’s time for Twitter to scrap one of its founding principles: the idea that it is an anything-goes paradise, where anyone who signs up for a voice on its platform is immediately and automatically given equal footing with everyone else, and where even the vilest, most hateful and antisocial behavior should be tolerated. The company is currently remaking its unworkable verification system — the blue check mark it awards to some high-profile accounts, an icon whose precise meaning is unclear, but that confers many privileges. Last week, Twitter removed the icon from several accounts belonging to white supremacists. Now it says it is rethinking the whole system, and looking for ways to better police its network. It ought to consider a radical, top-to-bottom change like this: Instead of awarding blue checks to people who achieve some arbitrary level of real-world renown, the company should issue badges of status or of shame based on signals about how people actually use, or abuse, Twitter. In other words, Twitter should begin to think of itself, and its users, as a community, and it should look to the community for determining the rights of people on the platform. "
1418,"Back in the 1980s, a comedy boom built a nationwide circuit of hundreds of clubs, a crowded new TV genre showcasing stand-up sets, and the blockbuster careers of Jerry Seinfeld and Roseanne Barr. The next decade, the boom went bust, with nearly a quarter of the clubs closing and two struggling cable channels merging into one, which later became known as Comedy Central. We’ve been in another boom for nearly a decade. This time around, there’s an even greater proliferation of outlets, with an explosion of arena shows; free or cheap stand-up nights; and cable, YouTube and streaming channels devoted to comedy. Perhaps most important has been the expensive push this year by Netflix to become the home of the special. But it’s easy to see telltale signs of oversaturation. “Netflix is releasing a new comedy special every week,” the stand-up Andy Kindler joked in his annual State of the Industry speech this year. “It’s exciting because now you can binge-watch America getting tired of stand-up comedy again.” There’s already been some contraction online: NBC’s comedy streaming service Seeso folded; the pioneering site Funny or Die has made cutbacks. And even before the sudden downfall of Louis C.K. inspired a necessary reckoning, a sense of anxiety filled clubs about the possibility of a second bust. “One of the things I hear repeated regularly is that comedy clubs are dying,” Sean Joyce, a Washington, D.C., promoter and host, said by email. Louis Faranda, the booker at Carolines on Broadway, who had a front-row seat for both booms, is outright predicting that a bust is coming and that smaller rooms will close. Greg Godbout, who owns spaces in Virginia and Washington, said he could sense the mood was shifting at this year’s Just for Laughs festival, the huge industry retreat in Montreal. “I saw a longtime comedy club owner offer to sell his club,” Mr. Godbout recalled. ‘He said, ‘Name your price.’” But a crash may be just what comedy needs.

The late-night hosts on Tuesday took jabs at Charlie Rose, who lost his positions at CBS and PBS after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment. Jimmy Fallon imagined how the firing at CBS might have gone down. Stephen Colbert focused on the account of one woman who said that while she was meeting with Mr. Rose at his home, he changed into a bathrobe and walked around with it untied. Gayle King, Mr. Rose’s longtime co-host on “CBS This Morning,” was Mr. Colbert’s first guest on “The Late Show” on Tuesday. Her appearance had been scheduled far in advance, but she admitted to Mr. Colbert that she “came this close to canceling.” Later, she added: “I was wincing at your monologue, though, Stephen.” On “Late Night,” the correspondent Amber Ruffin started off her latest edition of “Amber Says What” with a reminder that these many sexual assault allegations may be shocking, but to many women, they’re not necessarily surprising. "
1421,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Wednesday ordered a federal review of a database that is used to check gun buyers’ backgrounds, after a man who shot and killed more than two dozen people at a Texas church this month was omitted from the system despite a criminal record. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was asking the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to conduct a comprehensive review of the database, known as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Mr. Sessions said in a statement that the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Tex., showed that “relevant information may not be getting reported” to the database and that the agencies needed to determine “the steps we can take to ensure that those who are prohibited from purchasing firearms are prevented from doing so.” The suspect in the shooting, Devin P. Kelley, a former Air Force serviceman, had served 12 months’ confinement after striking and choking his first wife and breaking the skull of his young stepson. Federal law prohibits selling a gun to a person who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child. After the attack, the Air Force confirmed that the information about Mr. Kelley’s conviction had not been properly reported to the F.B.I. Mr. Kelley, who killed himself after the massacre at the church, bought guns from a Texas store in 2016 and 2017. It is unclear whether those guns were used in the attack. Mr. Sessions instructed the two agencies to ensure that the Defense Department and other federal agencies were reporting complete and accurate information, calling it “alarming” that there had been discrepancies. In the weeks since the shooting, there has been a bipartisan legislative push to require criminal records to be included in the database to increase the reporting of domestic assault convictions. The House of Representatives Armed Services Committee also said it would investigate the Air Force’s failure to notify the government about Mr. Kelley’s criminal record. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has recently come under increased scrutiny over an apparent lack of regulation of bump stocks, the gun conversion kits that a gunman used in October to kill 58 people and wound hundreds during a music festival in Las Vegas. The agency has said it has no jurisdiction over the kits because they do not qualify as guns. "
1422,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The administration of President Nicolás Maduro called it a necessary move to ferret out “putrid” corruption and end impunity. Outside the government, however, many observers saw it as yet another strong-arm move by Mr. Maduro to consolidate power. Whatever the motivation, the arrests this week of six senior executives at Citgo, the United States refining subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, have purged the American company’s leadership and stunned the energy sector. The move, announced on Tuesday by Venezuela’s attorney general, was the latest in an inquiry that has led to the arrests in recent months of about 50 people associated with the vital national oil industry. The purge has come as the state-owned company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, teeters on the brink of default on billions of dollars in bond debt amid the nation’s worsening economic crisis. Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the six Citgo executives, including the acting president, faced charges of embezzlement and other crimes in connection with a refinancing deal worth as much as $4 billion that had not been authorized by the appropriate authorities in the Maduro administration. He said the officials had offered the subsidiary as a guarantee, putting it “at risk.” The deal, he insisted, amounted to “corruption of the most putrid kind.” Four of the men are United States citizens, The Wall Street Journal reported. Corruption has been a chronic and well-known problem for years at Pdvsa and has helped to undercut its operations and profits. "
1423,"MOSCOW — Leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran announced an agreement on Wednesday to sponsor a conference aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement of the Syria war. The announcement by the three leaders, who were meeting in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, underscored Russia’s increasingly influential role in determining the outcome of the war, which appears to be winding down after nearly seven years. The conference they proposed, also to be held in Sochi, was announced just days before a new round of peace talks was planned in Geneva, convened by a special United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura. It was another sign that Mr. de Mistura’s efforts, frustrated for years, have now been overshadowed by Russia’s actions. The Sochi announcement also came a few days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, an indication that Mr. Assad had agreed to the idea. Mr. Putin also called President Trump and other regional leaders, reflecting what appeared to be a coordinated effort that highlighted Russia’s role. Mr. Putin sought to use the Sochi announcement to portray Russia as a flexible diplomatic intermediary in the Syria conflict, despite Russia’s military backing for Mr. Assad, widely regarded by opponents as a war criminal.

1425,"WASHINGTON — The party not occupying the White House seizes control of governor’s offices in New Jersey and Virginia. An unexpectedly competitive special Senate election threatens the chamber’s balance of power. Major legislation being forced through along partisan lines heads for a climactic holiday-season vote. Veteran lawmakers of the governing party race for the exits. Such was the state of play at this moment in 2009 when President Barack Obama and Democrats ruled the roost. Such is the virtually parallel political landscape now with President Trump and Republicans in charge: Substitute Doug Jones of Alabama, a Democrat, for Scott Brown of Massachusetts, a Republican, and switch the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with the Affordable Care Act. It ended badly back then for Democrats, who lost the House in the 2010 midterm elections and suffered setbacks in the Senate, severely limiting Mr. Obama’s ability to pursue his agenda during his remaining six years in office. History is already repeating itself. And the striking comparisons are not lost on either Democrats or Republicans. “Republicans who rode the wave eight years ago undoubtedly can sense the shifting tides,” said David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. “As one who was washed over, I can tell you, it’s an unpleasant feeling.” "
1426,"SAN FRANCISCO — Have you ever wondered whether you have fallen prey to a Russian misinformation campaign? Soon, you will be able to find out. Facebook said on Wednesday that it planned to roll out a new tool later this year to help figure out if that new page you followed on Facebook or account you added on Instagram was secretly being run by Russia’s troll army. The tool, which you will find through a newly created portal on your Facebook or Instagram page, is part of an effort to “protect our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors who try to undermine our democracy,” Facebook said in a blog post. The social network is trying to assuage critics who said Facebook did not do enough to stop Russian propaganda from spreading on its platform ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The social media giant, along with Twitter and Google, were grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill several weeks ago about their role in the election and the unintended consequences of their technology. Facebook has said that 29 million Americans saw content created by Russian agents directly in their news feed, while 126 million shared posts that were shared or linked to by their friends, with that number rising to roughly 150 million when including Instagram. On Election Day itself, about 10 million people saw ads purchased by the Kremlin on Facebook, the company has said. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company hoped the tool would help Americans who liked a page or followed an account created by a Russian agent, though he acknowledged that it stopped short of being able to help the much wider circle of people who viewed Russian propaganda shared by their friends. Facebook executives previously said they doubted whether they had the ability to reach out to every single American who was exposed to Russian government-backed propaganda. “It’s a much more challenging issue to identify and notify reliably people who may have been exposed to this content on an individual basis,” Colin Stretch, the company’s general counsel, said during the appearance before Congress. For now, the tool may only be able to help you if you chose to follow one of the accounts or pages set up by Russian agents on Instagram or Facebook. According to experts who have studied disinformation campaigns, that accounts for only a tiny sliver of the people Facebook estimate were affected by content Russian posted online. “People are much more affected by content shared by their friends, they are more likely to click on it and spend time reading it and considering its merits when a trusted friend shares it on their Facebook page,” said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, which tracks the spread of misinformation online. “People don’t know the extent to which they are influenced by what their trusted social circles post online.” The lesson? Choose your friends carefully. "
1427,"WASHINGTON — Representative John Conyers Jr., the House’s longest-serving lawmaker, does not plan to resign over accusations of sexual harassment despite facing a House Ethics Committee investigation, his lawyer said on Wednesday. His lawyer, Arnold E. Reed, said in a phone interview that Mr. Conyers, 88, denied any wrongdoing and believed that some people suggesting that he step down, including fellow Democrats, had been scheming for years to push him out as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Asked about the credibility of the accusations of harassment, which have been made by women who were former staff members, Mr. Reed stopped short of calling the women liars. “You have to ask the women, are they lying or not,” Mr. Reed said. “Mr. Conyers has not engaged in sexual harassment or harassment otherwise with regard to any staffer that he has had.” He suggested that many others in Washington, including the president, would also have to resign were they to face repercussions over similar claims. President Trump himself has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, including harassment and assault, as have others in Congress. “If we are talking about resignation and resignation over allegations, then half the people in the House, half the people in the Senate, including the president of the United States of America, would have to step aside, step down and or resign,” Mr. Reed said.

Here’s what you need to know: • “Most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies. But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain.” One of our business reporters, David Gelles, examined the differing stances that the Trump administration has taken this week on one of the central issues shaping business and society. On Tuesday, the F.C.C. announced plans to dismantle rules that prevent internet service providers from charging higher fees and blocking access to some websites. (This video explains how net neutrality works.) That followed Monday’s lawsuit by the Justice Department to block AT&T’s proposed takeover of Time Warner. • “You’ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there’s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else’s,” one analyst said. "
1429,"Many years ago, I committed an offense for which famous men are now being publicly, and rightly, shamed. I patted an office secretary on her behind. I won’t offer the usual lame defense that I didn’t know my advance was unwanted or that social attitudes were different back then. My only excuse is that at the time of the incident I was about 7 years old. I remember the moment because of what happened immediately afterward. The secretary, who worked at my father’s business in Mexico City, turned around and slammed a heavy stack of papers on my head. I marched indignantly over to my dad’s office to report her behavior — only so that he could march me over to her desk and have me apologize. He followed that up with a stern warning never to do anything of the sort again. I don’t remember the secretary’s name. But what a service she did me by giving me a knock I’ll never forget, one that took courage and self-respect considering I was her boss’s son. What a service, too, that my dad defended her and gave me the talking-to that he did. It’s a lesson every boy should get — loud, clear, and early — from a male role model. As it’s Thanksgiving, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I owe my late father. Living in Mexico, he was keen that his kids should never behave in the manner of los niños bien — the entitled and often abusive princelings of the upper class. A family acquaintance had once said he intended to raise children who would “know how to command the servants.” My dad would sometimes mention this to us as one of the most atrocious things he’d ever heard. His own way of being was shaped by a phrase he used often and in an expansive sense: “Give with a warm hand.” Don’t wait till you’re dead to give your money away. Be exceptionally considerate of those depending on you, most of all those born with a lot less. Be present. Be generous with your time and energy. Oh, and be tender. Most kids endure a sex talk with a parent. Mine with him, on a winter’s evening drive when I was 12, was light on the mechanical issues but heavy on the subjects of gentleness, respect and love. I sat through it in mortified silence. But I remember it vividly as I attempt to pass along the same wisdom to the next generation. "
1430,"Last Thanksgiving I wrote a column titled, “No, Trump, We Can’t Just Get Along,” in which I committed myself to resisting this travesty of a man, proclaiming, “I have not only an ethical and professional duty to call out how obscene your very existence is at the top of American government; I have a moral obligation to do so.” I made this promise: “As long as there are ink and pixels, you will be the focus of my withering gaze.” I have kept that promise, not because it was a personal challenge, but because this is a national crisis. Donald Trump, I thought that your presidency would be a disaster. It’s worse than a disaster. I wasn’t sure that resistance to your weakening of the republic, your coarsening of the culture, your assault on truth and honesty, your erosion of our protocols, would feel as urgent today as it felt last year. But if anything, that resistance now feels more urgent. Nothing about you has changed for the better. You are still a sexist, bigoted, bullying, self-important simpleton. But now all of the worst of you has the force of the American presidency. The degree to which Russia aided your ascendance, and the degree to which people connected to your campaign were willing and eager to entertain entreaties from Russia, are coming into clearer focus everyday. "
1431,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Europe closed what may be its most shameful chapter of bloodletting since World War II. After a trial that lasted years, the Bosnian Serb warlord Ratko Mladic, 75, was sentenced to life in prison by a U.N. tribunal. He was convicted of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Above, celebrating the sentence in Srebrenica, where 8,000 men and boys were executed by Mr. Mladic’s forces. Our reporters note that European nationalist passions are once again on the rise. In an Op-Ed, a journalist who covered the Bosnian war says Mr. Mladic’s conviction was too long in coming and sends a discouraging message to victims of conflicts in Syria, Zimbabwe, Yemen and elsewhere: “Will Mr. Mladic’s verdict, 22 years in the making, inspire hope that justice can be delivered fairly and without delay? I think not.” _____ • The U.N.

1432,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani court has ordered the full release of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the Islamist militant group that carried out the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks, 10 months after the government placed him under house arrest, his lawyer said. The move will free Mr. Saeed to participate more directly in Pakistan’s politics. And at a time when the United States has been pushing Pakistan to do better in curbing militants, it presents another example of how the most extremist voices in the country seem to be moving more into the mainstream. Mr. Saeed had long been one of the most-wanted militant leaders in the region, but he had been living in the open in Pakistan for years despite a $10 million American bounty on him. India, in particular, has criticized Pakistan for not bringing him to justice after the militant group he founded, Lashkar-e-Taiba, killed 166 people in the Mumbai attacks. But to many Pakistanis, Mr. Saeed is a hero: the architect of a long militant campaign to fight India in Kashmir, and a prominent voice for fundamentalist Islam. Some love how he has mocked efforts by the United States to capture him, and he drew large crowds as he continued to lead public gatherings, especially in his home city, Lahore. The Pakistani government long ago formally banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was widely listed as a terrorist group. But Pakistan had made few public advances against Mr. Saeed even after he founded a charity, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, that is openly considered a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba and that recently began moving into political campaigning. In January, the government declared him under house arrest, seeming to bow to international pressure and also keeping him from fund-raising for Jamaat-ud-Dawa. The arrest order was extended several times until Wednesday, when a three-member judicial body reviewed and rejected a government request to extend Mr. Saeed’s detention for 90 more days. His current detention order expires overnight Thursday. "
1433,"“Junk,” the riveting reincarnation of the junk bond era now playing at Lincoln Center, “is a fictionalized account suggested by events in the historical public record,” according to an author’s note in the program. “The characters in this play are dramatic concoctions,” it reads, “stitched together — at times — with details pulled from history, but these characters are never anything other than fictions.” But make no mistake about it: “Junk” is about as close to reality as theater gets. I should know: I’m the author of “Den of Thieves,” which chronicled the rise and fall of Michael Milken and his junk bond empire and the cast of characters that whirled around him. The author of “Junk,” Ayad Akhtar, has cited my book and “The Predators’ Ball,” Connie Bruck’s pathbreaking account of Mr. Milken’s heyday at Drexel Burnham Lambert, as works that influenced his play. Part of the fun of watching “Junk” is matching the characters to their real-life counterparts: the junk bond trader Robert Merkin (Mr. Milken); the arbitrageur Boris Pronsky (Ivan Boesky); the United States attorney Giuseppe Addesso (Rudolph Giuliani). Even their fictional names seem alliterative of those of their actual counterparts. Other characters are less obvious. Is the “private equity” magnate Leo Tresler really Teddy Forstmann? Of the many old-line industrial firms that succumbed to Mr. Milken’s junk bond onslaught, which one is Everson Steel and United? It’s a credit to Mr. Akhtar’s skills as a dramatist that such questions soon fade as deeper truths and questions emerge. No one unfamiliar with Michael Milken or even junk bonds should be deterred from seeing “Junk.” People who think they already know the story should be prepared to leave the theater with unsettling new thoughts. Perhaps it has taken the perspective gained over nearly three decades to see what a turning point in American history the late 1980s turned out to be, and how they shaped, as Mr. Akhtar puts it, “the world we inhabit today.” "
1434,"Even though there’s been nothing subtle about the current push to fill dozens of judicial vacancies kept open by the Republican-controlled Senate during the final years of the Obama administration, a document now making the rounds inside the Beltway is head-snapping. It is a proposal by a leading conservative constitutional scholar to double or even triple the number of authorized judgeships on the federal Courts of Appeals, now fixed by law at 179. Why so many, and why now? The author, Steven G. Calabresi, a law professor at Northwestern University, a founder and the current board chairman of the conservative Federalist Society, declares his goal boldly: “undoing the judicial legacy of President Barack Obama.” The 37-page document is styled as a “Memorandum to the Senate and the House of Representatives.” On one level, it tells us little that we don’t already know: that the Republicans, seemingly unable to accomplish much of anything else, are desperate to gain control of the federal courts. Sure, President Franklin D. Roosevelt failed 80 years ago with his plan to remake the Supreme Court to his liking by adding up to six new justices. But that’s evidently no reason not to aim just a little lower with a court-packing plan for the federal appeals and trial courts. (Professor Calabresi also advocates adding 185 District Court judgeships to the current 673.) There is something bracing about the naked activism of a leader of a movement that has spent the past generation railing against judicial activism. In his memorandum, Professor Calabresi explains that when President Obama came into office, 10 of the 13 federal appeals courts had majorities of Republican-appointed judges. By the time the Obama administration ended eight years later, that number had shrunk to four, with results that Professor Calabresi regards as calamitous. Calling out individual Democratic-appointed judges by name, he gives as examples last year’s decision by the Fourth Circuit invalidating North Carolina’s voter ID requirement, and a decision by the federal appeals court in Washington rejecting challenges to the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rule, as “another instance of the administrative state run amok.” In ordinary times, one might expect a document like this to be passed quietly among like-minded Capitol Hill staff members. But conservatives these days put their cards on the table. Professor Calabresi posted a link to his memorandum on National Review’s website and uploaded it to the Social Science Research Network, a widely used web-based index of newly published scholarship. I learned of it from a post by Ian Millhiser on the liberal Think Progress website. And the memo does have a scholarly cast, consisting of a lengthy discourse about a purported “caseload crisis” that has led judges to take quality-compromising procedural shortcuts like delegating work to staff members, omitting oral argument, and writing casual “unpublished” opinions that decide the case at hand without setting a precedent for other cases. Since 1990, Professor Calabresi argues, Congress has added no new seats to the appeals courts and only a few dozen to the district courts, while caseloads have grown. Thus, “the need for a new judgeship bill can be justified by the crisis in volume,” he writes, adding: “One of the most straightforward ways for Republicans to address this problem is to make the case for a new judgeship bill that would enable the president to appoint a sufficient number of new judges that would help to change the balance of power of each of the circuit courts back to a conservative majority.” "
1435,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: = • In Pakistan, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the Islamist group that carried out the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks, is expected to enter the country’s political arena directly, now that he has been freed from house arrest. Mr. Saeed had long been one of the most wanted militant leaders in the region, but until he was restricted in January, he lived openly in Pakistan despite a $10 million U.S. bounty. India, in particular, has criticized Pakistan for not bringing him to justice. _____ • Myanmar and Bangladesh said they had moved closer to the possible repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, but neither side gave many details apart from a vague commitment to begin the process within two months. And how many Rohingya would return? The U.S. and others have called the campaign of violence conducted by Myanmar’s security forces crimes against humanity. "
1436,"From an empty hallway at one of his jobs in Manhattan, Abdulaziz Marwan Hussin Mohammed watched his own wedding celebration through a fuzzy WhatsApp connection. His family called from Khartoum, Sudan, so he could see his fiancée, Hind Sirelkhatim Hamid Mukhtar, receive their marriage license. Relatives passed the phone around the banquet hall, congratulating him via the messaging app. Guests ate fried chicken and falafel. “And I guess they had cake, but I didn’t see it,” Mr. Mohammed, 32, added recently with a laugh. Missing the ceremony in August was yet another in a series of challenges for the long-distance couple, who had struck up a romance after he moved to New York in 2014. They met in Khartoum while they both worked at a heavy equipment company. Mr. Mohammed, who is soft-spoken and describes himself as shy, was fixing a computer four years ago when Ms. Mukhtar, an accountant, introduced herself. She shook his hand with the warmth and confidence of friend, he said. “She’s really outgoing,” he added. “The opposite of me.” "
1437,"WASHINGTON — Wherever I go, people ask me the same question: “How can he?” How can Kevin support President Trump? Why isn’t he bothered by all the things others find appalling and frightening? Thanksgiving weekend is here, so it’s time for my Republican brother to share his bounteous harvest of thoughts: Every time I hear Neil Gorsuch’s name, I smile. It has been a year since Donald Trump was elected, and his thrill-a-minute White House is still causing acid reflux for half the country and all of the mainstream media. There is always a lot of background noise buzzing around the president, and it’s catnip for his detractors. Full disclosure: I am not a Trump disciple. His manners offend me and the tweeting is overdone, but I do admire his resiliency against an unrelenting and unfair press. His tweeting is annoying, but it can be an effective defense. He has 43.2 million Twitter followers. The New York Times has 3.1 million subscribers. Trump got into office because of Congress’s inability or unwillingness to do its job. The voters were so fed up, they turned to a reality TV star instead of the 20 politicians on the menu. (Or 20.5 if you want to count Martin O’Malley.) Trump delivered on his promises to shake things up with a slew of executive orders undoing much of Barack Obama’s burdensome regulations and, more important, started to reshape the lower courts decimated by Obama’s appointments. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court may be his most lasting legacy. Trump’s presidency is unorthodox, but his blustering against Kim Jong-un is the only way to deal with a bully. And since Kim will want to get back at Trump, and Kim’s rockets may be able to reach only the West Coast, we’re probably all right until he can hit a red state. Democrats say Obamacare needs only a tweak. My youngest son just received his bill for health care. It came with an annual premium of $8,100. At that price, I think he will continue to vote Republican. "
1438,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. I want to start this Thanksgiving edition of the newsletter with a short story about The New York Times. The Times, like the rest of the media, is suffering from a drop in advertising. Print advertising is shrinking, and much of the new digital ad revenue is flowing to only two companies, Facebook and Google. The Times’s ad business remains robust relative to the competition, but it’s not immune. Our print advertising revenue dropped 16 percent — or $43 million — during the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period in 2016. A rise in digital advertising — of $23 million — wasn’t enough to make up for the decline. But something else was more than big enough to make up for the decline: Subscribers. Revenue from digital-only subscriptions jumped 44 percent — or $75 million — in the first nine months of this year, compared to the same period last year. (And print subscriptions remain strong. So don’t worry, print subscribers: The newspaper isn’t going away. It’s still a great technology.) In practical terms, Times subscribers are increasingly paying for Times journalism. If you’re a subscriber, you are helping to pay for the investigations of the Trump administration and Harvey Weinstein, for the correspondents and photographers bearing witness around the world, for the interactive graphics, podcasts and videos, for the expert journalists covering culture, business, government and — as seems worth emphasizing today — food. “We’re a reader-supported institution, driven by people like you, who believe in truth and independence, rigor and fact,” as Jodi Kantor, one of the reporters who broke the culture-changing Weinstein story, recently wrote to readers. Or as my fellow columnist Nick Kristof has written: “We sometimes fall short — and I hope you’ll tell us when we screw up — but it’s never been more crucial that we play the role of a serious watchdog.” So thank you. It’s a privilege for my colleagues and me to be part of your eyes and ears on the world. I especially want to thank all of you who read this newsletter, including those who frequently write to me with their thoughts. Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. In The Times. My colleagues have put together a selection of Thanksgiving-themed pieces from our archives. It includes Frank Bruni on his family’s Italian-American celebration; Jennifer Finney Boylan on her first Thanksgiving away from home; a 2014 blog post on how the Civil War created the national holiday; and two pieces from the latest Sunday Review: one on intuitive eating and one on staying on campus during break. Also, on Facebook yesterday, Frank Bruni and Bari Weiss talked about politics at Thanksgiving. "
1439,"WASHINGTON — President Trump urged senators this month to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most Americans have health insurance and use the proceeds to slash the top tax rate paid by the richest Americans, a suggestion that pitted his priorities against his daughter and Republican senators intent on helping the middle class. In the end, the president accepted only a partial victory. He got the repeal of the health law’s individual mandate, but gave up on an income tax rate cut that would have directly benefited him personally. Instead, Ivanka Trump and her allies in the Senate prevailed in their push to include an expanded child tax credit. “This was certainly an uphill battle, especially given that it is not an issue that is as widely understood,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a leading advocate of the expanded child tax credit. “We didn’t necessarily have the sense that the president was opposed to it. I still don’t have that sense. I think if he had been, things would have worked out differently than they did.” Two White House officials pushed back against the notion that Ms. Trump had split with her father. They said middle-income tax relief was one of the president’s priorities and that Ms. Trump worked in lock step with the administration on all aspects of tax reform. But the fight is actually continuing. Later this week, Mr. Lee and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, will take on another top priority of the president’s, cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The senators plan to offer an amendment that would cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, instead of 20 percent, and use the proceeds to help families with little or no income tax liabilities benefit from the expanded child credit and to allow the child credit to rise with inflation. A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, wasted no time declaring the president’s opposition on Wednesday. "
1440,"Rem Koolhaas, the architect whose ties to urbanism run so deep that his firm is even called the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, has shifted his focus to the countryside. His recent research obsession will be the subject of “Countryside: Future of the World,” an exhibition planned for the Guggenheim Museum’s spiral rotunda in fall 2019, the museum announced on Wednesday. The exhibition — organized by Troy Conrad Therrien in his most ambitious project since he was hired as the Guggenheim’s first curator for architecture and digital initiatives three years ago — will explore how the world’s rural landscapes have been altered by technology, migration and climate change. In an interview, Mr. Koolhaas said that there are obviously architectural and cultural reasons to consider the countryside (which he defined as “anything that is not the city”), but in the wake of Brexit and President Trump’s election, “there’s also a political reason to look at it.” “We know now the political consequences of ignoring the countryside,” he added. Mr. Therrien said the many headlines in the past year about the role small-town America played in the election have made interest in the countryside “roar back to life,” which, he added “raises the stakes for the exhibition and puts pressure on us to remain nimble” while the show is in development. The idea first struck Mr. Koolhaas several years ago when he noticed that a Swiss village he visits annually had lost much of its original population while drastically expanding to accommodate tourists who built houses they rarely inhabited. And, he said, a local farmer he thought had come from a rich tradition was in fact a dissatisfied nuclear scientist from Frankfurt. Mr. Koolhaas — along with AMO, the research arm of OMA, and his students at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design — began to look into roughly 15 to 20 areas around the world that, he said, “together describe comprehensively what is going on” with changes to rural environments on every continent. In Russia, for example, agriculture has migrated northward as permafrost melts, Mr. Koolhaas said, while farming communities have become increasingly isolated by hundreds of airport closures around the country. And in the United States, the California-Nevada border near Reno has been turned into “Silicon Valley’s back of house.” “You could say it’s not a city, yet,” Mr. Koolhaas said, although “the scale of development is definitely kind of urban. But it is a new kind of urban, because it will be inhabited by machines and by robots, and few people.” Mr. Koolhaas observed that more than half of the typical magazine covers on newsstands in cities showed images related to the countryside. “It’s there and part of our subconscious,” he said, adding that rural images also work their way into a faux-rustic aesthetic of urban coffee houses, hotels and shops. “It’s a very ironic situation,” Mr. Koolhaas said, “that we are at the same time ignoring yet profoundly influenced and infiltrated by the semiotics of the countryside.” "
1441,"For some pop stars, a holiday album is an opportunity to perfect the classics. But for others, it’s a chance to dismantle them or make new ones. This year, those left-field Christmas sounds include Gypsy jazz, Atlanta rap, club-pop and Renaissance Faire. Here, the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times select notable releases, familiar and odd. It’s surprising how well antiseptic zeal and pep age. The boy band 98° hasn’t put out an album of note in 17 years, and yet this holiday release — its second, after “This Christmas,” from 1999 — is appealing and welcome. The foursome sometimes stumbles on the more religiously oriented material (“Mary, Did You Know?”). But little gestures — a heaving take on Joni Mitchell’s “River,” the harmless beatbox backdrop on “Let It Snow” or the silky R&B harmonies on “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” — land like sprinkling snow. JON CARAMANICA Nearly half a century ago, Herb Alpert and his easy-listening squad, the Tijuana Brass, scored a success with “The Christmas Album.” His first holiday record since that 1968 release includes one original (“The Christmas Wish”) and a reprise from the earlier album (his trumpet version of “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring”), along with gauzy, Mantovani-string-soaked takes on typical Christmas fare. Still, Mr. Alpert knows a vast amount of music, and he feeds energy into these songs: the Afro-Caribbean funk feel on “Santa Baby,” or the surging swing of “Winter Wonderland.” Then there’s his trumpet playing, which he still does spryly at the age of 82, with its dusty allure intact. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO "
1442,"ST. CHARLES, Mo. — President Trump rallied support on Wednesday for his tax plan in a Missouri county where the unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, a fitting backdrop for a speech in which he bragged about the health of the economy while contending that a major tax cut was crucial to economic growth. Republicans have juggled those twin claims in pitching their tax bill, which was introduced at the beginning of November and remains on course to reach Mr. Trump’s desk next month. They insist that the plan will deliver an immediate stimulus and encourage long-term investment. “These massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel” for the American economy, particularly for small businesses on Main Street, Mr. Trump said in a speech here. But some economists question whether rocket fuel is needed at this point in the economic recovery and say that too much stimulus could ultimately backfire. The economy is strengthening and unemployment is at its lowest point in 16 years. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, above the maximum sustainable level of output estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Mr. Trump played up that report in a long riff, saying that the growth rate would have been “4 percent, maybe over 4 percent” if not for late summer hurricanes. “We are hitting numbers that nobody thought possible, certainly not in this time” in office, he said, adding, “This is all done without the tax cuts.” "
1443,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • North Korea’s latest launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile reached a new height, demonstrating that the full continental U.S. lies in reach — though not necessarily that the North could deliver a nuclear warhead. The North’s statement after Wednesday’s launch — that it had “finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force” — raised the possibility that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, might feel empowered enough to enter talks for concessions. Part of our Op-Ed team that visited North Korea recently put together this video, offering a rare glimpse inside the secretive nation. And our Interpreter column presents seven critical truths about North Korea. _____ • “It is wrong for the president to have done this.” That was the office of Theresa May, the British prime minister, after President Trump retweeted video posts from an ultranationalist British party leader supposedly portraying Muslims committing acts of violence. "
1444,"Two of the Republican senators who have stepped forward to block the party’s dash toward a tax overhaul say they are withholding their support to stick up for Main Street. Big corporations, they argue, are being given preferential treatment compared with smaller businesses that are organized differently and known as pass-throughs. The David-and-Goliath story that the senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, are spinning would be compelling — except that it is wrong. Pass-throughs have a lower total tax burden than corporations do. That advantage exists now and remains in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill. If corporations are “the haves,” then pass-throughs are the “have-mores.” “I honestly don’t know what he’s talking about,” Alan J. Auerbach, a tax expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said of Mr. Johnson’s complaints. “Tax rates are going down a lot. It’s businesses versus everybody else.” Businesses are taxed in different ways. Corporations and their investors are subject to two layers of taxation. First, a corporate rate on profits is paid directly by the company. Under current law, the top rate is 35 percent. Then, when the business pays returns to its investors, they pay tax on the money they’ve earned when they file in April. That income — dividends and capital gains — is taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent. (Generally, if your income is less than $200,000, the rate is 20 percent.) "
1445,"Susan Collins and some other senators who had hinted they might oppose the Republican tax bill giveaway to the super rich are changing their tune. Apparently, President Trump assured them over lunch that he’s going to fix the bill. Are they actually that clueless? Or do they merely think the rest of us are? One of the few certainties in these uncertain times is that no one can rely on anything Trump says. But these senators believe him now? The only other option is that they know Trump’s pledges to “fix” the tax bill are insincere and they are conning their constituents and the rest of America. Neither possibility is appetizing, but that’s where we are after Trump met with Republican senators to talk about the tax bill. Participants told reporters that Trump was paying attention and seemed to understand the details. Think about that. It’s news when this president seems to grasp an even slightly complicated idea. After the meeting, Trump announced that the bill will “have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive — the largest in the history of our country — tax cut.” Another false assurance. It was never going be the biggest tax cut in history, and the only “very, very massive” reductions are going to corporations and extremely wealthy individuals, like Trump. "
1446,"Oy vey, it’s awards season again. Could there be a worse time for Hollywood to celebrate itself? It was around this time last year — i.e., a more innocent time — that the fair people of Tinseltown began using acceptance speeches to shake their manicured fists at Donald J. Trump. There was Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes, tearing into Trumpian cruelty, and, amid furor over the Muslim travel ban, David Harbour of “Stranger Things” vowing at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to “repel bullies” and “hunt monsters.” Sitting in the cheering audiences on both occasions was Harvey Weinstein, months away from being accused of being a rapacious predator. As Hollywood has bitterly learned, it is a whole lot easier to preach when the monster is not one of your own. Even if more players from the entertainment world hadn’t been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment, the gravity of the accusations leveled at Mr. Weinstein — who has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex — would still have injected a stink into the awards season this year. Mr. Weinstein may have been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but he has left lasting marks on the Oscars race. He elevated and made a blood sport out of campaigning. Guild and ancillary awards matter more now in part because of him: He fought bareknuckled for every prize. Though his power had sharply waned from his heyday, which lasted from the ’90s through the aughts, Mr. Weinstein’s outsized presence and shameless politicking were awards-season staples. His reputation for being a bully endured, but he was also beheld as a grandstanding lion in winter, one who prompted eye rolls and the perennial question, “What will Harvey pull this year?” Despite being financially weakened, Mr. Weinstein delivered, audaciously. He arranged for Philomena Lee, who was forced by Irish nuns to give up her son for adoption, to meet the pope in the final weeks of the awards campaign for the 2013 film about her. "
1447,"It is a continuing astonishment to many a sensible adult that anyone who survived adolescence takes Ayn Rand seriously. Yet admirers of this creator of fat, hyperventilating novels, which extolled “the virtue of selfishness” and the capitalist superhero, have filled conservative power lists for decades. Those said to take counsel these days from her feverish portraits of egomaniacs at the top include Paul Ryan; Ron and Rand Paul; and the current president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. You may be surprised to learn that this roster has come to include the daring Tony-winning director Ivo van Hove, a creator of productions that might well provoke cries of puritanical censure from the Senate floor. Yet on the evidence of his adaptation of Rand’s breakthrough novel, “The Fountainhead” (1943), which opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Tuesday night, she has seldom had a better advocate. Not, I hasten to add, for her ferocious vision of free-market fundamentalism, which has so enchanted right-leaning politicians and economists. No, what this production from Mr. van Hove’s Toneelgroep Amsterdam captures with such alarming verve is the sheer pulp appeal of what is essentially one really sick soap opera. Designed by Jan Versweyveld, Mr. van Hove’s longtime partner in carefully calibrated excess, this four-hour glorification of an American architectural genius at odds with a culture of mediocrity has been given a sweep, heft and hysteria usually associated with productions of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle. Granted, Rand’s prose, both purple and leaden, doesn’t have the resistance-proof momentum of Wagner’s music. This is especially true when you’re hearing her (many, many) words spoken in Dutch, as adapted by Koen Tachelet, and then translated into projected English supertitles. "
1448,"In late August, a crowd of thousands — primarily leftists and liberals — cascaded down Martin Luther King Jr. Way in Berkeley, Calif. They were marching on a spattering of right-wingers, Trump supporters and Nazis who were gathering under the mission to say “no to Marxism in America.” At the front of the march were about 100 people dressed in head-to-toe black. According to many people present, this was the largest so-called black bloc they’d seen. This medley of black-clad anarchists, anti-fascists (known as “antifa” activists) and their fellow travelers was a response to the previous week’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. There, protests ended with 19 injured and 32-year-old Heather Heyer killed when James Fields, an admirer of Hitler who demonstrated with white supremacists, drove his car into a crowd. This mass of solid black descending upon the park in Berkeley, hunting for fascists, was an intimidating aesthetic. That’s by design. “Cops wear camouflage when they arrest people in city drug raids,” said Ben, a Bay Area activist. “But they’re in a city. It doesn’t help them, but it makes them look more intimidating.” Ben says he has participated in protests since 2000, including Bush/Gore, Occupy Oakland and Black Lives Matter. (The Times agreed to use only his first name because of the threat of harassment, online or otherwise, by activists.) “A group of people all dressed in black can be intimidating,” he said. Is that intimidation the motive or just a benefit? Do black bloc practitioners dress up because, as many progressives wonder, they want to commit crimes? What do they get out of “masking up”? Where does uniform merge with tactic? "
1449,"People who can’t stand U2’s earnest, heal-the-world side may want to turn elsewhere right now. The word “love,” unironic and high-minded, recurs all over “Songs of Experience,” the band’s long-gestating sequel to its 2014 album, “Songs of Innocence.” Where “Songs of Innocence” was full of youthful biographical specifics, both euphoric and grim, from the group’s lead singer and main lyricist, Bono, “Songs of Experience” has an adult’s broader, more general perspective. It favors lessons and archetypes, not stories. Like “Songs of Innocence,” the new album employed multiple producers, and U2 has clearly pondered every nanosecond of sound, whether polishing its reverberations or administering calibrated amounts of distortion. It’s not an album that courts new fans by radically changing U2’s style; instead, it reaffirms the sound that has been filling arenas and stadiums for decades. The album is also a return to the standard commercial market. Apple made “Songs of Innocence” a giveaway that suddenly appeared in the iTunes libraries of both fans and non-fans worldwide. Many greeted it as a corporate intrusion rather than a gift, generating a backlash that threatened to eclipse the album’s worthy songs. “Songs of Experience,” U2’s 14th studio album, is having a more conventional release. Bono has described “Songs of Experience” as a collection of letters to family, fans and America: messages and advisories from a globally minded public figure. And for most of the album, U2 sets out to counter the anger, despair and cynicism of 2017 with insistent optimism. That’s a temptation to preach, and some songs are unabashed homilies. Bookending the album (before a bonus track) are songs titled “Love Is All We Have Left” and “Love Is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way.” The opener is a celestial benediction over tremulous strings, declaring, “Nothing to stop this being the best day ever,” while the finale is a grand crescendo of a march, an arena anthem declaring, “When you think you’re done, you’ve just begun.” "
1450,"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. SAN FRANCISCO — How can policymakers, entrepreneurs and technologists fight climate change in the face of political headwinds? Gov. Jerry Brown of California is likely to address that question on Wednesday when he headlines ClimateTECH, a new conference from The New York Times, in a conversation with the Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman. On Thursday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, the billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, and the executive director of Project Drawdown, Paul Hawken, will continue the conversation, leading a lineup of policymakers and technology leaders to discuss solutions to global warming. When and where: Governor Brown will speak at 7:40 p.m. Pacific time (10:40 p.m. Eastern time) at the City View at Metreon in San Francisco. How to watch: The conversation will be streamed live on The Times’s home page, YouTube page and Facebook page. The following day’s panels will be posted online here. What to know: The Trump administration just attended two weeks of intense negotiations in Bonn, Germany, on the Paris agreement — the global accord on climate change that President Trump has vowed to abandon. Governor Brown was there too, along with a coalition of other governors, mayors and business leaders with an unequivocal message: that they are still in the Paris agreement even if the federal government backs out. Now comes the tough part: figuring out what that means in practical terms. Many states and cities have pledged to reduce emissions in an effort to meet the Paris agreement goals. The America’s Pledge movement is notable. It’s also incomplete. What will it take to get the biggest fossil-fuel dependent states on board? Beyond that, the world also needs an “energy miracle,” as the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has asserted. That’s where some of the world’s top innovators and entrepreneurs come in. Astro Teller, the “Captain of Moonshots” at X, the research and development arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, will talk with Mr. Friedman about the challenges and opportunities of seeking big technology solutions to big problems. Katie Benner, a Times technology reporter, will talk to Geisha J. Williams, the president and chief executive of PG&E Corp., about the utility’s ambitious goal of generating half its power from renewable energy by 2030. I’ll be sitting down with Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress, and Simon Irish, chief executive of Terrestrial Energy, to talk about the role of nuclear energy. And Keith Bradsher, The Times’s Shanghai bureau chief, will take the conversation global in a talk with Li Junfeng, a central architect of China’s renewable energy policy. Governor Brown is likely to remind the crowd that addressing climate change won’t be easy. “Decarbonizing the economy is like climbing Mount Everest,” he told me in Bonn. “It’s like going from pagan Rome to Christian Europe, and we don’t have 700 years to do it. It’s a transformation.” "
1451,"WASHINGTON — After firing an intercontinental ballistic missile higher than ever before, North Korea this week said it had mastered nuclear-strike capability and become a full-fledged nuclear state. That claim was immediately met with skepticism, not least in the White House. But by showing that its missiles can reach Washington — even if there is doubt that North Korea can deliver a nuclear warhead there — Pyongyang took yet another step toward that goal. Its latest test raised a question the United States and its allies seem likely to have to answer sooner or later: Is it time to accept that North Korea will never give up its nuclear arms, and try to reach a deal to stop its arsenal from growing further? China and Russia have been pushing for an agreement that would freeze Pyongyang’s nuclear program, in exchange for a suspension of joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. The United States rejects the idea; officials said the administration would stick to its strategy of marshaling international pressure on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to give up his nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, President Trump vowed to impose “additional major sanctions” on the North, though he got ahead of his bureaucracy by saying on Twitter that they would be announced that day. White House officials said the Treasury Department was still drafting the measures. Mr. Trump, who had reacted cautiously to news of the launch, also returned to name-calling, labeling Mr. Kim “Little Rocket Man” and a “sick puppy” in an unscripted aside during a speech on Wednesday about tax cuts in St. Charles, Mo. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council convened Wednesday evening, the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, called on China to stop providing North Korea with crude oil, threatening unilateral action if Beijing continued to resist that drastic step. "
1452,"It’s weird to think that one year ago today Barack Obama was still the president. Michelle Obama was decorating the White House with happy snowmen and gingerbread dogs instead of transforming the East Colonnade into a hell-bound gullet of witch fingers, apparently our new tradition, and the president of the United States somehow made it through the entire week without insulting a single 90-year-old Native American war hero. Many of us were angry and terrified but still energized about things like vote audits and faithless electors. We hoped the system might have a fail-safe to protect us from our worst selves — a flash-frozen grown-up to defrost in case of emergencies. Now, a year wiser and few thousand older, in too many ways we are still waiting. It hasn’t clicked with the necessary urgency that we are the grown-ups. We are still frozen. Every year, Dictionary.com chooses one word, “a symbol of the year’s most meaningful events and lookup trends,” to be the Word of the Year. The past few picks seem to follow a chilling but logical evolution. In 2015 the Word of the Year was broad and neutral — “identity” — issues of racial and gender injustice having finally come closer to becoming national priorities and weathered a ghastly but predictable (and still developing) backlash. Two thousand fifteen was a difficult year, but it was a year of progress. By the end of 2016, as Trumpism seized the wheel, our national conversation on identity sharpened to a sinister specificity: that year’s word was “xenophobia.” Two thousand sixteen was a year of us versus them, of villains making their plans clear, of straight, white, Christian identity politics moving to supplant everyone else. This year, the Word of the Year zooms out, implicating millions of us. The word is “complicit.” Two thousand seventeen is a year of reckoning. Searches for the definition of “complicit” spiked in May, Dictionary.com tells us, when Ivanka Trump was asked to respond to accusations of complicity on “CBS This Morning.” This is one of my favorite Trump-family anecdotes, if one can be said to have a “favorite” venomous snake biting your child on the face: “If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact,” Ivanka said, “then I’m complicit.” "
1453,"To the Editor: In “Net Neutrality Facing Full Repeal in F.C.C. Plan” (news article, Nov. 21), we learn that in a speech in April the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Ajit Pai, speaking of the creation of net neutrality, claimed that “we decided to abandon successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms.” Net neutrality gives a level playing field for content providers and allows consumers to select any content from the web. Contrary to Mr. Pai’s claim, the harms are not hypothetical. In early 2014, before the current net neutrality rules were adopted, Comcast slowed data from Netflix to a crawl. Netflix paid Comcast and the problem was resolved. But suppose Netflix were unwilling or unable to pay Comcast. Theoretically the consumer who wanted Netflix could select a different internet service provider, but in reality there is often no or very little choice of I.S.P.s. Under the current rules, Comcast could not slow data based on the content provider. Without net neutrality, I.S.P.s become gatekeepers of which content gets to their customers. This could leave many small businesses without the ability to reach their customers and many customers without choices. Furthermore, I.S.P. owners could decide to block content from a political party that did not align with their political views. Gatekeepers have a great deal of power, and without regulation can abuse that power. Mr. Pai’s refusal to acknowledge this is very dangerous for both the economy and our democracy. ETHAN ANNIS, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: Re “F.C.C. Releases Plan to Repeal Net Neutrality” (front page, Nov. 22): On the expected demise of net neutrality, as with the removal of so many rights and privileges, the authorities responsible for these losses present them as giving more people more choices: Ajit Pai is removing net neutrality “so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them.” Similarly, repealing the Affordable Care Act will provide consumers with more choices; expanding charter schools will give parents more choices about where to educate their children.

1454,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A Navy veteran, expectant father and nuclear engineering graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley would see his taxes increase by $4,247. Another graduate student at Berkeley, a mother of two who is studying jurisprudence and social policy, would see her federal taxes increase by $1,647. These are the some of the numbers that Kathy Shield, a graduate student at Berkeley, has crunched to highlight the repeal of an obscure deduction in the tax bill passed earlier this month by the House of Representatives. Many universities waive tuition for graduate students in exchange for research or teaching duties. The House bill contains a provision that, if included in a final tax bill, would remove a deduction on the waived tuition. Ms. Shield, who studies nuclear engineering, and Vetri Velan, who studies particle physics, have teamed up to draw attention to the tax bill provision. They have produced a rudimentary online calculator that students can use to calculate how their taxes will change. Mr. Velan wrote a widely circulated memo, explaining the tax provision. "
1455,"WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Wednesday that the country’s economic expansion had broadened and strengthened, and that she expected the growth to continue. Ms. Yellen’s upbeat assessment, delivered to the Joint Economic Committee, is likely to reinforce expectations the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-December. It could also sharpen questions about Republican plans for a major tax cut aimed at stimulating faster growth. “Economic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in the year,” she told the Congressional committee. “Moreover, the economic expansion is increasingly broad, based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.” The hearing may have been Ms. Yellen’s last appearance before Congress in her current role. Her four-year term as the Fed chairwoman ends in early February, and she has said that she plans to leave as soon as her successor is sworn in. President Trump has nominated Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, to serve as the its next chairman. Ms. Yellen was careful to say that the economy could be doing better. She noted that the pace of economic growth remained slow by historical standards. The two major determinants of growth, the number of workers and the productivity of the average worker, are rising slowly. “ Congress might consider policies that encourage business investment and capital formation, improve the nation’s infrastructure, raise the quality of our educational system, and support innovation and the adoption of new technologies,” she said.

1456,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The Republican senators who aren’t yet committed to voting for the tax bill have a huge amount of leverage. They are not using it. Instead, they mostly seem to be folding — accepting vague promises from President Trump (who doesn’t exactly have a good record of keeping his word) and Mitch McConnell. That was Tuesday’s theme on Capitol Hill. Susan Collins, who has said she is worried about the damage the bill will do to health care, no longer seems to be insisting on any legislation to reduce the damage. Bob Corker, who has said he is worried about the deficit, is backing away from his promise to vote against any bill that adds “one penny” to the deficit. Jeff Flake, James Lankford and Jerry Moran, three other senators who have been talking about the deficit, have also shown little sign of backing up their words. "
1457,"WASHINGTON — President Trump touched off another racially charged furor on Wednesday by sharing videos from a fringe British ultranationalist group purportedly showing Muslims committing acts of violence, a move that was swiftly condemned by Britain’s prime minister as well as politicians across the spectrum. The videos Mr. Trump retweeted were titled: “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” But the assailant in one of them was not a “Muslim migrant” and the other two showed four-year-old events with no explanation. No modern American president has promoted inflammatory content of this sort from an extremist organization. Mr. Trump’s two most recent predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both made a point of avoiding public messages that were likely to be seen as anti-Muslim and could exacerbate racial and religious animosities, arguing that the war against terrorism was not a war against Islam. But Mr. Trump has shown little such restraint, targeting Muslims with a broad brush, including when he claimed on the campaign trail last year that “Islam hates us” and when he called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims coming to the United States. Since taking office, he has sought to block visitors from select Muslim-majority nations and engaged in a long-distance feud with the Muslim mayor of London, whom he branded weak on terrorism. The messages came at a time when Mr. Trump has been lashing out at an array of perceived adversaries, including the National Football League, CNN, NBC and Democratic leaders. He referred to a senator as “Pocahontas” this week in front of Navajo veterans he was honoring. In a meandering speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Wednesday, Mr. Trump labeled North Korea’s leader a “sick puppy,” asserted that welfare recipients lived better than some people with jobs, noted that his wealthy friends “love their children” and insisted that he did not like some bankers even though he was making their job “easy for them.” Mr. Trump’s unbridled talk of Muslim violence thrilled some conservative supporters who see him as a truthteller breaking from the shackles of political correctness, but it alarmed mainstream political leaders in the United States and Britain, who deemed it reckless and counterproductive.

1458,"Good Wednesday. Here are some of the stories we are watching. • The former C.E.O. of Massey Energy plans to run for U.S. Senate. • Where have all the media deals gone? • Mars invests in Kind, a step toward a more healthful empire. • One of the biggest German IPOs in years could arrive next year. • Cineworld holds talks to buy Regal.

Two senators — Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana — have argued the Republican tax plans give big corporations preferential treatment compared with pass-throughs. The problem with their argument is it’s wrong. The New York Times’s Patricia Cohen reports: The key point here is that corporations and their investors are taxed twice: Pass-through businesses, meanwhile, are taxed just once: But even in Republican rewrite of the tax code — in which the corporate rate is lowered to 20 percent — pass-throughs still come out on top. That again is because corporation are taxed twice. Six months ago, Don Blankenship — the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy and once one of the most-feared men in the coal industry — shed his label as federal inmate 12393-088. "
1459,"The fast-moving national reckoning over sexual harassment in the workplace toppled another television news star on Wednesday when NBC fired Matt Lauer, the co-host of its most profitable franchise, “Today,” after an allegation of inappropriate sexual behavior with a subordinate. The downfall of Mr. Lauer, a presence in American living rooms for more than 20 years, adds to a head-spinning string of prominent firings over sexual harassment and abuse allegations. NBC News said it had decided to dismiss its star morning anchor after a woman met with network executives on Monday to describe her interactions with him. “While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he’s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,” Andrew Lack, the NBC News chairman, wrote in a memo to staff. On Wednesday, NBC received at least two more complaints related to Mr. Lauer, according to a person briefed on the network’s handling of the matter. One complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her. She provided her account to The New York Times but declined to let her name be used. She told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse. She said that she felt helpless because she didn’t want to lose her job, and that she didn’t report the encounter at the time because she felt ashamed. On Thursday, Mr. Lauer issued an apology, expressing “sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused.” News of Mr. Lauer’s sudden downfall shook the television world, where he had established himself as one of the most powerful men in his industry. Even President Trump — who himself has denied multiple allegations of sexual misconduct — weighed in, seizing on Mr. Lauer’s firing to denounce NBC News’s coverage and call for other senior figures at NBC News to be ousted. "
1460,"• Late Wednesday afternoon, the Senate voted along party lines, 52-48, to begin debate on the tax plan. • The spotlight now turns to the floor debate, which is limited to 20 hours. • President Trump gave a speech in Missouri touting his tax plan. • Some Republicans now say a “trigger” mechanism under discussion should require automatic spending cuts, not tax increases. • Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah want to expand the child tax credit and proposed a corporate tax rate of 22 percent, not 20 percent as in Senate bill. • Republicans are now discussing allowing pass-through owners to deduct 20 percent of business income, up from 17.4 percent. "
1461,"Over the past few decades, some of the largest companies in the United States made a big bet: By stashing hundreds of billions of dollars of profits offshore, they could slash their taxes and bolster their profits. It would take a generation to see if the strategy would fully pay off, because the law allowed companies only to defer the taxes on overseas earnings, not to permanently avoid them. Would they ever be able to bring the profits back to the United States without incurring huge tax bills? Some 20 years after the tax-avoiding technique became widespread, it is poised to pay off in a big way. The Republican tax bills making their way through the House and Senate would allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates. In a tax-overhaul package that would provide the greatest benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations, the so-called repatriation provision stands out. It would give companies a permanent tax break of about half a trillion dollars, rewarding the likes of Google, Apple, Pfizer and General Electric. Corporate America claims that about $3 trillion in profits were generated in places like Bermuda, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg. The tax breaks for bringing home such offshore profits “confirm the central tenet of tax planning that a tax deferred is a tax avoided,” said David Miller, a tax lawyer at Proskauer Rose. “For decades, U.S. multinationals have shifted profits abroad and deferred their taxes on them. If either of the tax bills pass, they will be rewarded for doing so.” To be sure, the legislation erects some potential guardrails against future efforts to shift profits offshore. It would establish a minimum tax abroad on certain types of income — at least 10 percent for the first several years in the Senate version — thus raising the tax bills for many companies on their foreign profits. And regulators in Europe and elsewhere abroad have accelerated their efforts to crack down on such profit shifting out of their countries. "
1462,"How does President Trump continue to pass for an economic populist even as his policies and appointees are those of an economic royalist? The Republican tax plans he supports are a prime example: They favor corporations and upper-bracket individuals and rely on the long-discredited “trickle down” theory to offer benefits to workers. Mr. Trump’s key economic posts have gone to Wall Street veterans. Most recently, he nominated Jerome Powell — a partner from 1997 to 2005 in the Carlyle Group, one of the largest private equity firms — to be chairman of the Federal Reserve. The president’s other top economic officials are either investment bankers or private equity managers. Gary Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both came from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is another prominent private equity operator. In 2002, Mr. Ross bought several steel factories that had been closed; he reopened them after persuading the steelworkers union to take major cuts. When he cashed out three years later, he made 14 times his original investment of $90 million. According to the economists Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, “his three-year investment netted him $4.5 billion — just equal to what retirees lost in their health and pension plans.” This is an administration run by and for financial engineers. The president’s policies have sought to gut what remains of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation that protects consumers from financial wrongdoing, most recently in his assault on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Despite Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to eliminate the carried-interest loophole — which taxes the fees of private-equity fund managers and other investment managers at low capital gains rates instead of at higher income tax rates — the House and Senate plans leave it intact. "
1463,"I opened the door of a business called True’s. It was a pharmacy run by a conservative Republican, a man who eventually served as the speaker of the House in the Maine State Legislature. It occurred to me, as I walked in, that the store might well refuse to fill my prescription, given my condition. And I wondered whether the pharmacy’s actions would be legal if, indeed, the pharmacist argued that helping a person like me went against his beliefs. After all, there’s a long history of people using religious liberty as reason to justify their refusal to provide a public service offered by their business. In 1968, the owner of a barbecue restaurant — Piggie Park, in South Carolina — held that his religious beliefs gave him the right to withhold service from African-Americans. The owner, Maurice Bessinger, argued that the Civil Rights Act violated his freedom of religion, because “his religious beliefs compel him to oppose any integration of the races whatever.” More recently, a pediatrician rejected Krista and Jamie Contreras’s child as a patient in Roseville, Mich., in 2014. The doctor, saying she had given the matter “much prayer,” decided that she couldn’t provide health care to their baby because they are lesbians. On Tuesday, in a case supported by the Trump administration and a group called Alliance Defending Freedom, a broad right to discriminate on the basis of faith will be argued before the Supreme Court. If you’ve never heard of the Alliance Defending Freedom, the name alone is probably a tip off that freedom is the last thing it’s concerned with defending. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated it a hate group. Yes, we have reached a point in our history where no one is surprised for one moment that in a case being argued before the Supreme Court, the White House is on the same side as a designated hate group. By now maybe you’re familiar with the case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. A baker in Lakewood, Colo., named Jack Phillips refused to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins, because their loving legal union violated his Christian beliefs. A series of lower courts has sided with Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins, but the appeals process has led to the Supreme Court, where it is expected that the swing vote will ultimately rest with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality. "
1464,"Matt Lauer, who was fired by NBC on Wednesday over a sexual harassment allegation, was one of the network’s most high-profile journalists and the face of one of its most valuable programs, “Today,” since the mid-1990s. Mr. Lauer spent 21 years at “Today,” the longest tenure for the show, and was often at the center of rumored tension among other anchors on the program. In his role, he led NBC’s coverage during major news events, including on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, and engaged in memorable interviews, such as his combative questioning of Tom Cruise in 2005. After several years as the news reader on “Today,” Mr. Lauer replaced Bryant Gumbel as the co-anchor on Jan. 6, 1997. His first week was full of jitters and awkwardness, but those five days were the second-best-rated week in the show’s history at the time. Jeff Zucker, then the executive producer of “Today,” called Mr. Lauer “the hunk next door.” He added, “It’s great for us that women are attracted to him. But that wouldn’t work, and Matt wouldn’t succeed, if he couldn’t do the job.” On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Lauer was talking to the writer Richard Hack about a new Howard Hughes biography. The interview stopped, and Mr. Lauer said he had a photograph to show viewers, but after a technical problem, he said he would discuss the breaking news after a commercial break. "
1465,"Yes, the vocabulary in New York Times articles can be challenging, and teachers of English language learners may assume it’s too hard for their students. But Larry Ferlazzo, who writes for us regularly about how he uses The Times in his E.L.L. classroom, has taught with articles on everything from climate change to Valentine’s Day, and he has a few tips to share. To find even more ideas, check out our 12 Ways To Learn Vocabulary With The New York Times. And, as always, we’d love to hear about your experiences; post a comment and share ideas and tips. What Are Tier Two Words? As you likely already know, the Common Core Standards use the research of Isabel Beck and Margaret McKeown to categorize words into Tiers One, Two and Three. Here is how the Standards describe the tiers: Of course, English language learners, particularly newcomers, must practice Tier One vocabulary daily, and I have written about how to do this in previous Learning Network posts. For instance, the Picture Word Inductive Model is one of my favorite strategies, and I explain how to apply it here. But Tier Two words, as the authors of the Standards point out, “are frequently encountered in complex written texts and are particularly powerful because of their wide applicability to many sorts of reading.” This is why, when I’m working with English language learners, I mainly focus on this tier. There is simply more bang for your teaching buck: Learning these words will make more texts accessible to your students. "
1466,"A gaunt man in tan jail clothes took the witness stand Wednesday and began testifying about how he had bribed a Turkish economy minister as part of a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for oil in violation of United States sanctions on Iran. The witness, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, had been charged with conspiring to violate the sanctions and had faced a trial with Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an official with Halkbank, a Turkish state bank that prosecutors say was involved in the scheme. But last month, Mr. Zarrab secretly pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the authorities, a development revealed when Mr. Atilla’s trial opened in Federal District Court in Manhattan this week. As Mr. Zarrab testified against Mr. Atilla, he was asked by a prosecutor why he had decided to help the American authorities. He offered a pragmatic reason. “Cooperation was the fastest way to accept responsibility and to get out of jail at once,” he said. Mr. Zarrab is currently being held at an undisclosed location — in F.B.I. custody and not in a hotel, he told the court. “Are you free to come and go as you please?” the prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked. “Definitely not,” he said. "
1467,"For the second week in a row, viewers of a network morning show woke up to a disturbing surprise: Two female hosts reporting, and working publicly through the emotion of, the ouster of their male colleague over allegations of sexual misconduct. On Wednesday morning, it was Savannah Guthrie, joined by Hoda Kotb on the “Today” show, her voice shaking as she announced, “Breaking news overnight: Matt Lauer has been terminated from NBC News.” Last week, it was Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell on “CBS This Morning,” where Charlie Rose was fired. How do we process the news, and the shattering of the morning shows? James Poniewozik and Margaret Lyons, two television critics for The Times, discuss. JAMES PONIEWOZIK As in every case like this, the first, second and thousandth concern should be for the victims. The main lesson is straightforward: You shouldn’t harass or assault your co-workers, whatever your job, and you should be punished if you do. But morning-show host is also a public job. By design, it involves a kind of connection with the home viewer, even if an artificial one. You bring people into your home for years, you feel as if you know them, though of course you don’t. Here, millions of people were suddenly told — twice — that this electronic, faux relationship was over. I can’t recall anything quite like this. MARGARET LYONS I can’t either. Morning TV lives and dies by its perceived intimacy. Of course, I don’t know Matt Lauer … but I don’t not know him either. He’s a celebrity — and much of celebrity culture is that one-way bond. "
1468,"One American prisoner has lost six teeth from malnutrition. Another tried to kill himself. A third, a Briton, is traumatized by the possibility her sentence could be doubled. They are among the foreign nationals incarcerated in Iran on spying or sedition charges, a continuing source of tension in that country’s relations with Western nations, particularly the United States and Britain. Many are Iranians with dual citizenship. Now, the prisoner issue is heating up as President Trump threatens to derail the nuclear agreement with Iran and possibly revive onerous American sanctions. Nearly two years after a group of American captives in Iran was freed when the nuclear accord took effect — in return for the release of a group of Iranians held in the United States — there is speculation that another prisoner exchange may be sought. The Iranians have been dropping hints recently that they are prepared to make a deal, even as the Trump administration increasingly shows its antipathy to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his subordinates. Like the last deal, this one might involve clearing of old debts owed to Iran from the period before its 1979 revolution. Each side, in effect, has prisoners to use as a bargaining chip. The Iranians say at least 14 Iranians have been unfairly imprisoned or prosecuted by the United States or its allies, mostly on what they call specious accusations of sanctions violations. The list includes a friend of Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and a pregnant woman held in Australia who could be extradited to the United States. "
1469,"A longtime outsider in New York State politics has been identified as the link between WikiLeaks and Roger J. Stone Jr., an adviser to Donald J. Trump who appears to have had advance knowledge about hacked emails related to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The outsider, Randy Credico, a comedian who has frequently run for office, posted on Twitter on Tuesday that he had received a subpoena requiring him to appear before the House Intelligence Committee next month. The panel is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016  campaign. Mr. Credico could not be reached on Wednesday for comment. A person familiar with the House efforts said that Mr. Credico had been identified as the intermediary between Mr. Stone and Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. Mr. Credico, who also hosts a radio show, interviewed Mr. Assange on his program in April, and Mr. Stone, who worked with Mr. Credico on efforts to reform New York’s drug laws, has also appeared on the show. On a separate occasion, Mr. Credico traveled to London to interview Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he has been granted asylum against extradition to Sweden to face questioning on allegations that he sexually abused two young women in 2010. "
1470,"On Wednesday morning the president of the United States retweeted a series of Islamophobic videos. On Wednesday night a persecuted character in “Mr. Robot” noted: “This country now blames Muslims for everything. There’s no room for us here anymore.” That this episode was produced months before President Trump offered his latest offense to Muslims is yet another example of the show’s uncanny ability to anticipate cultural currents. It also demonstrates that anti-Muslim sentiment is a sadly evergreen theme to explore on TV, and has only gotten more so amid the Trump Administration’s attempted travel bans and other insults and provocations. An Egyptian American who grew up in a Muslim family, Sam Esmail has said his heritage informs his work mostly by helping him relate to outsiders. But xenophobia has become a more prominent theme this season — along with Mr. Esmail’s contempt for the president — culminating in the Dark Army’s brutal scapegoating of Trenton and Mobley as hacker terrorists with Iranian loyalties last week. This week’s exploration of the aftermath, both for Elliot and for Trenton and Mobley’s families, brought the show’s most explicit depiction of the Muslim experience in America. The episode, written by Mr. Esmail, was uncommonly tender and also a little odd (more on that later) as Elliot turned a corner — and perhaps began to synthesize his two halves — with the help of Trenton’s little brother, Mohammed. We’ve heard Trenton discuss him before. Her closeness with her family, along with the fact that she only joined fsociety because American capitalism had victimized her family, made hers the most tragic death we’ve seen on “Mr. Robot.” (For me, anyway.) The boy was perhaps a bit too much the precocious font of guileless wisdom, a favorite trope of filmmakers, and his surprise appearance and cutesy pestering of Elliot also verged on cliché. But he was also endearing. His remarks, in the mosque, about being the only person in his family who could be President pointed up the arbitrariness of one’s place of birth — and all the judgments that are based on that — and reminded us that American citizenship can offer little protection for minority Americans. “If I were president, I would be able to stay here in the house we live in,” he said. "
1471,"WASHINGTON — At a Wednesday afternoon rally in Missouri, President Trump played up what he called the “biggest tax cuts in history” and boasted about economic growth “in a nonbraggadocious way.” “In fact, they’re going to say Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator,” he said of his rosy projections, in a speech full of exaggerations and falsehoods. Here’s an assessment. President Ronald Reagan, who enacted a major tax cut in 1981 and lowered tax rates again in 1986, was hardly the last president to have done so. President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W. Bush enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under President Barack Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and Mr. Obama later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012. Mr. Trump insisted that the tax bill is “not good for me” or the wealthy. Referring to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, the president said: “I keep hearing Schumer, ‘This is for the wealthy!’ If it is, my friends don’t know about it.” That is not supported by most analyses of the tax plans being considered in Congress. Under the Senate plan, every income level would receive a tax cut in 2019, but people earning $20,000 to $30,000 annually would face a tax increase the next year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. By 2027, most people making under $75,000 each year would see a tax increase, while those making more would continue to receive a tax cut. Under the House plan, every income group would see tax cuts through 2027, but the richest one-fifth of Americans would receive 56 percent to almost 75 percent of the cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center. "
1472,"Has North Korea achieved the nuclear weapons capability it thinks it needs to defend itself against the United States? Its latest and most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile test was undeniably hostile. Yet, paradoxically, it could signal a chance for a new diplomatic opening. There are many reasons to be skeptical of the North and pessimistic about the prospects for solving the crisis over its nuclear program, given the ruthlessness of its leader, Kim Jong-un, President Trump’s bombast and the deep mistrust between the two countries. But with regional tensions and the risk of miscalculation so acute, the United States and others, including China, Russia, South Korea and Japan, need to exhaust all avenues in the search for ways to limit the North Korean program. North Korea says its goal is a missile-delivered nuclear weapon capable of striking the United States. It considers itself a nuclear power, with an arsenal of 20 or more weapons, that its officials say is designed to keep the United States from invading and to force an end to sanctions. Mr. Kim has greatly accelerated the nuclear program. The country’s sixth nuclear test came in September and its third test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday. Some experts doubt whether the Hwasong-15 missile can deliver a nuclear weapon, but it flew higher and longer than previous missiles and was judged capable of hitting Washington. Mr. Kim called the test a “resounding success” and “the accomplishment of the historic cause of the national nuclear program, the cause of building a missile power.” American officials and many experts have assumed North Korea would not enter into serious negotiations until it achieved its nuclear ambitions. Therefore, the reasoning goes, if Mr. Kim is as pleased with the program as his statements suggest, now may be the time for the Trump administration, either directly or through intermediaries, to test again whether there’s a chance for serious dialogue. The situation is, to put it mildly, fragile. Mr. Trump has responded to North Korea’s nuclear progress with threats of military options, tighter sanctions and demands that China increase pressure on the North. North Korea effectively shut down communications, including unofficial contacts, with the United States after Mr. Trump threatened in his September speech to the United Nations to destroy North Korea and launched a personal attack on Mr. Kim. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on CNN, “We’re headed toward a war if things don’t change.” After the latest test, Mr. Trump called Mr. Kim a “sick puppy” and promised tighter sanctions but generally was more temperate than usual. Also encouraging was Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s assurance that “diplomatic options remain viable and open,” although he added a crucial caveat: “for now.” If there is any hope of easing the tension and avoiding serious confrontation, each side will have to make a move toward the other. "
1473,"Matt Lauer, of NBC News, played the easygoing dad you could rely on — fun-loving but serious enough when he had to be. Garrison Keillor, of public radio, was your quirky uncle, quick to spin a yarn, tell a corny joke or even break into a song that, if you paid close attention, just might have a lesson in it. Charlie Rose, of CBS, PBS and Bloomberg News, was the urbane, inquisitive host whose Manhattan sophistication was grounded by a humble North Carolina upbringing. And Bill O’Reilly, of Fox News — what can you say? To half the block, he was the neighborhood bully. But if you were with him, you swore by him. He was looking out for you and he had your back — as he reminded you every night. These media luminaries were just right for the archetypal parts they inhabited for so many years — roles that not only made them big names in broadcasting but also took them to the forefront of the national political discussion. One by one, they have fallen to a range of allegations of sexual misconduct against them — the latest coming against Mr. Lauer and Mr. Keillor on Wednesday. And their sudden loss of stature is stripping away their television personae and swiftly ripping down the edifice of the old television news patriarchy in the process. "
1474,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, met this month with investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, and answered questions about a meeting with a Russian ambassador during the presidential transition, according to a person briefed on the investigation. The questions focused on a meeting in December between Mr. Kushner, the ambassador and Michael T. Flynn, who at the time was the president’s incoming national security adviser, the person said on Wednesday. Prosecutors also asked Mr. Kushner about other interactions between Mr. Flynn and the Russian government, the person briefed on the investigation said. Mr. Flynn was fired in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations during the transition with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was then the Russian ambassador to the United States. Reached for comment on Wednesday night, Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, said, “Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so.” The special counsel’s interview of Mr. Kushner was first reported by CNN. Mr. Mueller is investigating whether anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russian officials to try to influence the presidential election. His prosecutors have interviewed many White House officials. The White House has said that Mr. Trump expects everyone to cooperate. The interview does not mean Mr. Kushner is a particular focus of the investigation. Defense lawyers typically do not allow such interviews if they believe that their clients are the target of an investigation. The interview with Mr. Kushner would have been important to Mr. Mueller, who is building a case against Mr. Flynn. A grand jury in Washington has subpoenaed documents and testimony from those around Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors are investigating his business deals, his foreign lobbying and whether he lied on government forms. Mr. Flynn recently cut ties with Mr. Trump’s legal team, a sign that he was considering cooperating with the government. The December meeting at Trump Tower was intended to “establish a line of communication” between the new administration and the Russian government, the White House has said. Mr. Flynn was the presidential transition team’s primary interlocutor with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Kushner coordinated the transition team’s foreign contacts. At that meeting, the men discussed establishing a secret communications channel between the Trump team and Moscow to discuss strategy in Syria and other policy issues. The idea was to have Mr. Flynn speak with a senior military official in Moscow, but the channel was never set up. The special counsel’s interview of Mr. Kushner lasted less than an hour and did not touch on the range of topics Mr. Mueller is investigating. That leaves open the possibility that Mr. Kushner could be interviewed again. Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer, has said that Mr. Flynn has no information to provide prosecutors that can hurt the president. And Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers have sought to play down news of Mr. Flynn’s potential cooperation. "
1475,"President Trump on Wednesday nominated Marvin Goodfriend, a leading critic of the Federal Reserve’s actions since the 2008 financial crisis, to serve on the Fed’s board of governors. The choice of Mr. Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, is a victory for conservatives who want to reshape the Fed’s approach to monetary policy. Mr. Goodfriend has long argued that the Fed should focus on controlling inflation using a minimalist set of tools. The selection comes after Mr. Trump chose a moderate Republican, Jerome H. Powell, as the Fed’s next chairman. There are still three vacancies on the board, and Mr. Trump’s nominees will determine how fast the Fed raises interest rates, and how forcefully it responds to future downturns. Mr. Goodfriend, 67, spent more than 20 years as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, a stronghold of conservative monetary theory, rising to the position of chief monetary policy adviser. He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon. In recent years, he has sharply criticized the Fed’s methods and its goals. As Fed officials sought to revive the economy and drive down unemployment by mounting a large-scale stimulus campaign, Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly cautioned that the Fed was courting higher inflation. In a 2011 interview, he said the Fed should “commit to making low inflation your priority. That will yield the lowest unemployment rate on average over time and the lowest inflation rate.” "
1476,"The United States has filed arguments to the World Trade Organization in a looming dispute over China’s future in the international body, which could shape the global trading system for decades to come. Senior United States officials said on Wednesday that they had filed a brief to the W.T.O. as a third party in a case that China has brought against the European Union. The brief, which will be made public on Thursday, will lay out their legal arguments for why China does not deserve the designation of a “market economy,” a distinction that would entitle it to preferential economic treatment under the W.T.O. The move is likely to ratchet up trade tensions with China, which the White House has called one of the world’s biggest trade offenders. And if China is awarded the designation against the wishes of the United States, it could test the Trump administration’s willingness to remain in the W.T.O., an international body for establishing trade rules and settling disputes that President Trump previously called a “disaster.” China is classified as a nonmarket economy, which allows the United States and other countries to use a special framework under W.T.O. rules to decide whether it is “dumping” its products in other countries by selling them at unfairly low prices. Under this framework, the United States can add an extra duty on some Chinese products to help protect American producers. China maintains that the United States and other W.T.O. members promised to award it the market economy label on Dec. 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of its accession to the W.T.O. But the United States and the European Union have opposed that, claiming that China has failed to hold up its end of the bargain by curtailing the state’s role in the economy. United States officials say the Chinese government’s heavy hand distorts costs and prices in the country and harms competitors abroad. Last December, China challenged both the European Union and the United States at the W.T.O., saying that it was merely protecting its lawful rights. The case with the E.U. is proceeding and could serve as precedent in China’s challenge against the United States, which a W.T.O. panel will consider next. "
1477,"ST. CHARLES, Mo. — President Trump flew to Missouri on Wednesday to talk about tax cuts lifting Main Street and the middle class. But he kept getting sidetracked by repeating unfounded claims that the tax bill poised to pass the Senate would hurt rich people, himself included. “This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me,” Mr. Trump said, in the midst of a frequently meandering 45-minute speech to a festive crowd of 1,000. Then he invoked Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “This is not good for me. Me, it’s not so — I have some very wealthy friends. Not so happy with me, but that’s OK. You know, I keep hearing Schumer: ‘This is for the wealthy.’ Well, if it is, my friends don’t know about it.” Mr. Trump went on to promise to sign the bill, and to vow that, if passed, it would reduce taxes by $2,000 a year for a family of four with a $75,000 annual income. A few moments later, Mr. Trump was back talking about the rich, and about his own taxes going up. “We’re also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage by the wealthy,” Mr. Trump said. “Who are they? I don’t know.” The crowd laughed. “I think my accountants are going crazy right now. It’s all right. Hey look, I’m president. I don’t care. I don’t care anymore.” The crowd cheered. “Some of my wealthy friends care. Me, I don’t care. This is a higher calling. Do we agree?” "
1478,"WASHINGTON — When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis declared on Tuesday that North Korea now had the missile capability to “threaten everywhere in the world, basically,” he hinted at a long-running debate inside the United States government: Can the same strategy that worked against the Soviet Union — mutually assured destruction — also work against a far smaller adversary? The answer is yes, of course it can, if the problem is defined as keeping Pyongyang from unleashing a surprise attack on the continental United States. Or no, it probably can’t, if the problem of containing North Korea is more complex than simply protecting Los Angeles and Washington. And with North Korea, as the past 70 years of bitter experience have repeatedly shown, almost everything is more complex. There is no evidence that Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s current leader, or his father or grandfather, ever contemplated getting into a direct nuclear exchange with the United States. Depending on whose estimates one believes, North Korea has 20 to 60 nuclear weapons; the United States has more than 1,500 currently deployed, and thousands more in storage. It would be, as one senior American military strategist put it a few weeks ago, a case of assisted suicide. But that hardly means nuclear weapons are useless for a 33-year-old leader, who has made clear he has ambitious goals for how he would make use of the power conveyed by a global nuclear reach. If the previous leaders of North Korea were interested mostly in a survival strategy — and saw a small nuclear arsenal as the country’s best guarantee — Mr. Kim appears to have far greater ambitions. South Korea may have all the technology and the money, but the North has a purity of purpose, in Mr. Kim’s mind, that will ultimately give it control of the entire Korean Peninsula. And with it, Mr. Kim believes, will come the respect of far larger powers that have been waiting, for decades, for the North to be swept away by forces of history. "
1479,"As more senators show signs of sacrificing their principles and embracing the Republican tax bill for minor and nebulous concessions, it bears looking more closely at the process that produced this terrible legislation and some of its lesser-known provisions. The Senate tax bill, a 515-page mammoth, was introduced just last week, and the chamber could vote on it as soon as Thursday. This is not how lawmakers are supposed to pass enormous pieces of legislation. It took several years to put together the last serious tax bill, passed in 1986. Congress and the Reagan administration worked across party lines, produced numerous drafts, held many hearings and struck countless compromises. This time it’s not about true reform but about speed and bowling over the opposition in hopes of claiming a partisan victory. The country ought to be dismayed by the way senators like Bob Corker, Susan Collins and Ron Johnson appear to be backing away from their principled objections based on half-measures promised by President Trump and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that will not address its big flaws. This rush to the Senate floor has been orchestrated by Mr. McConnell, following the same playbook he used in the failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The longer people have to study the details, the less likely the bill is to pass. People should know by now about the big stuff: the giant permanent corporate tax-rate cut, the small and temporary tax cuts for the middle class, the repeal of the A.C.A.’s individual mandate and the $1.4 trillion added to the federal deficit over 10 years. But other provisions are not as well understood and deserve to be called out. Here are three. PICKPOCKETING THE MIDDLE CLASS: Like the House tax bill, the Senate measure would change how the government adjusts tax brackets and other tax provisions for inflation, replacing the Consumer Price Index with the Chained Consumer Price Index, which tends to increase at a slower rate. While most taxpayers would not notice an immediate impact, the effects would compound over time as more low- and middle-income families are pushed into higher tax brackets, and as working families receive less help through benefits like the earned-income tax credit. Over the next decade, changing the inflation measure would mean that families would lose $134 billion by paying more in taxes and receiving fewer benefits than they would under current law, according to Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. The increase will be even bigger in future years: $31.5 billion in 2027 alone. "
1480,"Three N.F.L. players who have been kneeling during the national anthem have questioned a tentative plan negotiated this week by the N.F.L. to donate millions of dollars to groups that aid African-American communities, calling it an effort by the league to get them to stop their protests. Two of the players, Eric Reid of the San Francisco 49ers and Michael Thomas of the Miami Dolphins, said the proposal had been put together without their consent by the N.F.L. and the two leaders of the so-called Players Coalition: Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles and former wide receiver Anquan Boldin. In an interview Wednesday night, Reid accused the league of trying to donate money to get the players to end their protests during the national anthem, which have put the league in the cross hairs of the president and fans who have accused the league and players of being unpatriotic. “It’s apparent the N.F.L. is trying to buy an end to the protests,” Reid said. Reid and Thomas, who have been kneeling during the anthem to protest social injustice and police brutality, said on Twitter that they had left that coalition, a group of players that has worked to support social justice causes, because Jenkins and Boldin “can no longer speak on our behalf as we don’t believe the coalition’s beliefs are in our best interests as a whole.” Reid, who last year began kneeling during the anthem with his former teammate Colin Kaepernick, said on Tuesday, “At no point did I say the donations were contingent on me ending my protest.” Commissioner Roger Goodell, Reid added, “is trying to buy our silence.” "

If your co-worker in the next cubicle behaved as President Trump does, he would be relieved of his responsibilities and directed to see a mental health professional.

1482,"If there was a message in North Korea’s launch of a new missile capable of reaching anywhere in the United States, it was that America’s strategy toward that country is failing — and that war may be looming. The American public is far too complacent about the possibility of a war with North Korea, one that could be incomparably bloodier than any U.S. war in my lifetime. One assessment suggests that one million people could die on the first day. “If we have to go to war to stop this, we will,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told CNN after the latest missile test. “We’re headed toward a war if things don’t change.” President Trump himself has said he stands ready to “totally destroy” North Korea. His national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, says Trump “is willing to do anything necessary” to prevent North Korea from threatening the U.S. with nuclear weapons — which is precisely what Kim Jong-un did. One lesson from history: When a president and his advisers say they’re considering a war, take them seriously. The international security experts I’ve consulted offer estimates of the risk of war from 15 percent to more than 50 percent. That should be staggering. "
1483,"WASHINGTON — Members of Congress confronted Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, on Wednesday over an F.B.I. intelligence report that said that black extremists were targeting law enforcement because of police abuses in minority communities. Mr. Wray met with the Congressional Black Caucus for about 90 minutes on Capitol Hill to discuss its members’ concerns about the report, which grouped together blacks who have espoused violent ideologies, some of whom went on to attack the police, under the term the “Black Identity Extremist” movement. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Wray struggled to defend the report’s analysis and could not identify a single black identity extremist group. “He was asked to publicly clarify that there is no scintilla of evidence, as far as we can tell, to provide an example of the black identity extremist movement or any groups that fall in that category,” Mr. Jeffries said. “That clarification should be made publicly, it seems to many of us, and not privately behind closed doors.” Mr. Jeffries said that Mr. Wray would consider the request. In the report, the F.B.I.’s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit said that violence directed at law enforcement increased after a grand jury did not indict a white police officer who fatally shot in 2014 Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man, in Ferguson, Mo. Citing six attacks, the report said that those responsible committed assault over “perceived racism and injustice” and that some in the movement wanted to establish a sovereign, autonomous black homeland in the United States. Elected leaders, legal experts and civil rights activists said that labeling a so-called movement as black identity extremists was ambiguous and meant to chill free speech. They said the bureau’s analysis, earlier reported by Foreign Policy, harked back to the F.B.I. spying illegally on blacks during the civil rights movement and other groups suspected of being subversive. "
1484,"House Speaker Paul D. Ryan scratched plans for a fund-raiser on Wednesday that was to benefit the re-election campaign of Representative Lee M. Zeldin after Mr. Zeldin, a Republican from Long Island, voted against the sweeping tax overhaul that cleared the House this month. Several people familiar with the planning for the fund-raiser said the cancellation was designed to punish Mr. Zeldin, who not only voted against the bill but was outspoken about one aspect: the elimination of the federal deduction for state and local taxes, which particularly impacts high-tax states like New York. “The campaign can confirm, but has no further comment,” Mr. Zeldin’s campaign said in a statement in response to questions from The New York Times. The fund-raising lunch event still occurred on Wednesday, but the proceeds now went to Mr. Ryan’s political operation and the National Republican Congressional Committee, rather than Mr. Zeldin’s campaign. “Speaker Ryan attended an event today with longtime friends and supporters to raise money for the N.R.C.C. and congressional Republicans,” said Kevin Seifert, executive director of Team Ryan, the speaker’s political shop. Mr. Zeldin was one of five New York Republicans to vote against the tax bill, and among the most vocal. “I just have too many constituents who are going to see their taxes go up,” Mr. Zeldin said the day of the vote. “You’re taking more money from a place like New York in order to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere.” Next month, Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist for President Trump and a longtime critic of Mr. Ryan, is scheduled to headline a fund-raiser for Mr. Zeldin. Arthur Schwartz, a co-host of the December fund-raiser, and a friend of Mr. Bannon’s, said Mr. Bannon had agreed to attend after Mr. Ryan canceled on Mr. Zeldin. “It wasn’t a coincidence,” Mr. Schwartz said. “After the speaker pulled out, Steve stepped in to help protect our majority in the House.” "
1485,"Early Wednesday morning, President Trump set off international outrage when he shared a series of videos depicting Muslims in a negative light. The videos, taken in three countries at three different times, all have one thing in common: They all purport to show violence carried out by Muslims and offer no clear explanation of what is happening in front of the camera. But a closer look at the clips, first tweeted out by Jayda Fransen of the fringe nationalist group Britain First and then retweeted by Mr. Trump, reveals more, including that one video misrepresents the facts of what the viewer is seeing, while the other two lack context about what is happening. Here is a breakdown of what we know about the videos. The first video was of a teenager attacking another boy, and was presented in the tweet as footage of a “Muslim migrant” attacking a Dutch boy. But according to local officials, both boys are Dutch, and neither is a migrant. The clip was taken in May in Monnickendam, a small town in the North Holland province of the Netherlands. It shows a teenager punching and kicking a boy holding a crutch. The public prosecutor’s office in the province said the aggressor was a 16-year-old who was “born and raised in the Netherlands.” He was arrested after the video came to light, officials said. "
1486,"Even his co-hosts did not know until 4 a.m. on Wednesday, just hours before the official announcement, that Matt Lauer had been fired after a serious allegation of sexual misconduct. That was when the NBC News president, Noah Oppenheim, called two of his “Today” show anchors, Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb. They would be broadcasting live to millions of viewers in three hours — and Mr. Lauer would not be joining them. Senior executives at NBC News made the decision to fire Mr. Lauer, the face of “Today” for two decades, late Tuesday night. At 6:49 a.m., 11 minutes before airtime, Andrew Lack, the news division’s chairman, sent a memo to the staff. In the note, he referred to “a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer.” Mr. Lack added that there was “reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.” During a morning call with NBC News staff members, Mr. Lack said a reason for Mr. Lauer’s firing had to do with Mr. Lauer’s behavior toward a subordinate. For NBC News, Mr. Lauer’s ignominious exit represents another setback in an already difficult period. And it has plunged morning television, a genre that depends on maintaining a mood of homey continuity, deeper into upheaval. "

The reckoning over sexual harassment in the workplace has claimed more leading media personalities: Matt Lauer, above, and Garrison Keillor. NBC fired Mr. Lauer, a fixture in American living rooms for 20 years, after a complaint that he had inappropriate sexual contact with a subordinate. His shaken “Today” co-host, Savannah Guthrie, delivered the news at the start of Wednesday’s show, and two more women had come forward by the end of the day. Mr. Keillor, the creator and former host of the long-running variety show “A Prairie Home Companion,” was fired by Minnesota Public Radio for “inappropriate behavior” with a colleague. _____ "
1488,"While a House Republican proposal to tax the tuition waivers of graduate students may not be among the highest-profile Trump-era assaults on people of color, it represents a serious threat to racial equality. If included in the final tax plan, it would disproportionately harm nonwhite graduate students and be disastrous for the already dismal diversity of academia, putting an additional roadblock between people of color and the ivory tower and depriving all of us of their desperately needed intellectual contributions. If graduate students were to be taxed on free tuition valued at tens of thousands of dollars, the bulk of their small stipends would have to go to pay tuition tax, rendering doctoral education inaccessible for all but the independently wealthy. Though the Senate tax plan thankfully does not appear to include a proposal of this kind, the House plan to tax graduate students like me — not just on the modest stipends we receive in exchange for being the backbone of university teaching workforces, but also on the free tuition we receive — would be ruinous. It is obscene that Republican members of Congress are even considering shifting a tax burden off the likes of Donald Trump and his heirs and onto overworked, underpaid and sometimes even homeless graduate students. The effects of this tax would be overly felt by students of color, who already face too many barriers to entering the American academy. The result: Academia would become whiter and less inclusive than it already is. And what it already is, frankly, is shameful. “On average, 75 out of every 100 full-time faculty members at four-year colleges are white,” The Chronicle of Higher Education found last year after evaluating 400,000 professors at 1,500 colleges, adding that just “five are black, and even fewer are Hispanic.” (This disparity grows only worse when you look at tenured faculty members: 79 percent are white, and only 4 percent are black.) Such a racially monolithic faculty is woefully underprepared to teach a future student population, given that most United States newborn babies are now nonwhite, and there are already some freshman classes, such as at Harvard, that are majority nonwhite. A tuition tax would also worsen the many problems that have long kept university faculties from being diverse. It’s no surprise, given that the median wealth of white families is 12 times the wealth of black (and that the average wealth gap between white and black families appears to be growing), that white scholars have long had a significant advantage in overcoming the profoundly expensive costs of obtaining doctorates and entering academia. The effects of this racial inequality are felt generationally. The New York Times has reported that professors and lecturers have parents who are professors and lecturers at a rate of five times the rest of the population. "
1489,"WASHINGTON — Alex M. Azar II, President Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, said Wednesday that he would try to reduce the burden of high drug costs, but he largely absolved drug companies from blame, placing the responsibility on a system that encourages price increases on medicines. Mr. Azar sailed through the first of two hearings on his nomination without making major missteps. But he did not appear to dispel the doubts of Democrats who distrust him because of his experience as a top executive at a major drug maker, Eli Lilly and Company, for 10 years. Democrats said that Mr. Azar had enriched himself in going from government to private industry and was potentially tainted by his work in the sector. One Republican, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, joined that chorus. “You’ve got some convincing to make me believe that you’re going to represent the American people and not Big Pharma,” he told Mr. Azar. Mr. Azar’s first confirmation hearing came two months after Tom Price resigned as health secretary in the face of multiple federal inquiries into his use of private and government planes for travel. Mr. Azar has ample policy experience, including a stint as deputy health secretary under President George W. Bush. But he would assume control of the Department of Health and Human Services at a sensitive time. HealthCare.gov and the Affordable Care Act are in the middle of the first open-enrollment period of the Trump era, and Mr. Azar’s background in the pharmaceutical industry is raising questions about the president’s campaign promise to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, by allowing the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and possibly permitting the importation of medicine from Canada. "
1490,"In an election year marked by lackluster campaigning and low turnout, one group of New York City voters came to the polls in droves: those seeking to lodge the futile and time-honored protest of writing in a candidate for mayor. The number of such votes soared in 2017 to 5,343, according to certified results from the city’s Board of Elections released on Wednesday, a figure that surpassed previous recent mayoral elections by a wide margin. Four years ago, 1,792 ballots were cast for write-in candidates; in 2009 and 2005, the number was under 300. That precipitous increase came despite only a modest rise of about 6 percent in the number of votes cast earlier this month compared with four years ago, and a lower number of ballots than the two elections before that. The board certified 1,148,664 votes in the 2017 contest, which Mayor Bill de Blasio won with 66 percent of those cast. The winner of the write-in contest of discontent was his predecessor, the former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who received nearly 1,000 ballots bearing some variation of his name. Others included Preet Bharara, the former federal prosecutor (38 votes); Aaron Judge, the Yankees rookie slugger (10); and Jesus Christ (3). Neither John Lennon nor any other Beatle, living or otherwise, garnered a vote. The 2016 presidential election was revisited, with Hillary Clinton (240) topping Bernie Sanders (29) and President Trump (22). "
1491,"LONDON — She organized “Christian patrols,” marched with crosses through heavily Muslim neighborhoods and accosted veiled women to rail against Islam. She was barred from entering any mosque in England. She has been arrested several times, most recently this month, on charges of making threats and abusive remarks. Still, Jayda Fransen, the 31-year-old deputy leader of Britain First, a fringe group that insists that white Christian civilization is under threat from Muslims, had received relatively little attention. That changed on Wednesday, when Britain First got unexpected publicity from President Trump, who recirculated three sometimes misleading videos Ms. Fransen had posted on Twitter that purported to show Muslims engaged in violence. Hours later, Ms. Fransen took to Twitter to thank him. “You’ve shed light on my plight here in Britain, in that I am facing prison for giving a speech in which I criticized Islam,” she wrote. “This is evidence that Britain has become Sharia-compliant,” she added, referring to Islamic law. Mr. Trump’s tweets drew a rare rebuke from a staunch ally, as Britain’s prime minister and British lawmakers from across the spectrum said that he had given a platform to a hate group, one so extreme that it has been shunned even by other far-right organizations, and has attracted the notice of law enforcement. Matthew J. Goodwin, a scholar at Chatham House who studies far-right politics in Britain, said that Britain First was “not really a populist right movement but basically a neo-Nazi one.” "
1492,"The tax plan has been marketed by President Trump and Republican leaders as a straightforward if enormous rebate for the masses, a $1.5 trillion package of cuts to spur hiring and economic growth. But as the bill has been rushed through Congress with scant debate, its far broader ramifications have come into focus, revealing a catchall legislative creation that could reshape major areas of American life, from education to health care. Some of this re-engineering is straight out of the traditional Republican playbook. Corporate taxes, along with those on wealthy Americans, would be slashed on the presumption that when people in penthouses get relief, the benefits flow down to basement tenements. Some measures are barely connected to the realm of taxation, such as the lifting of a 1954 ban on political activism by churches and the conferring of a new legal right for fetuses in the House bill — both on the wish list of the evangelical right. With a potentially far-reaching dimension, elements in both the House and Senate bills could constrain the ability of states and local governments to levy their own taxes, pressuring them to limit spending on health care, education, public transportation and social services. In their longstanding battle to shrink government, Republicans have found in the tax bill a vehicle to broaden the fight beyond Washington. The result is a behemoth piece of legislation that could widen American economic inequality while diminishing the power of local communities to marshal relief for vulnerable people — especially in high-tax states like California and New York, which, not coincidentally, tend to vote Democratic. All of this is taking shape at such extraordinary velocity, absent the usual analyses and hearings, that even the most savvy Washington lobbyist cannot be fully certain of the implications. "

ne of the first things I noticed about Australia was the intensity of its competitive spirit. From sports to politics to multiplication tables, Australians jump into contests with gusto and smiles. So how about a “commitment to journalism” contest, versus Canada? Let me explain. When The New York Times accelerated its global expansion about a year ago, our bosses decided to focus on English-speaking countries where we already had growing audiences — chief among them, Canada and Australia. They are, of course, very different places. Surfing and ice hockey are not compatible pastimes. But both countries do share a Commonwealth history, and something new from The Times in the form of expanded coverage — and weekly newsletters. Yes, folks, the Australia Letter has a counterpart: the Canada Letter, written by my colleague Ian Austen. It’s good, in a Northern Hemisphere kind of way; more straight vodka, less gin and tonic. But anyway, here’s the challenge: Can we add more new subscribers to this newsletter than Ian can add to his Canada Letter? "
1494,"WASHINGTON — Gun rights legislation that would allow concealed-carry permit holders from one state to legally carry their guns to any other state passed a key House panel along party lines on Wednesday and appeared to be headed for a vote on the floor of the House. The measure is the first gun-related legislation to move in Congress since two of the most deadly mass shootings in United States history, in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas, and would hand a long-sought victory to gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association. Representative Richard Hudson, Republican of North Carolina and the bill’s original sponsor, called the measure “a simple, common sense solution” and “one of the most important pro-Second Amendment measures in Congress.” Democrats on the committee, along with gun control advocates and big city law enforcement officials, put up fierce opposition, warning that the bill would have disastrous effects on public safety in states and cities with more restrictive concealed carry laws. The bill, they said, tramples the rights of states to determine their own laws, but a series of amendments offered by Democrats to halt it failed. “Essentially, we are telling states who are responsible in the requirements that they place on their concealed-carry permits that that doesn’t matter anymore,” said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California. The measure, which has been co-sponsored by 210 Republicans and three Democrats, was expected to win passage in the Republican-controlled House as soon as next week. But its fate in the Senate is far less certain. Republicans control only a narrow majority in that chamber, where any legislation would need to pick up Democratic votes. "

The selections were announced Wednesday and include films from 29 countries; 100 of the 110 features will be world premieres. “We don’t ever really look for anything going into it,” John Cooper, the festival’s director, said. “We wait to be shown for sure.” Climate change is again an important theme, as it was at the last edition of Sundance. Grouped under the New Climate label will be films like “Anote’s Ark,” a documentary by Matthieu Rytz about a coral island in the Pacific Ocean that may wholly disappear within decades. There is also an emphasis on work by and about women. “RBG” looks at Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice and pop culture icon; “Jane Fonda in Five Acts” explores the actress’s life of activism and filmmaking; and “Bad Reputation” features the rocker Joan Jett. “These aren’t just biopics,” Mr. Cooper said. “These are studies of struggles and artistic freedom they took for themselves. I think that’s kind of a theme that we saw. How these people came into our lives really and why.” "

Time after time the media bites at his smoke and mirrors and exhausts every possible meaning out of his ridiculous tweets instead of devoting precious time explaining to the public the serious consequences of this tax bill.

1497,"Turning Point: Prototypes for a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States are unveiled. September brought great sadness, frustration and anger when the president of the United States, Donald Trump, called on Congress to phase out DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that assured the future of around 800,000 children from all over the world who are living in the United States, protecting them from deportation. Making up nearly 80 percent of that figure, Mexicans will be disproportionately affected by an end to the program. Latinos, particularly Mexicans, have been the main targets of President Trump’s constant racial attacks. According to Mr. Trump, we are guilty of all sorts of criminal acts. We have been called rapists, drug traffickers and thieves who steal American jobs. He has demanded that we pay for a wall to be built between our two nations that would prevent us from entering the United States. Many of these DACA recipients arrived as babies or toddlers and know no other home, yet they still acknowledge their birthplace and cherish their mother nation, adopting proud hybrid identities. Every country has its own Dreamers, as these young immigrants are known. As they grow up, study, build businesses and exchange ideas, they help fortify a globalized world where cultures mix. "
1498,"President Trump likes to argue that the tax-reform legislation hurtling through Congress this week will protect low- and middle-income households, “not the wealthy and well connected.” He puts himself forward as Exhibit A. “This is going to cost me a fortune,” he said on Wednesday in Missouri. “This is not good for me.” So surely at least a few of the most egregious loopholes that benefit Mr. Trump and real estate developers like him will be closed. Not in the slightest. In fact, the proposals seem almost tailor-made to enrich the president and people like him. “Commercial real estate came out essentially unscathed,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative advocacy group. Real estate developers “didn’t lose anything they care about,” and they got even more breaks, like a shorter depreciation schedule in the Senate tax bill, Mr. Holtz-Eakin pointed out. Mr. Trump still has not released his tax returns, so it’s impossible to know to what extent he would personally benefit from the legislation. But there’s little doubt that he would. "
1499,"MALTA’S CENTER UNTIL the 16th century, the golden-walled city of Mdina, sits on a hill with a view over its thick ramparts and across scrubby plains to Valletta, the current capital, and the glittering sea. My family and I had arrived there — having flown in from London the night before — by public bus from the busy terminal outside Valletta’s gates, along with a few taciturn locals bearing bouquets of flowers, presumably heading to Sunday lunch with relatives in the adjacent modern town of Rabat, and a gaggle of chatty Italians, keen, like ourselves, to visit the so-called “silent city.” And indeed, on this July afternoon, as the black-clad priest and his caretaker padlocked the vast doors of St. Paul’s Cathedral, passed us with their heads bowed and scurried away into the tiny city’s sun-washed maze, the streets were silent except for us, the tourists. The occasional decorated horse clopped by, pulling British or Italians upon a painted cart. Our own footsteps echoed in the silent canyons between cloistered monasteries, convents and private houses, until we rounded a corner into a square near the Carmelite Priory and were suddenly surrounded by young visitors buying trinkets and postcards, taking photographs, swigging, in the heat, from sweating plastic water bottles. A block farther on, all was quiet again. This small, perfect town felt as if I’d dreamed it, a hermetic Mediterranean fantasy, a curious and singular combination of Arab influence and profound Catholicism, the stretching vista of sandy earth and olive trees descending to the impeccable azure sea, punctuated by an occasional British red postbox. All my life I’d wanted to visit Malta. My interest stemmed in part from family lore: My French grandfather’s grandfather was a Maltese immigrant to French Algeria, born in 1820 in Rabat, just outside Mdina’s walls; our name, Messud, is a distortion of Mifsud, to this day common in Malta. (I recently, and surprisingly, encountered the name in relation to the Mueller investigation: It was Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese national, who had allegedly offered to put the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser in contact with the Kremlin.) Then, too, I’d been intrigued by the few details passed on to me along with my ancestor’s birth certificate: details of the island’s particular, rich history from prehistoric times to the present. My interest was inevitably writerly: My ancestors crisscrossed the Mediterranean from France, Italy and Spain to Algeria and back to France, thence to Beirut, from Salonica to Istanbul to Morocco. Malta sits like a jewel in the middle of that storied sea, 100 miles south of Sicily and 240 miles northeast of Tunisia. We started with Mdina because in Malta, on Sundays, most of the shops are still closed, and we’d been warned by our hotel that Valletta would be dozy. Religion and history are Mdina’s raison d’être, however, and the museums were open. In addition to visiting churches, we stopped at the Palazzo Falson, the former home of a prosperous local artist and collector named Olof Frederick Gollcher (whose Swedish ancestry made him no less passionately Maltese). Here, we could glimpse what lay behind Mdina’s millennium-old walled streets: the elegantly proportioned rooms of a typical townhouse, of course; but also the haven of its essential leafy courtyard, shaded from the midday sun and further calmed by its gently trickling fountain. The museum cafe was closed for renovations, and we ended up instead buying burgers from a stand outside the city walls, beyond the stately but unpeopled Howard Gardens (fashioned from the city’s former moat) in a municipal park of a kind familiar to me from my childhood in Sydney, Australia: It’s a British convention, the manicured open space with a green kiosk selling snacks and a separate structure housing well-kept public loos. Along its rim stood a row of Victorian-era terraced houses, looking for all the world as though they were in Margate or Brighton, each villa bearing a nameplate like “Winchester” or “Windward-ho.” If I hadn’t already known that Malta belonged to Britain for over 150 years, I would have deduced it then — we could only have been in a former British colony. BUT MALTA IS by no means trapped in its past. Named one of the two European Capitals of Culture for 2018, Valletta has been exhilaratingly revitalized by the architect Renzo Piano’s 2015 reconstruction and re-envisioning of its city gate, parliament building and opera house (badly bombed in World War II). The tourists on the city’s streets and at the island’s beautiful beaches — around 2 million visitors a year — are notably young: The nation is progressive on LGBTQ rights, has a lively party reputation and is justly famous for its scuba diving. In the past few years, it has become a trendy, readily accessible, less overrun alternative to Ibiza or Crete, and one where almost everyone speaks English. But the island has been in the news for darker reasons, too, most recently on Oct. 16, when the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was assassinated near her home by a car bomb. She had been investigating government corruption in her home country, and in recent years had focused her attention on the infamous Panama Papers, drawing links to those surrounding Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat. "
1500,"WASHINGTON — The National Academy of Sciences called Thursday for sweeping changes in the pricing, sale and promotion of prescription drugs to make lifesaving treatments more affordable without discouraging the development of new medicines. The federal government should negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, the academy said, an idea pushed by Democrats for years, embraced by President Trump during the 2016 campaign, but opposed by congressional Republicans. The government, it said, should also deny tax deductions for drug advertising aimed at consumers and set annual limits on out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. “Consumer access to effective and affordable medicines is an imperative for public health, social equity and economic development,” a panel of 17 experts said in a report issued by the academy. “However, this imperative is not being adequately served by the biopharmaceutical sector today.” “The federal government,” it said, “should consolidate and apply its purchasing power to directly negotiate prices with the producers and suppliers of medicines.” Specifically, it said, Congress should allow Medicare to negotiate prices with drugmakers and should amend the Medicaid law to make it easier for states to deny coverage of certain drugs when less costly medicines provide “similar clinical benefit.” The need for change is urgent, the panel said, because more than half of all people in the United States routinely use prescription drugs, and 15 percent regularly take five or more drugs. The report does not endorse price controls, saying they could erode incentives for the development of valuable new drugs. But the panel recommended many other steps to promote competition and make drugs more affordable. The government, it said, should take steps to prevent “common industry practices that delay the entry of lower-cost generic drugs into the market.” "
1501,"LONDON — Donald Trump’s state visit to Britain should be canceled without delay. The withdrawal of the invitation extended to the president in January by Prime Minister Theresa May would indeed be a diplomatic embarrassment and — given Mr. Trump’s vindictive temperament — would be unlikely to go unpunished. Such a decision is never easy to take. But it must be taken. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump retweeted a series of anti-Muslim videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, an ultranationalist group so far to the right that it is repudiated by nearly every sector of British politics and society. It is hard to exaggerate how disgusted Britons are by the president’s recent behavior on Twitter. The prime minister responded on Thursday, saying, “I’m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do.” Before her, Sajid Javid, the communities secretary and a Muslim, wrote on Twitter: “So POTUS has endorsed the views of a vile, hate-filled racist organization that hates me and people like me. He is wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing.” Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, called the retweets “abhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society.” It is worth bearing in mind that Ms. Fransen — who celebrated the attention delivered by the American president — is facing charges of religiously aggravated harassment. At least one of the original videos, captioned “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!,” is completely inauthentic. The others are of dubious provenance at best. What is so shocking is that Mr. Trump, who has more than 43 million Twitter followers, should so casually proliferate content tweeted by an organization that actively subverts the social cohesion of a country that is, at least notionally, America’s closest ally. Those in Britain who follow the president’s unfiltered outpourings on social media have learned to expect an aggressive stream of consciousness. But this insult, delivered in so cavalier a fashion, is of a different order. "
1502," America’s cars run partly on fuels derived from corn and soy. That’s because of a decade-old federal mandate beloved by Midwestern farmers but opposed by an unusual coalition of oil refiners and environmentalists. On Thursday, the Trump administration sided with the farmers and announced that it would stick closely to the current rules and quotas for fuel: Refineries must blend about 20 billion gallons of biofuel — much of it ethanol made from corn — into the nation’s gasoline supply, a level largely unchanged from last year. The decision is a rare setback for the oil industry under a presidency that has filled its ranks with fossil fuel advocates and embarked on a rollback of rules aimed at reducing the industry’s regulatory obligations. A number of environmental and health groups oppose the mandate, citing emerging research showing that ethanol is no cleaner than gasoline. “Biofuels are not helping us environmentally,” said Jonathan Lewis, senior counsel at the Clean Air Task Force. “So the question is: What’s the value of the standard other than as a price support for agriculture?” "
1503,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Republican tax bill, which had appeared to be cruising to victory, suffered a setback late on Thursday as lawmakers were forced to contemplate significant changes, including future tax increases, to help pay for the legislation. The bill had gained momentum in the morning when it picked up a key swing vote. But it came to a grinding, if temporary, halt, as senators scrambled in the early evening to find ways to raise several hundred billion dollars after some members objected to moving forward without a plan to safeguard against ballooning the deficit. Lawmakers are now considering alternatives, including reinstating the alternative minimum tax on some corporations and wealthy individuals, and raising the corporate rate above 20 percent after some number of years. A final vote on the bill is expected on Friday after a series of amendments are considered. The push to raise money came after an analysis by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found that the tax cuts would not pay for themselves by generating enough revenue through economic growth to offset the tax cuts, as Republicans have claimed, but would instead add $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next 10 years. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, had already been on the fence over deficit concerns, and he insisted on Thursday evening that the Senate leadership find a way to mitigate the cost of the bill, lawmakers said. “Senator Corker has been pretty clear he doesn’t want any deficit spending,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican.

To those I would add that candidates learn to speak to these voters in simple, ordinary, everyday language that people can connect to. Donald Trump did this, and it was a major reason he got so much support.

1505,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, could be on the way out. The Trump administration has marginalized and bypassed the State Department, even as Mr. Tillerson has pushed out droves of career diplomats. Now, senior White House officials tell our reporters that the president plans to replace Mr. Tillerson with his C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, possibly before the end of the year. Other countries appear to be maneuvering rapidly in the meantime. Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi is visiting China, which is drawing her country closer as much of the rest of the world turns away over the Rohingya crisis. And Russia is further extending its profile in the Middle East with a move toward using Egyptian air bases and airspace. _____ • Photographs from North Korea are providing valuable clues about the powerful new missile it launched Wednesday, the Hwasong-15. Analysts say it appears to have two engines for its first booster stage, giving it greater range. Washington is revisiting a long-simmering debate: Could the Cold War strategy that worked against the Soviet Union — mutually assured destruction — also work against North Korea? "
1506,"The drive by Senate Republicans to repeal the requirement that most Americans have health insurance is not only likely to discourage people from signing up for coverage during the current enrollment period, but also could result in higher premiums. If repeal is approved, people could opt out of buying policies because they would no longer face a tax penalty and millions could go uninsured. With the Affordable Care Act already weakened by the Trump administration, big drops in enrollment would deal yet another body blow to the law and wreak more havoc in the individual insurance market. Many consumers would likely to turn to the cheap, short-term policies that already skirt provisions of the law and may not cover pre-existing conditions or basic medical needs. “If you get rid of the mandate, you open the floodgates,” said Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. These plans — sometimes sold by brokers using tactics rife with fraud — were only supposed to last for three months. But President Trump recently signed an executive order that loosened regulations to allow such coverage to be extended up to a year. The proposed repeal of the individual mandate is part of the Senate Republicans’ tax package, and a vote on the legislation is expected this week. Without a mandate, the cost of coverage could increase by double digits on top of already high premiums as healthy people left the market and sick people needing costly care stayed in it. While repeal supporters argue that people would benefit by having the choice to buy less expensive plans, state regulators have been cracking down on rogue agents who have misled customers about what such inexpensive plans cover or more important don’t. "
1507,"Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey personally ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in an oil-for-gold scheme that violated United States sanctions on Iran, according to testimony on Thursday by a Turkish-Iranian gold trader in a federal trial in Manhattan. The gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who helped orchestrate the billion-dollar scheme, recently pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade the sanctions and has become a witness for American prosecutors. On Thursday, Mr. Zarrab testified that in 2012, a senior Turkish official told him that Mr. Erdogan — now Turkey’s president, at the time its prime minister — and a second official, the treasury minister, had given orders for the banks “to start doing this trade.” Mr. Zarrab’s testimony marked the first time Mr. Erdogan has been implicated in the alleged sanctions busting, which first surfaced when the Turkish police uncovered the activity in 2013 — only to have their investigation quashed by Mr. Erdogan’s government. Mr. Erdogan has consistently condemned the American investigation into the scheme, raising the matter repeatedly with American officials, including President Trump in September. On Thursday, before Mr. Zarrab, 34, told his story to jurors in Federal District Court in New York, Mr. Erdogan said, “We did not breach the sanctions.” “Whatever the verdict is, we did the right thing,” he said at a closed meeting with his deputies, Turkish state media reported. “We have never made commitments to the U.S. on our energy ties with Iran.” "
1508,"To the Editor: Re “Longtime Face of NBC’s ‘Today’ Is Fired as Complaints Multiply” (front page, Nov. 30): I would like to respond to the heartfelt question of Matt Lauer’s co-host, Savannah Guthrie: “How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly?” The fact is, we are all fallible and capable of some pretty bad behavior. If the bad behavior is big enough or public enough, it can easily come to define the totality of the wrongdoer. But we’re all more than our worst moments. The tendency to continue caring for someone in spite of wrongdoing is part of the experience of being fully human. That said, the part of our humanity that seeks justice requires that the wrongdoer be held fully accountable. As we move through this wrenching period, sorting through the contradictory feelings that arise is both very difficult and very necessary. ANITA MORAN, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: NBC must do some real soul-searching about how it has dealt with reports of sexual harassment by some of its male stars, not only Matt Lauer, host of “Today,” but before that, Donald Trump as host of “The Apprentice,” if some reports are to be believed. It’s not a stretch to suggest that if Mr. Trump were still in that job following Mr. Lauer’s ouster, he, too, would have been fired. None of this is to suggest that NBC is the only media giant to put financial considerations before moral ones — see Charlie Rose at CBS and PBS, and Kevin Spacey at Netflix. But it is a sobering reminder that even the so-called keepers of the flame are far from perfect and need some serious minding themselves, perhaps now more than ever. "
1509,"WASHINGTON — An American citizen who has been held in military custody in Iraq for 11 weeks refused to talk to F.B.I. interrogators without a lawyer after he was warned of his Miranda rights to remain silent and have a lawyer present, the Justice Department told a federal judge on Thursday. “The individual stated he understood his rights, and said he was willing to talk to the agents but also stated that since he was in a new phase, he felt he should have an attorney present,” the department said in a court filing Thursday afternoon. “The agents explained that due to his current situation, it was unknown when he would be able to have an attorney, and the individual stated that it was O.K. and that he is a patient man.” The filing came in response to an order by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia, after a contentious hearing earlier on Thursday during which she warned that the Trump administration seemed to be claiming “unchecked power that is, quite frankly, frightening.” The case centers on an American who was captured by a Syrian militia in mid-September, apparently fighting for the Islamic State, and turned over to American military forces. Although the International Committee for the Red Cross has visited the detainee twice, the government has kept secret even the most basic facts about him, including his name. But a senior administration official has told The New York Times that the detainee was born in the United States to foreign parents and raised in an unidentified Middle Eastern country. The official also said that after being interrogated for intelligence purposes, the detainee was read the Miranda warning and had not talked since then. But Judge Chutkan said on Thursday that she did not want to rely on news reports and wanted the government to disclose such information. "
1510,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Gov. Jerry Brown of California understands why climate change is so politically polarizing. But he still thinks Democrats know best. “Republicans have to change or they have to get out of the way,” Governor Brown, a Democrat, told entrepreneurs, activists and policymakers here in San Francisco on Wednesday night as part of ClimateTECH, a conference from The New York Times. Governor Brown’s comment came in response to a question from the Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, who asked how the coalition of blue states that pledged their commitment to the Paris agreement after President Trump’s rejection of the pact might attract Republicans. (You can see the full video here.) Governor Brown, who has been in politics since the 1960s, offered his analysis of how climate change had become mired in partisanship. “Dealing with climate change takes very assertive governmental action,” he said. “You can’t just say, ‘I hope the market will work it out.’ You do need policy, you need leadership, you need rules.” In other words, regulation: something anathema to Republican orthodoxy. Yet rather than talking about ways to reach across the aisle on climate change or offering clear ideas on how to work with fossil fuel-heavy red states on reducing emissions, Governor Brown said Republicans had sole responsibility for shifting positions. “It might be easier to remove them from office than it will be to convert them,” he said.

1512,"On Thursday morning, The New York Times revealed that Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has been lying for months about Republican tax plans. Mnuchin has repeatedly claimed the existence of a Treasury report that — unlike every independent, nonpartisan assessment — found that these plans would pay for themselves, increasing growth and hence revenues so much that the deficit wouldn’t rise. But there is no such report, and never has been; Treasury staffers weren’t even asked to study the issue. Also on Thursday, John McCain — who has delivered sanctimonious lectures on the importance of “regular order” in the Senate — declared his support for the G.O.P. tax bill. Remember, Senate leaders rushed this bill to the floor without holding any hearings or soliciting expert testimony (and tax policy is an area where you really, really need to hear from experts, lawyers and accountants even more than economists). In fact, at the time McCain declared his support, some key provisions were still secret, so they could be presented for a vote with no time for debate. McCain declared that he had made his decision after “careful consideration.” Careful consideration of what? He didn’t even wait for an analysis of the bill’s economic impact by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s own scorekeeper — the only official assessment, since the Trump administration was, as I said, lying when it claimed to have its own analysis. Later that day the joint committee delivered its predictable verdict: Like all other reasonable studies, its review found that the Senate bill would do little for U.S. economic growth, while directly hurting tens of millions of middle-class Americans, blowing up the deficit, lavishing benefits on the wealthy and opening up new frontiers for tax avoidance. But thanks to the moral collapse of McCain and other supposedly principled Republicans, at the time this column was filed the bill nonetheless seemed on track to clear the Senate. But aren’t politicians always cynical? Not to this degree. For one thing, there’s no precedent for this frantic rush to pass major legislation before anyone can figure out what’s in it or what it does. By way of comparison, the Affordable Care Act went through months of hearings before it was brought to the Senate floor; the full Senate then debated the bill for 25 straight days. And there’s a world of difference between normal political spin — yes, all politicians try to emphasize the good aspects of their policies — and the outright lies that have marked every aspect of the selling of this thing.

The Trump administration has marginalized and bypassed the State Department, even as Mr. Tillerson, above, has pushed out droves of career diplomats. "
1514,"[Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] Whenever he leaves Foggy Bottom, Rex Tillerson will be remembered as one of the most consequential secretaries of state in recent history — but for all the wrong reasons. Mr. Tillerson, who has clashed with President Trump and may be fired soon, has presided over the hollowing out of the State Department. The exodus of senior and rising Foreign Service officers will debilitate American diplomacy for a generation. It’s hard to imagine doing more damage to an institution and less good for America’s standing in the world in such a short period of time. Meanwhile, Mr. Tillerson’s sound instincts on the substance of foreign policy were routinely undermined by Mr. Trump and his incontinent Twitter feed. Mr. Tillerson’s obsession with downsizing our diplomacy has colored his time at the State Department. Instead of defending the department against the White House’s proposed 30 percent budget cut, he embraced it. Fortunately, Congress stopped — for now — the gutting of our diplomatic, democracy and development programs. Mr. Tillerson imposed a hiring freeze, canceled programs to diversify the department’s personnel, left empty dozens of the most senior positions requiring Senate confirmation and encouraged officers to leave by dangling $25,000 buyouts. Equally damaging, Mr. Tillerson’s insular management style alienated or marginalized many of the department’s most experienced hands. He and the small team around him seemed to view foreign policy professionals as the enemy — a “deep state” opposed to Mr. Trump’s agenda. In this they were profoundly wrong. Over the past 25 years, I’ve worked closely with hundreds of Foreign Service officers and civil servants through Democratic and Republican administrations. To a person, they take pride in checking their personal beliefs at the department’s door and working for the success of whatever administration they serve. I could not tell you the political affiliation of any of the officers with whom I served. But instead of looping them in, Mr. Tillerson’s seventh floor locked them out of policy deliberations. The result was to deny Mr. Tillerson the intellectual capital he needed to succeed when policy was debated around the White House Situation Room table. And the department found itself grievously short-handed of the assistant secretaries and ambassadors who actually implement policy around the world. "
1515,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Masked government agents stormed the homes of two former top officials of Venezuela’s state oil company and arrested them on Thursday, a move that the prosecutor heralded as a blow against corruption but that others saw as a political purge to strengthen the country’s president. The accused men, Nelson Martínez and Eulogio del Pino, are the highest-level officials detained in a string of arrests that have shaken the country’s troubled oil giant, Petróleos de Venezuela, and its United States refiner, Citgo. More than 50 people so far have been detained in a widening net of charges from corruption to sabotage. Mr. Martínez, a former oil minister who led the oil company until this week, was detained early Thursday and charged with seeking debt refinancing contracts without getting government approval, said Tarek William Saab, the Venezuelan attorney general. Mr. Del Pino, Mr. Martínez’s predecessor, was arrested on a list of charges that included falsifying production figures and sabotage that resulted in millions of dollars in lost revenues, Mr. Saab said. Mr. Saab described the two men as running “a cartel” that he said “bit by bit was delivering blows to the oil industry and causing national damage.” In a video posted on Mr. Del Pino’s Twitter account and apparently recorded before his arrest, he said he had been the victim of an unjustified attack. "
1516,"WASHINGTON — The first time Donald J. Trump met Senator Tom Cotton, in summer 2015, the two commiserated over their shared hatred of the nuclear deal that President Barack Obama had just struck with Iran. Mr. Trump, at the time a presidential candidate who knew little about national security, thanked Mr. Cotton, an Ivy League-educated Iraq war veteran and then a first-year senator, for his staunch opposition to the agreement. Mr. Cotton, who described the encounter in a recent interview, had written an unusual letter to Iran’s mullahs, signed by 46 Republican colleagues, warning that Congress might reverse the nuclear accord or a new president might rip it up; Mr. Trump was campaigning on doing just that. Now Mr. Cotton, 40, is Mr. Trump’s favorite to lead the C.I.A. as part of a quietly conceived plan to elevate the current director, Mike Pompeo, to replace Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state who has lost favor with the president and his closest advisers. Should the plan hold and he be confirmed for the post, Mr. Cotton, the youngest member of the Senate, would also be the youngest person ever to lead the nation’s premier intelligence agency. Serving as C.I.A. director would seal his reputation as a young man in a hurry in Washington, underlined by his lack of experience relevant to the job. It is unclear how leaving the Senate would affect Mr. Cotton’s outsize political ambition, widely believed to include an eventual run for president. But choosing Mr. Cotton as C.I.A. director would be the latest in a string of appointments by Mr. Trump that reflect his preference for loyalists who are unapologetic about couching their hawkish stances on national security issues in sharply partisan terms. Last year, Mr. Cotton defended Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to bring back waterboarding, telling CNN that “waterboarding is not torture,” and labeling it as a “tough call” for experienced intelligence officials who might decide it is warranted. In 2006, Mr. Cotton wrote an open letter accusing three New York Times journalists of treason for exposing a secret American program to track the financing of terrorist networks. "
1517,"To the Editor: I am the editor of “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.” We represent a much larger number of concerned mental health professionals who have come forward to warn against the president’s psychological instability and the dangers it poses. We now number in the thousands. We are currently witnessing more than his usual state of instability — in fact, a pattern of decompensation: increasing loss of touch with reality, marked signs of volatility and unpredictable behavior, and an attraction to violence as a means of coping. These characteristics place our country and the world at extreme risk of danger. Ordinarily, we carry out a routine process for treating people who are dangerous: containment, removal from access to weapons and an urgent evaluation. We have been unable to do so because of Mr. Trump’s status as president. But the power of the presidency and the type of arsenal he has access to should raise greater alarm, not less. We urge the public and the lawmakers of this country to push for an urgent evaluation of the president, for which we are in the process of developing a separate but independent expert panel, capable of meeting and carrying out all medical standards of care.

1518,"LONDON — One member of Parliament called him a “fascist.” Another described him as “stupid.” A third wondered aloud whether President Trump was “racist, incompetent or unthinking — or all three.” The stream of criticism that began after Mr. Trump shared anti-Muslim videos from a far-right British group on Wednesday morning turned into a gusher on Thursday, after he rebuked Prime Minister Theresa May in a nighttime tweet, telling her: “Don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.” Mr. Trump’s one-two punch managed to generate rare unanimity in a Britain that is deeply divided over the contentious process of leaving the European Union. For one day at least, political rivals redirected the ire they normally aim at one another to focus on Mr. Trump. Criticism came from ideological opposites like Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London and a Muslim with whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly feuded on Twitter, and Nigel Farage, the euroskeptic provocateur who traveled across the Atlantic to campaign for Mr. Trump last year. (“Put your hands up, say ‘I got this wrong,’ and, frankly, try to move on,” Mr. Farage advised Mr. Trump.) Meeting in Parliament, lawmakers were unanimous in saying Mr. Trump, by giving a platform to the fringe group Britain First, had gone too far. "
1519,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. A few weeks ago, I read a short new book by the legal scholar Cass Sunstein titled, simply, “Impeachment.” The book doesn’t mention President Trump once. Sunstein started writing it, he told me, partly because he was alarmed by what he considered reckless talk of impeachment during Trump’s first weeks on the job, before he had started doing much. Sunstein’s goal was to lay out a legal and historical framework for thinking about impeachment, independent of any specific president. I’ve been thinking about the topic a lot since finishing the book, and I want to recommend both Sunstein’s book and a Vox piece published this morning by Ezra Klein. To be clear, I think it would be a mistake for Democrats to put much energy into impeachment right now, because it’s not going to happen: Republicans control Congress and show no interest. But I also think it would be a mistake for Americans — regardless of party — to be in denial about the governing crisis our country is facing. Let’s admit it: Trump is behaving in ways that call for serious talk of impeachment. If you read Sunstein’s careful history of impeachment — of when the founders believed it was appropriate and necessary — I expect you will come to the same conclusion. Trump disdains the rule of law (as I detailed in this column), and he lies constantly. Multiple high-level Republicans, including some who work in the administration, consider him unfit for the presidency. "
1520,"WASHINGTON — The White House has developed a plan to force out Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, whose relationship with President Trump has been strained, and replace him with Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, perhaps within the next several weeks, senior administration officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pompeo would probably be succeeded at the C.I.A. by Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and key ally of the president on national security matters, according to the White House plan. Mr. Cotton has signaled that he would accept the job if offered, said the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations before decisions are announced. Mr. Trump has not signed off on the plan developed by John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, officials said, but the president is said to have soured on Mr. Tillerson and is ready to make a change at the State Department. Mr. Trump spoke harshly about Mr. Tillerson in front of White House aides as recently as Thursday but did not seem ready yet to replace him, according to one person close to the president. For all his public combativeness and his “you’re fired” reputation from reality television, Mr. Trump is often reluctant to dismiss advisers. The disclosure of Mr. Kelly’s transition plan may have been a way to nudge him into making a decision, according to that person. It may also have been meant as a not-too-subtle message to Mr. Tillerson that it is time to go. The ouster of Mr. Tillerson would end a turbulent reign at the State Department for the former Exxon Mobil chief executive, who has been largely marginalized over the last year. Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson have been at odds over a host of major issues, including the Iran nuclear deal, the confrontation with North Korea and a clash between Arab allies. The secretary was reported to have privately called Mr. Trump a “moron” and the president publicly criticized Mr. Tillerson for “wasting his time” with a diplomatic outreach to North Korea. Replacing him with Mr. Pompeo could presage a dramatic change. While many veteran diplomats have expressed disappointment in Mr. Tillerson for the way he has run the State Department, they see him as a pragmatic figure in the Situation Room. Mr. Pompeo, a former congressman from the Tea Party wing of the party, would be more hawkish on Iran, North Korea and other key issues. "
1521,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Many questions remained unanswered in the death of Slobodan Praljak, the Croatian war criminal, after he swallowed what appeared to be poison at his appeal sentencing at the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. First among them: How did he obtain and smuggle it into the courthouse? The Dutch authorities declared the courtroom a crime scene and are carrying out an inquiry. Mr. Praljak’s suicide is the third by a defendant facing the tribunal. Mr. Praljak was a key figure during the siege and shelling of the city of Mostar in the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict. The judges upheld his sentence and those against five other defendants. _____ • “It is wrong for the president to have done this.” That was the office of Theresa May, the British prime minister, amid the racially charged furor President Trump set off by retweeting video posts from an ultranationalist British party leader supposedly portraying Muslims committing acts of violence.

1522,"Please note: Student Opinion is a forum for teenagers. Please refrain from commenting if you are an adult. In an April 28, 2017, article, The New York Times cataloged every tweet by President Trump in his first 100 days in office. Look at the 10 themes Times reporters used to categorize the tweets and read some of the tweets in each category. What do you notice about the way Mr. Trump has used Twitter as president? What is your reaction to his use of this social media platform? This week, President Trump shared inflammatory anti-Muslim videos on Twitter. As Peter Baker and Eileen Sullivan write: Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — What is your reaction to Mr. Trump’s sharing these videos on Twitter? Do you think he is trying to draw attention to the need for national security, as the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, claims? Or, like the British politicians who condemned his actions, do you think he is perpetuating racist narratives, inciting fear and normalizing hatred? — One paragraph in this piece reads, “Such unbridled talk has thrilled some of his supporters who see him as a truthteller breaking out of the shackles of political correctness, but it has alarmed mainstream political leaders both in the United States and Britain, who see it as reckless and counterproductive.” With which side do you feel most aligned? Why? Do you know people who feel the opposite way? What arguments do they make? Since the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s use of Twitter has been the subject of political analysis and provoked debates about its legal, ethical and political implications: — In general, what do you think of Mr. Trump’s use of Twitter? Do you find it informative? Entertaining? Inflammatory? Reckless? How do you think a president should use social media? What effects do you think Mr. Trump’s tweets have? Why? "
1523,"SEOUL, South Korea — The intercontinental ballistic missile North Korea launched this week was a new type of missile bigger and more powerful than any the country had tested before, South Korean officials said on Thursday. Photos from the North’s official Korean Central News Agency are providing valuable clues about the capabilities of the missile, named the Hwasong-15. North Korea said it carried a “super-large heavy warhead which is capable of striking the whole mainland of the U.S.” North Korea’s Hwasong series represents the most successful and formidable part of its ballistic missile arsenal, and photographs of the test suggested improvements over the Hwasong-14, a missile first tested over the summer that showed the country’s capacity to strike the continental United States. “We believe this is a new type of missile,” said Roh Jae-cheon, a spokesman for the South Korean military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. “It looks clearly different from the Hwasong-14 in the external looks of its nose cone, the linkage between its first and second stages, and its overall size.” South Korean officials said the launch suggested that North Korea’s missile program was advancing faster than previously believed. Private analysts agreed that the Hwasong-15 looked bigger and more powerful than the Hwasong-14. "
1524,"The author of, most recently, “Vacationland,” doesn’t like to talk about writing with other writers. “We mostly talk about TV.” What books are on your nightstand? Most of my bedtime reading is done on a device, screen ambered and darkened, so as not to wake my wife during my now inevitable 2 to4 a.m. of unwanted wide awake time. But I keep a few actual books on the nightstand as comforting totems. Bedtime reading should be comforting, lulling. After the death of my mom I used to keep an insanely detailed illustrated book of Star Wars vehicles. There I would lose myself in the mania of small details—finding where the Jawas slept on their Sandcrawler; examining the luggage compartments of an X-Wing—until my dumb brain finally gave up to sleep. Currently I have the new Penguin Classics collection of Richard Matheson short stories, some zines of very funny essays by the comedian April Richardson that I got in the mail, and the newly reissued crime novel “Breakout,” featuring the great, emotionless thief, Parker, which is also what I’m reading on my phone. What’s the last great book you read? “We Were Eight Years in Power,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates. I don’t think anyone who more thoughtfully and fearlessly reminds us that America was never really great for everyone, and that the only way forward is forward. Whether challenging the reader to question our own self-serving myths, or chiding me on Twitter to get over myself and just read Marvel’s “Secret Wars,” Coates’s breadth of knowledge, taste, talent, anger, decency, curiosity, and humor makes me work harder to be better every day. On y va. What influences your decisions about which books to read? Word of mouth, reviews, a trusted friend? Fate typically. I pick things up a libraries and bookstores, used and new. I turn them over in my hands, and if they speak to me, I bring them home and let them sit on the counter for a while and mock me. And finally I say, you win, and I read them. The Big Chicken Barn in Ellsworth, Me., serendipitously provides an old Stephen King paperback every summer. That’s how I found “Cujo” a couple of years ago, which I probably would never have sought out on purpose, and more shame me. It is one of the most achingly sad and subtly constructed novels I’ve read. What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? In “The Green Ripper,” by John D. MacDonald, his rangy, soulful, nondetective detective Travis McGee offers a long inner monologue about how six hours of brisk walking a week is all the exercise a middle-aged male body requires and, frankly, can tolerate. I took it as both an indictment and a relief. Which classic novel did you recently read for the first time? I am poorly read in the classic classics. I’m not proud, but it’s just that my eye always turns first to the dollar bin of paperbacks, the ephemeral, forgotten and weird. But per the above, “The Green Ripper” is one of a classic crime series my mom always loved but I had never gotten to until now. I was amazed by it. McGee is a likeable, noble, sardonic houseboat-dwelling dilettante in all his books, but the horror he endures (and by necessity, causes) in this one was as powerful as any “literary” novel I’ve read. More people should read the classics of genre fiction before they plow into their old high school syllabus. "
1525,"One of the longest stock-market booms in history continued its gravity-defying ascent Thursday, with investors cheering the prospect of deep corporate tax cuts and the rollback of government regulations under President Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average eclipsed yet another milestone, closing Thursday above 24,000 for the first time. And the Standard & Poor’s 500 index logged its 13th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history. Stock markets have been going up, more or less without interruption, since March 2009, the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis. This eight-and-a-half-year bull market is now the second-longest in history, behind only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000. Investors are embracing Mr. Trump’s pro-corporate presidency, marked by the promise of lower taxes, the installation of former industry executives in key government agencies, and the repeal or relaxation of rules and regulations that have made it hard for some big businesses to expand without fear of interference from Washington. Indeed, the view is taking hold that Mr. Trump, in so aggressively promoting policies aimed to stoke the economy and financial markets, has unleashed animal spirits — largely absent under President Barack Obama — that are now reflected in ever rising consumer confidence indicators and a willingness to embrace risk in the stock market. “It comes down to psychology, and the psychology today is that everything is awesome,” said Charlie Bilello, a stock market historian at Pension Partners. “Jobs have grown for 85 straight months, you have growth in corporate earnings, and you have tax cuts.” "

President Trump tweeted a response to the Lauer scandal, but Mr. Colbert said he had no right to talk, since more than a dozen women have accused Mr. Trump of sexual harassment or assault. Trevor Noah pointed to one particularly bizarre detail that has emerged about Mr. Lauer’s office. Seth Meyers took a moment to address an issue that late-night hosts have not spent much time discussing: the Federal Communications Commission’s plan to scrap net neutrality. "
1527,"President Trump has single-handedly done more to undermine the basic tenets of American democracy than any foreign agent or foreign propaganda campaign could. “Trump is a political weapon of mass self-destruction for American democracy — for its norms, for its morality, for sheer human decency,” Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at Brookings, wrote by email: For the moment, let’s put aside the conclusion of “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections,” the F.B.I., C.I.A. and N.S.A. joint report that was released in January, which said that: This determination, disputed by Trump and others, pales in comparison to the ruinous record of Trump’s 10 months in office. First and foremost, Trump has gravely damaged the premises and procedures that undergird American democracy. Partisan polarization, which helped give rise to Trump in the first place, is getting worse as discord intensifies with every slur and insult Trump hurls. On Oct. 5, the Pew Research Center reported that partisan conflict on fundamental political values In the introduction to their forthcoming book, “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, political scientists at Harvard, write: Their attempt at reassurance is not comforting: In an email, Levitsky argued that “it is important that we understand that the U.S. has largely been doing these things to itself,” before adding, “obviously we should investigate Russian meddling to the fullest, but to blame Putin for the mess we are in today would be ridiculous. We Americans created this mess.” Along similar lines, Ryan Enos, who is also a political scientist at Harvard, suggested that the question of Russian involvement in the election is a secondary issue: In addition, Enos noted, Trump has not only taken a hammer to the code of behavior underpinning democracy at home, he has simultaneously diminished the international stature of the United States — and arguably accelerated the rise of this country’s major competitor, China. "
1528,"If you want to understand the ways in which Donald Trump’s presidency is systematically corrupting the American mind, I have a book recommendation for you. It’s about Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The book is Peter Pomerantsev’s “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible.” It was published in 2014, and it brilliantly tells the story of the (Soviet-born) British author’s sojourn as a producer for Russian TV. As the title suggests, at its heart it’s the tale of the substitution of reality with “reality,” of factual truth with interpretive possibility. That’s also the central task of Donald Trump’s presidency. We were reminded of this again this week, on news that Trump is backing away from his public admission last year that he said what he said on the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Then there was his appalling insinuation Wednesday that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough might have killed an office intern in 2001. And his hallucinatory tweet last week in which he claimed to turn down an approach from Time magazine to make him Person of the Year for the second time in a row. Before that it was his multiple attacks against his attorney general. Or his tweeting of a video pastiche in which he physically assaults CNN. Or his voter fraud claims. Or the ones about the size of his inaugural crowds. All this has given rise to the suggestion that Trump is mentally unwell. That’s the charitable interpretation. But the president also gives signs that he is perfectly well, can communicate relatively coherently when he wants to do so, and knows exactly what he is tweeting (and subtweeting), and to what effect. This is where Pomerantsev is so instructive. In one of his book’s early scenes, he relates a professional homily from a man he identifies as prominent Russian TV presenter. “We all know there will be no real politics” in Putin’s Russia, the man says at a staff conference. "
1529,"WASHINGTON — In pitching the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said repeatedly that the plan will pay for itself through a surge of economic growth and that over 100 people in Treasury are “working around the clock on running scenarios for us.” Mr. Mnuchin has promised that Treasury will release its analysis in full. Yet, as the full Senate prepares to vote on a sweeping tax rewrite, the administration has yet to produce the type of economic analysis that it is citing as a reason to pass the tax cut. Those inside Treasury’s Office of Tax Policy, which Mr. Mnuchin has credited with running the models, say they have been largely shut out of the process and are not working on the type of detailed analysis that he has mentioned. An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a “dynamic” analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist. Instead of conducting full analyses of tax proposals, staff members have been running numbers on individual provisions or policy ideas, like lowering the tax rate on so-called pass-through businesses and figuring out how many family farms would benefit from the repeal of the estate tax. Activity has picked up more recently as Treasury has sought to provide technical assistance to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office for their estimates. A Treasury official said that there was not sufficient time to produce a full analysis with growth and revenue estimates of the final bill, which the Senate Finance Committee passed before Thanksgiving. The official pointed to a letter sent this week to Mr. Mnuchin by nine top conservative economists detailing how the Republican tax bills could bolster economic growth, saying that reflected the findings of its own economic models. On Thursday, the Treasury’s inspector general said it was opening an inquiry into the department’s analysis of the tax plan. The inquiry was in response to a request from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who called for the inspector general to investigate political meddling in the tax policy office after The New York Times reported on the lack of a Treasury analysis.

1530,"Good morning on this cooling Thursday. The thousands of revelers who packed into Rockefeller Center last night for the annual Christmas tree lighting brought to mind another holiday tradition here in the city: massive crowds. ’Tis the season for long lines, cramped sidewalks and sardined subway cars. But hordes of tourists are no reason to miss out on the cheer. Seeking a less congested holidays, we spoke to owners and employees of popular attractions for advice on how to best avoid the masses. Macy’s Santa. For the first time ever, St. Nick is taking reservations. You can hold a spot in line from 30 minutes to five days ahead of time. Santa’s little helpers can still accommodate walk-ins, but visit Monday through Thursday for the shortest lines, said Susan Tercero, Macy’s vice president of branded entertainment. And if you can, dash over soon. “The closer we get to Christmas, the busier Santa gets,” she said. Ice Skating. The Rink at Rockefeller Center is typically packed during the holidays, said Carol Olsen, director of the skating rink. Expect to wait up to 90 minutes for your chance on the ice. The only reliably crowd-free moments, she said, are between 8:30 and 10 a.m., when you can still expect 50 to 75 people skating alongside you. For less crowded rinks, try weekday mornings or evenings at The Rink at Bryant Park in Midtown, LeFrak Center at Lakeside in Prospect Park, or The Rink at Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan. Holiday Windows. The creative directors behind retail holiday windows are split on the least trafficked times to go: at sunrise or after sunset. “It’s quiet and darker at sunrise,” said Richard Moore of Tiffany’s. “Early morning allows you to spend a few minutes alone to take it all in.” But Matthew Mazzucca of Barneys New York prefers visiting in the evening, before 7 p.m. “There is time to hear the custom audio composition,” he said, “and it’s still dark so the light levels are perfect.” Museums. If you’re planning on visiting one of the big four museums (the Met, MoMA, the Whitney and the American Museum of Natural History), plan on going before the doors open, or during the extended hours on Friday or Saturday. When visiting the Met, enter at the 81st Street entrance, where there are fewer people and the line is faster, said Annie Bailis, the museum’s senior manager of media relations. And here’s a tip: Instead of squeezing next to your neighbors at the next holiday tree lighting, the Met has tree lighting ceremonies with Christmas music every day. "

Blue Apron co-founder Matt Salzberg is stepping down as chief executive and being replaced with Chief Financial Officer Brad Dickerson. Mr. Salzberg will become executive chairman, Blue Apron said. Shares of Blue Apron have struggled since it went public in June. The company priced its initial public offering at $10, 40 percent below its target. Since then, the stock has tumbled 70 percent to $2.99. Blue Apron has faced increased competition from Amazon and rival meal-kit delivery start-ups. Amazon’s announcement on June 16 that it would purchase Whole Foods Market weighed heavily on the offering. Since then, the company has done little to assuage investors. It has reported losing customers for two straight quarters and has laid off hundreds of employees. The Dow Jones Industrial Average smashed through 24,000 on Thursday. Increased optimism that the Senate will pass the Republican tax bill pushed the index up more than 300 points to close at 24,273 today. The rally extends a record run for the blue-chip index this year. The Dow has gained 21 percent this year. "
1534,"LONDON — Egypt, in what appeared to be a snub to the Trump administration, has reached a preliminary agreement to allow Russian military jets to use its airspace and bases, both sides said Thursday. If finalized, the agreement would give Russia its deepest presence in Egypt since 1973, when Cairo expelled the military of the Soviet Union and instead became Washington’s closest Arab ally. The United States has provided Egypt more than $70 billion in aid in the four decades since, at a rate of more than $1.3 billion a year in recent years. The cost is often justified in part by the argument that it secures the use of Egypt’s airspace and bases for the American military. Egyptian and American analysts called the preliminary deal the latest sign of the waning influence of the United States as President Trump has diminished its military and diplomatic footprint in the region and the world. “Power abhors a vacuum and when the United States pulls back we can’t be under the impression that the world is going to stand by and wait for us,” said Matthew Spence, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy under the Obama administration, which faced similar criticism for its policy toward the region. “The danger, and the reality, is that other countries will take advantage of the opportunity presented when America chooses to pull back.” In practical terms, the presence of Russian jets in Egypt would raise concerns about the operational security of American military personnel and require coordinating with American military planes in the same airspace.

1535,"Where is the line between culturally appropriate dress and cultural appropriation? It was hard to look at Ivanka Trump’s wardrobe during her India trip this week and not ask the question. After all, from her opening mother-of-pearl embroidered jacket to her final kurta dress, she swerved from her usual pencil skirts and high heels to make her clothes part of the content of her communications. And there were many: two and a half days, six looks, all excitedly chronicled by local style watchers. Indeed, Ms. Trump, in Hyderabad, the capital of the southern Indian state of Telangana, to lead the United States delegation to the eighth annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit, had begun making headlines with fashion even before she arrived. Critics pointed out what they called the hypocrisy of Ivanka Trump (the individual) in making a speech on the importance of female empowerment and equality, when Ivanka Trump (the company) is believed to employ low-wage workers in countries such as … India. Ms. Trump did not address the issue during her various speeches and panels, but she did use dress in a notable way. Unlike her stepmother, Melania Trump, who seemed uninterested in leveraging fashion for political capital during her tour through Asia with President Trump, Ivanka Trump seemed to have embraced the idea wholeheartedly. If, at least at the beginning, a little one-dimensionally. On Monday evening, for example, she made her initial appearance in a Tory Burch “Sylvia” jacket: a black style covered in mother-of-pearl embroidery that called to mind Indian prints and architecture. As it happens, Hyderabad is historically known as “the city of pearls.” "
1536,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Keith Bradsher, our senior writer for Asia economics and business. China’s push to become a major player in electric cars is already shaking up the global auto industry. California’s governor is hoping it will also give the state an advantage in its continuing showdown with Detroit over battery-powered vehicles. Gov. Jerry Brown said on Wednesday evening at an event in San Francisco that China’s electric-car effort would help California withstand demands from American automakers that the state ease back on its effort to put more clean-burning vehicles on the road. California mandates that manufacturers sell a small but growing percentage of electric cars or plug-in hybrid vehicles, which run on both gasoline and electricity. Detroit says the mandate is technologically infeasible. “Even now, some of the automobile companies are trying to come out and say ‘Gee, the standards in a few years will be too tough,’” Governor Brown said. “‘Will you let us off the hook?’” But speaking at the The New York Times’s Climate Tech conference, Governor Brown said China’s push puts pressure on Detroit’s automakers to more quickly embrace electric cars or be overwhelmed by the competition. “We have an ace card called China” in the dispute, he said. China imposed in September a complex formula that compels automakers to sell more electric cars starting in 2019 or be banned from selling gasoline-powered cars. In response, global automakers are moving to expand sharply their electric car production and sales. "
1537,"Donald Trump is completely unfit to be president of the United States. That is not an ideological expression. That is an expression of the shock of mounting evidence that he is intellectually deficient, temperamentally unsound and morally bankrupt. Just this week, he has once again underscored the degree to which he is openly hostile to people of color — I call that racism and bigotry — and demonstrated his lack of impulse control to conceal his contempt even when doing so would be to his benefit. On Monday, Trump defiled a White House ceremony to honor Navajo veterans of World War II (a meeting already defiled because it was held before a portrait of Andrew “Trail of Tears” Jackson) by using a racial slur, pejoratively referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.” These men deserved better, and if Trump were thinking more about them and less about himself — as almost any other American president would have been — he wouldn’t have dragged their moment down into his muck. But this is what happens when you “let Trump be Trump”: He shows up as the bestial creature that he is. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that unnamed advisers told the paper that Trump has also resurrected the racist lie of his political vivification: the question of Barack Obama’s birthplace, and by implication, his legitimacy as America’s first black president, or put another way, its only nonwhite president. According to The Times: “In recent months, they say, Mr. Trump has used closed-door conversations to question the authenticity of President Barack Obama’s birth certificate.” "
1538,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The tax overhaul that has moved through Congress with scant debate includes measures that are straight from the Republican playbook. It would also affect issues barely connected to taxation, such as Medicare, education and granting rights to “unborn children.” The plan’s guiding philosophy is trickle-down economics, whose benefits have historically been monopolized by the wealthy, our correspondents write. Pay for most American workers has been stagnant since the mid-1970s. On Wednesday, President Trump said the $1.5 trillion package of cuts was aimed at the middle class and would not help wealthy people like him. (We assessed some of his claims.) • Significant changes were still being discussed in the Senate, which is on track for a final vote this week. Our live briefing has the latest. • The White House has developed a plan to force out Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose relationship with President Trump has been strained, senior administration officials said today.

1539,"When the floodgates opened on Wednesday to cast Senator Al Franken aside, following a half-dozen accusations of sexual misconduct, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand had positioned herself at the crest of the wave. “Enough is enough,” she wrote on Facebook, becoming the first of Mr. Franken’s Democratic colleagues to call for his resignation on Wednesday morning. By lunchtime, more than a quarter of Democratic senators had concurred; by evening, a solid majority. Mr. Franken has now scheduled a public announcement about his future for Thursday. It was the second time in a month that Ms. Gillibrand, of New York, widely considered a possible presidential candidate in 2020, stepped to the forefront of the national debate about sexual harassment and powerful men. In mid-November, she told The New York Times that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, emerged two decades ago. That remark set off an unwelcome round of backward-looking questions for a Democratic Party that has tried to focus on the multiple women who have publicly accused President Trump of sexual misconduct, and the current Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, Roy Moore, who is accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls as young as 14. “I think when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual assault and sexual harassment and unwanted groping you are having the wrong conversation,” Ms. Gillibrand said Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference when asked about calling on Mr. Franken to resign. “You need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K. None of it is acceptable. "
1540,"OSLO — Injecting rare drama into a process that is supposed to be shielded from politics, members of the Norwegian Parliament have blocked the appointment of a right-leaning populist politician to the committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize. For nearly three decades, from 1978 to 2006, the politician, Carl I. Hagen, led the Progress Party, transforming it from a small right-wing fringe party into a significant anti-tax, anti-immigration bloc that entered the ranks of government for the first time in 2013, in a coalition with the center-right Conservative Party. Mr. Hagen, 73, is an outlier in the consensus-based political world of Norway, an oil-rich nation that prides itself on its humanitarian record and its outsize role in international diplomacy. He has been a critic of immigration since the 1980s, long before the issue dominated the political agenda as it does now. He once argued that, like Hitler, fundamentalist Muslims planned world domination — a claim that drew formal protests from Arab diplomats. He denies climate change. And he supports President Trump, having likened him to Ronald Reagan. But even those controversies paled in comparison to the one set off last month when the Progress Party put forward Mr. Hagen as its nominee for one of three seats on the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize. Under the terms of Alfred Nobel’s will, members of the committee are elected for six-year terms, and the composition is supposed to reflect that of the Norwegian Parliament. The Progress Party put forward Mr. Hagen as a replacement for another party member, Inger-Marie Ytterhorn, whose six-year term is expiring. Leaders of the opposition Labour, Centre and Socialist Left parties immediately raised a furor. Descendants of Nobel, and a former secretary of the Nobel committee, Geir Lundestad, also spoke out against Mr. Hagen’s appointment. "
1541,"WASHINGTON — Ten days before Donald J. Trump took office, Sheldon G. Adelson went to Trump Tower for a private meeting. Afterward, Mr. Adelson, the casino billionaire and Republican donor, called an old friend, Morton A. Klein, to report that Mr. Trump told him that moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would be a major priority. “He was very excited, as was I,” said Mr. Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, a hard-line pro-Israel group. “This is something that’s in his heart and soul.” The two men had to wait nearly a year, but on Wednesday, Mr. Trump stood beneath a portrait of George Washington to announce that he was formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and setting in motion a plan to move the embassy to the fiercely contested Holy City. “While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise,” he said, “they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.” For Mr. Trump, the status of Jerusalem was always more a political imperative than a diplomatic dilemma. Faced with disappointing evangelical and pro-Israel backers like Mr. Adelson, or alarming allies and Arab leaders while jeopardizing his own peace initiative, the president sided with his key supporters. In doing so, Mr. Trump invited opprobrium from foreign leaders, who said the move was reckless and self-defeating. He also acted against the counsel of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who worried about anti-American blowback, not least to diplomats and troops serving overseas. "
1542,"NATIONAL An article on Wednesday about a gathering of 45 mayors held to discuss city-level policies to address climate change misstated the day of an interview with Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago. It was on Tuesday, not Thursday. NEW YORK An article on Wednesday about a defamation lawsuit brought against President Trump in New York State Supreme Court misstated an argument made by a lawyer in the case. Mariann Meier Wang, a lawyer for the plaintiff, argued that a federal ruling in a similar case against former president Bill Clinton allows a state court to hear a lawsuit against a sitting president — so long as it does not concern his official conduct. Ms. Wang did not argue that a state court could hear the case “so long as it concerns his official conduct.” • An article on Wednesday about an increase in official disputes between the New York City Police Department and the Civilian Complaint Review Board misstated the percentage of board recommendations the police commissioner modified in the first six months of 2016. It was 21 percent, not 18 percent. THE ARTS An article on Wednesday about a redesigned rendition of “The Nutcracker” performed by Miami City Ballet misidentified the production of Balanchine’s “Nutcracker” for which Karinska and Rouben Ter-Arutunian designed the scenery. It was the 1964 production, not the 1954 original. THURSDAY STYLES An article last Thursday about anthurium flowers, using information from a florist, referred imprecisely to the flowers in Emily Weiss’s wedding bouquet. It included roses, but not orchids. • An article last Thursday about anxious New Yorkers turning to pottery and crafts as a balm and a corrective misspelled the surname of Bkln Clay’s co-founder. She is Jennifer Waverek, not Wavereck. OBITUARIES An obituary on Wednesday about Christine Keeler, who in the early 1960s was at the center of the political scandal known as the Profumo affair, misspelled the surname of the actor who played the British politician John Profumo in the 1989 movie “Scandal,” in which Joanne Whalley played Ms. Keeler. He is Ian McKellen, not McKellan. • An obituary on Wednesday about King Michael of Romania misspelled the given name of one of his daughters. She is Margareta, not Margarita. • An obituary on Saturday about the architecture historian Vincent Scully referred incorrectly to his childhood. While he did grow up in New Haven, he did not grow up under East Rock, which rises above New Haven’s harbor.

1543,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr. refused on Wednesday to provide a congressional committee details of a July telephone conversation with his father about a meeting last year at which Trump campaign officials had expected to receive damaging information from the Russian government about Hillary Clinton. Testifying in a closed session before the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump claimed that his conversation over the summer with his father, two days after The New York Times disclosed the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, was protected under attorney-client privilege because lawyers for both men were on the call. What, if anything, Donald J. Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting as a presidential candidate — and his role in drafting a misleading statement about it once he was president and it became public — are key questions for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the election. Donald Trump Jr. had agreed to the meeting after receiving an email stating that a Russian government lawyer would provide incriminating facts about Mrs. Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” He has said that no damaging information was delivered. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said after Wednesday’s session that Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged that he had discussed the Trump Tower meeting by telephone with his father on July 10. The congressman said that Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, asked the committee for more time to answer questions about that conversation because both he and a lawyer for the president were privy to it. Mr. Schiff said that he believed the contents of the phone call should not be kept secret simply because lawyers participated in it. “The presence of counsel does not make communications between father and son a privilege,” he said. He added that he would follow up with Mr. Futerfas about the legal basis for refusing to disclose what was discussed. "
1544,"After last week’s surreal, poignant journey through Elliot’s emotional torment, “Mr. Robot” returned the plot to a full boil on Wednesday as onetime partners resumed tense relations. You had Elliot and the Dark Army, plotting each other’s demises. Mr. Robot and Tyrell Wellick rekindled their old oligarchy-smashing bond, with an assist from Phillip Price. Darlene and Dom took things to the next level. Angela and her fish spiraled in crazytown. While the actions and decisions that led to these encounters made sense from a character standpoint, only a few of them were very satisfying. The result was an uneven, somewhat draggy episode that nevertheless set up plenty of jeopardy for next week’s Season 3 finale. By the end Whiterose and her loyal attendant had resolved to give Elliot the send off she first promised in the season premiere; Darlene was captive at the F.B.I. with a Dark Army target perhaps on her back as well; and Angela was headed into a mystery van, which rarely leads to good things on “Mr. Robot.” (Or in life.) The main thrust involved Elliot’s counterstrike against the malign forces that have dominated this season, a theoretical Stage 3 that was actually a sneak attack on the Dark Army. It was part of a two-pronged approach that involved Elliot 1.) getting the group to copy his control-seizing file onto its server, while also 2.) pursuing the plan, posthumously provided by Trenton last week, to recover E Corp’s data by cracking the F.B.I.’s network, thus undoing the 5/9 hack. The scheme took Elliot on a greatest hits tour of his “Mr. Robot” past — he started in the arcade with Darlene and then went on to use Irving’s OnStar trick against him and briefly reunite with Leon, before finally tricking Dark Army flunkies into uploading his file. (Which they did in rather gullible fashion, for hacker terrorists, though by the end they were at least somewhat on to him.) Elliot was in hero mode throughout, imbued with the determination that emerged at the end of last week’s dark night of the soul. “The only thing we can do now is rebuild,” he told Darlene in the arcade. While such optimism was an abrupt switch from last week’s suicidal depression and bagful o’ pills, it was also a logical response from a man who’s spent this season in search of purpose, and afraid that his lack of it has been fueling Mr. Robot’s misadventures. "
1545,"Jay and I wondered what the climb back out would be like as we made our way down a wide, smooth, but radically tilted carapace of sandstone toward Upper Calf Creek Falls. This was a “trail,” visible mostly as an imaginary line between rock cairns. We had to brace ourselves against the steep pitch, mind the loose grit underfoot and take care not to be distracted: The domes and swales of bright vanilla rock, a faint scatter of distant pines and junipers, a dark weight of azure sky. The oceanic expanses of sandstone — known locally as “slickrock”— are common in southern Utah’s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.  For two decades, monument status has protected this mostly uninhabited high-desert region where ancestral Native American rock art and ruins are on view, backcountry hiking is accelerating in popularity, kayakers ply the Escalante River, rock climbers ascend towers and canyon walls, and the fossils of newly discovered species of dinosaurs are unearthed every few years. The geology is durable, but national monuments may no longer be. President Donald Trump appeared in Salt Lake City on Monday to proclaim that he will cut this one to half its current size, opening the other half to mining, drilling, motorized recreation and various industrial uses. An adjacent national monument, the 2,000-square-mile Bears Ears, will shrink by 85 percent. A long list of  Republican and Democratic presidents have created national monuments under the authority of the century-old Antiquities Act. Grand Staircase-Escalante was declared by Bill Clinton in 1996, Bears Ears by Barack Obama in 2016. According to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, “There is no doubt that President Trump has the authority to review and consider recommendations to modify or add a monument.” His opponents say no such authority exists. “We intend to sue the president immediately in federal court over these unlawful acts” Steve Bloch, legal director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said, just as the president arrived. S.U.W.A. will join several plaintiffs that include the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Wilderness Society, Earthjustice and other groups, he said. ""The Antiquities Act does not provide authority to revoke or modify national monuments once they’ve been created,” Mr. Bloch said, adding that “we’ll be in a position to move very quickly to have those actions declared unlawful.” "
1546,"TUCSON — As the police chief here, I’m deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s campaign against “sanctuary cities,” which refuse to turn over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. Washington is trying to retaliate against them by withholding funding for things like crime prevention, drug treatment and mental health programs. Tucson is not technically a sanctuary city. But we are close to the border with Mexico and take pride in being welcoming to immigrants. Yet the government has warned us that our grants are in danger. Still, while federal judges in Chicago and San Francisco have ruled against President Trump’s executive order to withhold money from sanctuary cities, the administration’s crackdown on immigrants is already having a chilling effect on police-community relations here. Many community members have told me that Latinos are not turning to us for help or working with us as often as they have in the past. Their growing sense of fear and distrust is clearly a consequence of the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Justice Department could be playing a key role in building on the Obama-era policing reforms that many of my fellow police chiefs strongly support. Instead, the changes it wants to make — to force local police officers to cooperate much more closely with federal immigration authorities — will compromise public safety by reducing community confidence in law enforcement. To be sure, violent crime has risen in some cities over the past couple years. But the administration’s response, paradoxically, is shortsighted policies that hurt local law enforcement agencies. An associate deputy attorney general, Steven Cook, recently explained the department’s rationale this way: “It is unfortunate that cities like Chicago are more interested in implementing their extreme sanctuary policies that put criminal aliens back on the street than in addressing violent crime.” That couldn’t be farther from the truth. Public safety has always been our top priority. The message from Washington is that cities need to refocus on “law and order.” Yet the harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric and Mr. Sessions’s reckless policies ignore a basic reality known by most good cops and prosecutors: If people are afraid of the police, if they fear they may become separated from their families or harshly interrogated based on their immigration status, they won’t report crimes or come forward as witnesses. "
1547,"WASHINGTON — Support for Al Franken all but collapsed on Wednesday among his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, with dozens calling for him to resign after a sixth woman said he had made an improper advance on her. “Senator Franken should resign,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday evening, the latest in an avalanche of statements that began with a half-dozen Democratic women and then snowballed throughout the day. “I consider Senator Franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the Senate, and he should step down immediately.” Mr. Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has scheduled an announcement on his future in the Senate for Thursday, and he pushed back on a Minnesota Public Radio report that he would be resigning. “No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family,” his office said on Twitter. By Wednesday evening, there was widespread expectation among senators in the Democratic caucus and aides that Mr. Franken would step down. If he does, he would be the most prominent lawmaker so far to be felled by the swirling allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct sweeping through the Capitol. On Tuesday, Representative John Conyers Jr., the longest-serving member of the House and the longest-serving African-American congressman in history, stepped down under severe pressure after multiple women said he had harassed them, including one who said she was fired for refusing to have sex with him. A freshman Democrat, Representative Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, has faced calls for his resignation since charges emerged Friday that he had repeatedly propositioned his former campaign finance director. "
1548,"SHANGHAI — The official newspaper of a Chinese province adjoining North Korea published a full page of blunt advice on Wednesday about what to do in case of a nuclear explosion or radioactive fallout, from hiding indoors to bathing quickly with soap. The newspaper, Jilin Daily, printed the advice as the United States and South Korea were conducting extensive military exercises this week, and after President Trump repeatedly threatened to take unspecified action if North Korea did not agree to halt its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The publication came less than a week after Hawaii resumed testing of a Cold War-era warning system designed to alert residents of an imminent nuclear attack. The advice published by the newspaper emphasized ways for residents to minimize their exposure to radioactive fallout. The suggestions, including cartoons vaguely reminiscent of those published in the United States during the 1950s, emphasized taking shelter indoors, washing off suspected radioactive dust from exposed body parts and shoes, and taking other precautions consistent with past tips from civil defense experts in the West. Tensions rose a week ago when North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that flew higher and longer than its previous tests. Its government subsequently declared that the missile could deliver heavy nuclear warheads anywhere in the continental United States. Residents of Jilin province, which abuts North Korea and Russia, had a jostling reminder of the dangers of nuclear detonations in early September, when the province was physically shaken by an earthquake set off by what North Korea described as a successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Scientists subsequently warned that the test had been so powerful that further tests underneath the same North Korean mountain could cause part of the mountain to collapse, releasing a cloud of radiation that could drift across the border into Jilin. Jilin is one of two Chinese provinces along the North Korean border — the other is Liaoning, which had not yet issued a comparable public warning. North Korea’s nuclear test site is close to the border with Jilin, and the nuclear test in early September has left residents with lingering anxiety. Publication of the civil defense advice caused a flurry of discussion on social media in China, and official news media sought to discourage speculation that a nuclear conflict might be imminent. The nationalistic Global Times said that China was trying hard to avert a conflict on the Korean Peninsula, while adding, “Even if war happens on the peninsula, our nation will try its best to make sure the war has the least possible impact on our northeastern areas.” Xu Yucheng, the deputy chief of Jilin’s civil air defense office, told the Beijing News that the information had been provided by the province’s civil air defense authorities and was consistent with other countries’ efforts to use mass media to spread knowledge about how to mitigate the effects of nuclear explosions. "
1549,"If he was hoping for thunderous applause from American Jews, President Trump may be disappointed. His announcement on Wednesday that he will recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital went down well with those on the political right, who have urged the step for years. They will be telling him so at the White House Hanukkah party on Thursday, they said. But other Jewish leaders said they were more worried than glad, fearing that the precipitous step would inflame tensions in the region, provoke more terrorism, put peace with the Palestinians even farther out of reach, and worsen the diplomatic isolation of both Israel and the United States. They say they wish he had held off, as previous presidents have done. “Jerusalem has always been the most delicate issue in every discussion about peace,” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest branch of American Judaism. “So we’re very concerned that the announcement will either delay or undermine the very, very important resuming of a serious peace process.” Debra DeLee, the president of Americans for Peace Now, an affiliate of the Israeli peace group Shalom Achshav, said, “Trump is causing severe damage to the prospects of Middle East peace, imperiling lives, and degrading U.S. leadership.” Jewish leaders are not alone in expressing alarm at Mr. Trump’s move. Leaders of other faiths decried it, including Pope Francis, Orthodox patriarchs and Protestant church leaders in Jerusalem and the United States, and Muslims around the world. The words Mr. Trump uttered about Jerusalem sounded sweet to many Jews, who belong to a faith that has revered the city as its holiest site for 3,000 years. But Jerusalem is also holy to Christians and to Muslims, and for centuries, attempts by any side to take exclusive control have brought trouble. Balancing their competing claims has been seen as the stickiest part of any peace effort. "
1550,"BRUSSELS — Nearly a year after the State Department discovered that something terrible had happened to diplomats and their spouses posted in Havana, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Wednesday that the United States remained convinced the personnel were victims of “targeted attacks.” Mr. Tillerson also suggested that Cuba could have stopped the attacks, which the State Department has said left 24 people, who are associated with the American Embassy in Havana, with medical problems. His remarks came after The Associated Press reported that medical tests had revealed perceptible physical changes in the brains of some of the diplomats, leading experts to become increasingly skeptical that the attackers had used a sonic weapon, which had been initially suspected because the diplomats reported strange sounds in their homes or hotels. Sonic weapons do not cause the kind of physical changes seen in the personnel, experts have said. Instead, the sounds may have been a byproduct of something else that caused the damage, The Associated Press reported. The United States has never accused the Cuban government of perpetrating the attacks, but officials have said that Cuba, as the host government, was responsible for ensuring the safety of its diplomats and their spouses. On Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson made clear that no matter who was behind the attacks, Cuba was to blame. “What we’ve said to the Cubans is: small island,” Mr. Tillerson said, raising his hands. “You’ve got a sophisticated security apparatus. You probably know who is doing it. You can stop it. It’s as simple as that.” "
1551,"ROME — Pope Francis said, “I cannot remain silent.” The United Nations secretary general spoke of his “great anxiety.” The European Union expressed “serious concern.” American allies like Britain, France, Germany and Italy all declared it a mistake. A chorus of international leaders criticized the Trump administration’s decision on Wednesday to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it a dangerous disruption that contravenes United Nations resolutions and could inflame one of the world’s thorniest conflicts. Secretary General António Guterres and Pope Francis both expressed alarm that the announcement would provoke new tensions in the Holy City, which is revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims. Within minutes of Mr. Trump’s speech, in which he said the American Embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Mr. Guterres delivered what amounted to a diplomatic rebuke. Reading a statement outside the Security Council chambers at United Nations headquarters in New York, Mr. Guterres criticized “any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,” underscoring the administration’s departure from decades of American policy. “Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides,” Mr. Guterres said. "
1552,"BRUSSELS — Just hours before President Trump declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel, prompting warnings of unrest across the Muslim world, the administration’s top diplomat said on Wednesday that peace in the Middle East was still possible. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, during a news conference at NATO headquarters in the heart of Europe, said that he did not want to pre-empt the president’s official announcement, but expressed reassurances about the expected consequences of the decision. “The president’s very committed to the Middle East peace process,” Mr. Tillerson said. Mr. Tillerson has been largely shut out of the usual back-and-forth between Israelis and Palestinians that many secretaries of state spent much of their tenures conducting. Instead, Mr. Trump entrusted that task to his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Tillerson was complimentary toward Mr. Kushner’s Middle East peace efforts, which have also been pursued by Jason Greenblatt, an assistant to the president. “They have done the hard work,” Mr. Tillerson said. “We continue to believe there is a good opportunity to achieve peace.” But in a chorus of concern, European and Middle Eastern leaders and diplomats said in recent days that the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital could have a devastating effect on efforts to resolve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Trump is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital to fulfill one of his campaign promises, his advisers have said. Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary who joined Mr. Tillerson at the NATO conference here, said he viewed reports of Mr. Trump’s looming decision “with concern because we think Jerusalem should be part of a final settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, a negotiated final settlement, and we have no plans ourselves to move our embassy.” Later, he amended those comments as he stood beside Mr. Tillerson before a bilateral meeting, saying the Americans should produce their plans for peace in the Middle East right away. “We would like to see, as a result of this, the American proposals on the Middle East peace process brought forward,” he said. Mr. Tillerson also met here with the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, who was far less diplomatic. “It will be a grave mistake,” Mr. Cavusoglu said of the pending announcement. “It will not bring any stability or peace but rather chaos and instability.” Mr. Tillerson has been calling leaders from around the world in recent days to alert them to the pending announcement. In brief public remarks on Tuesday beside Mr. Tillerson, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top diplomat, warned against the Jerusalem declaration. “A way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states so that the aspiration of both parties can be fulfilled,” she said. But in his own comments Wednesday after meeting Mr. Cavusoglu, Mr. Tillerson said diplomats had barely brought up the subject with him. “We haven’t had a lot of talks about that,” Mr. Tillerson said. "
1553,"JERUSALEM — Palestinians burned photos of President Trump in Gaza, and the walls of the Old City were illuminated with the American and Israeli flags on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump made good on his campaign pledge to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In a much-anticipated speech from the White House, Mr. Trump argued that it was “the right thing to do” to acknowledge the reality that Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s government. Decades of avoiding that fact, he said, has done little to resolve the protracted feud between Israelis and Palestinians. “It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump declared. Recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, he said, is “a long overdue step to advance the peace process.” Mr. Trump said that the United States still wanted a negotiated peace agreement — and “would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides” — and that he was not seeking to dictate the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in the fiercely contested Holy City. “There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,” the president said. He appealed for “calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate.” Mr. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem isolates the United States on one of the world’s most sensitive diplomatic issues. It drew a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, including some of America’s closest allies. "
1554,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. My view of the tax bill in Congress is probably clear to you by now. I think it’s bad for the economy and, in particular, for the middle class and poor. A small number of Republicans can still prevent the bill from becoming law, and I hope they do. But I also think that some of the commentary about the bill is exaggerating its impact. The goal of today’s newsletter is to put the bill in perspective. It does not fundamentally alter American politics. Its passage would not be as big of a deal as Obamacare repeal would have been (and, no, the bill does not stealthily repeal Obamacare). The tax bill doesn’t threaten democratic values in the ways that President Trump, Roy Moore and their various enablers are otherwise doing. The tax bill, to be clear, is a dreadful piece of policy. It’s also a dreadful piece of policy that is unlikely to endure — so long as people avoid becoming despondent. “Of all the horrors Donald Trump has (and has yet to) inflict upon the republic, a huge tax cut for the rich was the most inevitable,” Jonathan Chait of New York magazine wrote. “But it is also the most easily reversible.” Here’s my attempt at perspective: Tax policy swings back and forth with partisan control. Ronald Reagan cut taxes for the rich, and Bill Clinton raised them. George W. Bush cut taxes on the rich, and Barack Obama raised them. Now Trump is on the verge of cutting them again. Changes to the tax code are often ephemeral. "
1555,"First it was a story. Then a moment. Now, two months after women began to come forward in droves to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment and assault, it is a movement. [Time’s persons of the year for 2020: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.] Time magazinehas named “the silence breakers” its person of the year for 2017, referring to those women, and the global conversation they have started. The magazine’s editor in chief, Edward Felsenthal, said in an interview on the “Today” show on Wednesday that the #MeToo movement represented the “fastest-moving social change we’ve seen in decades, and it began with individual acts of courage by women and some men too.” Investigations published in October by The New York Times and The New Yorker, both of them detailing multiple allegations of sexual harassment and assault against the movie producer Harvey Weinstein, sparked the sudden rush of women coming forward. In a joint interview after the choice was announced, Tarana Burke, who created the Me Too mantra years ago, and the actress Alyssa Milano, who helped promote it more recently, focused on what was still left to do.

1556,"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we are looking at: • Disney may extend chief executive Robert Iger’s tenure • A Disney deal could split the Murdochs as an operating team. • An investigation of the people who abetted and protected Harvey Weinstein Like what you see? Get the DealBook Briefing in your inbox each morning. Here’s the sign-up. The Wall Street Journal reports that The Walt Disney Company may extend chief executive Robert Iger’s tenure if it completes a purchase of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox. Here’s the thinking: Any deal for Fox’s assets likely wouldn’t close until late next year, at which point Disney would spend the next year integrating Fox. Mr. Iger had previously said he plans to step aside in July 2019, but making a C.E.O. transition so close to the completion of the deal would be difficult. According to The Journal: This would be the fifth time Disney has extended Mr. Iger’s contract. What about James Murdoch? If the deal is completed, James Murdoch, who’s currently Fox’s C.E.O., could become a senior executive at Disney, with a portfolio that would likely include oversight of Sky and Star, The New York Times reported. Several news reports have said that James Murdoch could eventually succeed Bob Iger as Disney’s C.E.O., though they cautioned that there’s no formal agreement. Meanwhile, James Murdoch spoke at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference Tuesday night and faced questions about the deal. His response: Paul Pendergass, who wrote the “Jack Flack” column for DealBook from 2008 through 2009, has offered his unique take on James Murdoch’s response. "
1557,"It has been just over a year since the election of Donald J. Trump forced the political establishment to reconsider how it does business, and in turn upended many of the news media’s rhythms. Mr. Trump is not a 9-to-5 president, and the way he works has complicated the way he is covered. This is especially true at night. Missiles fly, the staff is shaken up, policy is announced. The tweets never stop. They can be deadly serious (an attack on Syria’s chemical weapons capability) or unintentionally funny (“covfefe”). On the front lines at The New York Times after the usual working hours have been Lara Jakes, who until last month was the night editor for the Washington bureau, and Steve Kenny, who runs the newsroom at night in New York. Ms. Jakes, a former correspondent for The Associated Press who came to The Times from Foreign Policy magazine, joined the Washington bureau the same week that Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Her entire experience at The Times has been defined by the Trump administration.

1559,"All aboard on this semi-sunny Wednesday. There’s one train show at Grand Central Terminal and another at the New York Botanical Garden. Vintage subway cars are making special runs, model trains are zipping through Macy’s Santaland, and tales of the Polar Express abound. Trains seem to be inextricably linked to the holidays. Why is that? Christian Wolmar, a railway historian and author of “The Great Railroad Revolution: The History of Trains in America,” told us that the holidays were, in essence, “invented by the railways.” “Until they had railways, people couldn’t travel very much,” he said. “There’s a strong association with time off or holiday time and the railways, because the two developed in tandem.” The railways, which originated in the United Kingdom, existed for at least half a century before people could travel by car, Mr. Wolmar explained, so the association between leisure and locomotives became fixed early on. The British “railway mania” of the 1840s picked up speed in the United States over the few decades that followed, but trains here had their holiday travel “heyday” in the 1920s and 1930s, Mr. Wolmar said, “before the luxury market was taken away by airplanes and the mass market was taken away by cars.” He added that mail-order — ordering gifts from department stores to homes, for example — was also made possible by the railways, further connecting trains to holiday traditions. Amy Hausmann, senior curator and deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the New York Transit Museum, explained that “in the 19th century, going home for the holidays meant getting on a train to visit your family.” "
1560,"Is social media responsible for our democracy’s current crisis? An increasing amount of political information (and misinformation) gets disseminated online, and many Americans do not trust the media, do not trust Congress and do not trust the president. By many measures, voters are as polarized now as they have ever been in recent memory. Many observers — even, before he left office, President Barack Obama — have tagged social media as a key driver of this crisis. The digital world offers no shortage of potential villains: targeted Russian ads; shadowy purveyors of fake news; political consultants like Cambridge Analytica wielding big data and cutting edge psychology; and formerly fringe media players like Breitbart leaping into the mainstream. But we risk giving too much weight to the newest and most frightening media technologies. If any media platform is to blame, it is not the web. It is more likely television, which is a more important source of political information. Growing polarization may also result from structural economic changes, like rising inequality, that have occurred in recent decades. A few facts can help keep the role of social media in perspective. The share of Americans who use social media as their primary source of political news and information is rising fast but remains relatively small. Recent work by Mr. Gentzkow and Hunt Allcott finds that only 14 percent of American adults reported that social media was their most important source of news for the 2016 election. On the other hand, 57 percent of American adults said that TV (cable, network or local) was their most important source. It’s also important which demographic groups use social media. In a paper recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we show that polarization has been growing as fast or faster among elderly Americans — those least likely to use social media — as among those aged 18 to 39. This applies across a broader set of demographic groups: Polarization increased as fast or faster among the Americans least likely to use the internet compared with those who are most likely. In the 2016 election, President Trump was most popular among demographic groups least likely to use social media. According to our calculations, Mr. Trump gained support relative to Mitt Romney among non-internet-using voters, but actually lost support among internet-using voters. An analysis by the media researchers Keith Hampton and Eszter Hargittai likewise finds that Hillary Clinton’s supporters were more likely to use Twitter and Reddit than Mr. Trump’s supporters. "
1561,"During his first official trip to Asia last month, President Trump issued a stern warning to North Korea: “Do not underestimate us. And do not try us.” But for his part, Mr. Trump should not underestimate the steep human cost of initiating a war against Pyongyang. The key problem for the United States is the likely possibility that North Korea has the missiles to deliver nuclear bombs to South Korea and Japan. If one of these weapons were to reach its target, an entire city would be annihilated. And even if an American first strike knocked out North Korea’s nuclear capacity, millions of South Korean civilians, and American and South Korean soldiers, would be vulnerable to retaliation with conventional or chemical weapons. Pyongyang could devastate Seoul and kill tens of thousands of people. North Korea may have as many as 250 mobile missile launchers, some of which could fire nuclear-tipped missiles. If some of these mobile units were dispersed at the time of an American attack, it’s unlikely that the United States could destroy all of them before one fires a missile. America has not had much success in finding and destroying mobile missile launchers in recent wars. An American attack that truly caught North Korea by surprise could minimize the effectiveness of a North Korean counterattack — but not eliminate the possibility. And surprise would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. North Korea probably has reliable intelligence sources reporting on activity in South Korea and Japan that could warn of an attack. And news reports from the United States and elsewhere, or the intelligence agencies of other countries like China and Russia, could also warn Pyongyang. "
1562,"First, let me vent. The Republican tax reform, now extremely likely to become law pending certain events next week in Alabama, represents a remarkable missed opportunity for a party struggling through an identity crisis and a country reckoning with a social crisis. After watching Trumpian populism overwhelm the dikes of ideology during the last primary campaign, Republican lawmakers could have learned something from the experience, and made the discontented working class voters who put Donald Trump in the White House the major beneficiaries of their tax reform. Instead, with Trump’s enthusiastic blessing, they devised a bill that was more solicitous of their donors than their voters, and that only modestly addressed the central socioeconomic challenge of our time — the nexus of wage stagnation, family breakdown and falling birthrates, which will eventually undo conservatism if conservatives cannot take it as seriously as they do the animal spirits of the investor class. What’s particularly frustrating is that it didn’t have to be this way. The bill’s basic architecture is compatible with better policy, and there is no great mystery about how it could have been improved: All it needed was to shrink the business tax cuts somewhat and push the extra money directly into the paychecks of the working class. But when a version of that improvement was attempted, when Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee tried to use a small portion of the bill’s corporate tax cut to pay for family tax cuts, the Republican leadership decided to make the corporate cut nonnegotiable, the Democrats decided it was better not to improve a bill that they oppose, and the senators themselves declined to be the Bad Guys of their caucus in a good cause and simply swallowed their defeat. So the result leaves a reforming conservatism as the neglected stepchild of the G.O.P., granted table scraps while the donors get the feast. It leaves Republicans with ownership of a bill that is neither populist nor popular, and Trump with ownership of an economic agenda that a reasonable voter should consider a betrayal of his promises. And it wastes an opportunity to turbocharge the recovery, because the bill’s corporate beneficiaries are already sitting on ample cash reserves and it’s the middle-class taxpayers who would have been more likely to spend extra money if they got it. "
1563,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. We’ve had some technical difficulties this week that have resulted in some readers not receiving the Morning Briefing by email. We believe those problems have been fixed, and apologize for the inconvenience. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump is to announce today that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision that Arab and European leaders warned could disrupt the Mideast peace process and unleash violence across the region. The president wants to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to one of the world’s most fiercely contested areas: West Jerusalem is the seat of Israel’s government, but the Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The president’s decision, likely to be welcomed by evangelicals and ardently pro-Israel American Jews, would upend nearly seven decades of U.S. foreign policy. The White House is preparing for possible unrest and is making plans to protect Americans abroad. • We spoke to experts about the modern history of Jerusalem, and why it’s important to Christians, Jews and Muslims. "
1564,"SAN JUAN, P.R. — For an overburdened pediatrician trying to care for a child who was in pain, needed hip surgery, and was displaced from his home in the wake of Hurricane Maria, it seemed a godsend — a modern military hospital ship sent from its berth in Virginia to help with medical care in Puerto Rico. But after days calling phone numbers that did not work and trying to navigate the admissions process for the ship, the 894-foot U.S.N.S. Comfort, Dr. Jorge Gabriel Rosado finally gave up. The boy is still awaiting surgery, which had been scheduled for the day before the storm hit more than two months ago. “It was rough because there were a lot of people that could have taken advantage of all the resources the Comfort had,” Dr. Rosado said. “But there were so many steps to it. Most physicians on the island, even us, decided it was too many steps.” The Comfort’s mission has ended, but it leaves behind questions about whether it was adequately used during a time of desperate medical need. The ship was prepared to support 250 hospital beds, but over its 53-day deployment, which included travel to and from the island, it admitted an average of only six patients a day, or 290 in total. An additional 1,625 people were treated aboard the ship as outpatients, all at no cost. In many ways, the Comfort’s story is that of the wobbly recovery effort in Puerto Rico, in which attempts to bolster vital services have often fallen flat or become entangled in bureaucracy and politics. Following public debate over the Trump administration’s initial reluctance to deploy it, the Comfort arrived two weeks into the disaster, after some of the medical urgency had abated. Its mission and capabilities were opaque to many doctors on the island. It lacked the ability to treat some important areas of need, and the complex referral procedures made little sense on a battered island with scant power or telephone service. "
1565,"MIAMI — A dozen high school students working for Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political network funded by Charles G. and David H. Koch, fanned out across the Little Havana neighborhood one day last week to make the case that the Republican tax bill was something to get excited about. “We believe it’s time to fix our broken tax code and let families keep more of what they earn,” Barbara D’Ambrosio, a sophomore, dutifully told an elderly woman who answered the door in her slippers. After she finished her script, Barbara glanced up from the iPad she was carrying and asked if the woman would kindly call her senators to urge them to support the tax bill, which was hours away from being approved by the Senate. The woman stared at her silently for a moment. Then she nodded, politely but unconvincingly. So Ms. D’Ambrosio and her friends soldiered on, visiting about 40 houses that afternoon and finding more of the same: people who were often unenthusiastic, unaware or simply uninterested. It’s the trickle down theory of selling tax cuts to the American voter. Conservative activist groups like Americans for Prosperity, celebrating what they expect is the imminent passage of a tax package that they and the Republican Party’s corporate backers have sought for a generation, now need to convince ordinary Americans that this is good for them too. These groups have marshaled their resources in almost every state in a campaign that can sound at times as if it were something a Democrat dreamed up, complete with tributes to the American worker and the middle class. “The American people have waited 31 long years to see our broken tax code overhauled,” the leaders of the Koch’s political network insisted in a letter to members of Congress on Monday, urging swift approval of final legislation. They added that the time had come to put “more money in the pockets of American families.” "
1566,"“Get Out,” the box office smash and awards season honey, almost didn’t get made, because its writer and director Jordan Peele figured it couldn’t happen. The broad strokes of the story line — white girl brings black boyfriend home to meet her family — evoked “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” but with a crucial and sinister twist (spoilers ensue): The boyfriend’s suspicions about the white folks having it in for him become increasingly, and terrifyingly, justified. Mr. Peele, 38, is known for his subversive comedy sketch show with Keegan-Michael Key, and had never before seen a movie like the one he desperately wanted to make. But he worried that its themes of white villainy and black victimization would keep people away in droves. Also, being biracial, he felt discouraged by the lack of people of color in the industry. “I didn’t have enough role models telling me this movie could be made,” Mr. Peele said during a chat in mid-November at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan, a few months before he would become a three-time Oscar nominee (for writing, directing and producing the movie). “But to me, it was the missing piece of the conversation. I’d never seen my fears as an African-American man onscreen in this way.” Around 2014, five years after he first began kicking the idea around, Mr. Peele started working on a script and brought it up with the producer Sean McKittrick (“Donnie Darko”), hedging all the way. He recalled telling Mr. McKittrick that it was his favorite movie that had never been made, and probably would never get made, and that he understood why. But Mr. McKittrick surprised Mr. Peele by telling him that he was on board. Three years later, in February 2017, the movie opened just as the racist ugliness attending the election of Donald J. Trump dashed lingering Obama-era delusions that America was a post-racial place. And Mr. Peele’s worries about the movie’s reception were knocked down like pins. "
1567,"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency will be free to publicly discuss their work from now on, Scott Pruitt, the agency’s administrator, has assured lawmakers who criticized the E.P.A. for preventing employees from presenting findings about climate change. In a letter Monday to Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, Mr. Pruitt did not explain why the agency had canceled the presentations of two E.P.A. scientists and one consultant who were scheduled to speak in Providence in October about the health of the Narragansett Bay, nor did he address whether the agency had acted improperly. “Procedures have been put in place to prevent such an occurrence in the future,” Mr. Pruitt wrote. He said he had assured staff members within the E.P.A.’s offices of research and development throughout the country that they had the authority to make decisions about participation in events. “I am committed to holding up the E.P.A.’s scientific integrity policy, which ensures that the agency’s scientific work is of the highest quality, is presented openly and with integrity and is free from political interference,” Mr. Pruitt wrote. Senator Whitehouse and 11 other Democrats from New England who challenged the E.P.A.’s move said they were pleased with Mr. Pruitt’s response but would remain vigilant. “After the E.P.A.’s reckless and shortsighted decision to muzzle its own scientists from presenting to the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, we appreciate Administrator Pruitt’s commitment never to let this happen again,’’ the lawmakers said in a statement issued Wednesday. “We will hold him to that commitment.” The cancellation of the presentations in October infuriated some scientists. Researchers who worked on the event said they believed that major factors in the agency’s decision were that the canceled talks dealt with climate change and that one panel was entitled “The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate Change.” The E.P.A. under Mr. Pruitt has deleted most mentions of climate change from the agency’s website and is preparing to open a national debate to question decades of peer-reviewed science that has concluded that human activity is the dominant cause of rising greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Pruitt’s letter said the agency would continue to conduct research as outlined in E.P.A.’s four-year strategic plan. That blueprint does not mention climate change as an issue the agency plans to address in the coming years. "
1568,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and setting in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City. “Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital,” Mr. Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It’s something that has to be done.” The president cast his decision as a break with decades of failed policy on Jerusalem, which the United States, along with virtually every other nation in the world, has declined to recognize as the capital since Israel’s founding in 1948. That policy, he said, brought us “no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.” “It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump declared. Recognizing Jerusalem, he added, was “a long overdue step to advance the peace process.” Mr. Trump’s remarks were the most closely scrutinized of his presidency on the Middle East, where he has vowed to broker the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians but has yet to find a breakthrough to end the conflict. He said he remained committed to brokering an agreement “that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.” "
1569,"President Trump on Wednesday officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of American foreign policy. Mr. Trump made the formal announcement during a speech in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, with Vice President Mike Pence standing behind him. The following is a transcript of his remarks, as prepared by The New York Times. For more coverage and analysis, read here. _______ PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you. When I came into office, I promised to look at the world’s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking. We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. All challenges demand new approaches. My announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. "
1570,"WASHINGTON — About 2,000 American troops are in Syria fighting the Islamic State, a Pentagon spokesman said on Wednesday, almost four times the total previously disclosed as the Trump administration changes how troop numbers are publicly counted. The new total, ordered disclosed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, counts service members on temporary duty of six months or less who were not included in Obama-era totals. The 1,500 or so previously undisclosed troops in Syria include traditional combat forces like infantry, artillery and forward air controllers trained to call in airstrikes, as well as support personnel, said Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman. He called the previous public total of 503 an “artificial construct” that became increasingly inaccurate as the campaign against the Islamic State progressed. Military officials said that the 2,000 personnel in Syria represented something of a high-water mark as the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria winds down. The American-led coalition has retaken 97 percent of the territory once held by the militants, and the military is working to stabilize recently liberated areas, including the restoration of basic essential services, the removal of explosive materials and the distribution of humanitarian aid. “The campaign to defeat ISIS is now in a new phase in Iraq and Syria,” Col. Robert Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. The updated figure does not reflect troops assigned to classified missions and some Special Operations personnel, Mr. Pahon said. The number also does not include combat aircrews flying from bases outside Iraq and Syria, nor from Navy aircraft carriers at sea. Mr. Mattis directed the Pentagon months ago to revise how it accounts for deployed personnel fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon also announced revised troop numbers in Afghanistan in August, acknowledging publicly for the first time that about 11,000 troops were deployed there. The numbers of American service members in Syria rose after a decision by President Trump in March to allow subordinate military commanders set the levels of troops they needed. But Colonel Manning said the number of troops in Syria “are generally trending downward,” and noted that an artillery battalion of 400 Marines deployed near Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, had recently returned to the United States. Colonel Manning said troop numbers would continue to decline as the American-led coalition transitioned to missions to train and advise local forces. The Pentagon also announced Wednesday that about 5,200 American troops are serving in Iraq. Colonel Manning said that total did not constitute a troop increase, but rather was a result of the change in the way troop numbers were accounted for and disclosed. About 3,000 Islamic State fighters remain in Syria, mainly in a strip of land along the Euphrates River Valley south of Deir al-Zour, according to military estimates provided by Mr. Pahon. "
1571,"It began with Donald Trump’s taunting of prisoners of war: “I like people who weren’t captured.” Then came his mocking of a disabled reporter; his suggestion that Judge Gonzalo Curiel wasn’t qualified to do his job on account of his being “Mexican”; his attacks on a Muslim Gold Star family; his flirtation with David Duke. By election night, the catalog of Mr. Trump’s insults was thick. That first jab at P.O.W.s persuaded me, a staunch social conservative, that Mr. Trump wasn’t qualified for the office he sought. A loudmouth who denigrates war heroes, I knew, doesn’t belong in the White House. Yet I watched with dismay as many evangelicals and social conservatives — people I consider allies — embraced him. How could they back a candidate who obviously didn’t care a whit for basic decency, let alone religious tradition? The question of how social conservatives should practice politics in the age of Trump has resurfaced as Alabamians are poised to elect Roy Moore to the Senate. The likes of Mr. Trump and Mr. Moore promise social conservatives an appealing menu of policies and judicial nominations. Their offer is especially attractive after a decade during which the left embraced a new, aggressive mode of secular progressivism and continued its war against tradition long after it had won most courtroom and ballot-box battles. But these vulgar populists exact an exorbitant price: namely, complicity in the degradation, conspiracism, thinly veiled bigotry and leader-worship that is their stock in trade. To understand the social conservatives’ dilemma isn’t to excuse the vile personal conduct of a figure like Mr. Moore. But if you believe, as they (and I) do, that a public culture informed by the Bible and traditional morality is essential to America’s constitutional order, then the stakes are high indeed. "
1572,"WASHINGTON — Republican leaders moved closer on Wednesday to resolving some key differences between the House and Senate tax bills, though several big issues, including the size of the corporate tax cut, remained in flux. As the Senate voted to begin the process of reconciling its tax bill with the House version, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, threw his support behind allowing a more generous state and local tax deduction in the final legislation. “That sounds like a kind of reasonable idea,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to a proposal brewing among House Republicans that would give people the option of deducting up to $10,000 in income taxes or property taxes. Right now, both bills would only allow taxpayers to deduct property taxes and cap that at $10,000. Once the conference committee process begins, lawmakers will begin formally hashing out the remaining differences, including what to do about the corporate alternative minimum tax, which crept back into the Senate bill as a late addition. The chambers are also debating how to treat the deduction that many people take for high medical expenses, a provision that is repealed by the House but expanded by the Senate. Complicating the discussions is the need to ensure that the overall bill stays in the $1.5 trillion bucket lawmakers have budgeted for the cuts. All the changes under discussion would cost money, requiring lawmakers to find ways to offset the effect on the deficit. Lawmakers continued to debate whether to increase the corporate tax rate to 22 percent from the proposed 20 percent, an idea that President Trump appeared to support over the weekend. Mr. McConnell publicly remains cool to the idea. On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, reiterated his support for a 20 percent corporate rate. "
1573,"WASHINGTON — President Trump pressed Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to fully end its blockade of food, water, medicine and fuel into Yemen, a rare humanitarian rebuke to the Middle East ally that he has firmly embraced since taking office. Saudi Arabia joined Yemen’s civil war, which pit the country’s leaders against Houthi rebels, in 2015. In November, the Saudis intensified a blockade on Yemen, stopping the entry of goods and other basic necessities, and heightening warnings of a humanitarian crisis from international aid groups. In a brief but blunt statement, Mr. Trump called on the Saudi government to “completely allow food, fuel, water and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it.” Mr. Trump added that lifting the blockade “must be done for humanitarian reasons immediately.” The president’s pointed request to the Saudi monarchy came on the same day that his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel sparked anger among Saudi leaders, including King Salman, who condemned Mr. Trump’s announcement. Mr. Trump has emphasized cooperation, not conflict, with Riyadh since becoming president. He has hailed his close relationship with the Saudis and described it as a key part of efforts to combat Islamic extremists. Even so, Saudi’s ongoing fighting in Yemen has the potential to strain the friendship between the kingdom and the United States, especially in the wake of the blockade, which humanitarian groups described as increasingly dire for Yemen’s civilian population. "
1574,"WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators thrashing out differences over a major tax bill are likely to eliminate the insurance coverage mandate at the heart of the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers say. But a deal struck by Senate Republican leaders and Senator Susan Collins of Maine to mitigate the effect of the repeal has been all but rejected by House Republicans, potentially jeopardizing Ms. Collins’s final yes vote. “I don’t think the American people voted for bailing out big insurance,” said Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, who opposes a separate measure to lower insurance premiums that Ms. Collins thought she had secured. The sweeping tax overhaul approved Saturday by the Senate would eliminate penalties for people who go without insurance, a change not in the tax bill passed last month by the House. But the House has voted many times to roll back the mandate, most recently in a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and House members were enthusiastic about going along. “Mandating people to buy a product was a bad idea to begin with,” said Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia. “We made people do something that was supposed to be good for them. But they are telling us by the millions how much they dislike the mandate.” Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chief architect of the House tax bill, asked whether he was receptive to the idea of eliminating the penalties for going without insurance, said, “I certainly am.” "
1575,"WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, told a former business associate that economic sanctions against Russia would be “ripped up” as one of the Trump administration’s first acts, according to an account by a whistle-blower made public on Wednesday. Mr. Flynn believed that ending the sanctions could allow a business project he had once participated in to move forward, according to the whistle-blower. The account is the strongest evidence to date that the Trump administration wanted to end the sanctions immediately, and suggests that Mr. Flynn had a possible economic incentive for the United States to forge a closer relationship with Russia. Mr. Flynn had worked on a business venture to partner with Russia to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East until June 2016, but remained close with the people involved afterward. On Inauguration Day, as he sat behind the president listening to the inaugural address, Mr. Flynn, according to the whistle-blower, texted the former business associate to say that the project was “good to go.” The account is detailed in a letter written by Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. In the letter, Mr. Cummings said that the whistle-blower contacted his office in June and has authorized him to go public with the details. He did not name the whistle-blower. “These grave allegations compel a full, credible and bipartisan congressional investigation,” Mr. Cummings wrote. "
1576,"LONDON — He is a little-known Saudi prince from a remote branch of the royal family, with no history as a major art collector, and no publicly known source of great wealth. But the prince, Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, is the mystery buyer of Leonardo da Vinci’s painting “Salvator Mundi,” which fetched a record $450.3 million at auction last month, documents show. The revelation that Prince Bader is the purchaser, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times, links one of the most captivating mysteries of the art world with palace intrigues in Saudi Arabia that are shaking the region. Prince Bader splurged on this controversial and decidedly un-Islamic portrait of Christ at a time when most members of the Saudi elite, including some in the royal family, are cowering under a sweeping crackdown against corruption and self-enrichment. As it happens, Prince Bader is a friend and associate of the leader of the purge: the country’s 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The $450.3 million purchase is the clearest indication yet of the selective nature of the crackdown. The crown prince’s supporters portray him as a reformer, but the campaign of extrajudicial arrests has been unprecedented for modern Saudi Arabia, worrying Western governments about political stability in the world’s largest oil producer, alarming rights advocates and investors about the rule of law, and roiling energy markets. Prince Mohammed’s consolidation of power has upended decades of efforts by previous Saudi rulers to build loyalty and consensus within the royal family. And even before the disclosure of the record-breaking purchase in a New York art auction by one of his associates, Prince Mohammed’s extravagance had already raised eyebrows, most notably with the impulse purchase two years ago in the south of France of a Russian vodka titan’s 440-foot yacht, for half a billion dollars. A spokeswoman for Christie’s, the auction house that sold “Salvator Mundi,” said it did not comment on the identities of any buyers or sellers without their permission. Prince Bader did not respond to a detailed request for comment. But as The Times was pressing for a response on Wednesday, the newly opened branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, tweeted that the painting “is coming to Louvre Abu Dhabi.” The Saudi crown prince is a close ally of his counterpart in Abu Dhabi.

1578,"WASHINGTON — The House on Wednesday easily passed a sweeping expansion of the right to carry concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country, putting the fate of the National Rifle Association’s top legislative priority in the hands of a divided Senate. To win over Democrats, House Republicans paired the measure, which would require all states to recognize any other state’s concealed-carry permit, with a more modest bipartisan fix meant to incentivize better reporting of legal and mental health records to the national background check system. Together, the measures were the first gun-related bill to pass through the chamber since two of the deadliest mass shootings in the United States, in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Tex., in the fall. But the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions. The final House vote was 231 to 198, with six Democrats in favor of and 14 Republicans against the bill. Passage in the Senate would almost certainly require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster, and although several Democrats have expressed support in the past, the climb for the N.R.A. will be steep. "
1579,"President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren make odd antitrust bedfellows. Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, says megadeals like Aetna’s $77 billion sale to CVS could kill competition. She also backs the Justice Department’s fight against an AT&T-Time Warner merger and has concerns about past merger remedies. That puts her in the same camp as the president. She laid out her views on deal making in a speech on Wednesday. AT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, she said, would mean higher prices, fewer choices and worse service for consumers. That echoes Mr. Trump’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, and the Justice Department’s November lawsuit to block the deal, which asserted that the merger would leave millions of television viewers paying more and would slow innovations like video streaming. Ms. Warren also said past concession agreements that allowed certain mergers to go forward had been “epic failures.” That almost feels like a hat tip to Mr. Delrahim, who in a speech last month said past behavioral remedies to address antitrust concerns had not worked out as planned and had been difficult to enforce. He cited Comcast’s takeover of NBCUniversal as an example, adding extra execution risk to vertical mergers in which deal partners don’t directly compete. His tough stance surprised the corporate sector, which had expected easier deal reviews under the Trump administration. It’s also rare for vertical mergers, like AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner, to face court challenges since they are usually approved with conditions. Ms. Warren argued that big vertical deals needed to be viewed as critically as horizontal mergers and said Aetna’s sale to CVS would be a test for antitrust enforcers. It’s unclear whether the Justice Department, which reviews insurance-industry deals, or the Federal Trade Commission, which assesses the pharmaceutical and retail sectors, has jurisdiction over the merger. Ms. Warren did admit she was worried about whether the Justice Department’s AT&T lawsuit was politically motivated given Mr. Trump’s attacks on CNN, which Time Warner owns. She also branded Mr. Delrahim as someone with a “long record” of backing bad mergers. Still, in rare praise of the Trump administration, Ms. Warren said the Justice Department’s move to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal was “a good step.” Such an alliance of convenience puts more pressure on big M&A.

1580,"The art critics of The New York Times Roberta Smith, Holland Cotter and Jason Farago share their picks for the best art of the year. 1. BEST GALLERY SHOW I REGRETTABLY DID NOT REVIEW “Ad Reinhardt: Blue Paintings” at the David Zwirner Gallery, which brought together 28 luminous abstract paintings from this artist’s early-1950s “blue period” — the most ever. With blue fields layered with levitating blocks, or intersecting beams of contrasting blues and sometimes greens or purples, these immersive paintings evoked geometric versions of Monet’s “Water Lilies.” Their joyfulness stood in striking contrast to Reinhardt’s relatively daunting if better-known Black Paintings, which suddenly seem a little pretentious. 2. ANOTHER ONE At Gavin Brown’s Enterprise in Harlem, Rirkrit Tiravanija continued his Johnsian devotion to inventing nothing with a masterpiece: a loving and infinitely touching frame-by-frame re-creation of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1974 film “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul.” The story centers on Emmi, a widowed German cleaning woman, and Ali, a much younger Moroccan migrant worker, whose unlikely romance and marriage elicit every species of bigotry from those around them. The Tiravanija version has an exquisite corpse of a title: “‘skip the bruising of the eskimos to the exquisite words’ vs. ‘if I give you a penny you can give me a pair of scissors.’” It was an in-house job, shot in the gallery in four weeks with a cast consisting almost entirely of artists, friends and employees, on sets that then became part of the exhibition. The stiffness of the amateur acting gave the proceedings an odd clarity, and the random casting unsettled stereotypes, as did giving the leading female roles to men: The Swedish artist Karl Holmqvist played Emmi; Florian Troebinger, the film’s only professional actor, portrayed Barbara, the blond Germanic bar owner and Ali’s sometime lover. In keeping with Mr. Tiravanija’s relational-aesthetics pieces involving the serving of free food, Mr. Troebinger tended the bar throughout the show. As Ali, Hamid Amini, who has worked with this artist on various projects, gave the remake its center of gravity as well as a touch of Hollywood dreamboat. 3. BEST FIRST IMPRESSION “War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Quilts From Military Fabric” at the American Folk Art Museum and its furnace blast of geometric patterns, predominantly in the reds, blacks and yellows of the military fabrics. On view through Jan. 7, it is some of the best abstract art you’ll see this season. "
1581,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — For decades, the idea of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital served as a rare and powerful rallying cry that united the Arab world. Kings and dictators stumped for it, priests and imams prayed for it, jihadists and protesters died for it, and militant groups and political parties campaigned for it — naming their television stations, boulevards and even themselves, after Al Quds, the Arabic name for the holy city. In officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday, President Trump struck what many considered the death blow to those aspirations, handing a major victory to Israel in the perennial struggle between Jews and Arabs for control of the Holy Land. But as Arab and Muslim leaders raised their voices to condemn the move, many across the Middle East wondered if so much had changed in recent years that the real Arab response would amount to little more than a whimper. “ ‘Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine’ joins ‘Palestinian refugees are going back home one day’ in the let’s-hope-it-will-happen-but-it-never-will department,” Mustapha Hamoui, a Lebanese blogger, wrote in a rueful tweet. "
1582,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump formally announced the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, saying it would advance the peace process. Mr. Trump asserted that the U.S. would remain a neutral broker in the effort, but offered little solace to the Palestinians. But the decision has drawn a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, and Pope Francis and China joined the chorus of voices warning that the move could stir unrest across the region. The leader of Hamas called it “an unaccountable gamble.” This video explains why Jerusalem is so contested. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a NATO conference that Mr. Trump was “very committed” to peace in the Middle East. _____ • Time Magazine named “the silence breakers” its person of the year for 2017, honoring the women who came forward to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment, and the global conversation they have started.

1583,"To the Editor: Re “Does Mr. Trump Want Mideast Peace?” (editorial, Dec. 6): The world does not get to choose a nation’s capital. That is the right of the sovereign nation. Instead of focusing on Israel’s capital, the world needs to focus on Palestinian incitement to violence and the Palestinians’ refusal to recognize Israel’s right to exist. When Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered the Palestinians 93 percent of the West Bank and a piece of Jerusalem as their capital in 2008, the Arabs rejected the plan. Why? Because it allowed Israel to continue its existence. Once the Palestinians deal with the reality that Israel exists, that it has a right to exist and that Jerusalem is its capital, perhaps President Mahmoud Abbas can start real negotiations for the benefit of his people, as President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt did 38 years ago. HOWARD B. WEBER, NEW YORK The writer is president of the Coalition for Israel. To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Pledge Over Jerusalem Rattles Mideast” (front page, Dec. 6): When you are unencumbered by history, advice and empathy, you get to make quick decisions that have a monumental effect on a part of the world that can erupt at any time. You get to make those decisions because it suits your short-term political desires. Surely, Mr. President, you have made life more dangerous for your military and your diplomats in the region. Why decide to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel with a vague promise to move our embassy there? Did you receive anything of value in return? Did you get a promise of movement toward peace in the region? We know what you received. You got a chance to change the headline from your continuing troubles for 24 hours. If your decision results in violence against Americans, your short-term decision will result in lifelong pain for the Americans you swore to protect. ELLIOTT MILLER, BALA CYNWYD, PA. "
1584,"I’m contemplating writing a book on the first year of President Trump’s foreign policy, and I already know the name: “The Art of the Giveaway.” In nearly 30 years of covering United States foreign policy, I’ve never seen a president give up so much to so many for so little, starting with China and Israel. In both the Middle Kingdom and in the Land of Israel, Christmas came early this year. The Chinese and the Jews are both whispering to their kids: “There really is a Santa Claus.” And his name is Donald Trump. Who can blame them? Let’s start with Israel. Every Israeli government since its founding has craved United States recognition of Jerusalem as its capital. And every United States government has refrained from doing that, arguing that such a recognition should come only in the wake of an agreed final status peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians — until now. Today, Trump just gave it away — for free. Such a deal! Why in the world would you just give this away for free and not even use it as a lever to advance the prospect of an Israeli-Palestinian deal? Trump could have said two things to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. First, he could have said: “Bibi, you keep asking me to declare Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. O.K., I will do that. But I want a deal. Here’s what I want from you in return: You will declare an end to all Israeli settlement building in the West Bank, outside of the existing settlement bloc that everyone expects to be part of Israel in any two-state solution.” Such a trade-off is needed. It would produce a real advance for United States interests and for the peace process. As Dennis Ross, the veteran American Middle East peace negotiator and author of “Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.-Israeli Relationship From Truman to Obama,” explained: “When you stop building outside the settlement blocs, you preserve, at a maximum, the possibility of a two-state outcome and, at a minimum, the ability for Israelis to separate from Palestinians. Keep up the building in densely populated Palestinian areas and separation becomes impossible.” "
1585,"To the Editor: Re “Trump Won, but Lost His Agenda,” by Henry Olsen (Op-Ed, Nov. 21): What happened to Donald Trump’s populist agenda? Simple: He never had one. It was a scam to get elected. And it worked. Mr. Trump, as president, is continuing to do what he has done his whole life: Make rich people like him even richer. Expecting anything else is simply wishful thinking. JEREMY KAPLAN, BROOKLYN "
1586,"Ann Marie Buerkle, a commissioner at the federal agency charged with protecting consumers from hazardous toys and products, has seldom voted for a mandatory recall, a maximum fine or a tougher safety standard. In more than four years on the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Ms. Buerkle has opposed limiting dangerous carbon monoxide emissions in portable generators; resisted requiring safety technology on table saws; and disagreed with the other Republican commissioner on the five-member board by rejecting fines against companies that delayed reporting hazards to the agency, as required by law. As President Trump’s nominee to head the agency, she is drawing criticism for her positions. Like some Trump administration officials, Ms. Buerkle is an unabashed supporter of voluntary regulations, and believes that collaboration with manufacturers, rather than levying fines or imposing recalls, is the fastest way to get dangerous products off the market. “My top goal, of course, is safety,” said Ms. Buerkle, the agency’s acting chairwoman, in an interview. But she elaborated that in her view, the agency had become too emotionally reactive under the Obama administration. “The agency is supposed to be data-driven and science-driven,” she said. “It’s not supposed to be emotional.” A 66-year-old former nurse, lawyer and member of Congress, Ms. Buerkle is very likely to be confirmed soon by the Republican-controlled Senate, but her record has spurred opposition from Democrats and some consumer advocates. The Senate will also vote on another Trump nominee for the agency, Dana Baiocco, who has long worked as a lawyer defending companies against liability claims. The emergence of Ms. Buerkle, Ms. Baiocco, and the newly appointed general counsel, Patricia Hanz, in leadership roles represents a major shift in the tiny agency, which had in recent years taken a tougher stance against companies manufacturing toxic toys, flammable pajamas, exploding batteries and other household hazards. "
1587,"Classical music critics and writers of The New York Times share their picks for the best of the year. On Jan. 20, the day President Trump was inaugurated, the outspoken conductor Daniel Barenboim seized the moment to argue for the importance of culture and community at a time of bitter divisiveness. The occasion was the second of Mr. Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin’s sweeping survey of Bruckner’s nine symphonies at Carnegie Hall. After leading a magnificent account of Bruckner’s Second, Mr. Barenboim spoke to the audience to defend classical music from charges of elitism. Concerts like this one, he said, can bring audiences and musicians from around the world together as “one community” in an act of “human communication.” Referring to the events that day in Washington, he emphasized that America, of all countries, has “the possibility” to “make the world great!” The audience applauded vigorously. Here was a musician who has long channeled social ideals into artistic action, drawing explicit links between a Bruckner cycle and today’s roiling political issues. But I was struck all year by how many performances — challenging new works as well as repertory pieces we may take for granted — spoke to our fractious times. ANTHONY TOMMASINI ‘THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL’ Last year, I included the world premiere at the Salzburg Festival of Thomas Adès’s audacious opera, adapted from Luis Buñuel’s surreal 1962 film, on my list of favorite performances. I’m choosing it again this year, after the Metropolitan Opera presented the American premiere in October with an impressive cast and Mr. Adès conducting. The opera’s themes felt chillingly pertinent: In the plot, the guests at a fashionable dinner party find themselves psychologically trapped in the salon of their wealthy hosts. Some force — internal, imposed or both — seems to be sapping their will to act. There were eerie parallels between these panicked members of the ruling class and the elected officials in Washington who can sometimes seem frozen in deciding how, and even whether, to stand up to a norm-shattering administration. "
1588,"The N.F.L. on Wednesday extended the contract of Commissioner Roger Goodell for another five years, ending an unusually rancorous monthslong standoff with Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys’ owner, who wanted to derail the deal. A committee of owners negotiating Goodell’s compensation signed off on a contract worth roughly $200 million over five years, which is in line with his current deal. But unlike his current arrangement, nearly 90 percent of the potential compensation will be paid only if a variety of financial targets are met. The N.F.L. and its commissioner routinely negotiate such matters behind closed doors. But this year, disorder among owners spilled out in public, leading to an extraordinary tit-for-tat of threats of legal action and rebukes that added to the sense of a league anxious over its future. Despite declining television ratings, persistent worries about the safety of the game and a backlash against the league because of players protesting during the national anthem, the league is still a financial juggernaut, with $14 billion in annual revenue. That is a big reason the owners are comfortable keeping Goodell — who became commissioner in 2006 — on for another five years. But with anxiety over the league’s weaknesses growing, Jones and other owners wanted to ensure Goodell continued to focus on growing the league’s business. As a result, they have insisted that most of his compensation in the coming years be based on the N.F.L. hitting financial targets, with various owners signing off on bonuses linked to the targets. Goodell’s guaranteed salary before those potential bonuses will be about $4 million a year. In a letter sent to every owner on Wednesday, Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the committee, said that Goodell’s contract extension was “fully consistent with ‘market’ compensation” and was “in the best interests of ownership.” Contrary to Jones’s efforts to undermine the deal, Blank said there was nearly a consensus to offer Goodell an extension and to move quickly “to avoid further controversy surrounding this issue.” "
1589,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has decided that the National Security Agency and the F.B.I. can lawfully keep operating their warrantless surveillance program even if Congress fails to extend the law authorizing it before an expiration date of New Year’s Eve, according to American officials. National security officials have implored Congress for the past year and a half to extend the legal basis for the program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, before it lapses at the end of the month. They portrayed such a bill as the “top legislative priority” for keeping the country safe. But with Congress focused on passing a major tax cut and divided over what changes, if any, to make to the surveillance program, lawmakers may miss that deadline. Hedging against that risk, executive branch lawyers have now concluded that the government could lawfully continue to spy under the program through late April without new legislation. Intelligence officials nonetheless remain intent on getting lawmakers to pass a durable extension of Section 702 by the end of the month — warning that even a stopgap short-term extension of several months, as some lawmakers have proposed, would risk throwing the program into a crisis in the spring. “We fully expect Congress to reauthorize this critical statute by the end of the year,” said Brian Hale, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “Not doing so would be unthinkable in light of the considerable value Section 702 provides in protecting the nation.” The expiring law grew out of the Bush administration’s once-secret Stellarwind warrantless surveillance program after the Sept. 11 attacks. After it came to light, Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to legalize a form of the program. "
1590,"The journalist and author of “People Who Eat Darkness” and, most recently, “Ghosts of the Tsunami” avoids “lad lit” even more assiduously than he avoids “chick lit.” What books are on your nightstand? The books beside my bed are like the expensive, and suspiciously unsullied, pair of running shoes in the cupboard: an aspiration, and a symbol of the man I would like to be rather than the one I truly am. I’ve got the “Collected Poems” of W. B. Yeats and Ted Hughes, both of which I did in fact read a good deal of over the summer. I’ve got “Asia’s Reckoning: The Struggle for Global Dominance,” by Richard McGregor, which I hear great things about. “Quennets,” by Philip Terry, is a book of experimental poetry, purchased in a fit of avant-garde fervour that I will no doubt get round to one of these decades. Right at the bottom of the pile is “Ulysses,” by James Joyce. I know, I know … I read it at university, and then got halfway through it again in my 30s. And then stopped. For a while, I kept it in the loo, with the idea that I would read it in short, but regular, doses. It’s been in its current position for a few years. What’s the last great book you read? There are Great Books, and then there are great books. My last Great Book was “Nostromo,” by Joseph Conrad, which is admirable in all kinds of ways, but not as great as “Austerlitz,” by W. G. Sebald, which I seem to reread every two years. Which writers — novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets — working today do you admire most? Like many male British writers my age, I am engaged in a grotesque Oedipal struggle with Martin Amis. His new collection of journalism, “The Rub of Time,” produced the usual reaction in me: intense, fawning admiration for his wit and verve, interspersed with bursts of contemptuous irritation at some pomposity or other. Annoyingly, for a part-time dabbler, he is one the finest writers of nonfiction in English. "
1591,"WASHINGTON — Former Gov. Phil Bredesen, the last Democrat to win statewide office in Tennessee, announced on Thursday that he would run for the seat being vacated by Senator Bob Corker, handing his party a conceivable, if extremely narrow, path back to a Senate majority in 2018. Mr. Bredesen, a wealthy business executive and two-term governor who swept every county in the state in his 2006 re-election bid, was aggressively courted by Senate Democrats, who have been eyeing any potential openings in a year that features a forbidding map for the party. Democrats are defending 25 Senate seats next year, 10 of them in states that President Trump won. But if Mr. Bredesen can mount a strong campaign, Tennessee would join Nevada and Arizona as states where Republican-held Senate seats could be in jeopardy. Republicans currently have a two-seat majority. A win by Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the Alabama special election on Tuesday would provide a wider path to the majority. Mr. Bredesen, 74, declared his candidacy with a web video that illustrated why he could prove a formidable candidate but also why he faces a bruising campaign that could prove the most expensive in state history.

While some American Jewish leaders welcomed the announcement, many worried that it could make peace in the Middle East even harder to achieve. Some in the region expect reactions to be muted as the Palestinian cause, once a rallying cry for Arab unity, has been overshadowed by the wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and the contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional dominance. _____ "
1593,"In these dark, chaotic times, it would not be unrealistic for someone, when asked what color will represent 2018, to look around and guess, say, black. Or maybe deep, bloody burgundy. Wartime red? Fake-tan orange? At the very least, soot gray. Any of them would seemingly match different shades of the general mood. And yet the self-proclaimed “color authorities” at Pantone sent approximately 10 people to blanket the globe for weeks at a time last year, searching for color signals in food, cars, cosmetics, clothes and housewares. They reconvened, pooled their findings, did their analysis and declared the color of 2018 to be … Ultra Violet. Huh? Yup, the highlighter-purple shade that has also been the name of a Warhol superstar who died in 2014; a 2006 dystopian action film starring Milla Jovovich as a rebel infected with a vampiric virus; an online activist community founded in 2012 to combat sexism and violence toward women; and a kind of light that can cause skin cancer (ahem). Those things may not be exactly what you think about when you think about what’s coming, but the history does demonstrate that the idea has a broad reach. Ultra Violet can be many things to many people. It “communicates originality, ingenuity and visionary thinking,” Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said by way of explanation. It is found in the cosmos (think of all those swirling purple nebulae!), the wellness movement (amethyst crystals!) and was a favorite color of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who, Ms. Eiseman said, used to wear a purple cape when he was trying to be creative. Ditto Wagner, who liked to surround himself with purple when he was composing. Also, of course, Prince. "

1596,"Barack Obama is not the subject of “Quest,” Jonathan Olshefski’s new documentary, an intimate and patient portrait of a North Philadelphia family. But the film, which begins and ends with presidential elections — Mr. Obama’s in 2008 and his successor’s eight years later — is shadowed, in some ways haunted, by his presence and his temperament. At one point, he appears on television, in the wake of the massacre of school children and their teachers in Newtown, Conn. “These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods,” he says, referring to the places that have been devastated by gun violence. “These children are our children.” The simple inclusiveness of that idea and the feeling behind it — the sense that this nation, with all of its troubles, is something we’re all in together — may sound especially poignant now, and even a bit quaint. But a similar ethic of solidarity informs every moment of “Quest,” which brings us into the neighborhood and the home of Christopher and Christine’a Rainey and their teenage daughter, PJ. Christopher is also known as Quest, which is the name of the recording studio where he sits behind the mixing boards as local rappers spit their rhymes. Christine’a is Ma Quest, and the two of them, without vanity or any expectation of praise or reward, serve as mentors, confidants and semi-parental figures for the people around them. Mr. Rainey wakes up at dawn to deliver coupon circulars door to door. His wife works long hours at a shelter for survivors of domestic violence. If you lived in North Philly, you would want to know them. “Quest” offers the gift of imagining that you do, even as it honors their complicated, sometimes opaque individuality. Mr. Olshefski doesn’t pry too intrusively into their lives. He and his crew record only what the Raineys are willing to tell and show, and a story takes shape in response to events in their lives. Time flows like a current rather than advancing steadily according to the calendar or the clock. Mr. Obama’s first term passes in the blink of an eye. Before you know it, PJ and her father are talking about Mitt Romney as the 2012 election draws near. Politics is part of their world, and some of the issues that have recently galvanized public debate — health care, addiction, crime, tensions between the police and African-American citizens — figure prominently in “Quest.” Gun violence affects the Raineys with direct and traumatic force, disrupting the film’s calm, contemplative rhythm. (There’s another, blessedly benign twist later on.) The disaster that strikes them is upsetting, and the stoicism with which they keep going is at least equally moving. "

1599,"Almost a year ago, after heavy criticism from President-elect Donald J. Trump, Ford Motor Company canceled plans to build a $1.6 billion car plant in Mexico and announced that it would instead equip a Michigan factory to make electric and hybrid models. Now the automaker is changing its plans again, saying it intends to assemble new battery-powered cars in Mexico, not Michigan. But the Michigan location will get an even larger investment than previously planned and will focus on making a range of self-driving cars. The switch comes as the Trump administration has been pushing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Few industries are more heavily affected by the accord than the auto sector, which has rushed to build plants in Mexico over the last several years to take advantage of lower labor costs and that country’s extensive network of trade agreements. Late last month, Vice President Mike Pence met with top executives from Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler to discuss trade and the renegotiation effort. Automakers have been concerned that changes to the trade accord, such as rules requiring the use of more American-made parts, could raise the cost of vehicles produced in Mexican plants and hurt the value of the plants they have built. Sherif Marakby, Ford’s vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification, said Thursday that the company had altered its plans for the Michigan plant — in Flat Rock, 25 miles southwest of Detroit — because it now expected the market for self-driving cars for taxis and delivery fleets to grow rapidly after it rolls out its first model in 2021.

And no wonder: The baker’s position that no law can force him to lend his “art” to a use to which he objects — celebrating a same-sex wedding — would, if accepted, invite a flood of “I would prefer not to” opt-outs from anti-discrimination laws meant to apply to all. Another free speech case on the Supreme Court’s calendar with equally profound implications hasn’t yet caught the public’s eye, even though it is likely to be the only abortion-related case on the court’s docket this term. The justices accepted the case, National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra three weeks ago, and will hear it this winter. Just as Masterpiece Cakeshop is about far more than bakers and their creative expression, this case transcends the subject of abortion. The First Amendment question it presents is doctrinally complex but can fairly be boiled down to this: when is it unconstitutional to require an entity that deals with the public to tell its customers the truth? At issue are requirements that a 2015 California law imposes on “crisis pregnancy centers,” described in the legislative record as places that “pose as full-service women’s health clinics, but aim to discourage and prevent women from seeking abortions” through “intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices.” These centers exist all over the country, and in many states are more numerous than actual abortion clinics. Women find their way to them by looking up “abortion” in the telephone book or by responding to ads on mass transit (“Pregnant? Need help?”). California has some 200 of them, most, like those that sued the state in this case, run by organizations with religious-based opposition to abortion. The main plaintiff, known as Nifla for short, is a Virginia-based national organization that describes its mission as to “empower the choice for life.” It operates 111 pregnancy centers in California alone, of which most are licensed medical clinics and the rest are unlicensed offices that provide self-administered pregnancy tests, referrals to doctors for prenatal care, and free baby supplies such as diapers. "
1602,"Given the triumph of contemporary conservatism, it may be time for liberals to take a look at the vulnerabilities of their own orthodoxies. Democrats who yearn for President Trump to be taken down should examine this list of Republican strengths: victories in all three contested special elections for the House of Representatives this year; Trump’s 82 percent approval rating among Republican voters; his success with the current tax bill; his swift evisceration of key regulatory policies; the Gorsuch appointment to the Supreme Court; economic growth of over 3 percent in the last two quarters; the Dow Jones topping 24,000; and the unemployment rate dropping to 4.1 percent. For the moment, the left is both stunned and infuriated by the vehement animosity it faces from red America, which is made up of counties that are 84 percent less dense than blue America, 37 percent less racially and ethnically diverse, and 34 percent more white. Voters in red America are 44 percent less likely to be college graduates and 22 percent more likely to have served in the armed forces. Geographically speaking, red counties are virtually nonexistent on the West Coast and on the East Coast north of the Mason-Dixon line. Many Democrats continue to have little understanding of their own role — often inadvertent, an unintended consequence of well-meaning behavior — in creating the conditions that make conservatives willing to support Trump and the party he is leading. I asked Karen Stenner, the author of “The Authoritarian Dynamic” and no fan of the president, for her explanation of the political dynamic in the current struggle between left and right. She emailed back: In fact, Stenner argues, these values are the subject of intense debate. They lie at the core of what divides America: Not only are the values that the left takes for granted heatedly disputed in many sections of the country, the way many Democratic partisans assert that their values supplant or transcend traditional beliefs serves to mobilize the right. "
1603,"President Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration is making a radical break with nearly 70 years of official United States policy and with the international community: He is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. This decision will be interpreted by Palestinians, Arabs and the rest of the world as a major provocation. It will cause irreparable harm to Mr. Trump’s own plans to make peace in the Middle East, and to any future administration’s efforts, as well. It will also undermine the United States’ own national security. The president should reconsider this decision immediately. Since Israel was established in 1948, the United Nations and the United States, like most countries, have refused to recognize any country’s sovereignty over Jerusalem, a city holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians. For this reason, the United States has always maintained its embassy to Israel in Tel Aviv. Since Israel militarily occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the United States and the international community have rejected as illegal Israel’s attempts to cement its control over the city by expanding its boundaries, annexing it and constructing a ring of settlements on occupied Palestinian land around its outskirts to sever it from the rest of the West Bank. With his announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump has legitimized Israel’s illegal actions and sent the message that the United States no longer has any regard for international conventions or norms, and that might and power prevail over justice and the law. "
1604,"This is the text of the keynote speech delivered on receipt of an honorary doctorate at Yeshiva University’s annual Hanukkah dinner in New York on Sunday. Thank you for the honor you do me with this degree. I’d like to think that somewhere in the great upstairs my rabbinical forbears from Vilna are smiling on this occasion. My topic this evening concerns the future of the United States — or, as some of my more pessimistic friends in the Never Trump camp are prone to frame the question: “What future?” It is prompted by the reflection that tonight is this 93rd year for this event, and thus by a sense of curiosity about where the world might be 93 years hence. I hope that my youngest child will have just celebrated her 101st birthday. And I predict the Jets will be no closer to winning a Super Bowl. What about the rest of America? Suppose it’s the year 2110, and a history professor at Yeshiva’s Business School is asking her students to name the inventions or innovations that defined the economic terms of the 21st century, much in the way that airplanes, the Model-T, and penicillin defined the 20th century, or the steam engine and locomotive defined the 19th. "
1605,"WASHINGTON — Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., defended his work force on Thursday in a politically charged hearing on Capitol Hill, rebutting President Trump’s accusation that the bureau was in “tatters” and fending off attacks from Republicans on personnel. The unusual scenario — the nation’s top law enforcement official pressed by normally deferential Republican lawmakers — was a reflection of the extreme partisanship that has taken hold in Washington. The F.B.I., whose leadership and agents have long seen it as an apolitical institution, has been thrust into the political maelstrom repeatedly over the past two years. Mr. Wray, who became director in August, remained unflappable during his first appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, touting the work of the F.B.I.’s nearly 37,000 employees. “There is no finer institution than the F.B.I. and no finer people than the men and women who work there,” he said. Mr. Wray was pressed by Republicans on the political leanings of F.B.I. agents and Justice Department prosecutors. Lawmakers tried to cast doubt on the impartiality of the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, noting that prosecutors on his team donated to Democrats. They also repeatedly brought up Peter Strzok, an F.B.I. agent who was removed from Mr. Mueller’s staff because of potentially anti-Trump text messages he traded with another person on the team. Mr. Strzok was also a key member of the F.B.I. team that investigated whether Hillary Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information. According to F.B.I. documents, he interviewed Mrs. Clinton. "
1606,"WASHINGTON — Congress approved a two-week stopgap measure on Thursday that will avoid a government shutdown this weekend, pushing until just before Christmas a broader possible showdown over spending priorities, immigration and health care. The measure, which the House and Senate passed in quick succession, would fund the government through Dec. 22. President Trump is expected to sign it. “Along with enacting historic tax reform, we’ll be working together in the next two weeks to find a long-term solution to our funding needs while maintaining fiscal discipline,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. The approval came as congressional leaders from both parties met with Mr. Trump at the White House to talk about the thicket of issues facing lawmakers as the end of the year approaches. In negotiations this month, Democrats plan to press to shield from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has pledged to support the passage of bipartisan legislation intended to stabilize health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers also want to provide tens of billions of dollars in response to this year’s hurricanes and wildfires, and they need to provide funds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, whose financing lapsed at the end of September. "
1607,"John Lewis, the civil rights leader and Democratic congressman from Georgia, said Thursday that he would not attend opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum this weekend because President Trump would be there. In a joint statement, Mr. Lewis and Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said Mr. Trump’s presence at the event would be disrespectful to the memory of those who participated in the struggle for civil rights, particularly in light of his “disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants and National Football League players.” They encouraged people to visit the museum “after President Trump departs.” “President Trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,” the statement said. “The struggles represented in this museum exemplify the truth of what really happened in Mississippi.” In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Mr. Lewis said that he might attend the event in Jackson, Miss., if Mr. Trump did not. “Right now we’re not going,” said Mr. Lewis, who was badly beaten by the police while marching from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that it was “unfortunate” that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Thompson would not “join the President in honoring the incredible sacrifice civil rights leaders made to right the injustices in our history.” "
1608,"President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel not only upends decades of American policy. It also appears to put the United States at odds with the United Nations Security Council. The 15-member council has adopted a number of resolutions, dating back 50 years, aimed in part at preventing Israel from claiming sovereignty over all of the holy city. That could make for awkward diplomatic dynamics on the council, where none of the other members share Mr. Trump’s position on Jerusalem. Eight members, including Britain, France and Italy, allies of the United States, have called for an emergency meeting of the council on Friday to discuss Mr. Trump’s declaration. Many supporters of Israel have long accused the United Nations of bias against it, a criticism that the United States ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, has echoed and vowed to change. As Israel’s strongest ally at the United Nations, the United States often has used its veto power to block Security Council resolutions critical of Israel. But there have been exceptions, including for resolutions concerning the status of Jerusalem. "

he end of the year at The New York Times usually means a rush of big, ambitious stories — and don’t miss this examination of Harvey Weinstein’s complicity machine, detailing all the people who knew about his behavior and did nothing, or helped hide it. But this week, I’m counterprogramming with a newsletter of (mostly) bite-size thoughts. 1. Two of Australia’s biggest stories this year — same-sex marriage, and China’s influence on politics — reached their expected conclusions this week. As you no doubt know, Parliament changed the definition of marriage, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull proposed new laws that would limit foreign interference. What stood out to me? Consensus. At a time when democracy around the world often looks meek or messy, Canberra managed to look this week like a capital populated with reasonable adults. Bravo, folks, bravo. 2. I watched “Animal Kingdom” this week, on the recommendation of a friend who works in Australian film. "
1610,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s harsh criticism of the F.B.I. elicited a rare and impassioned defense on Thursday from its director, Christopher A. Wray, even as he noted “no shortage of opinions out there” about the bureau. Mr. Wray’s comments to the House Judiciary Committee may as well have described Mr. Trump’s own shifting stances on the F.B.I., C.I.A. and other federal agencies that do intelligence and law enforcement work. A review of Mr. Trump’s comments during and after the 2016 presidential campaign reveals his eagerness to praise them when they investigate his opponents. He is quick to rebuke them, however, when their actions do not align with his interests. Presidents normally refrain from commenting on or interfering with law enforcement investigations or intelligence analyses to avoid being seen as politicizing them. Most recently, Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday that the F.B.I.’s “reputation is in Tatters — worst in History!” following last week’s guilty plea by Michael T. Flynn, the former White House national security adviser, for lying to investigators. Mr. Trump also suggested, falsely, that the F.B.I. refused to charge Hillary Clinton for lying — a claim its former director, James B. Comey, has refuted multiple times. "
1611,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “It felt like the whole world was burning down.” That’s how our Los Angeles reporters describe the wind-driven wildfires that have scorched 116,000 acres across Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Schools are closed, roadways are shut and nearly 200,000 people have been told to evacuate. Winds are strengthening, and none of the fires are close to being contained. Here’s the latest. This video examines how recent weather, climate change and rapid development have made California’s fire season so brutal this year. Our California Today newsletter will have detailed updates in the morning. _____ 2. “I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.” "
1612,"WASHINGTON — The Republican tax bills moving through Congress could significantly hobble the United States’ renewable energy industry because of a series of provisions that scale back incentives for wind and solar power while bolstering older energy sources like oil and gas production. The possibility highlights the degree to which the nation’s recent surge in renewable electricity generation is still sustained by favorable tax treatment, which has lowered the cost of solar and wind production while provoking the ire of fossil-fuel competitors seeking to weaken those tax preferences. Whether lawmakers choose to protect or jettison various renewable tax breaks in the final bill being negotiated on Capitol Hill could have major ramifications for the United States energy landscape, including the prices consumers pay for electricity. Wind and solar are two of the fastest-growing sources of power in the country, providing 7 percent of  electricity last year. Sharp declines in the cost of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels, coupled with generous tax credits that can offset at least 30 percent of project costs, have made new wind and solar even cheaper than  running existing fossil-fuel plants in parts of the country. In different ways, direct and indirect, the House and Senate bills each imperil elements of that ascension. A Senate bill provision intended to stop multinational companies from shifting profits overseas could unexpectedly cripple a key financing tool used by the renewable energy industry, particularly solar, by eroding the value of tax credits that banks and other financial institutions buy from energy companies. The House bill’s effects would be more direct, rolling back tax credits for wind farms and electric vehicles, while increasing federal support for two nuclear reactors under construction in Georgia. Fossil fuel producers are under little pressure in either bill and some would stand to benefit: The Senate legislation would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling, while a last-minute amendment added by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, would allow oil and gas companies to receive lower tax rates on their profits. "
1613,"The world took a significant step toward averting future financial meltdowns Thursday, just as the United States under President Trump begins relaxing constraints on risky behavior by banks. A group of global central bank governors and bank regulators, meeting in Frankfurt, signed off on the last chapter of a banking rule book they began writing after the financial crisis began in 2008. The rules are intended to prevent the kind of mischief by banks that triggered the last meltdown, causing millions of people to lose their homes and jobs. The rules are the capstone of years of grindingly detailed work by the so-called Basel Committee. Known as Basel III, the rules require banks to reduce their dependence on borrowed money so they are less susceptible to losses from bad loans, market turmoil or other problems. “It’s a great day,” Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference. But he acknowledged that the agreement was not perfect. “This is a compromise,” Mr. Draghi said. The rules will make the banking system more resilient, he added, but “nothing is crisis proof.” The negotiators were unable, for example, to reach agreement on a way to address one of the root causes of the government debt crisis that nearly destroyed the eurozone a few years ago. "
1614,"WASHINGTON — Representative Trent Franks of Arizona, one of the House’s most ardent social conservatives, said Thursday night that he would resign after the House Ethics Committee began an investigation into complaints that he had asked two female staff members to be a surrogate to bear his child. In a statement, Mr. Franks said the discussion about surrogacy came up with “two previous female subordinates” because he and his wife, who have struggled with fertility, wanted to have a child. He said he regretted that the conversations had “caused distress.” “Due to my familiarity and experience with the process of surrogacy, I clearly became insensitive as to how the discussion of such an intensely personal topic might affect others,” Mr. Franks said. Mr. Franks denied that he had ever “physically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.” His statement said only that he deeply regretted discussing the topic of surrogacy, but a Republican familiar with the accusation said that Mr. Frank had specifically asked those aides to be surrogates. Speaker Paul D. Ryan was briefed a week ago on “credible claims of misconduct” and presented them to Mr. Franks, according to a separate statement from his office. When the congressman did not deny them, the speaker referred the matter to the Ethics Committee and told him to resign. Mr. Ryan’s statement did not detail the behavior in question. "
1615,"All but two of 11 former United States ambassadors to Israel contacted by The New York Times after President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital thought the plan was wrongheaded, dangerous or deeply flawed. The 11 ex-envoys all closely followed Mr. Trump’s announcement on Wednesday, in which he also set in motion a plan to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Even those who agreed that Mr. Trump was recognizing the reality on the ground disagreed with his approach — making a major diplomatic concession without any evident gain in return. One of the exceptions was Ogden R. Reid, a former congressman who was the ambassador from 1959 to 1961, at the end of the Eisenhower administration. “I think it’s the right decision,” he said. “Not a lot more to say.” The other exception was Edward S. Walker Jr., who was ambassador from 1997 to 1999, under President Bill Clinton. “I think it’s about time,” he said. “We’ve been remiss in not recognizing realities as they are. We all know Israel has a capital, it’s called Jerusalem, and over my 35 years of service in the Middle East no one ever questioned that.” What about the departure from United States policy since 1948 — that the final status of Jerusalem is a matter for negotiation between the Israelis and Palestinians — and the condemnation from the international community? “It’s really a question of what are the lines, the borders, to be drawn around the state of Israel and the ultimate state of Palestine,” Mr. Walker said. “Nothing in what the president has said precludes the negotiation of a settlement of this issue.” "
1616,"From the start, Lena Dunham and Hillary Clinton were something of an odd match. The millennial daughter of New York privilege known for her audacious public presence and frequent nudity on her HBO show, “Girls.” And the baby boomer raised with a steely Midwestern reserve, a devotion to her Methodist faith and a fierce affinity for a “zone of privacy.” But early on in a presidential election unlike any other, Ms. Dunham and Mrs. Clinton became a kind of package deal, with the campaign scrambling to reach young women and dispatching Ms. Dunham as one of its most visible ambassadors. On Tuesday, the generational tensions that hummed beneath the alliance during the presidential campaign exploded into public view. The rift came as a result of comments made by Ms. Dunham for an article published in The New York Times on Tuesday about the film mogul Harvey Weinstein and how he used a network of lawyers, publicists and journalists to protect his reputation and, in some cases, enable the sexual aggression of which he is accused. In the article, Ms. Dunham said she had warned two Clinton campaign officials against associating with Mr. Weinstein. “I just want you to know that Harvey’s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,” Ms. Dunham said she told the campaign. In reply to Ms. Dunham’s comments, Nick Merrill, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton, said, “As to claims about a warning, that’s something staff wouldn’t forget.” Ms. Dunham’s prominence in the Clinton campaign made her comments particularly resonant. Mrs. Clinton leaned on Ms. Dunham’s support so heavily that the actress and writer was awarded a prime speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (“Hi, I’m Lena Dunham and according to Donald Trump, my body is probably, like, a 2.”) "
1617,"Let me ask you a question; take your time in answering it. Would you be willing to take health care away from a thousand children with the bad luck to have been born into low-income families so that you could give millions of extra dollars to just one wealthy heir? You might think that this question is silly, hypothetical and has an obvious answer. But it’s not at all hypothetical, and the answer apparently isn’t obvious. For it’s a literal description of the choice Republicans in Congress seem to be making as you read this. The Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, is basically a piece of Medicaid targeted on young Americans. It was introduced in 1997, with bipartisan support. Last year it covered 8.9 million kids. But its funding expired more than two months ago. Republicans keep saying they’ll restore the money, but they keep finding reasons not to do it; state governments, which administer the program, will soon have to start cutting children off. What’s the problem? The other day Senator Orrin Hatch, asked about the program (which he helped create), once again insisted that it will be funded — but without saying when or how (and there don’t seem to be any signs of movement on the issue). And he further declared, “The reason CHIP’s having trouble is that we don’t have money anymore.” Then he voted for an immense tax cut. And one piece of that immense tax cut is a big giveaway to inheritors of large estates. Under current law, a married couple’s estate pays no tax unless it’s worth more than $11 million, so that only a handful of estates — around 5,500, or less than 0.2 percent of the total number of deaths a year — owe any tax at all. The number of taxable estates is also, by the way, well under one one-thousandth of the number of children covered by CHIP. But Republicans still consider this tax an unacceptable burden on the rich. The Senate bill would double the exemption to $22 million; the House bill would eliminate the estate tax entirely. "
1618,"To keep its graduate students from unionizing, Harvard is pushing the government to weaken important protections for workers across the United States. That’s not how the university puts it, of course. But as law students who came to Harvard to study labor, we are alarmed by the implications of the anti-organizing tactics the school is using against its students. The institution is poised to hobble unions far beyond our Cambridge campus. As teaching and research assistants at other universities have done, many graduate students at Harvard seek access to collective bargaining. They want basic protections like access to better pay, an independent grievance procedure for sexual harassment cases and adequate health care. Harvard is not unlike other elite institutions that oppose graduate student unionization attempts, but its current legal strategy poses a threat to workers inside and outside the academy. To understand how the university could gut workers’ rights, it’s important to explain the importance of what is called, in labor law, the “Excelsior list.” Workers across many industries can vote for union representation if 30 percent of employees want it. The workers can choose a union for representation and then file for an election, and all eligible employees have a right to vote on whether to unionize or not. In the past, during the lead-up to a unionization vote, employers could easily make their case against unionization but hopeful unions had no way of ensuring that all potential voters knew about the organizing campaign. In 1966 the National Labor Relations Board decided that this issue for workers — specifically, a “lack of information with respect to one of the choices available” — impeded their free choice in voting. The board declared that employers must provide unions with a master list of their employees, an Excelsior list, to ensure that union supporters could make their case to everyone before the election. "
1619,"While President Trump has followed in few of his predecessors’ footsteps, his administration has done the expected in at least one respect: It has undertaken a Middle East peace initiative in its first year. Most recent administrations have done the same, and all have failed. Will Mr. Trump do any better? The specifics of the initiative are still being hammered out, but some elements are clear. Most administrations start with modest proposals to build trust between the parties and then, when these efforts have bred mutual suspicion and disappointment, they propose a framework for an agreement just as the process moves toward collapse. Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, the chief negotiator, have done the reverse, hinting that Washington will lay down the principles of an agreement at the outset of talks, but without imposing them on either party. A two-state solution might not be in the cards. While talks toward a plan move forward, the administration will undertake a series of confidence-building measures; these might include a Palestinian pledge to resume security cooperation with Israel in return for the transfer of a bit of land to the Palestinian Authority, a limited settlement freeze and economic aid for West Bank Palestinians. This is standard fare. Mr. Trump will also try to regionalize the process. In exchange for Israeli flexibility, Arab countries in the Sunni coalition — notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — would extend privileges that Israel has long coveted, including overflight and perhaps some sort of diplomatic status, and offer lavish funding to prop up the Palestinian entity that signs an agreement with Israel. The Obama administration attempted to elicit Saudi involvement, too, but King Abdullah rejected its proposal. As the process evolves, the particulars of these canonical provisions will change as well. In addition, on Wednesday Mr. Trump conferred American recognition on Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and announced that the Embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He did not, however, define what he meant by “Jerusalem,” only defining it as an Israeli capital whose boundaries have yet to be negotiated with Palestinians. It is therefore unclear what precisely has been formally recognized. It is possible that Mr. Trump is attempting to lure Israel into concessions through this policy departure and maybe even trap Mr. Netanyahu into responding in kind. But the emptiness of the gesture suggests otherwise. One thing that the announcement will have done is to shore up the president’s evangelical base, who won’t inquire too closely into the practical import of the announcement but will be seduced by the headlines it generates. "
1620,"WORCESTER, Mass. — Hundreds of protests were staged across the country on Thursday in the latest uproar over a repeal of rules ensuring an open internet. The drumbeat of action can in good part be traced back to a yellow Victorian house in this leafy New England city. The home is the nerve center for Fight for the Future, a scrappy 10-person nonprofit that has helped lead the opposition to the change — even if its effort to protect so-called net neutrality has the longest of odds. For months, the founders, Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson, have pushed the group’s 1.8 million supporters to flood social media sites with warnings about how the change could favor big companies and hurt smaller ones. They have also supplied online tools to their followers, like one that makes it easier to call lawmakers and another to file comments directly to the Federal Communications Commission, the agency considering the repeal. For next week, just ahead of the agency’s vote on the proposal, they have organized hundreds of internet companies to alter their websites — slowing them down, for example — to show what online experiences could be like without the rules. “We believe people care about this enough to take a stand,” Ms. Cheng, 37, said while sitting inside the house, nearly surrounded in a tiny office by bookshelves stocked with medieval literature. Their efforts may seem quixotic. Fight for the Future is trying to stop the chairman of the F.C.C., Ajit Pai, from dismantling rules that prevent internet service providers from blocking websites or charging them for faster delivery to consumers. The group argues that the policy, passed in 2015 under the Obama administration and with a groundswell of support, helps protect free speech and expression online. "
1621,"To the Editor: Re “Senator Al Franken Resigning Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations” (nytimes.com, Dec. 7): What I find truly disturbing and outright appalling about the calls that resulted in Senator Al Franken’s decision to resign is what this says about our standards for honesty and accountability, as well as the failing status of our political system. Notwithstanding the fact that, arguably, his behavior may be categorically different than that of Donald Trump and Roy Moore, in essence Mr. Franken is being punished for, in the view of some, admitting what he did and demonstrating remorse and accountability for inappropriate actions. In stark contrast, Mr. Trump and Mr. Moore are being rewarded for very likely lying, denying and, worse yet, viciously attacking their accusers, most of whom are widely seen as credible. This is a sad commentary on the state of our political system and a stain on our moral code. In his resignation speech Mr. Franken clearly captured the problem, citing the “irony in the fact that I am leaving, while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.” RICHARD CHERWITZ, AUSTIN, TEX. To the Editor: Men who harass and abuse women should be publicly shamed and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I do not think, however, that accusations alone should be enough to force a public official out of office. I understand that for too long people in power have looked the other way, and women have felt powerless and at the mercy of abusive men. Thank God it appears this has changed. However, I fear that in some cases the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. "

1623,"This was a year when books — like the rest of us — tried to keep up with the news, and did a pretty good job of it. Novels about global interconnectedness, political violence and migration; deeply reported nonfiction accounts of racial and economic strife in the United States; stories both imagined and real about gender, desire and the role of beauty in the natural world. There were several worthy works of escapism, of course, but the literary world mostly reflected the gravity and tumult of the larger world. Below, The New York Times’s three daily book critics — Dwight Garner, Jennifer Senior and Parul Sehgal — share their thoughts about their favorites among the books they reviewed this year, each list alphabetical by author. Janet Maslin, a former staff critic who remains a frequent contributor to The Times, also lists her favorites. The year in books included a historic change at The Times. Michiko Kakutani stepped down as our chief book critic in July. Kakutani began her role as a critic in 1983, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998. This year, among other noteworthy books, Kakutani reviewed George Saunders’s “Lincoln in the Bardo,” Mohsin Hamid’s “Exit West,” Omar El Akkad’s “American War” and Ayobami Adebayo’s “Stay With Me.” — John Williams, Daily Books Editor and Staff Writer Each of these books, in a hard year, was one I didn’t know I needed until it appeared. ‘SELECTION DAY’ By Aravind Adiga (Scribner). This is Adiga’s third novel, and it offers proof that his Man Booker Prize, for “The White Tiger” in 2008, was no fluke. He is not merely a confident storyteller but also a thinker, a skeptic, a wily entertainer and a thorn in the side of orthodoxy and cant. This is a cricket novel that maintains a running critique of the sport, and a moving novel about fathers and sons. It’s a book about religion and its tribal cruelties, and it bears bad tidings. Adiga’s take on the world makes you consider what the apocalypse might sound like as reported by the BBC’s Hindi service. (Read the review.) ‘THE VIRGINIA STATE COLONY FOR EPILEPTICS AND FEEBLEMINDED: POEMS’ By Molly McCully Brown (Persea). This is Brown’s first book of poems, and it is part history lesson, part séance and part ode to dread. The title refers to an actual place, a government-run hospital that, in the early part of the 20th century, sterilized many of its patients without their consent. The author grew up near the institution, and it has long haunted her. Brown’s blank verse is supple yet restrained; it contains all its essential oils. In its formal design, and in its interest in art and history, the book resembles a slender ghost version of James Agee’s text for “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” (Read the review.) ‘TRANSIT’ By Rachel Cusk (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). Faye, the divorced writer who is the narrator of Cusk’s transfixing latest novel, is the same woman we met in the author’s previous novel, “Outline.” These two short books are part of a projected trilogy, and together they’re already an achievement: dense, aphoristic, philosophically acute novels that read like Iris Murdoch thrice-distilled. We watch Faye move through her days, speaking to friends, old lovers, real estate agents, salon employees, fellow writers, construction workers. Cusk’s writing offers the iron-rich pleasure of voice instead of style. (Read the review.) "

1625,"WASHINGTON — United States officials have expressed concern about security at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February, initially raising the possibility of withdrawing from the games but later insisting that American athletes will compete. The American envoy to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said on Wednesday that it was an “open question” whether American athletes would be able to attend the Winter Games, given the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, echoed Ms. Haley’s remarks during a briefing for reporters on Thursday, saying that “no official decision has been made” about participating in the Olympics. Asked about whether the reason is security concerns, she said “absolutely.” But moments later, Ms. Sanders took to Twitter to clarify, saying that “the U.S. looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics in South Korea. The protection of Americans is our top priority and we are engaged with the South Koreans and other partner nations to secure the venues.” The Winter Games are scheduled to be held Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang, a city about 50 miles south of the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea.

1627,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, Time magazine named “the silence breakers” — the women speaking out against sexual harassment and assault — as 2017’s Person of the Year. It’s an excellent choice. Decades from now, I expect we will look back on this year as a turning point on this issue. And unlike many potential 2017 turning points, this one is welcome. Still, don’t forget the terrible price many women pay for speaking up: “Nearly all of the people Time interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up.” Related: Lauren Greene, a former staff member to Blake Farenthold, a Texas congressman, has suffered both personally and professionally after accusing Farenthold of sexual harassment. Rachael Bade of Politico reported the details this week, and they’re worth reading. In The Times, Thomas Chatterton Williams writes that too many women — often poor and of color — are prevented from telling their stories of harassment and assault. Unfairness in higher ed. This country’s colleges are not the meritocracies they claim to be. Top public and private colleges — as measured by resources, graduation rates or just about anything else — still disproportionately enroll affluent students. The colleges do so even though many highly qualified low- and middle-income students exist, as I’ve written before. "
1628,"WASHINGTON — Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, in an emotional speech on the Senate floor, announced on Thursday that he would resign from Congress, the most prominent figure in a growing list of lawmakers felled by charges of sexual harassment or indiscretions. At turns defiant and mournful but hardly contrite, Mr. Franken called it “the worst day of my political life,” as he denied allegations of groping and improper advances from at least six women. Instead, as his Democratic colleagues looked on, he took a parting shot at President Trump and Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama; both have also been accused of sexual misconduct. “I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party,” Mr. Franken said. Hours later, Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, resigned after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment — a move that made him the third member of Congress to leave under a cloud of claims of sexual impropriety in three days. On Tuesday, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and the longest-serving African-American in House history, also quit. The dizzying series of departures comes during a national reckoning over sexual misconduct in the workplace that has cost men their jobs across the spectrum of American life, including in the entertainment and media industries, the arts, academia and now, politics. As accusations of sexual improprieties continue to swirl on Capitol Hill, lawmakers have struggled with how to respond. Democrats and their leaders forced Mr. Conyers and Mr. Franken out in a succession of seemingly coordinated statements that made clear that their continued presence would be untenable. Mr. Franken stepped down one day after nearly all the Senate’s Democratic women — and most Democratic men, including the top two leaders — called for him to resign. "
1629,"MSNBC pulled an abrupt about-face on Thursday, announcing that it had rehired a contributor just days after it fired him when far-right activists drew attention to an inflammatory tweet he posted in 2009. “Sometimes you just get one wrong — and that’s what happened here,” Phil Griffin, the cable network’s president said in a statement on Thursday announcing that the cable network had rehired Sam Seder, a political commentator and host of the “Majority Report” podcast. The episode began late last month when Mike Cernovich, the far-right activist, resurfaced a tweet sent by Mr. Seder in 2009 that was meant to mock supporters of the film director Roman Polanski. Mr. Seder’s tweet, which has since been deleted, was posted shortly after Mr. Polanski, who pleaded guilty in 1977 to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old, was arrested in Switzerland in 2009 in connection with that crime. As some spoke out to support Mr. Polanski, most prominently the French culture and foreign ministers, Mr. Seder posted a cutting parody of a statement defending the director. “Don’t care re Polanski, but i hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scene,” Mr. Seder’s tweet said.

1630,"JERUSALEM — Palestinians clashed with Israeli forces in the West Bank and along the border with Gaza on Thursday, as widespread predictions of unrest were realized a day after President Trump took the high-risk move of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Hundreds of youths clashed with Israeli forces at checkpoints. In Gaza, youths protested along the border fence, rallied in a central Gaza City park and burned tires in a refugee camp. Dozens were injured, at least one seriously. After nightfall, two rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza. The Israeli military said they had fallen short and landed inside the Palestinian coastal territory. The Israeli military said it was sending additional battalions to the West Bank in response to the protests. Mr. Trump’s decision ignited other protests across the region, from the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon to Tunisia. Hundreds of Jordanians protested outside the United States Embassy in Amman and called for its closing, chanting, “America is the head of the snake.” At a news conference in Baghdad, Moqtada al-Sadr, an influential Iraqi Shiite cleric, called for a unified “Arab Spring” against Israel. Jihadist groups from Somalia to Syria and from Yemen to Afghanistan issued venomous statements about Mr. Trump’s decision. "

1632,"To the Editor: Re “President Calls Jerusalem Shift ‘the Right Thing’ ” (front page, Dec. 7): President Trump said all final status issues, like border issues in Jerusalem, remain open to negotiation between the parties. So he may not have actually denied that Jerusalem could be negotiated to be the capital of not only Israel but also Palestine: to be a shared capital. This could decrease the high emotion on all sides, and would seem the most important question to ask him about where United States policy stands today on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. JAMES ADLER, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: President Trump, in his speech about Jerusalem, called attention to President Harry S. Truman’s recognition of the state of Israel 70 years ago. But what Truman did not do was to recognize Jerusalem as its capital. Truman supported what we now call a two-state solution, a partition plan drawn up by the United Nations. Palestine would be divided into two separate states, one Jewish and one Arab. They would be tied together in an economic union. As for Jerusalem, an international zone would be established around the city to guarantee access by all faiths to their holy sites. Jews welcomed the partition. The Arabs did not. Truman believed that was a great missed historic opportunity. President Trump’s decision on Jerusalem will likely be seen as a great historic mistake, making a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians that much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.

1634,"At 11:45 a.m. on Thursday, Al Franken, the Democratic senator from Minnesota, stood on the Senate floor and announced his intention to resign. He didn’t admit to allegations of groping and unwanted kisses, but argued that they’d become too great a distraction for him to serve effectively. “Minnesotans deserve a senator who can focus with all her energy on addressing the challenges they face every day,” he said, implying he’ll be replaced with a woman. While Franken is on his way out of the Senate, Roy Moore, Republican of Alabama, may be on his way in. Moore stands credibly accused of molesting a 14-year-old whom he picked up outside her mother’s custody hearing and of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old after offering her a ride home from her waitressing job. Nevertheless, Moore has President Trump’s endorsement. The Republican National Committee, which pulled financial support for Moore in November, has restored it. Recent polls show him leading in the special election set for Tuesday. Franken noted the asymmetry in his resignation speech: “I of all people am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.” This irony reveals the limits of the #MeToo movement. This week, Time magazine named those who’ve spoken out against sexual harassment — collectively called “The Silence Breakers” — as its Person of the Year. “When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former ‘Today’ show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door,” the cover article says. In truth, however, this new door is open for only some people — those whose harassers are either personally or professionally susceptible to shame. Since October, when the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was outed as a serial sexual predator and shunned by the social worlds he once ruled, an astonishing number of powerful and famous men have been fired and disgraced. It sometimes feels as if we’re in the midst of a cultural revolution where the toll of sexual harassment on women’s lives and ambitions will finally be reckoned with. But the revolution is smaller than it first appears. So far, it has been mostly confined to liberal-leaning sectors like entertainment, the media, academia, Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party. It hasn’t rocked the Republicans, corporate America or Wall Street — with some exceptions — because these realms are less responsive to feminist pressure. "
1635,"Donald Trump is the contemporary master of a little-used literary device: the narcissistic third person. On the indictment of Paul Manafort: “There’s not even a mention of Trump in there.” On the possibility of Russian interference in the 2016 election: “Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?” Even his very first tweet, back in the innocent days of 2009, employed this peculiar mirror-gazing perspective: “Be sure to tune in and watch Donald Trump on Late Night with David Letterman ….” Like so much else that Mr. Trump favors — red baseball hats, caps lock — referring to oneself in the third person has, these past few years, come to seem tainted, almost pathological. It has entered the cultural lexicon — suitable only for the toweringly grandiose (LeBron) or the deeply immature (Elmo). When the writers of a drama wish to signal that someone is soon to die of tuberculosis, they have her cough blood into a handkerchief. When they wish to signal that someone suffers from a terminal case of self-regard, they have him refer to himself in the third person. Which accounts for the sheepishness I feel when I tell you about my recent discovery: that referring to yourself in the third person is, well, kind of wonderful. Lately I’ve been walking around with an inner monologue that runs something like this: Ben is feeling tired; Ben is considering blowing off the gym; Ben is feeling regret about eating that entire baguette while walking home from the grocery store. And I’ve not only found my ego swelling from all this Ben-ing. I’ve also found it tamer than ever before, as manageable and mild as a baby panda. Much as it pains me to admit, I’ve come to believe that our egotist-in-chief may have stumbled onto something profound. Allow me to explain. At the core of Buddhism is the concept of non-self. The idea, basically, is that the thing you think of as you — the entity whose well-being occupies your every waking thought — is an illusion. This doesn’t mean that your body is a hologram — that Uniqlo-clad lump of meat is indisputably there. What non-self refers to, rather, is the thing that you think of as your true self — the little captain who lives somewhere behind your forehead and looks out through your eyes. The thing that says, “I hope people like me” or “I can’t stand another minute on this train” — that, Buddhists believe, is what needs to be seen through and rooted out. "
1636,"VIENNA — The top diplomats from the United States and Russia sat yards from each other at a security conference here on Thursday in Vienna and lobbed broadsides that were sharply at odds with the tone of President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin’s meeting last month. “We will never accept Russia’s occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea,” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson vowed in his opening remarks at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Russia is “arming, leading, training and fighting alongside antigovernment forces” in Eastern Ukraine, Mr. Tillerson added. Moments earlier, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, gave such a rapid-fire list of grievances — complaining about the growing expansion of NATO and the West’s increasing limits on Russian-language journalists, for example — that his interpreter could barely keep up. “We’ve reached an absolute low point regarding confidence between the main players,” the secretary general of the security forum, Thomas Greminger, told reporters at the start of the conclave. The dueling remarks at the conference, with underpinnings of Cold War tensions, played out under the sparkling chandeliers of the Hofburg Palace as diplomats came in from a cold, gray Vienna day to ballrooms warmed by endless speeches. Whether Mr. Tillerson’s tough stance on Russia is in keeping with Mr. Trump’s often-stated wish to improve relations with Russia is unclear. But the secretary of state has maintained it since his confirmation hearings in January despite the Order of Friendship he received from Mr. Putin when Mr. Tillerson was Exxon Mobil’s chief executive.

It’s a revelatory work, developing Mr. Hadreas’s experiences of love and loss into a virtuosic song cycle of himself — at turns bold (“Slip Away”), elegiac (“Wreath”) and sexy (“Die 4 U”), and quite often all three at once. The album’s intimate scale has translated well to large rooms this year, but these performances at a pair of smaller venues (the first two of which are sold out) are likely to be particularly powerful.

1642,"NEW ORLEANS — Climate change made the torrential rains that flooded Houston after Hurricane Harvey last summer much worse, scientists reported Wednesday. Two research groups found that the record rainfall as Harvey stalled over Texas in late August, which totaled more than 50 inches in some areas, was as much as 38 percent higher than would be expected in a world that was not warming. While many scientists had said at the time that Harvey was probably affected by climate change, because warmer air holds more moisture, the size of the increase surprised some. “The amount of precipitation increase is worse than I expected,” said Michael J. Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an author of a paper on his group’s findings, which included the 38 percent figure. Based on how much the world has warmed, Dr. Wehner said, before the analysis he had expected an increase of only about 6 or 7 percent. The other study, by an international coalition of scientists known as World Weather Attribution, found that Harvey’s rainfall was 15 percent higher than would be expected without climate change. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the lead author of the second study, said that climate change also made such an extreme rainstorm much more likely. “The probability of such an event has increased by roughly a factor of three,” he said. While the likelihood of a Harvey-like storm was perhaps once in every 3,000 years in the past, he said, now it’s once every 1,000 years or so — which means that in any given year, there is 0.1 percent chance of a similar storm occurring along the Gulf Coast.

1643,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Roy Moore lost. Thank goodness. The United States Senate will not have among its members a proud anti-Muslim, anti-gay bigot who is the subject of multiple credible accusations of molestation. The politicians who supported Moore, starting with President Trump, and those who silently refused to condemn him, including many congressional Republicans, will forever be stained by doing so. They supported a man who rejects American values. They also supported a man who managed to lose what should have been an easy Republican win. The immediate implication of Doug Jones’s victory is that the Republican margin in the Senate will shrink to just two votes once Jones is sworn in, sometime in the next several weeks. This means the party can lose only one of its members and still pass legislation (with the vice president breaking a tie). Republicans will now be in even more of a rush to pass their tax plan. I hope the Alabama result causes at least a few of them to reflect on the folly of passing an unpopular bill that increases the deficit and hurts the middle class. Only two more Republican “no” votes can keep it from passing — and the plan violates the stated principles of at least three Republican senators (Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and John McCain). "
1644,"(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Our introduction today comes from Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times. Just about every visitor to San Francisco knows Alcatraz. Many fewer know Angel Island, the verdant dot in the Bay where around 175,000 immigrants from China were detained, in some cases for years, during the first part of the 1900s. Angel Island was an immigration station almost exclusively used for immigrants from China. It was a symbol of the many forms of discrimination that the Chinese endured in America during the early waves of migration, a time when they played such a critical role in the development of the American West, the construction of the railroads being the most famous example. Isolated in the ghetto of Chinatown for decades, it was not until 1994 — almost a century and a half after Chinese people arrived in large numbers for the Gold Rush — that a Chinese-American, Mabel Teng, was directly elected to citywide office in San Francisco, according to David Lee, a political science lecturer at San Francisco State University. The death of San Francisco mayor, Edwin M. Lee, on Tuesday, was a coda in the belated but successful attainment of Chinese political power in the city. Today both members of the State Assembly representing San Francisco are of Chinese descent, as are members of the board of supervisors and many city officials. Mr. Lee’s ascension as mayor in 2011 was a landmark achievement for the Chinese community. “The Chinese were never fully American, never fully part of San Francisco — that is until Ed Lee became mayor,” said Mr. Lee of San Francisco State, who is not related. “It was a symbol of true political acceptance.” "
1645,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The word traveled, urgently and insistently, along the informal networks of black friends, black family and black co-workers: Vote. Joanice Thompson, 68, a retired worker at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, scrolled Tuesday through the text messages on her phone from relatives reminding each other what needed to be done. Byron Perkins, 56, a trial lawyer, said his Facebook feed was clogged with photos of friends sporting the little “I Voted” stickers given out at polling places. Casie Baker, 29, a bank worker, said her family prodded and cajoled and hectored each other until the voting was done. The message was largely received: African-American voters played an essential role in electing the Democrat, Doug Jones, over his scandal-scarred Republican rival, Roy S. Moore, in a special election on Tuesday for an open Senate seat that proved to be one of the most shocking upsets in recent memory. They said they were motivated by the specific fears that Mr. Moore would help President Trump cut government aid programs, reduce access to health care and neglect criminal justice reform. But they also voted out of a more general concern that the country, in the Trump era, was going back to a place best left in the past. “There’s no state in America where black people recognize the horrors of turning back the clock more than the State of Alabama,” said Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, which is based in Montgomery. “There is a consciousness about this history in the African-American community.” "

1647,"It was a year that felt like a decade: 2017 saw the arrival of a new president (and an at-the-ready resistance movement), the unsealing of long-held silences on abuse and consent, a radically new world order and a terrifying spate of natural and human-made disasters (fire, water, terror). It was also a year full of stuff. Fashion and commerce don’t grind to a halt even in troubling times, and the designers and retailers of the fashion world responded to turmoil as usual. They invented, rebranded, up-marketed and revitalized. It was a year that gawked at stilettos and embraced ugly sneakers; when an advocacy hat was met with an activism hat; when makeup and a glossy magazine offered a new chance at inclusion; when luxury looked to the bargain basement; and when a lion of the industry, a man seemingly out of his own times, left us too soon. What a long, strange year it has been. Here are the pieces that defined it: what we wore, we carried, wanted, feared and waited for. If the signal political fashion item of 2016 was the Make America Great Again cap — a Republican-red telegraph of support for Donald J. Trump, more instantly legible than any other accessory of a brutal, knockdown presidential race — it found  its opposite in the “pussy hat,” the unofficial headgear of  the anti-Trump resistance. When women’s marches took to the streets in Washington and cities around the country on Jan. 21, many marchers were crowned with knitted pink cat-eared beanies, their patterns  freely distributed online and their production crowdsourced by the Pussyhat Project in a viral knitting campaign of solidarity and support for women’s rights.

1649,"Omarosa Manigault Newman, who achieved a measure of fame playing a villain on “The Apprentice” and cemented a relationship with President Trump that led to a White House appointment, will be leaving her position in January, the administration said on Wednesday. Ms. Newman “resigned yesterday to pursue other opportunities,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “Her departure will not be effective until Jan. 20, 2018. We wish her the best in future endeavors and are grateful for her service.” One of the president’s prominent African-American supporters, Ms. Newman served as the director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison. But the division, which was absent a clear leader for most of the year, atrophied with her in a key position. Two people close to the administration said Ms. Newman neglected to find enough attendees for a Black History Month event early in the administration, for instance. And the office — which is crucial for building coalitions — became seen as what one person close to the White House described as the “island of misfit toys,” where people who could not be slotted into other roles were sent. Reached by phone on Wednesday, Ms. Newman referred a reporter to Ms. Sanders’s statement about her departure. Three administration officials described reports of Ms. Newman being hauled off the White House grounds as overstated. "
1650,"ST. PAUL — The campaign started immediately. Five minutes after being named as Al Franken’s temporary replacement in the United States Senate, Lt. Gov. Tina Smith of Minnesota said Wednesday that she would run for the job next fall, in an election for the two years left in Mr. Franken’s term. Ms. Smith’s appointment keeps a Democrat in Mr. Franken’s seat for at least a year, but also cues up a seismic 2018 election that could shift the balance of power in Minnesota and, quite possibly, in the Senate. Ms. Smith, a far less famous politician than Mr. Franken, whose resignation came amid accusations of sexual harassment, seemed eager to avoid being seen as a senator foisted upon Minnesotans. “Anybody who knows the voters of Minnesota knows that they can’t be told what to do,” Ms. Smith said at the State Capitol after Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, announced that he had appointed her. “My purpose is to go out and ask for those voters’ support, and that is my job to do.” Some Democrats here remain conflicted about Mr. Franken’s resignation, announced after some of his colleagues in Washington called on him to leave over the accusations. And Republicans, who control the Legislature but have struggled in statewide races, sense an opportunity to pick off the seat, which they had expected was out of reach until at least 2020. Next year’s ballot will also include an open race for governor — Mr. Dayton is not seeking another term — and an election for Senator Amy Klobuchar’s position. Ms. Klobuchar, a well-known Democrat, is expected to run for another six-year term. "
1651,"LONDON — Facebook, confounding expectations, said on Wednesday that the company had found no evidence of a significant Russian effort to interfere in the British referendum last year on leaving the European Union. In an emailed statement, Facebook said the Russian agency that had spent $100,000 advertising on its platform to influence the United States presidential election last year had spent only 97 cents on advertisements that were delivered to British users during the two months before the referendum, on June 23, 2016. Those 97 cents bought three ads, all centered on immigration and aimed at American users, Facebook said. The ads were viewed just 200 times by British users over four days in May 2016, the company said. Facebook made its statement in response to questions from a committee of the British Parliament, which has sought to expand on parallel American congressional investigations around the election of Donald J. Trump as president. Damian Collins, the Conservative chairman of the committee, questioned Facebook’s findings, saying the company did not conduct a thorough search, something the company denied. Facebook executives said a search for potential foreign interference in the two months before the British vote had not turned up any Russian advertising spending other than the three ads from the Russian entity. That company, known as the Internet Research Agency, has been identified by American intelligence agencies as the troll farm the Russian government used to influence the United States election. "
1652,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, was not in a talking mood on Wednesday as he sped through the corridors of the Capitol. It had been roughly 12 hours since Doug Jones, a Democrat, had won election to the Senate — a victory that for Mr. McConnell spelled both bad news and good news. “It was quite an impressive election,” Mr. McConnell, of Kentucky, said tersely. “It was a big turnout, and an unusual day.” The election of Mr. Jones — the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in 25 years — will have significant consequences on the national level, making it more difficult for Republicans to enact their legislative agenda and opening, for the first time, a possible — if narrow — path to a Democratic majority in the Senate in 2018. For Mr. McConnell, it has very immediate consequences: It reduces his already razor-thin majority in the Senate to 51 from 52 votes. But it also relieves Mr. McConnell of a huge problem: having to deal with Roy S. Moore, the unpredictable Alabama Republican nominee whose candidacy was tarred by allegations that he molested a 14-year-old girl and made sexual advances toward other teenagers. Mr. McConnell called repeatedly for Mr. Moore to abandon his campaign and had pledged that Mr. Moore would face an Ethics Committee investigation the moment he arrived in the Senate — an inquiry that could have put the Senate on a torturous path to expel him. Mr. Moore, a deeply polarizing former judge who is aligned with Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, would undoubtedly have given Mr. McConnell headaches on policy matters, as well. “It’s short-term pain, long-term gain,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell, in assessing the election results. "
1653,"WASHINGTON — The day after suffering a political blow in the Alabama special Senate election, congressional Republicans sped forward with the most sweeping tax rewrite in decades, announcing an agreement on a final bill that would cut taxes for businesses and individuals and signal the party’s first major legislative achievement since assuming political control this year. Party leaders in the House and Senate agreed in principle to bridge the yawning gaps between their competing versions of the $1.5 trillion tax bill, keeping Republicans on track for final votes next week with the aim of delivering a bill to President Trump’s desk by Christmas. The House and Senate versions of the tax bill started from the same core principles — sharply cutting taxes on businesses, while reducing rates and eliminating some breaks for individuals — but diverged on several crucial details. In the end, more of the Senate bill appeared to be included in the final version, though lawmakers continued to make significant changes from the legislation that passed either the House or the Senate. The changes included a slightly higher corporate tax rate of 21 percent, rather than the 20 percent in the legislation that passed both chambers, and a lower top individual tax rate of 37 percent for the wealthiest Americans, who currently pay 39.6 percent. But the bill will still scale back some popular tax breaks, including the state and local tax deduction and the deductibility of mortgage interest. In a break from the House bill, the agreement would allow taxpayers to continue to deduct high out-of-pocket medical expenses, and it would retain a provision allowing graduate students who receive tuition waivers to avoid paying taxes on that benefit. Also included in the consensus bill is the Senate’s repeal of the Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty and a provision that opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to energy exploration. Still unclear is the overall cost of the revised legislation, which cannot exceed the $1.5 trillion bucket that lawmakers have allowed if they want to pass the bill without Democratic support. Several of the provisions added by the Senate to help pay for the overall bill were either reversed or scaled back in the consensus version, and some tax breaks eliminated by the House were added back in.

In the short term, she concedes that Democrats are the winners. But Mr. Moore’s loss deprives the Democrats of a target for their criticism. Her list of losers includes the president, Stephen K.

We could have foreseen, for example, that “he is the kind of personality that is a constant source of random political embarrassment” outside of the Republican mainstream. And those who think that it was merely the sexual misconduct charges lodged against Mr. Moore that sank him, Mr. Tracinski argues, are not seeing the coalition of voters that came out for Mr. Jones, including the overwhelming majority of black women. Mr. Moore may “have retained the loyalty of his die-hard, core supporters, but at the expense of alienating everyone else.” Read more » "
1655,"HONG KONG — Google pulled some of its core businesses out of China seven years ago, after concluding that government controls and surveillance ran counter to its commitment to a free and open internet. Since then, as China’s online scene has grown and prospered, the American search giant has been looking for ways to tiptoe back in. On Wednesday, it unveiled a small but symbolically significant move toward that end: a China-based center devoted to artificial intelligence. The move nods to the country’s growing strength in A.I., thanks to substantial government funding prompted by Beijing’s ambition of having a say in the technologies of the future. Google said the center would have a team of experts in Beijing, where the company has hundreds of employees in research and development, as well as other roles. The center will be led by Fei-Fei Li, who runs Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Lab and leads the artificial intelligence arm of Google’s Cloud business, and Jia Li, the head of research and development for the A.I. division of Google Cloud. The Silicon Valley company, which announced the center’s opening at a software developer conference in Shanghai, cited China’s growing academic and technical contributions to the A.I. field, and said the new center would be “working closely with the vibrant Chinese A.I. research community.” “The science of A.I. has no borders,” Fei-Fei Li said in a post on Google’s website, and “neither do its benefits.” "
1656,"Roy Moore’s stunning defeat in the Alabama special Senate election last night was a temporary setback for the forces of Trumpism that have gripped the Republican Party. It has been clear in recent weeks that not everyone is thrilled by the direction of the Republican Party in the Trump era. Just this week, Joyce Simmons, the Nebraska Republican National Committeewoman, stepped away from her role with the party in response to its support for Mr. Moore. Depressed turnout in reliably Republican areas of Alabama on Tuesday suggest Ms. Simmons was not alone in taking a stand and saying “enough.” Certainly, most Republicans are quite fond of President Trump and the direction he has taken the party. Yet in the wake of the Moore defeat — a concrete sign that Trumpism alone may not be able to sustain the party — dismayed Republicans across the country are left to decide: stay and fight, or simply flee? “This fever will someday break,” Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said in October, “and we can rebuild our party once more.” He decided to neither fight (and seek re-election) nor flee his party. I often hear that sentiment — that what we are experiencing is just a blip — along with the belief that eventually a new generation of Republican leaders will rise up to save the party and the country. Republicans skeptical of a “Trumpified” party should not be so sure. There is no guarantee that young Republicans will produce the green shoots to rebuild the party. Young voters in particular are burning off from both parties — especially the Republican Party — and becoming independents, and the remaining partisans are a more highly concentrated hard-line group.

1658,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — The once-unimaginable Republican defeat in Alabama’s special Senate election on Tuesday tore open divisions between the party’s establishment and populist wings, inciting bitter recriminations in the Republican Party as Democratic enthusiasm surges — especially in the nation’s cities and affluent suburbs. While the accusations of child molestation and teenage sexual abuse made Roy S. Moore a uniquely poor candidate, it was not lost on Republicans that Democrats, black and white, had flooded to the polls here just over a month after voters in Virginia overwhelmingly rejected Republican candidates. In Alabama, a state that Donald J. Trump won by 28 points last year, exit polls showed that as many voters disapproved of the president as approved of him, an ominous sign for Republicans that revealed both soaring Democratic intensity and growing dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump among moderate voters. “The side that has the energy and anger and enthusiasm usually prevails,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. “And Democrats don’t have to be for anything, they just have to be against us.” Republicans are now bracing for the possibility of another unexpectedly difficult special election, in March, this one in a conservative-leaning House district in western Pennsylvania, and they are resigned to having to spend money to protect what has been a safe seat. Further, Mr. Dent, who has already said he will not seek re-election next year, confirmed he has had conversations with TV news executives about becoming an analyst, raising the possibility that he would leave his seat early and create yet another special election for his party. (“I have no definitive plans,” he said.) And the seemingly unremitting stream of accusations from women about male lawmakers committing sexual misconduct is raising the possibility of even more unexpected resignations, which could at a minimum cause Republicans to have to direct more cash toward races for which they had not planned. "
1659,"LONDON — Dog lovers tend to find each other in life, for the rest of humanity is, after all, suspect. On a long flight recently, I fell into a conversation with a woman about dogs. It turned into a conversation about disobedience, and the world’s current need for it. When immense power is in erratic and belligerent hands, as it is today in the United States, the readiness of subordinates to disobey becomes critical. “Befehl ist befehl” — an order is an order — was the German principle that enabled the Nazis’ industrialized mass murder. The woman had been training her pet to become a guide dog. The dog did well until the phase of training dedicated to learning disobedience. A dog trained to lead a blind person needs to refuse orders if the direction received would lead into the path of a car, or onto a subway track, or over a precipice. Her dog had failed this part of the training and became depressed. Dogs are naturally joyous. Seeing them listless is hard. We talked about feeling bad for your dog — a vast subject to dog lovers. But the story of this dog’s failure was also reassuring. It suggested that disobedience is a higher cognitive skill than obedience, and affirmed how essential it can be. (One of the worrisome things about drones is that they won’t disobey.) Jim Kutsch, the president of The Seeing Eye in Morristown, N.J., the nation’s oldest organization training guide dogs for the blind, told me recently: “In all other cases, the human gives a command and the dog is expected to obey that command.” He continued, “In the case of the Seeing Eye dog, the dog is obligated to decide whether the command makes sense. The dog needs to stand still, or turn left or right, and lead me away from danger.” "
1660,"In one of his first acts as president, Barack Obama signed executive orders closing this country’s secret prisons overseas, banning torture and authorizing an end to the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Obviously, Mr. Obama didn’t fully get his way. Guantánamo, though reduced to a few dozen prisoners, is still operating. And the current president has expressed full faith in the harsh methods described euphemistically as enhanced interrogation techniques. “Don’t tell me it doesn’t work — torture works,” Donald Trump insisted during the 2016 presidential campaign. Standing behind Mr. Obama as he signed those orders on Jan. 22, 2009, were 16 retired generals and admirals who had his back, figuratively as well as literally. They were hardly soft-on-terrorism types. A few were lifelong Republicans. But these military men, working with Human Rights First, felt a moral imperative to oppose torture. They were convinced that it not only trampled core American principles, but also produced useless intelligence while potentially endangering United States troops who might fall into enemy hands. A leader of that group was James Cullen, a retired brigadier general who had begun Army life as a private during the Vietnam War. He became a lawyer, serving for many years in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps, and later in private practice. In alliance with the human rights group, he and his once-uniformed colleagues lobbied major politicians to support a ban on coercive interrogations. General Cullen died in Scarsdale, N.Y., last week at age 72. His death is a reminder of how former military men and women of conscience and courage can provide helpful support for the civilian leadership — and, if necessary, be a bulwark against the worst instincts that at times grab hold of it. We are living in one of those times, with a president whose respect for the rule of law is meager and whose expressed affinity for waterboarding and “a hell of a lot worse” is strong. Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with retired generals, and many Americans are counting on them to restrain his most reckless impulses. The endless barrage of insults and threats from the tweeter in chief — plus decisions running counter to sound national security policy — shows that efforts to rein him in have been mixed at best. After an Uzbeki immigrant plowed a pickup truck into people in Lower Manhattan on Halloween, killing eight of them, the president’s reflex was to “send him to Gitmo” — something never done with anyone arrested on American soil. It took a couple of days for advisers to finally persuade him that a transfer to Guantánamo was the wrong way to go. "
1661,"Yes, President Donald Trump has sexually harassed women. This concludes my ethics investigation. I hate to bore you with technical jargon, but I suppose it’s important, in the interest of nonpartisan professional transparency, to offer some insight into my methodology. First of all, as a very good sexual harassment investigator, I know that one of the sexual harasser’s classic tells is a history of repeatedly sexually harassing women, or talking about sexually harassing women, in public, either on the internet or on video or on the record with reporters, perhaps as recently as today. A second thing that investigators like me are trained to look for is whether or not saying degrading things about women like a cartoon sex creep is kind of an accused harasser’s whole deal. A third subtle and suspicious clue is if you, the investigator, recently woke up to 17 news alerts on your phone that say, “[Accused Harasser] Just Sexually Harassed [Female Senator] in Front of Everyone Just Now!” Armed with these parameters, I began my investigation by thinking about Donald Trump for an infinitesimally small measurement of time, the barest whisper of consciousness, a mayfly’s breath. And I have some terrible news, America. It is with 100 percent professional certainty that I must inform you our president, Donald Trump, is a sexual harasser, on account of all of the sexual harassment he constantly does. I know this comes as a shock. App-based pay-per-minute grief counselors will be on call at your neighborhood Costco; they are not covered by insurance, but they are covered by In-Churro-Ance™, the Republicans’ Obamacare replacement run by Taco Bell. Caliente savings! Live más! That’s not to say that we shouldn’t subject Donald Trump and every politician accused of sexual misconduct to a rigorous, standardized ethics investigation — we absolutely should — just that I am so tired of participating in the collective national farce that things happening right in front of our eyes might not really be happening. That we do not already know the truth about what our president and the nation he rules think about women. We know. Anyone who says he doesn’t know is lying. The term “sexual harassment,” used here in a social sense, not a legal one, refers to a spectrum of behaviors from unwanted sexual advances to belittling, intimidating or uncomfortable sexual comments. In other words, a spectrum of behaviors that Donald Trump engages in all the time. Barging into the dressing rooms of Miss Teen USA in order to see teenage girls naked (“I sort of get away with things like that,” Trump once told Howard Stern); calling Caitríona Perry, a reporter from Ireland, up to his desk to tell her she has a “nice smile”; once speculating, while seated next to his daughter, Ivanka, that if he weren’t her father, “perhaps I’d be dating her”; instructing a female “Apprentice” contestant to stand and twirl so the male contestants could rate her body; implying, as he did on Twitter Tuesday morning, that his professional colleague Senator Kirsten Gillibrand offered him sexual favors for political donations; bragging about forcibly kissing women and grabbing their genitals — I don’t have to keep listing them, do I? Trump’s own interviews, memoirs, news conferences and Twitter feed evince a pattern of sexual degradation, objectification and assault stretching back decades. Not only does Trump not try to hide these behaviors from the public, he brags and laughs about them. They are, to a certain set of Americans, what makes Trump a real man. Mitch McConnell reassured the public this week that if Roy Moore won the Alabama special election (R.I.P.), he would have been subject to an ethics investigation. How comforting for the teenage girls of America to know that their government is happy to elect a man like Moore first and ask questions later, as long as he’s openly nostalgic for slavery. Investigation, due process, objectivity — yes, these are fundamental to our justice system. And yes, Congress (like any workplace) needs some sort of routine and fair internal protocol for addressing sexual misconduct allegations. But in the far less rigid and more mercurial court of public opinion, we, as a populace, must remain cognizant of the fact that spinning eternally in the “investigation” stage is a well-established right-wing tactic to avoid meaningful action.

1663,"For more than two hours on Tuesday night, many Americans bit their nails and glued themselves to a screen as the votes rolled in. Then, in a matter of minutes, media outlets — in rapid succession — called the Alabama Senate race for Doug Jones, a Democrat who defeated Roy S. Moore, a Republican accused of sexual abuse and child molestation. And almost as quickly, high-profile politicians took to Twitter to weigh in. Just after 11 p.m., President Trump congratulated Mr. Jones on his favored platform, arguing that “the write-in votes played a very big factor” in the outcome, though he also acknowledged that “a win is a win.” About 22,800 write-in votes had been counted. Just before midnight on Tuesday, Mr. Jones was more than 20,000 votes ahead of Mr. Moore with all the precincts having reported. (Mr. Moore did not concede defeat late Tuesday.) Still, Mr. Trump forged ahead. “The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time,” he said on Twitter. “It never ends! Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, said on Twitter that Alabama voters had elected a senator who would “make them proud.” “And if Democrats can win in Alabama, we can — and must — compete everywhere,” she said. “Onward!” Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, released a statement that both praised Mr. Jones and excoriated Mr. Moore. “Doug Jones will be an outstanding Senator who will represent Alabama well. He was a great candidate and will be an even better Senator,” Mr. Schumer said. “Roy Moore was an awful candidate and never should have gotten to the Senate. But make no mistake about it, just like in Virginia, Democrats are energized, focused on the middle class and those struggling to get there, and things are looking better and better for 2018.” Many Republican politicians remained relatively quiet on Tuesday night. But one who spoke out was Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who sent a check to Mr. Jones’s campaign this month and posted a photo of it on Twitter. He kept his comments concise on Tuesday. In an apparent reference to the allegations of sexual abuse against Mr. Moore, Mr. Flake tweeted simply: “Decency wins.” "
1664,"There are so many things I could say right now after watching Doug Jones defeat Roy Moore in the Senate race in Alabama, but for me it comes down to just two words: “Thank you.” Thank you to the majority of Alabamians for loving our country more than you hated Democrats. Thank you for voting as citizens, not as members of a tribe. Thank you for understanding that sending a credibly accused child molester to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate would not only have denigrated your state, it would have denigrated that whole legislative body. Thank you for seeing the decency of Doug Jones, even though he is a Democrat, and seeing the indecency of Roy Moore. And most of all, thank you for sending a message to Donald Trump and Stephen Bannon that you are not as dumb as they think you are. That you see what they are up to — trying to use divisive tweets and racist dog whistles to get as many Americans as possible so aroused and inflamed that they won’t think about the real issues, they won’t think about the actual candidates, they won’t think about the national interest, or even their own self-interest, but just how much they dislike “the other” — and you’re not buying it any more. God bless every one of you. Yours was a deeply patriotic act. It’s too soon to say for sure, of course, whether this is a national trend, but when the majority in a deep-red state like Alabama — where anti-abortion sentiments run so high, making it nearly impossible for a pro-choice Democrat to be elected — repudiates the effort by Trump and Bannon to turn us from citizens into tribes, there is hope for the country after all. It is a real sign of health. I speak from some experience, because I have peered into this tribal abyss. Back in the late 1970s, when I was covering the Lebanese civil war, a story made the rounds in Beirut that the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia had come up with a novel way of discovering a Palestinian trying to pass through one of its checkpoints. The Phalangists would show the driver a tomato and ask: What’s this? If the driver used the standard Lebanese pronunciation, “banadurra,” he was allowed to pass. If he used the Palestinian pronunciation, “bandora,” he could be pulled out of his car and shot on the spot. That is tribal politics at its raw essence: It doesn’t matter how you live your life or what you aspire to for your society. All that matters is your sectarian or tribal identity, revealed by how you pronounce the word for tomato. "
1665,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • In the Southern U.S. state of Alabama, Democrats celebrated the unlikely victory of their candidate, Doug Jones, above, in an election to fill a crucial Senate seat. (Here are detailed results.) The upset trims the Republican majority in the Senate to one. And it is a snub to President Trump, who backed Roy Moore, the Republican candidate, despite accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Earlier in the day Mr. Trump lashed out at his own accusers as fabricators and insulted a female senator as someone who “would do anything” for campaign contributions. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are near an agreement on a tax bill and began work on dismantling Obama-era rules on higher education. _____ "
1666,"WASHINGTON — President Trump does not readily admit defeat. Knocked to the mat in Alabama with the stunning loss of a Senate seat, he got right back up on Wednesday and defiantly claimed that he had known his candidate would lose all along. He may have been humbled by voters, but Mr. Trump does not exactly do humble. Aides to the temperamental president reported being pleasantly surprised that he did not rage against the setback in private, as he is wont to do in moments of difficulty. But neither did he concede a mistake in backing the Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, despite sexual misconduct allegations, attributing the loss to Mr. Moore and the national party establishment that abandoned him. All but ignoring the political earthquake in Alabama in public appearances on Wednesday, Mr. Trump pushed forward with his drive for major tax cuts, giving little indication that he shared his party’s panic about potentially worse defeats to come in next year’s midterm congressional elections. While aides anticipate possible staff changes, Mr. Trump showed no signs of shifting from the strident, base-oriented politics that have animated his presidency. “I don’t think it’s going to affect it,” Mr. Trump said of the election’s impact on his agenda as he met with Republican lawmakers writing the final version of his tax legislation. “I think we’re doing a lot. This is the biggest thing that we’ve worked on.” Behind the scenes, some advisers hoped the loss would persuade Mr. Trump to stop listening to Stephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist who has vowed war against the Republican establishment. But Mr. Trump talked with Mr. Bannon for 15 minutes by phone on Tuesday, aides said, and seemed disinclined to cut the adviser from his circle. Nor was it clear that Mr. Trump was any more eager to reach across the aisle and build new coalitions with Democrats even as his party’s control of the Senate narrowed to a single seat. With Wednesday’s agreement on a final tax cut bill, Mr. Trump seems poised to push through his first major achievement after a year of legislative frustrations, but it remained uncertain how he would proceed after that. "
1667,"In one of the strange rhymes that history favors, nearly eight years after Barack Obama’s Democrats managed the extraordinary feat of losing a senate race in Massachusetts, Donald Trump’s Republicans have matched the feat by losing a senate seat in Alabama. Roy Moore and Martha Coakley don’t really have a lot in common personally, but their respective defeats have one essential similarity. They are both stark repudiations of a first-term president, foreshadowing a larger repudiation soon to come. What was repudiated in Massachusetts in early 2010 was a specific policy course: The Obama White House’s pursuit of a sweeping and complex health care bill in the teeth of an enormous recession, which unsettled voters who wanted hope and change only so long as the latter didn’t affect their health-insurance premiums. The fact that Coakley was a terrible candidate made it easier for Scott Brown to torpedo her, but the backlash against Obamacare, the feeling that a liberal president had turned too soon from seeking growth to seeking redistribution, was an essential element in her defeat. There is an unpopular Republican tax bill now to echo the unpopular Democratic health care bill eight years ago, but policy is a much smaller part of what was repudiated last night in Alabama. It was not so much a rejection of the Trump agenda as it was a rejection of the whole Trumpian mode of politics, which since our president’s election has consisted of a trebling down on the most unattractive features of his campaign style, a fervent commitment to “triggering the libs” shorn of any populist substance, and a cocksure assumption that any Republicans who aren’t in it for the liberal-triggering care enough about judges and abortion or their tax cuts or the soaring stock market to swallow hard and go along. Roy Moore, in this sense, was Trump’s Trump — the man who took this mode of politics to 11 and beyond. The president has harassment accusations; the judge had mall-trawling accusations. Trump is a race-baiter; Moore was a stock character from a message movie about Southern bigotry. Trump’s populism mixed reasonable grievances in together with some stupid ones; Moore’s populism was the purest ressentiment. And like Trump but much, much more so, the Moore campaign relied on the assumption that Republicans who didn’t care for who he was and what he represented simply had nowhere else to go. So while Moore’s defeat is, yes, specific to him, specific to the statutory rape accusations and all the rest of his problems as a candidate, it’s also a pretty clear foretaste of what you get when you distill white identity politics to a nasty essence and then try to build a coalition around it. You get massive Democratic turnout, black turnout in particular, slumping Republican turnout, and a whole lot of write-in votes from people who should be your supporters. You get Democrats winning elections in the most unlikely places. And you get, quite probably, a Democratic majority in the House and perhaps even the Senate. "
1668,"With Roy Moore’s humiliating loss in the Alabama Senate race, the Trumpified Republican Party finds itself both defeated and dishonored, with no sign that it has yet hit bottom. At every stage of the run-up to this special election, Republicans could have resisted, pushed back, or drawn lines, but their failure to do so led them inexorably to this moment: the defeat of an unreconstructed bigot and ignorant crank who had the full-throated backing of the president they have embraced and empowered. It may be worthwhile charting the party’s descent to this moment. Think of it as a drama in four acts. In Act I, the curtain opens to reveal a gaudy golden escalator, and as Donald Trump descends to announce his candidacy for president, the scene has the feel of a French farce. But the humor is tinged with menace, as his lies and insults pile up, targeting women, the disabled and minorities. As the curtain closes, it is unclear whether Republicans will bring themselves to embrace the erratic usurper. (Exit Jeb! stage right.) The mood is more somber in Act II, as Republicans ponder their choice. A solitary Hamlet-like Paul Ryan paces the stage in a torn doublet and laments the evil days that have fallen on his party; he is accompanied by a Joker (who looks a lot like Lindsey Graham) who tells him that Donald Trump is a “kook,” someone who is “not fit to run the country.” But after several long monologues, in which he rationalizes that “there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so,” the young Mr. Ryan decides that the election is a binary choice and he and other Republicans must go along. He wavers after Mr. Trump engages in what he calls a “textbook definition” of racism and is caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women. Other women come forward, but they are largely ignored. Republicans make the choice to stick with him and to everyone’s surprise, Donald Trump wins. (Exit Mr. Ryan and Joker stage left.) Act III opens to a scene shortly after the inauguration. One after another, Republican leaders bow the knee to the newly enthroned Orange God King, who is surrounded by a motley court of misfits, sycophants and brigands. Even as Mr. Trump’s behavior becomes increasingly outrageous and often unhinged, the party’s grandees appease and flatter him. Courtiers, who come and go, repeatedly reassure him that he is winning. After all, he is giving them what they want: judges, tax cuts, deregulation and an end to Obamacare mandates. Enter Paul Ryan, who is better dressed and a much more cheerful character in this act. He is asked: What choice would Republicans now make? "
1669,"Mobile, Ala. — Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are politically impotent. The president and his former grand strategist threw considerable weight behind Roy Moore, the polarizing Republican Senate candidate in Alabama. For the second time this year, the state that gave Mr. Trump crucial early support during the presidential campaign — and his first senatorial endorsement — has rejected the candidate Mr. Trump endorsed for the Senate. Extraordinarily high turnout among African-American voters pulled the Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, a former United States attorney, to a narrow victory. Mr. Moore was held back by a significant resort to write-in ballots (some 1.7 percent of the total, a fact on which Mr. Trump quickly fixated) that presumably came from voters who ordinarily lean Republican — suburban professionals, especially women — along with tens of thousands fewer suburban Republicans voting at all. For example, in Shelby County, neighboring Birmingham, Mr. Trump earned 73,000 votes and a 51,000-vote margin, but it appears that Mr. Moore won 36,000 votes and a 9,000-vote margin. The last four days of the race, though, featured a series of embarrassments for Mr. Moore, several stemming from re-unearthed interviews of his and several more involving gaffes by his team at Mr. Moore’s final campaign rally. As played through the social-media filter (meaning relevant context sometimes was lost), the interviews showed Mr. Moore saying: 1) life was better early in American history despite the existence of slavery; 2) American immorality may well make the United States the focus of evil in the modern world; and 3) all constitutional amendments after the 10th — thus including the antislavery amendments and the one giving women the vote — should be repealed. His own team’s gaffes included one rally speaker talking about the time he and Mr. Moore walked into a brothel featuring teenagers (Mr. Moore insisted they walk right back out). At the same election eve rally, Mr. Bannon blasted MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough for attending a worse college than Mr. Bannon did — a snobbish remark in the best of circumstances, made worse by the fact that Mr. Scarborough’s alma mater is the University of Alabama. To top it off, Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla, played into the most obvious of stereotypes when she told those assembled that she and her husband must not be anti-Semitic because “one of our attorneys is a Jew.” "
1670,"WASHINGTON — Doug Jones’s defeat of Roy S. Moore in Tuesday’s bitterly fought special Senate election was one of the most unlikely upsets in recent campaign history. But the Democrats’ victory in Alabama carries some more immediate political implications. Voters in Alabama’s cities and most affluent suburbs overwhelmingly rejected Mr. Moore’s candidacy, an ominous sign for Republicans on the ballot next year in upscale districts. In Jefferson County, which includes Birmingham and some of the state’s wealthiest enclaves, Mr. Jones, the Democratic candidate, captured more than 68 percent of the vote. And in Madison County, home to Huntsville and a large NASA facility, Mr. Jones won 57 percent of the vote. While these Alabamians, many of them women, may have been appalled by the claims of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moore, results like these were not isolated to this race. They mirrored returns in last month’s statewide and legislative races in Virginia, a state filled with well-heeled suburbanites. These highly educated and high-income voters, while often open to supporting Republicans, are uneasy with the hard-edged politics of President Trump and part of the reason his approval ratings are so dismal. If Republican candidates facing well-off voters next year do not find a way to separate themselves from the president, they will face a punishing midterm election next year. "
1671,"You took nearly two million photos of Barack Obama as his chief official White House photographer. Everyone knows the situation-room photo, everyone knows “Hair Like Mine.” Can you tell in the moment when a picture is going to go viral? Most of the time you’re sort of aware that you’ve captured a really important moment. The day of the bin Laden raid, I think I shot like a thousand photos. The one of the little kid touching his head, it just happened so fast I didn’t realize the significance of the photo until I actually saw it at the end of the day. What is your favorite photo that isn’t famous? It’s a picture of the president on vacation in Hawaii. He’s got his arm around Malia, and on the right side of the frame is Denis McDonough on the phone, about to hand the phone to the president for a conference call with his national-security team after the underwear-bomber incident. It shows when two worlds of being a dad and being a president collide, and that happens when you least expect it. Did having such an intimate look at the inner workings of government for eight years affect how you personally consider politics? I can’t tell you how proud I am to have seen that there are actually a lot of people trying to do good. I was a photographer in the Reagan administration, and I would say the same thing about them. You had to travel everywhere that the president traveled, but you weren’t the president. Did you ever think: Look, do you really need photos of this trip? I’m exhausted. I took one sick day in eight years, and there were times where I didn’t feel good, but I still came in. If you’re truly going to document history, you don’t want to miss anything. You took only one sick day in eight years? I had a colonoscopy, and I had to go under anesthesia. I was ready to go in, but the doctors said it would not be a good idea. "
1672,"This was a terrible year for the tech industry. That’s an odd thing to say at a time of record growth and profits. In 2017, large American tech companies have kept hauling in more money and more users, and — to a degree that might seem dystopian — they continued to expand their foothold in our lives. This was a year in which Amazon created a way for its delivery drivers to let themselves into your house, and Apple created a phone you can unlock with your face. Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point. Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely. Let me explain how this is all playing out. “Platforms” are the shiniest prizes in the tech business. The reason the five most valuable American tech companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft — are also the five most valuable American companies of any kind is that they own these fundamental building blocks of the digital economy, whether they are operating systems, app stores, social networks, cloud servers, or shipping and logistics infrastructure. Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy — an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn’t live in a secluded cabin in the woods. For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren’t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story. "
1673,"WASHINGTON — Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein adamantly defended the character and impartiality of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, as he came head-to-head on Wednesday with an increasingly aggressive campaign by Republicans to discredit the inquiry. The Republicans’ effort received a fresh jolt from the release one night earlier of text messages exchanged last year between an F.B.I. agent, Peter Strzok, and an F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page, describing the possibility of an election victory by President Trump as “terrifying” and saying that Hillary Clinton “just has to win.” Mr. Mueller removed Mr. Strzok from the Russia investigation as soon as he learned of the texts, a step that Mr. Rosenstein praised. Nonetheless, Republicans used the messages as fodder to attack the impartiality of Mr. Mueller during an appearance by Mr. Rosenstein before the House Judiciary Committee. “The public trust in this whole thing is gone,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, summing up sentiments among his party. “It seems to me there are two things you can do: You can disband the Mueller special prosecutor, and you can do what we’ve all called for and appoint a second special counsel to look into this.” But the swelling campaign to undermine Mr. Mueller’s investigation, which has dominated conservative media for days, appeared to have little effect on Mr. Rosenstein, who oversees Mr. Mueller. Mr. Rosenstein said he would only fire Mr. Mueller if he had cause under Justice Department regulations — and he said nothing that has happened so far met that standard. Instead, Mr. Rosenstein mounted a step-by-step defense of Mr. Mueller’s conduct. He noted that department rules prevented Mr. Mueller from taking political affiliation into consideration when hiring for career positions, and he distinguished between officials holding political views and making investigative decisions out of bias. He said Mr. Mueller would be careful not to allow the latter. "
1674,"A shake-up in global coal trading has delivered some oxygen to the struggling American mining industry, driving up exports to energy-hungry countries. But the relief may not last. United States coal sales abroad over the first three quarters of the year surpassed exports for all of 2016, according to government figures. Energy experts project an increase of 46 percent for the full year, adding more than $1 billion to coal companies’ revenues. Those are crucial dollars for an industry trying to stabilize itself after nearly a decade of declining prices, expanding competition from natural gas and wind and solar energy, and bankruptcies. Domestic coal-fired power plants continue to close despite promises of regulatory relief by the Trump administration, making the exports all the more critical. The upturn in exports has been particularly helpful to Appalachia, where production is up 11 percent this year. Coal executives attribute the increase mostly to exports, especially of coal for making steel, known as coking coal. Alpha Natural Resources, which came out of bankruptcy in 2016 and exports half of its coking coal production, opened a new mine this year in economically depressed West Virginia, employing 35 workers. In Virginia, several privately held coal companies are adding shifts and drilling new mine sections for the first time in five years to export more coking coal. “Exports are certainly an opportunity for growth,” said John Stranak, the treasurer at Cloud Peak Energy, a major producer in Wyoming and Montana. “Pricing for exports is outpacing sales domestically. The growth in that arena is certainly where we would like to focus.” "
1675,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, buoyed by a steadily strengthening economy, raised interest rates on Wednesday for a fifth time since the financial crisis and predicted that a proposed tax cut moving through Congress would modestly increase economic growth for the next few years without stoking inflation. As a result, the Fed said it did not expect the legislation, which President Trump has called “rocket fuel” for the economy, to accelerate the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates in 2018 and indicated it remains on track for three rate increases next year. The Fed’s highly anticipated economic assessment, delivered after a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee, amounted to a lukewarm endorsement of the Trump administration’s top economic priority. Mr. Trump has suggested that the $1.5 trillion tax cut could nearly double economic growth to as much as 6 percent, a level far greater than most economists think likely. “My colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists,” said Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman. She said they expected the bill to provide “a modest lift.” Ms. Yellen spoke at a news conference after the Fed announced a widely expected decision to increase its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. The increase continues the Fed’s gradual march toward higher rates, which were cut to near-zero during the financial crisis. Wednesday’s increase is the third time this year that the Fed has raised rates, reflecting its confidence that the economy is in good health. The Fed and Congress are moving in opposite directions. The Fed, in raising rates, is reducing the support it has provided to the economy since the financial crisis. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are preparing a $1.5 trillion tax cut for businesses and individuals with the aim of stimulating economic growth. "
1676,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. The late-night shows all taped on Tuesday before Alabama’s Senate election results came in. But they did have time to respond to some of the day’s news — particularly the video of the Republican candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, riding to the polls on horseback. Watching Mr. Moore’s ride, Stephen Colbert gave him a not-so-friendly greeting. The singer Harry Styles came to James Corden’s aid on Tuesday, hosting “The Late Late Show” after Mr. Corden’s wife went into labor. She later gave birth to a daughter. Mr. Styles took the opportunity to poke fun at his friend. Imagine the TV show “Riverdale” — as Charles Schultz’s “Peanuts.” Seth Meyers took Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla, to task for trying to defend him by pointing out that one of his lawyers “is a Jew.” Dennis Rodman, who is increasingly being called America’s unofficial ambassador to North Korea, will chat with Mr. Colbert on Wednesday. Our film critic was surprised by how much she enjoyed the new Star Wars movie. "
1677,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • For once, Doug Jones said, Alabama declined to take “the wrong fork” at a political crossroads. The former prosecutor defeated Roy Moore in a special election on Tuesday, an almost-unimagined victory for Democrats that shaves Republicans’ Senate majority to a single seat. Here are the full results, and four takeaways from the election, including robust turnout by black voters. There were over 22,000 write-in votes, more than the margin of victory. Mr. Jones’s win could complicate the Republicans’ legislative agenda in Washington. It also amounts to a snub of President Trump, who had broken with most of his party and embraced the scandal-scarred Mr. Moore. • Watch Tuesday night’s speeches by Mr. Jones and Mr. Moore, who has not conceded. • President Trump repeated on Tuesday his contention that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated the allegations. He also described Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, one of his leading critics, as a “lightweight” who “would do anything” for campaign contributions. "
1678,"TOKYO — Toshiba has cleared one of the last remaining hurdles to a planned sale of its microchip subsidiary and moved a step away from the financial brink. The struggling Japanese conglomerate said Wednesday that it had settled a legal dispute with Western Digital, the American data storage company, that threatened to block the microchip deal. Toshiba is counting on the sale to bring in about $14 billion in much-needed cash after its losses on nuclear power projects in the United States left its finances in tatters. Toshiba and Western Digital said Wednesday that they had agreed to withdraw a cluster of lawsuits and arbitration claims over the deal that they had filed against each other. Under that deal, Toshiba plans to cede a majority stake in the chip subsidiary to a group of investors led by the investment firm Bain Capital. “With the concerns about litigation and arbitration removed, we look forward to renewing our collaboration with Western Digital,” Yasuo Naruke, Toshiba executive vice president and chief executive of the microchip unit, Toshiba Memory Corporation, said in a statement. He added, “Toshiba also remains on track to complete our transaction with the consortium led by Bain Capital.” Toshiba signed a deal in September, after months of tumultuous negotiations, to sell 60 percent of Toshiba Memory Corporation to the Bain-led group, whose members also include Apple and other technology companies that rely on Toshiba’s NAND flash memory chips to make their products.

1679,"To the Editor: Re “Democrat Wins Pivotal Alabama Senate Seat” (front page, Dec. 13): I would like to thank the state of Alabama for carrying our country on your backs on Tuesday and pointing us toward humanity and fairness. I thank, with a lump in my throat, the African-American community, which was pivotal in defeating Roy Moore, turning out in tremendous numbers to vote for Doug Jones. According to exit polls, black women voted 98 percent for Mr. Jones. I also give thanks to the righteous Republicans who helped decency win, such as Condoleezza Rice, Jeff Flake and Richard Shelby (write in!). Right on! And thanks to the basketball star Charles Barkley. Your words were a force. Thank you for helping to galvanize the vote. And finally to Doug Jones, and every single voter and volunteer in Alabama who helped shift the Trump trajectory, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. WENDY MISSAN, MILLBURN, N.J. To the Editor: It may be hard to believe, but there was actually a time when the Republican leadership thought that credible sexual misconduct allegations against their own were disqualifying. In 1995, for example, Senator Bob Packwood was forced out of office by his G.O.P. colleagues after he was accused of sexual assault. "

1681,"WASHINGTON — More than one million people signed up last week for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, pushing the total in the federal marketplace to nearly 4.7 million, the Trump administration said Wednesday, days before the annual enrollment period is scheduled to end. The number of sign-ups on HealthCare.gov from Nov. 1 through Saturday was about 17 percent higher than the same time last year. But the final tally is likely to fall short of the 9.2 million who were in plans at the end of the last open enrollment period, which was twice as long as the current one. Insurance counselors around the country, who help consumers enroll, said they had seen a surge of activity despite sharp increases in premiums, a smaller selection of health plans and confusion about the future of the Affordable Care Act after a year in which Republicans have repeatedly tried to dismantle the law. About 1.4 million new customers have signed up this year, and 3.3 million people returned to HealthCare.gov to select the same plan or a different one for 2018. People who have coverage this year and take no action may have their coverage automatically renewed. If their plan is no longer available, the government may assign them to another health plan offered by the same company or a different insurer, and that could significantly increase overall enrollment. The numbers reported on Wednesday were for the 39 states that use HealthCare.gov. They do not include data for 11 states that run their own insurance marketplaces. "

1683,"On the day before the Alabama election, I found myself explaining that I needed to get to work despite the bombing at my subway station because there were women coming in to talk about having been sexually assaulted by the president. Really, we live in interesting times. The bombing — in which no one was seriously hurt but the bomber — has already faded from the memory of New York’s hardened mass transit riders. But the rest of the story is reverberating. We’re in the middle of a women’s uprising that really does feel like a new wave, maybe the one that could actually get the country within shouting distance of power equality. Think about it. This week Roy Moore got skunked in Alabama, thanks in great part to female voters who went for the Democratic candidate instead. Then the U.S. Senate got ready for another woman member — Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith is going to replace Al Franken, who is resigning in the sexual harassment scandal. We have a revolt against sexual harassment that’s running through the political, entertainment, restaurant and communications worlds. And we’re finally trying to focus on the Donald Trump sleaziness sagas that the nation didn’t deal with in 2016. Trump is really behind everything — his election jarred and frightened women so much that there was nothing to do but rebel and try to change the world. “I think it’s very much because of President Trump,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. “For me the Women’s March was still the most extraordinary political moment of my lifetime.” Gillibrand is a leader of the antiharassment campaign in Congress. This week, as some of the women who had stories about Trump’s own hands-on history were talking to the media, she called on the president to resign. Trump responded — as only he can — with a Twitter attack, calling Gillibrand a political “lightweight” who used to come to him “begging” for campaign contributions, “and would do anything for them.” "
1684,"Over the last eight years, political analysts had come to think that Democrats were at a distinct disadvantage in midterm elections, since their younger and nonwhite coalition was less likely to turn out than older and white voters. It is time to retire that notion. Tuesday in Alabama, Democrats benefited from strong turnout that plainly exceeded midterm levels, while white working-class Republicans voted in weaker numbers. It was enough to send Doug Jones to the Senate instead of Roy Moore, in one of the reddest states in the country. This has been a pattern in all of this year’s major special elections, as well as in the Virginia general election. It is consistent with a long-term trend toward stronger turnout by the party out of power in off-year elections. It also suggests that President Trump’s less educated and affluent version of the Republican coalition has eroded the party’s traditional turnout advantage. To the extent that there had been any weakness in Democratic turnout so far this year, it had been among black voters. In Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, for instance, black turnout barely eclipsed midterm levels even as all other voters surged well past it. A similar pattern appeared in Virginia. In majority-black Petersburg, the turnout was even lower than it was in 2013, even as turnout surged in Northern Virginia. But in Alabama, black turnout was far stronger than white Republican turnout, based on county-level data and the exit polls. Black voters probably represented an even larger share of the electorate than they did in 2012 or 2008. "
1685,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • American Democrats are celebrating an almost-unimaginable Senate victory that shaves the Republican majority to a single seat. A key factor: African-American voters’ distaste for Roy Moore, the Republican candidate in a special election in Alabama, uncorked even deeper alarm over his most prominent backer, President Trump. Here’s how writers from across the political spectrum reacted to Mr. Moore’s defeat. The Democrats urged the Republicans to delay any vote on their nearly completed, sweeping tax bill until the winner, Doug Jones, above, can take office — a request almost certain to be rejected. _____ "
1686,"I love the acknowledgments sections of books. I love what they say and what they do not say. I love what they accidentally say. I love the ways families are discussed, and how the truth about the wretchedness of book-writing finally comes tumbling out, and the combination of neuroticism and relief, pride and latent terror. It is not, however, fashionable to love acknowledgments, and for good reason: Most of them are numbingly predictable in their architecture, little Levittowns of gratitude. The critic Sam Sacks wrote a splendid rant about this for The New Yorker five years ago. “The most radical experimentalist,” he complained, “adheres to the most mindless acknowledgments-page formula.” In my job as a book critic for this newspaper — a role I leave today; is this why I’m contemplating codas, endings? — I have learned what Sacks means. Authors thank their publishers for their patience, and their editors for their brilliance and vision. (“She saw what this book was supposed to be long before I did.”) They thank their agents for betting on them, their friends and family for tolerating their anxiety, and their talented colleagues for invaluable comments that transformed leaden first scribbles into fine threads of spun gold. They thank resourceful librarians, indispensable research assistants and diligent fact-checkers; the foundations that gave them money and the experts who lent them wisdom; and the many universities — assuming the authors are academics — that invited them to conferences to refine their ideas. But even within this rote exercise, even amid the dreary name-checking calisthenics, truths seep out. Some revelations are inadvertent, and not especially flattering to the author. In my head, I have an informal taxonomy of acknowledgments, and one species is the Name-Dropper. Do writers know the kind of insecurity they’re betraying when they do their Trump Towers of thanks, their gold-plated word-piles of self-regard? "
1687,"Combatants in the annual “War on Christmas” have some new data to chew on, thanks to a survey released this week by the Pew Research Center. While many doubt that Christmas is embattled, as some conservative pundits contend, the new study does suggest American attitudes are changing. The Pew study, based on interviews conducted in recent weeks with 1,503 adults, found that while a vast majority of Americans still celebrate Christmas, most find the religious elements of the holiday are emphasized less than in the past — and few of them care about that change. Like much else in the United States, a strong partisan divide runs through the survey results, with responses from Republicans seeming to place an emphasis on religion and those from Democrats on secularism. [ALSO READ: How the ‘War on Christmas’ Was Created] But the data complicate efforts to portray Christmas as either in mortal danger or in no trouble at all, a central issue in a yearslong debate over whether Christmas in America respects Christianity or has been undermined by liberalism. Ninety percent of Americans celebrate Christmas in some form, a figure that has “hardly budged at all” since its survey in 2013, the center said. "
1688,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson are once again at odds over how to deal with nuclear-armed North Korea after Mr. Tillerson declared on Tuesday that the United States was ready to open talks with the North “without precondition.” The secretary’s comments were remarkably conciliatory for an administration that has repeatedly threatened North Korea with military action, and ruled out any negotiations, if it did not curb its missile and nuclear programs. But a few hours later, the White House distanced itself from his overture. In an unusual statement released to reporters on Tuesday evening, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Mr. Trump’s position on North Korea had not changed — namely, that talks were pointless if the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, continued to menace his neighbors. “North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world,” she said. “North Korea’s actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea.” It was only the latest example of a public rift between the president and his chief diplomat over North Korea. In October, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to open diplomatic lines to Pyongyang. But this time, the comments follow reports that the White House is laying the groundwork for the secretary’s departure from the State Department and his replacement by Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director. "
1689,"ISTANBUL — Leaders and officials of Muslim nations declared East Jerusalem the Palestinian capital on Wednesday at a summit meeting in Istanbul, producing the strongest response yet to President Trump’s decision to recognize the city as Israel’s capital. The gathering of the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation was held to formulate a unified response from the Muslim world to Mr. Trump’s decision last week. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was the host; the country currently holds the chair of the I.O.C., and Mr. Erdogan has long championed the Palestinian cause. The meeting condemned in a communiqué Mr. Trump’s “unilateral” and “dangerous declaration” as an effort to change the status of Jerusalem. It said that it considered the action a violation of United Nations resolutions and legally null and void, and that it would hold the United States liable for all consequences of not retracting its decision. It also said it took Mr. Trump’s declaration as an announcement that the United States was withdrawing from its role as a sponsor of peace for the region. Among the 30 leaders present were Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader; King Abdullah II of Jordan; President Michel Aoun of Lebanon; President Hassan Rouhani of Iran; and the emirs of Kuwait and Qatar. Officials were present representing the full 57 members, Mr. Erdogan said. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela also attended by special invitation of Mr. Erdogan. A conservative Muslim, Mr. Erdogan has made the Palestinians’ fate a leading cause of his politics, styling himself as a leader of the wider Muslim community. He criticized some Arab states for what he called their weak response to Mr. Trump’s decision, suggesting they were intimidated by the United States. "
1690,"MEXICO CITY — Protests snaking through city streets, nighttime curfews, a raucous political battle over a president’s re-election: Honduras has been seized by a crisis since a disputed  vote last month. The country has lived through a version of this turmoil before. Eight years ago, a leftist president was ousted by a coup in a fight over what his opponents said was a plan to overturn the constitutional ban on a second presidential term. The resistance movement that sprang up to support him has endured, and the discord that split Honduran society then still defines today’s divisions. Both in 2009 and now, the return of stability in Honduras is important to the United States, which seeks a president there who can be counted on to support American policies to stem the flow of drugs and migrants from reaching the Texas border. The question is whether the United States is willing to overlook a possibly fraudulent election to ensure that outcome. President Juan Orlando Hernández, a conservative hoping to win a second term, has been a willing partner on the concerns that matter most to the United States. And as he increased control over every branch of the government since his election in 2013, no objections were raised from the Obama or Trump administrations — not even when his handpicked Supreme Court justices found a circuitous way to lift the prohibition on running for re-election. "
1691,"WASHINGTON — Small tech companies, consumer groups and many celebrities have been up in arms for weeks about a proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle landmark rules that guarantee an open internet. But in one speech, Ajit Pai, the chairman of the agency, called the complaints “hysteria” and “hot air.” In another, he dismissed criticism that by pushing the change, he was doing the bidding of companies like Verizon, his former employer. He joked that his nightmare scenario would be refereeing a dispute between Verizon and Sinclair Broadcasting, another company he has been accused of helping with his policies. “How do you choose,” he said, “between a longtime love and a newfound crush?” The agency was expected to vote on Thursday to dismantle the so-called net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for higher quality delivery to consumers. It would also dial back the stance established during the Obama administration that broadband should be regulated like a utility. The three Republican commissioners, including Mr. Pai, have said they will vote for the proposal, outnumbering the two Democratic commissioners. Passing the plan would be the biggest victory in Mr. Pai’s eventful 11-month tenure as the head of the F.C.C. Under his leadership, the agency has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers. All of this activity has made Mr. Pai, 44, a former lawyer for Verizon and a longtime government bureaucrat, the target of many angry protests. In recent days, government officials — including 18 state attorneys generals and dozens of Democratic members of Congress — have asked the F.C.C. to delay the vote. On Wednesday, the attorneys general said that many of the 23 million public comments that had been filed to the agency about net neutrality appeared to be fraudulent. Mr. Pai has ignored the delay requests. But Mr. Pai’s changes have also made him a pivotal official in the Trump administration’s rush to shed regulations. The effects of his decisions have rippled across the industries Mr. Pai oversees. The looser rules on media ownership, for example, has enabled Sinclair Broadcasting’s $3.9 billion bid for Tribune. "
1692,"The first election I can remember was the race between George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis in 1988. Dressed in footie pajamas, I stayed up late with my political die-hard parents. They tried and failed to avoid swearing as the map on television turned red. “Who are we cheering for?” I asked them. “The blue people,” my dad said, because the red people “don’t like us.” Who is “us?” I asked. “Black people,” he said. You could call my dad’s opinion reductionist. Or you could acknowledge that in the Alabama Senate election on Tuesday, the red people voted for Roy Moore — a guy who said the slavery era was the last time America was “great.” I stayed up late on Tuesday, excited by exit polls showing that some 30 percent of the Alabamians going to the polls were black, a higher percentage than in either of the presidential elections Barack Obama won. Mr. Jones rode to a one-and-a-half-point victory in one of the reddest states in America thanks to black voters. That was his only real path to the Senate: Whites in Alabama have a longstanding preference for Republicans, and blacks, 27 percent of the state’s population, make up a large chunk of Democratic voters there. Most of Alabama’s white voters did choose Mr. Moore, either despite or because of his support for slavery, the allegations that he had sexually assaulted girls as young as 14 and the fact that he was twice removed as a justice on the Alabama Supreme Court for disobeying federal court orders. Alabama’s black voters overwhelmingly chose Mr. Jones, and turned out in force despite numerous obstacles placed in front of them. The state’s voter ID law — passed in 2011 to undermine “the black power structure,” as a legislator had described it — has an outsize impact on black and Latino voters because they are less likely to have the financial resources (for transportation and a fee) and get time off from work to get an ID. On Tuesday some black voters reportedly received text messages that told them to report to the wrong polling places. Others found that they had erroneously been marked “inactive,” so they had to fill out a form and update their address before they could vote. "
1693,"President Trump’s nominee to oversee the Environmental Protection Agency’s chemical safety division on Wednesday withdrew his name from consideration for the post in the face of mounting opposition. The nominee, Michael L. Dourson, a longtime researcher whose studies often bolstered safety claims by manufacturers of pesticides, flame retardants and other products under federal scrutiny as possible public health hazards, had been working as an adviser to the agency while awaiting confirmation. But the Senate never scheduled a confirmation vote for Mr. Dourson, who resigned from his job at the University of Cincinnati in October. And in recent weeks, two Republican senators came forward to say they would not support him. Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware and a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, had pushed his colleagues to reject Mr. Dourson. He said Wednesday that his objections were not partisan. “I sincerely believe he is the wrong person to hold this important position, and it’s become clear that, even with a Republican majority in the Senate, he could not be confirmed,” Mr. Carper said in a statement. “Dr. Dourson, an individual who has spent most of his career promoting less protective chemical safety standards, had no business overseeing our nation’s chemical safety laws.” Mr. Dourson notified the White House late on Wednesday of his decision to withdraw his name, according to a Senate aide, adding that Mr. Dourson would not remain at the agency. "
1694,"In 1995, Drew Dixon was working her dream job as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, helping to oversee a chart-topping album and a ubiquitous single by Method Man and Mary J. Blige. But as her star rose, Ms. Dixon, then 24, was spiraling into depression, she said, because of prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, Russell Simmons, the rap mogul and co-founder of the label. On work calls, he would talk graphically about how she aroused him. At a staff meeting, he asked her to sit on his lap. He regularly exposed his erect penis to her. Late that year, Mr. Simmons raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment, Ms. Dixon said. She quit Def Jam soon after. “I was broken,” she said. In recent interviews, four women spoke on the record about a pattern of violent sexual behavior by Mr. Simmons, disclosing incidents from 1988 to 2014. Three of the women say that he raped them. In each case, numerous friends and associates said they were told of the incidents at the time. The women said they were inspired to come forward in the aftermath of the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, as victims’ stories have been newly elevated and more often believed. Told in detail about the rape accusations and other misconduct, Mr. Simmons, 60, said in a statement: “I vehemently deny all these allegations. These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual.” "
1695,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — As supporters of Roy S. Moore on Wednesday sifted the results of his stunning loss in Alabama, one number jumped out: About 22,800 write-in votes were cast, more than the gap separating Mr. Moore, the scandal-plagued Republican, from the victorious Doug Jones, the first Democratic senator elected in the state in a quarter-century. Many of the votes are thought to have been cast by Republicans displeased by Mr. Moore but unwilling to cross party lines, and who wanted to register a protest. “I would bet strongly it was good Republican voters who couldn’t stomach voting for Roy Moore, but didn’t want to stay home,’’ said Brent Buchanan, a Republican strategist in Alabama. “It was a protest vote.’’ One was Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Republican dean of Alabama’s congressional delegation, who said over the weekend that he could not vote for Mr. Moore and had written in the name of “a distinguished Republican’’ whom he declined to identify. Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former White House adviser, said on Monday at a Moore rally that there was “a special place in hell” for Republicans like Mr. Shelby. An array of factors fueled Mr. Jones’s upset win in a deeply conservative state, including a surge in black turnout and pervasive frustration with Mr. Moore among well-heeled suburban residents who ordinarily push Republicans to victory. Some strategists suggested that the write-in votes also tipped the race, depriving Mr. Moore, who was accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls, of the support that a less-compromised Republican would have garnered. “Those are people who value democracy and intellectual consistency and conservative ideals so much that they were still willing to go to the polls and vote,” said Collier Tynes, a Republican who was chief of staff to Dianne Bentley when she was first lady of Alabama. But they are unwilling, she said, “to compromise human decency and conservative ideals.” "
1696,"In the fall of 1987, a Nashville woman named Teresa Harris decided she’d had enough of her boss’s harassment and quit. Ms. Harris was one of just two female managers at Forklift Systems, a construction equipment supplier, and for two years, she had endured leers, propositions and vulgar “jokes” from the company’s owner, Charles Hardy. (Mr. Hardy had a fondness for jingling change in his front pants pocket and asking Ms. Harris to fish quarters out.) But the final straw came when Ms. Harris told Mr. Hardy she had landed a big client. “What did you do, Teresa?” Mr. Hardy responded, according to testimony. “Promise the guy some bugger on Saturday night?” As Ms. Harris later testified in the sexual harassment case she brought against the company, it was this penchant for trivializing her business acumen, not Mr. Hardy’s pocket change habits, that cut the deepest. “The comments about my ability to do my job and that I was stupid and I was dumb devastated me,” she said. “I hated walking in there.” President Trump’s tweet on Tuesday insinuating that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York used sex to extract campaign contributions brought this distinctly demeaning form of harassment into sharp relief. Rather than objectify its target as alluring, it dismisses her as incompetent. It tells the woman, and everyone else in her workplace, that she can succeed only if she trades on her sexuality and not because she is smart, savvy or resourceful. There’s a reason a powerful woman so often gets smeared as having “slept her way to the top.” Of course, harassment that manifests as desire (however brutal or twisted) conveys, too, that a woman is valuable at work only insofar as she provides sexual amusement. But suggesting that a woman’s sexuality is responsible for her demonstrable achievements — such as, say, winning election to the United States Senate — is an insult precisely because it implicates her in the harasser’s own low opinion of women’s abilities. Slurs like Mr. Trump’s reinforce the idea that without sex to offer, women are worthless, in the same way harassers do when they demand that women fork over sexual favors to have the chance to achieve with their legitimate labors what their male colleagues do. "
1697,"ALBANY — Amid the ongoing national reckoning over sexual harassment, New York’s junior senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, has been front and center in the debate, denouncing the unsavory actions of powerful men in all walks of life, from President Trump to fellow Democratic senators like Al Franken. And so it was on Wednesday that New York’s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, was asked about his response to sexual harassment in state government. The exchange did not go smoothly. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat seeking a third term next year, was asked about allegations against Sam Hoyt, a former senior aide, and what he could have done differently to address such behavior. The governor tried to turn the question — posited by a public radio reporter, Karen DeWitt — into a broader discussion of sexual harassment in journalism and other fields. “When you say it’s state government, you do a disservice to women, with all due respect, even though you’re a woman,” the governor said, during an impromptu news conference here. “It’s not government, it’s society,” he added. “It’s not just one person in one area.” But the assertion that Ms. DeWitt was doing a disservice, rather than doing her job, was met with a shock in some quarters, and a scramble by the governor’s own aides to clarify his remarks. Melissa DeRosa, the secretary to the governor, responded to one comment on Twitter by reiterating that the governor was saying that it “is a disservice to limit the problem to state government.” “Must be dealt with across the board,” said Ms. DeRosa, who was appointed in April, by Mr. Cuomo, as the first woman to serve as secretary, the top unelected position in the state. “It exists everywhere in society and must be addressed holistically.” She later added, “Limiting the problem to one man, political party or profession misses the whole point of the #MeToo moment.” "

arlier this week, I experienced a bit of local media whiplash. On Saturday, on the front page of The Australian, there was an article declaring that Australia’s spy agency had identified 10 local and state political candidates with ties to Chinese intelligence, part of China’s plans to interfere in Australian democracy. The politicians were not named and the sources were anonymous, but the tone was clear: Be afraid, China is not your friend. The next day in The Australian, also out front, there was an article on why that fear might be misguided. The chairman of the Australia China Business Council, John Brumby, among others, encouraged Australians to remember that their 26 years without a recession could not have happened without China’s rise. This time, the message — China is good for Australia — was just as loud and clear. So which is it? Should Australia treat China as an enemy, or focus on the relationship’s economic benefits? Is the country Australia’s friend, or foe? This, of course, is what Australia is trying to figure out. Legislation targeting foreign interference that was introduced last week by the prime minister is both a reflection of that struggle and a trigger for more debate — all of which I’ll explore in detail in a coming article. "
1699,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — For Janet Maycock, Tuesday’s election of the Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama was personal. The allegations of sexual misconduct against teenage girls by Mr. Jones’s opponent, Roy S. Moore, the conservative former judge, had stoked Ms. Maycock’s own memories of being molested by an older employee in the restaurant where she worked when she was 17, and of feeling like she could never speak up about it. “It made me more adamant to keep a man like that out of the Senate,” said Ms. Maycock, 67, who is black and was among numerous women celebrating at Mr. Jones’s victory party. She wanted, she said, “to make a stand for women who have the courage to speak out.” Depending on one’s point of view, Tuesday’s election was a referendum on decency, a test of the credibility of the news media, or a rallying cry against outside interference in Alabama politics. But it was also the first election in the #MeToo era and a measure of the deep divide among women over personal issues like sexual harassment, religion and race. Exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool suggested a majority of women, 57 percent, backed Mr. Jones, compared with 42 percent of men. But the polls also showed women as sharply divided by race, with about 98 percent of black women supporting Mr. Jones, mobilizing heavily to carry out a long tradition of supporting Democrats here. "
1700,"The political winds are shifting with all the subtlety of a hurricane. Doug Jones’s defeat of Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate special election is yet the latest signal that the accommodators of Donald Trump, those who have normalized and bolstered him, the gutless, schismatic conservatives who abandoned principle to follow a pariah, will have hell to pay in 2018. Yes, Roy Moore was defeated, but it can never be fully erased from history or memory that he was endorsed by this president and supported by the Republican National Committee. All of Roy Moore’s sins are their sins, and they will wear that scarlet R straight into the midterms. We should also note that Jones didn’t win by a landslide. The margin was thin as a rail. Moore still won the Republican vote and the white vote and, yes, the “white born-again Christian” vote. These people contorted their faith to support a man accused of unthinkable transgressions. They made a mockery of Christian faith and moral fidelity. But as the Apostle Paul wrote in Galatians, “God is not mocked.” The Resistance is marching on, emboldened, with a strategy and proof that the strategy can work. The Alabama election has demonstrated once again that resisters aren’t just angry; they are motivated and insistent that the past will not defeat the future. It demonstrated once again that black voters, particularly black women, have been summoned to save America from its worst impulses and to establish that they are the most loyal and crucial constituency of a Democratic Party that still doesn’t grant them enough respect or deference, instead often pleading in the final hours after efforts to win more white voters fall short. "
1701,"After a Democrat prevailed in a special Senate election in Alabama, a ruby-red Republican state, President Trump offered on Wednesday a truncated and misleading account of his role in the race. Mr. Trump had endorsed Roy S. Moore, the Republican who was accused of sexual misconduct by several women and was narrowly defeated on Tuesday night by Doug Jones, a Democrat and former prosecutor. By early Wednesday morning, the president sought to distance himself from the loss by reminding his Twitter followers that he had doubts about Mr. Moore months ago. Back then, Mr. Trump supported Luther Strange, the Republican who was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. “The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post. “I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!” But that is a highly amended account of the president’s efforts in the Alabama race. Mr. Trump officially endorsed Mr. Strange on Aug. 8 as he ran against Mr. Moore and several other Republicans in the primary election a week later. "
1702,"Stemming the tide of rising economic insecurity for service workers, a major union has won significant job protection and increased pay for about 20,000 AT&T wireless employees, as well as a commitment to bring work back from overseas. The deal, struck Wednesday, comes as President Trump has made clear his desire to keep low- and middle-skilled jobs in this country. The union, for its part, offered to help make the case for AT&T’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which the Trump administration has opposed. The support of a union representing hundreds of thousands of working-class voters may have proved compelling to AT&T as it faces off against the White House. “We tried to emphasize to the company that we could help you or hurt you,” said Dennis G. Trainor, a vice president of the Communications Workers of America, which represents the employees. The union called in mid-November for approval of the acquisition. Service industries provide by far the largest share of American jobs. But in many service fields — notably the traditional retail sector — workers have found it difficult to gain traction on issues like low pay, high turnover and unpredictable scheduling. The AT&T wireless workers had been without a long-term contract since February and staged a strike in May that lasted less than three days. "
1703,"In late 2008, at a meeting with academics at the London School of Economics, Queen Elizabeth II  asked why no one seemed to have anticipated the world’s worst financial crisis in the postwar period. The so-called Great Recession, which had begun in late 2008 and would run until mid-2009, was set off by the sudden collapse of sky-high prices for housing and other assets — something that is obvious in retrospect but that, nevertheless, no one seemed to see coming. Are we about to make the same mistake? All too likely, yes. Certainly, the American economy is doing well, and emerging economies are picking up steam. But global asset prices are once again rising rapidly above their underlying value — in other words, they are in a bubble. Considering the virtual silence among economists about the danger they pose, one has to wonder whether in a year or two, when those bubbles eventually burst, the queen will not be asking the same sort of question. This silence is all the more surprising considering how much more pervasive bubbles are today than they were 10 years ago. While in 2008 bubbles were largely confined to the American housing and credit markets, they are now to be found in almost every corner of the world economy. As the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan recently warned, years of highly unorthodox monetary policy by the world’s major central banks has created a global government bond bubble, with long-term interest rates plumbing historically low levels. He might have added that this bubble has hardly been confined to the sovereign bond market. Indeed, stock values are at lofty heights that have been reached only three times in the last century. At the same time, housing bubbles are all too evident in countries like Australia, Britain, Canada and China, while interest rates have been driven down to unusually low levels for high-yield debt and emerging-market corporate debt. "
1704,"Health care, Social Security, Medicare and other social programs are all on the chopping block as the Republican-led Congress scrambles to make up for the revenue lost to its planned tax cuts. The Pentagon, however, remains a sacred cow, destined to receive yet more money. The military budget is now $643 billion. The actual and potential threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Islamic extremists are all serious, but giving the Pentagon another huge increase defies common sense. The Pentagon already wastes about one in five of the taxpayer dollars it receives, according to a Pentagon-commissioned study. And the United States, which has plenty of other urgent needs, already spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined. The opening bid for the 2018 defense budget came from President Trump, who in May proposed $677 billion. That was $54 billion above a budget cap set by Congress in 2011, after the 2008 financial crisis led to demands for fiscal restraint. Then last month, Congress upped his ante by passing a 2018 military authorization bill that would increase spending to around $700 billion, some $85 billion above the legal cap. Mr. Trump signed that bill into law on Tuesday. For the moment, that increase is a fiction. Before it can occur, Congress must remove the 2011 caps and appropriate the money. That is the focus of the present budget battle on Capitol Hill. Republican leaders reportedly want to increase military spending by at least Mr. Trump’s original figure of $54 billion and nonmilitary spending by $37 billion. Democratic leaders are insisting on equal increases for both categories. What’s not clear is that the Pentagon needs any increase until it can get a handle on waste, which a 2015 study estimated at $125 billion, about one-fifth of its budget. The Pentagon had a virtual blank check after the Sept. 11 attacks, as it went after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and then turned its attention to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Military spending in 2017 is already as high as during the armed forces buildup of the 1980s. The proposed increase, coming after the United States has withdrawn thousands of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, would take it even higher. Mr. Trump, bedazzled by men in uniform and enthralled by displays of weaponry, says more money is needed to build bigger and better forces. And senior commanders have lobbied hard for a big increase to upgrade a military they say lacks readiness, meaning the training and equipment needed to fight. "
1705,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. They have a deal. House and Senate Republicans reached an agreement on a tax bill that keeps the party on track for final votes next week. President Trump delivered what was dubbed a closing argument for the bill from the White House, above. The key provisions, as described by a senior Congressional aide: The corporate tax rate drops to 21 percent in 2018. Individuals can deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes. The corporate alternative minimum tax gets nixed. Here’s the latest from Capitol Hill. _____ 2. “We knew the world was looking at us.” Black voters were crucial in the victory of Doug Jones, above, over Roy Moore to represent Alabama in the Senate. The share of African-American voters, including the man quoted above, was even higher than in 2008 and 2012. Here’s how writers from across the political spectrum reacted to the outcome.

1707,"WASHINGTON — House and Senate Republicans faced a new round of uncertainty on Thursday about the fate of their $1.5 trillion tax bill with the possible defection of a Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, amid continuing questions about how the bill will be paid for and how much of the benefits will flow to low- and middle-income people versus corporations. Republicans, who reached agreement Wednesday on a merged version of the House and Senate tax plans, expect to unveil the final bill on Friday and vote on the legislation early next week so that it can be sent to President Trump before Christmas. But those plans were thrown into some disarray on Thursday when Mr. Rubio said that he would vote no on the bill unless it included a greater expansion of the child tax credit, which he and another Republican senator, Mike Lee of Utah, have been pushing for to benefit lower-income individuals. “I think my requests have been pretty reasonable and consistent and direct,” Mr. Rubio said. A spokesman for Mr. Lee said he was undecided on the bill. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Lee have been pressing Republican leaders to bolster the child tax credit to make it more generous for low-income families. That change would further drive up the cost of the tax bill, which can add no more than $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over a decade if the bill is to pass without Democrat support. In a tweet on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Rubio needled Republican leadership, saying, “Tax negotiators didn’t have much trouble finding a way to lower” the top tax bracket and to have the corporate tax cut take effect a year early.

1710,"We don’t know what exactly Omarosa Manigault Newman did at the White House, but we do know the number one skill she brought to the table — being fired. Donald Trump has now axed her four times: on “The Apprentice” in 2004, on “The Celebrity Apprentice” in 2011 and 2013 and on Tuesday evening. She is really, really good at getting canned. Maybe her true purpose was to remind America of the time when Mr. Trump was popular because he fired people like her, including her. The Trump administration clearly looked at Doug Jones’s victory in Alabama on Tuesday and decided to reach out to black female voters by firing one. This is consistent with Mr. Trump’s previous attempts to bond with black voters by not allowing them to live in his apartment buildings, coming up with new ways to suppress the black vote, and threatening to send the National Guard to the South Side of Chicago. In fact, Mr. Trump is probably sitting around right now drinking Diet Coke, watching TV, and dreaming up a plan to make Jeff Sessions hold every black voter’s hand in the voting booth while whispering sweet nothings about the Ku Klux Klan. When Steve Bannon got fired, people cheered. When Anthony Scaramucci got fired, people laughed, because most of us have had bouts of flu that lasted longer than he did. But now the Trump administration is giving me a chance to relax during the stressful holiday season by firing someone I can feel neutral about. "
1711,"B
ecause she didn’t know what to tell her children, she tried not to tell them anything. When they asked where their father was, she gave flimsy excuses: Yes, he came home last night, but he left while you were still asleep. He’s working late, he’s working early, he just stepped out, he’ll be back soon. “You just missed him,” she found herself repeating. The strategy worked, for a few days at least, with the youngest three. They were all under 5 and were used to the world going about its strange business without them. But then there was Kelly. She was 8 and sharp-eyed, a good student who preferred English to Spanish and wanted to someday be a doctor, or maybe a gymnast, and who had watched a presidential candidate on television say he wanted to send people back to Mexico, where both her parents grew up. Kelly came home from school one day in October last year and demanded to know where her father was. Because his construction job started so early in the morning, Javier was usually the first home. That was part of how he and Kelly’s mother, T., fell in love. They boarded in the same house more than a decade ago, when she was 19 and freshly arrived in South Florida, having followed her sister from their small village in southern Mexico. T., who is being identified by her first initial to shield her identity, quit school after sixth grade. She helped her parents plant corn and beans but dreamed of something better for herself and her infant son; she decided to leave him in her mother’s care and support him from afar. Javier was from the same region, and because he finished work early, he cooked for her while she was still out in the Florida sun. The food was delicious and tasted like home. Soon they were a couple, and then Kelly was born, and her father, who fainted with anxiety in the birthing room, adored her, and she adored him back. “He’s late from work,” T. told her daughter. But Kelly wasn’t having it. Before heading to school that morning, she saw uniformed men come to the door and ask her mother for her father’s passport; she heard her mother on the phone, asking what had happened, what to do. “Don’t lie to me,” Kelly said, and started to cry. “Where did they take him? What did he do?” By now T. knew. One of her first phone calls was to an immigrant advocate and former refugee named Nora Sándigo, who, in this poor area south of Miami, was the most powerful person in many people’s worlds: She knew lawyers, county commissioners, even members of Congress. After T. called her, Sándigo quickly discovered that Javier had been detained by the Department of Homeland Security. T. didn’t tell Kelly the details she had learned from Sándigo, or from Javier, when he was finally able to make a brief call. That they arrested him just a few yards away from their home, as he stood waiting for his ride to work. That now he was on the edge of the Everglades, in a gray-and-tan detention center adjacent to a state prison, a half-hour’s drive away, a distance that, for T., had suddenly become unbridgeable. “He was arrested,” she told Kelly, simply. “We have no papers to be here, like you do.” “Will they take me, too?” Kelly asked. She didn’t know what papers her mother was talking about, what this thing was that she had and her parents didn’t. "
1712,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The Walt Disney Company reached a roughly $52 billion deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in a once unthinkable deal that — if approved by regulators — promises to reshape Hollywood, the tech industry and the competitive world of streaming.

And Mr. Murdoch, 86, must now divide up a lifetime of spoils. He moved quickly to reassure investors. “Are we retreating? Absolutely not,” he said. “We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.” _____ "
1713,"MOSCOW — With an eye to his presidential candidacy, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promoted his domestic record throughout his annual national news conference on Thursday. But he did save a few jabs for the United States on election meddling and Olympic doping — at one point asking members of Congress, “Are you normal at all?” This was Mr. Putin’s 13th such news conference, and the formula has become so worn that it is sometimes compared to the movie “Groundhog Day,” in which the hero relives the same moment repeatedly. The nearly four-hour marathon, broadcast live nationwide, started with a broad query about why Mr. Putin was running for re-election in March 2018. This gave him an opening to unleash a welter of positive economic data, seemingly with the intent of reminding Russians how much the country has improved since he first became president, in 2000. The questions drifted along on domestic matters for a while, until a couple of foreign correspondents, usually planted in advance, switched the topic briefly to possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and to North Korea. On the collusion question, Mr. Putin essentially echoed President Trump, saying the accusations were an invention of enemies who wanted to reverse the election results. Any contacts with Russian diplomats or other officials were normal, he said, and suggesting otherwise is “spy hysteria.” “This is all made up by people who oppose Trump to make his work look illegitimate,” Mr. Putin said, adding that there is a “deep state” in the United States that fosters hostility toward Moscow: “Do they want to ban all contact?” "

1715,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to dismantle rules regulating the businesses that connect consumers to the internet, granting broadband companies the power to potentially reshape Americans’ online experiences. The agency scrapped the so-called net neutrality regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or certain content. The federal government will also no longer regulate high-speed internet delivery as if it were a utility, like phone service. The action reversed the agency’s 2015 decision, during the Obama administration, to have stronger oversight over broadband providers as Americans have migrated to the internet for most communications. It reflected the view of the Trump administration and the new F.C.C. chairman that unregulated business will eventually yield innovation and help the economy. It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, so consumers will not see any of the potential changes right away. But the political and legal fight started immediately. Numerous Democrats on Capitol Hill called for a bill that would reestablish the rules, and several Democratic state attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, said they would file a suit to stop the change. Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action. The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, vigorously defended the repeal before the vote. He said the rollback of the rules would eventually benefit consumers because broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast could offer them a wider variety of service options. His two fellow Republican commissioners also supported the change, giving them a 3-to-2 majority. "
1716,"DECATUR, Ala. — One evening last fall, an informant for the Morgan County sheriff entered the office of a small construction business near this old river town and, he said, secretly installed spyware on a company computer. He had no warrant. The sheriff, Ana Franklin, wanted to know who was leaking information about her to a blogger known as the Morgan County Whistleblower. The blogger had been zeroing in on the sheriff’s finances, specifically $150,000 that by law should have gone toward feeding inmates in the county jail. Instead it had been invested in a now-bankrupt used-car dealership run by a convicted bank swindler. Now the sheriff has become ensnared, along with others, in a wide-ranging government investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking at her stewardship of taxpayer money, as well as the dealership and its financial links to prominent people in town, including several state law enforcement agents, according to more than a half-dozen people who say they have spoken to the F.B.I. Government divers recently searched the bottom of a creek for evidence. What, if anything, investigators have uncovered is not known. But The New York Times found that since taking office in 2011, Sheriff Franklin has failed to comply with court orders, has threatened critics with legal action and has not publicly accounted for tens of thousands of dollars raised through charity events. Her activities point to questions about the broad powers afforded America’s county sheriffs, newly emboldened in the era of President Trump. Unlike appointed municipal police chiefs, sheriffs answer only to voters, giving them often-unfettered dominion not just over county law enforcement but over the jail and the lucrative service contracts that go with it. "
1717,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Thursday that his administration was answering “a call to action” by rolling back regulations on environmental protections, health care, financial services and other industries as he made a push to showcase his accomplishments near the end of his first year in office. The remarks highlighted an area where Mr. Trump has perhaps done more to change the policies of his predecessor than any other, with regulatory shifts that have affected wide sections of the economy. “We are just getting started,” Mr. Trump said, speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. He described progress so far as the “most far-reaching regulatory reform” in United States history, a claim he did not back up. “We have decades of excess regulation to remove,” he added. “To help launch the next phase of growth, prosperity and freedom, I am challenging my cabinet to find and remove every single outdated, unlawful and excessive regulation currently on the books.” Echoing his days as a real estate developer with the flair of a groundbreaking, Mr. Trump used an oversize pair of scissors to cut a ribbon his staff had set up in front of two piles of paper, representing government regulations in 1960 (20,000 pages, he said), and today — a pile that was about six feet tall (said to be 185,000 pages). His efforts — his staff said that the rules already rolled back had saved $8.1 billion in regulatory costs over their lifetime, or a total of an estimated $570 million a year — have brought cheers from the business community, most notably from companies that will benefit from the rollbacks. "
1718,"HONG KONG — With some investors in its bonds running for the exits and foreign banks increasingly skeptical about its prospects, HNA Group tried this week to reassure markets that it has access to the money it needs. At the same time, HNA, a vast but troubled Chinese conglomerate, is continuing the drive that helped cause its difficulties in the first place: completing billions of dollars in foreign deals. The competing efforts by a company that has symbolized China’s growing wealth and global ambitions are a problem for the country’s leaders. They want to end wasteful overseas spending by debt-laden Chinese companies, which in the case of HNA and some others have drawn growing regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe. China has yet to let one of its big conglomerates fail, and HNA is unlikely to be an exception. But it is testing how effectively China can curb such behavior, and how the country may deal with some companies that have gone too far. HNA said late Wednesday that it had talked to eight Chinese banks, including powerful and politically connected lenders like China Development Bank and China Construction Bank, about extending the conglomerate’s credit lines next year. HNA said several of the banks planned to increase the amount of money it could borrow if needed. Bank officials believe “HNA is the best-quality client of banks,” according to a statement posted on HNA’s website. An HNA spokesman said the company had no further comment. "
1719,"The wide halls, regal rooms and wrought-iron arches of the Park Avenue Armory have glorified military might since its founding during the Gilded Age. Now these same spaces will be the site of a 10-hour “convening” on Sunday by Carrie Mae Weems with the help of more than 50 artistic all-stars, centered on “interrogating the deep structures and multiple dimensions of violence, and how artists and thinkers respond to it,” she said. Ms. Weems is a renowned photographer and installation artist, but her appearance at the armory is not a starring vehicle. Rather, it is ”sort of a wonderful way of bringing a larger idea forward,” she explained during a series of conversations. “I have been dealing with this idea of being a socially engaged and motivated artist since the very, very beginning of my career and very little has changed,” she said, her voice low and stentorian, yet warm. “Presidents have come and gone.” The violence that concerns Ms. Weems “didn’t only come with the Trump presidency, but it certainly has intensified since the Trump presidency,” she said, pointing to the brutal attacks at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August, which left a counterprotester dead and many injured. The program on Sunday is the culmination of her yearlong artistic residency at the armory, which began just as people around the country were knitting “pussy hats” and preparing to protest the presidential inauguration. “My chief preoccupation has been really grappling with and trying to understand in some small way the influence and the meaning of power,” she said. “This is a difficult and extraordinary political moment for the U.S.” To that end, Ms. Weems, 64, has invited luminaries from the visual and performing arts (including MacArthur Foundation “geniuses,” like herself, and several Pulitzer Prize-winners) along with writers, professors and activists, to address violence of all kinds: domestic, political, racist, sexual, verbal, physical and environmental. "
1720,"At this time last year, the Democratic path to Senate control seemed impossible: Hold all of the Democratic seats, flip Arizona and Nevada, then hope for a miracle. The Democrats got the political version of a miracle on Tuesday. Doug Jones’s victory in Alabama means Democrats have accomplished the most difficult item on their checklist in pursuit of the Senate. A Democratic path is now obvious, and the race for control is basically a tossup,  perhaps with a Republican advantage. It is hard to overstate how surprising this would have seemed a year ago. Democrats needed three states to flip control of the Senate, but they entered the cycle defending 25 seats (two of them independents) to the G.O.P.’s eight. Of those Democratic seats, a staggering 10 of them were in states that chose Donald J. Trump for president, including five that he carried by at least 18 percentage points. Only one Republican, Dean Heller, represented a state (Nevada) won by Hillary Clinton. Jeff Flake’s seat in Arizona was also plausibly competitive after Mr. Trump’s tepid 3.5-point win in the state, but it was hard to find the third Democratic seat. Perhaps the next best Democratic opportunity was against Ted Cruz in Texas — a long shot at best. But the Republican position has steadily deteriorated throughout the year. Most obviously, Mr. Trump’s weak approval ratings have  decidedly shifted the national political environment. The party’s two most vulnerable seats — those held by Mr. Heller and Mr. Flake —  became much more vulnerable. Mr. Flake said he wouldn’t run for re-election, while Mr. Heller came out of the health care debate badly damaged and facing a primary challenge. "
1721,"STOCKHOLM — This past Saturday, a Hanukkah party at a synagogue in Goteborg, Sweden, was abruptly interrupted by Molotov cocktails. They were hurled by a gang of men in masks at the Jews, mostly teenagers, who had gathered to celebrate the holiday. Two days later, two fire bombs were discovered outside the Jewish burial chapel in the southern Swedish city of Malmo. Who knows what tomorrow may bring? For Sweden’s 18,000 Jews, sadly, none of this comes as a surprise. They are by now used to anti-Semitic threats and attacks — especially during periods of unrest in the Middle East, which provide cover to those whose actual goal has little to do with Israel and much to do with harming Jews. Both of these recent attacks followed days of incitement against Jews. Last Friday, 200 people protested in Malmo against President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The protesters called for an intifada and promised “we will shoot the Jews.” A day later, during a demonstration in Stockholm, a speaker called Jews “apes and pigs.” There were promises of martyrdom. Malmo’s sole Hasidic rabbi has reported being the victim of more than 100 incidents of hostility ranging from hate speech to physical assault. In response to such attacks, the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel warning in 2010 advising “extreme caution when visiting southern Sweden” because of officials’ failure to act against the “serial harassment” of Jews in Malmo. Today, entering a synagogue anywhere in Sweden usually requires going through security checks, including airport-like questioning. At times of high alert, police officers with machine guns guard Jewish schools. Children at the Jewish kindergarten in Malmo play behind bulletproof glass. Not even funerals are safe from harassment. "
1722,"LONDON — The leaders of a British far-right group, which had gained notoriety after President Trump recirculated unverified anti-Muslim videos it had posted on social media, were arrested on Thursday. Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First, was detained in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the group said, where he was accompanying his deputy, Jayda Fransen, to her court hearing on earlier charges related to using “threatening, abusive, insulting words or behavior” during an anti-Islam speech in August that prosecutors said could qualify as incitement to racial hatred. She has denied the charges. Shortly after her court appearance, British news media said she was arrested again, this time as part of a police investigation into “an incident at a peace wall” in Belfast on Wednesday. Earlier, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said on Twitter that detectives investigating speeches made at the Northern Ireland Against Terrorism Rally on Aug. 6 “have arrested a 35-year-old man in the Belfast area today.” The post did not identify Mr. Golding or the offense. Ms. Fransen, in a video posted on Twitter, said that the man was Mr. Golding, and that he had been detained on “trumped-up charges.” A spokesman for Britain First confirmed the arrest. According to British news reports, a video recorded earlier this week in Belfast and in which Ms. Fransen spoke of the “Islamification of the mainland,” had been posted on the group’s Facebook page. She also described the Belfast Islamic Center as a “den of iniquity.” "
1723,"WASHINGTON — Thousands of the Interior Department’s employees reported that they had experienced harassment or intimidation at work, a department-wide survey conducted earlier this year and released Thursday found. Of the nearly 30,000 employees who reported on their experiences, about 35 percent said they felt some form of harassment and intimidation, often related to their age or gender. More than 85 percent of those employees said they had to continue to interact with the person responsible for the mistreatment. “This is a breach of public trust,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in an interview, adding that he had personally fired four people over accusations of harassment. “Harassment — intimidation — is a cancer that can destroy even the best organizations.” In the survey, 8 percent of employees reported sexual harassment, 20 percent reported negative treatment based on their age and 16 percent based on their sex. About 44 percent of the department’s 70,000 employees responded to the survey. “It has to start from the top,” Mr. Zinke said. “But we have to remove this cancer immediately because it is distracting from our ability to successfully carry out our mission.” Department officials are working to strengthen the policies on harassment based on the survey results, and have trained about 100 employees on how to conduct investigations into allegations. "
1724,"Not long ago, Democratic power brokers and political strategists in both parties spoke about Kirsten Gillibrand’s seemingly inevitable presidential candidacy with a shrug of the shoulders or a roll of the eyes. She was eager all right, but that didn’t mean that she was ready, and they felt that too much of her brand was invested in a fight against sexual assault and abuse. Now they rave: What a fierce warrior she is! How ahead of the curve! While that’s a testament to her savvy and persistence, it’s also thanks to Donald Trump. His presence in the White House amplifies her signature issue, and he’s the best tormentor that an ambitious Democrat could have. In trying to demean her, he merely makes her more important. He also fuels chatter that the first female president will, after all, be a senator from New York. His administration devours the reputations of the people who join it. They mortify themselves. But there are exceptions, and one stands out. Her name is Nikki Haley, and her time in Trump’s service, as our ambassador to the United Nations, has only elevated her standing among Republicans — even those who detest him. In her they see someone somehow respectful enough of Trump to hold onto her job but defiant enough to hold onto her dignity. Meanwhile, she’s adding serious foreign-policy experience to her two terms as the Indian-American governor of the deep-red state of South Carolina. Could she, in fact, be our first female president? Watching her go hard after Iran and North Korea at the United Nations, many impressed conservatives are asking that question. Perhaps I’m just scribbling in my silver linings playbook, but I find myself contemplating an absurdly delicious irony. It goes like this: An unabashed misogynist helps to sire the very milestone for women that his pummeling of Hillary Clinton postponed. He advances women just as surely as he has objectified and trivialized them. "
1725,"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. Daoud Hanania was born in West Jerusalem in 1934, the grandchild of an Arab Greek Orthodox priest. But his family left Jerusalem in 1951, in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. “Not a day goes by that I don’t think about Jerusalem,” he wrote to The New York Times last week. Mr. Hanania’s story is one of almost 600 we received from readers last week, after we asked you to tell us about your personal experiences with Jerusalem, either as residents, visitors or refugees. In the wake of President Trump’s announcement that the United States now formally recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, we wanted to hear from you. Here are some of the most evocative responses, condensed and edited for clarity. Louly Hanania, 75, lives in Amman, Jordan. She was born in West Jerusalem in 1942 and lived there until she was 6.

1726,"WASHINGTON — As a group of progressive activists and constituents prepared for a 15-minute meeting on Wednesday with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, they sat in the lobby of her office and developed a last-ditch strategy to persuade her to vote against the $1.5 trillion tax bill barreling through Congress: tears. “If Senator Collins actually saw you as a human, saw me as a human, then she wouldn’t pass any of this,” said Ady Barkan, a member of the Center for Popular Democracy, who recently learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., and uses a wheelchair. Ms. Collins, after weeks of wavering, cut several deals with Republican leaders in exchange for going along with the tax overhaul that passed the Senate this month and is on track to be sent to President Trump by Christmas. Among other things, the Senate version of the bill would repeal the Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. Among the provisions she secured was support for bipartisan health care legislation to stabilize the Affordable Care Act’s insurance markets, whose prices could increase if the mandate repeal is enacted. She also claims to have a commitment from Republican leaders to prevent automatic Medicare spending cuts that could occur as a result of arcane budget rules that would kick in after the tax cut is passed. Those trade-offs still seem to to be in place as far as Ms. Collins is concerned. But because Ms. Collins is one of the few Republican senators who sometimes votes against her party, the pressure from opponents of the tax plan to flip her vote is rising as the bill inches closer to final passage, possibly as early as next week.

A day after Doug Jones became the first Democrat to win a Senate race in Alabama since 1992, late-night hosts poked fun at Roy Moore, his vanquished opponent. Mr. Moore has been accused by various women of sexual misconduct with them when they were teenagers. Dennis Rodman sat down with Mr. Colbert to discuss his many visits to North Korea. “For some reason, he likes me,” Mr. Rodman said, referring to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Samantha Bee traveled to Mexico to learn about La Brigada Feminista. “As a black woman, I just have two things I want to say about last night’s election: You’re.

1728,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • With House and Senate negotiators reaching an agreement on a final version of their rewrite of the tax code, the party is closing in on its first major legislative achievement since assuming political control this year. Final votes on the revised legislation, whose overall cost remains unclear, could come next week. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve predicted that the measure would modestly increase economic growth for the next few years without stoking inflation. • One thing the debate over the tax overhaul has shown: the peril Americans face in making financial decisions based on the tax code. • We’re still sifting through the once-unimaginable Republican defeat in Tuesday’s special Senate election in Alabama. These maps compare the turnout with that of the 2016 presidential election. Roy Moore’s loss again pointed to divisions between the party’s establishment and its populist wing, led by Stephen Bannon. "
1729,"Take a walk with me, dear reader, into the yard, down the street — anywhere, really, just so that we can step outside of our house of outrage. It’s a roomy house, with space for everyone from woke progressives to disillusioned conservatives. It’s a good house, filled with people united in a just and defiant cause. It’s a harmonious house, thrumming with the sound of people agreeing vigorously. And lately, we’ve started to believe we’re … winning. We breathed relief Tuesday night when Roy Moore went down to his well-earned political death, like Jack Nicholson’s Joker at the end of Batman. We roared when Robert Mueller extracted a guilty plea from a cooperative Michael Flynn, and the investigative noose seemed to tighten around Donald Trump’s neck. We cheered when Democrat Ralph Northam trounced Ed Gillespie after the Republican took the low road with anti-immigrant demagogy. It’s all lining up. Democrats have an 11-point edge over Republicans in the generic congressional ballot. The president’s approval rating is barely scraping 37 percent. Nearly six in 10 Americans say the United States is on the “wrong track.” Isn’t revenge in 2018 starting to taste sweet — and 2020 even sweeter? Don’t bet on it. Democrats are making the same mistakes Republicans made when they inhabited their own house of outrage, back in 1998. You remember. The year of the wagged finger and the stained blue dress. Of a president who abused women, lied about it, and used his power to bomb other countries so he could distract from his personal messes. Of a special prosecutor whose investigation overstepped its original bounds. Of half the country in a moral fever to impeach. Of the other half determined to dismiss sexual improprieties, defend a democratically elected leader and move on with the business of the country. Oh, also the year in which the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 16 percent, the unemployment rate fell to a 28-year low, and Democrats gained seats in Congress. Bill Clinton, as we all know, survived impeachment and left office with a strong economic record and a 66-percent approval rating. "
1730,"LOS ANGELES — Pharrell Williams remembers the exact moment when he realized he was ready to return to N.E.R.D, his long-running side project with Chad Hugo and Shae Haley. In the beginning of 2016, he dyed his hair green: “The minute I looked in the mirror, I was like, ‘Oh, starting N.E.R.D now.’” He had just left Nashville, where he’d been producing and writing on “Wanderlust,” an album by the unflinchingly smooth country group Little Big Town. And he was coming off the peak of his career as a recording artist: “Blurred Lines,” his limber collaboration with Robin Thicke, and “Get Lucky,” his disco revival with Daft Punk, held No. 1 and 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a time in 2013; the next year, the pop-gospel hymn “Happy” became his first No. 1 as a lead artist, and the song that vaulted him into the stratosphere. He wore an artfully goofy hat to the Grammys. He joined “The Voice” as a coach. He sat for an interview with Oprah, and cried. For someone who’d spent much of his career making others sound good as a producer and songwriter, it was a belated, and extremely loud, splash into the brightest spot of the limelight. The world changed, though, and with it, Mr. Williams. The version of him that appears on the new N.E.R.D album, “No_One Ever Really Dies,” is anti-“Happy,” and anti-happy. He is exasperated by the police shootings of unarmed black Americans. The election of Donald J. Trump stymies him. “We’re gonna climb your wall,” he sings on “Deep Down Body Thurst,” continuing, “It’d be worth the fall/I sure hope you’re just talking man, and that’s all.” On the 11 tracks on the new album, due Friday, he is frantically waving for attention, as if hoping to stave off more trauma. “I spoke up because I saw this coming,” he said last month, discussing politics in his dedicated room at Chalice Recording Studio here, while footage of NASA lectures played on a television screen above the recording booth. (Mr. Williams was a producer of “Hidden Figures,” the 2016 film about black female NASA mathematicians, and wrote music for it as well.) "
1731,"The issue of sexual misconduct has emerged as a centerpiece of Democratic strategy for taking on President Trump and the Republican Party. That strategy paid off on Tuesday with the defeat of Roy Moore. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s decision to bring to center stage charges of sexual harassment leveled by more than a dozen women against Trump has forced the White House onto the defensive. The story so far: On Sunday, Nikki Haley, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, broke ranks with the administration, telling John Dickerson on “Face the Nation” that Trump’s accusers “should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with.” Haley added that she is “incredibly proud of the women who have come forward” in all the recent cases of alleged harassment. On Monday, three of Trump’s accusers appeared on NBC Today with Megyn Kelly, following the publication of articles further chronicling Trump’s alleged misconduct in People, The New Yorker, The Atlantic and New York magazine. The liberal filmmaker, Robert Greenwald, released a documentary, “16 Women and Donald Trump: Hear Their Stories.” All of these developments are taking place against the backdrop of a pending defamation lawsuit against Trump, who awaits the decision of Jennifer G. Schecter — a New York state judge — who is considering a motion to require Trump to testify under oath in a lawsuit brought by Summer Zervos, a former “Apprentice” contestant. Zervos, who is represented by Gloria Allred, claims that in 2007 Trump “kissed her on the mouth repeatedly, touched her breast and pressed his genitals against her,” without her consent. Zervos contends that she was defamed when Trump dismissed her claims during the campaign as “lies” and “nonsense.” "
1732,"Update: The F.C.C. voted on Thursday to repeal net neutrality rules. HONG KONG — To taste a future without net neutrality, try browsing the web in Beijing. China’s internet, provided through telecom giants aligned with the Communist Party, is a digital dystopia, filtered by the vast censorship apparatus known as China’s Great Firewall. Some sites load with soul-withering slowness, or not at all. Others appear instantly. Content vanishes without warning or explanation. The culprit is rarely knowable. A faulty Wi-Fi router? A neighborhood power failure? Commercial sabotage? A clampdown on political dissent? To most Chinese netizens, the reason matters little. They simply gravitate to the few sites that aren’t slowed or blocked entirely: the Chinese counterparts of Facebook, Google, and Twitter. But these Chinese platforms come with heavy government surveillance and censorship by corporate and party apparatchiks. For the Communist Party and its commercial allies, this is win-win, cementing respective monopolies on political markets and consumer power. The Trump administration’s plan to dismantle net neutrality regulations has brought this nightmare scenario to America’s digital doorstep. With the Federal Communications Commission scheduled to vote on the issue today, the threatened rollback not only imperils fair play and free speech; it will also empower foreign entities with substantial market-making power, like China’s government, to meddle in American public discourse on a scale dwarfing Russia’s recent cyber-chicanery. Worse, abolishing net neutrality gives American corporations the means, motive and opportunity to become accomplices in selling out our freedom of speech. Net neutrality is called the First Amendment of the internet for a good reason. Obama-era net neutrality rules classed telecom giants, such as AT&T, as “common carriers,” de facto public utilities like water and electricity companies. This status prohibits corporate bosses from abusing control over network infrastructure to stifle rivals or favor subsidiaries. Under net neutrality rules, a company like Comcast, which owns NBC, cannot throttle data flows carrying Netflix’s competing TV shows, any more than General Electric, once a majority stakeholder in NBC and corporate parent to Jay Leno’s “Tonight Show,” could have cut the power to David Letterman’s “Late Show” studios at CBS. These content-neutral safeguards apply to political speech as much as to “Orange Is the New Black.” They enshrine a basic American value: that diverse opinions, from diverse sources, are a pillar of public welfare. Eliminating net neutrality allows corporations to tamper with data flows on their networks without public oversight or accountability. If a connection is slow for MSNBC but not for Fox News, you may never learn why. Beijing, meanwhile, is not shy about using its political and economic heft to blot out dissent beyond China’s borders, employing tactics that blend politics and commerce. The process starts at home: Foreign media firms seeking access to China’s enormous markets face intense pressure from Communist Party gatekeepers to make odious concessions on content control and privacy. Then, the chilling effects spread overseas. This has already happened in Hollywood: If you can’t distribute a film like “Seven Years in Tibet” in China’s giant market, why bother making it at all? (That 1997 project would never be greenlit today.) Facebook, long locked out of the Chinese market, is flirting with censorship in a likely bid to gain entry. After the Facebook page of Guo Wengui, a prominent regime critic living in exile, vanished last spring, Facebook blamed a systems error. As a private corporation, it is under no obligation to provide more detail. As the incentives and opportunities to self-censor accumulate, content providers will gravitate to producing and promoting whatever reaches the most customers worldwide, even if that means pleasing Chinese cyber-commissars who control access to a billion of them. Content providers — companies like Facebook and LinkedIn — are not, after all, common carriers. They do not control the pipes, or carry a unique public trust in the eyes of the government. As private businesses, they are not bound by the First Amendment. Self-censorship is simply good business. "
1733,"LOS ANGELES — In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion. While the agreement is subject to the approval of antitrust regulators — and the Justice Department recently moved to block a big media company, AT&T, from becoming even bigger — Disney is acknowledging that the future of television and movie viewing is online. The acquisition, which would make Disney a colossus unlike anything Hollywood has ever seen, is the biggest counterattack from a traditional media company against the tech giants that have aggressively moved into the entertainment business. Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video. “The pace of disruption has only hastened,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. “This will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority.” At the same time, the agreement means that one of moviedom’s most celebrated studios, 20th Century Fox, will be downsized, with some operations folded into Walt Disney Studios or refocused to make films for online distribution. Founded in 1935, the Fox studio championed Marilyn Monroe, produced classics like “The Sound of Music,” released the first “Star Wars” movie and, more recently, turned “Avatar” into the biggest ticket-seller of all time. But lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content — namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch’s sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood. "
1734,"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The F.C.C. formally voted to overturn Obama-era net neutrality regulations. • How does the Disney deal affect Fox’s efforts to buy control of Sky? • The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney. • Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together. • Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers. Want this in your inbox every morning? Here’s the sign-up. As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today’s big transaction. From Shannon Pettypiece of Bloomberg: But then there’s the jobs angle Ms. Sanders also inserted the White House into the little matter of mergers and layoffs. She said that Mr. Trump thinks that today’s deal could be “a great thing” for jobs. There’s a problem. Here’s what Disney’s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning: As Andrew reminded earlier this week, “synergies” is a code word for “layoffs.” And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes. "
1735,"For a while, Rupert Murdoch seemed invincible. First, the mogul emerged relatively unscathed from a 2011 phone hacking scandal involving his British tabloids that threatened to upend his empire. Then, he installed his sons, Lachlan and James, in leadership roles at 21st Century Fox. And, last year, the thrice-divorced Mr. Murdoch married Jerry Hall, a former supermodel 25 years his junior. But even Mr. Murdoch, a self-made billionaire whose range of media assets wield enormous political influence on three continents, was no match for Silicon Valley. Like King Lear confronting his mortality, Mr. Murdoch, 86, is preparing to divide up a lifetime of spoils. And as he moves to sell off wide swaths of his media and entertainment business, he is also throwing into confusion the line of succession and testing the ties that bind the family-run fief. The Walt Disney Company announced on Thursday it had reached a deal to acquire most of 21st Century Fox Inc., the Murdoch-owned company that includes the storied movie and television studio, national cable networks like FX and National Geographic, 22 regional cable channels dedicated to sports and a 39 percent stake in Britain’s pay TV service, Sky. The $52.4 billion deal — which would not include Fox News, the Fox broadcast network or the FS1 sports cable channel, which will be spun off into a newly listed company — has come about as part of the consolidation sweeping over traditional media companies as they try to fight off threats from Amazon, Apple and Netflix. It also represents a remarkable shift for Mr. Murdoch, a visionary businessman who has long lived by a single credo: Buy, buy, buy. After all, Mr. Murdoch didn’t grow a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, into a $100 billion media business by selling. “Rupert has always been a collector, a builder,” said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.

1736,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. This summer, after my colleagues and I published our attempt at the definitive list of President Trump’s lies, I went on Jacob Weisberg’s podcast to talk about it. Jacob asked about the reaction from readers, and I mentioned a common one from Trump supporters: They didn’t doubt that he sometimes bent the truth. But they thought he was no worse than other recent presidents, and they challenged The Times to do the same exercise for a president other than Trump. Today, we’re publishing the results of that challenge. We analyzed every statement of President Barack Obama’s that had been challenged by fact-checkers (the same methodology we’d used for Trump) and applied the same standard. We were looking for demonstrably untrue statements, defensible under no reasonable interpretation of the facts. In Obama’s case, his demonstrably untrue statements include his infamous lines about a “red line” for Syria and about Americans being able to keep their health insurance if they liked it. They also include lesser-known statements on the high-school dropout rate, American exports and the size of the country’s Muslim population. I encourage you to check out the piece — or, if nothing else, the chart at the top — but here’s one headline number: Obama averaged a little more than two blatant, distinct falsehoods per year during his presidency. Trump is on pace for 124 a year. We have also done something that many newsletter readers have been asking for: An updated version of the definitive list of Trump’s lies, which includes repeated lies. The tax deal. The House and Senate have reached a compromise that bridges the gap between their separate tax bills. The differences were modest, in the big picture. Both bills — and the final deal — will cut taxes deeply for the wealthy, increase the deficit and ultimately hurt the middle class. The final deal, in fact, will cut the top marginal tax rate more than either original House or Senate bill. (Some compromise!) It also seems likely to reject Marco Rubio’s pleas for a larger child-tax credit that would help low-income families. A remarkable part of the deal: It appears to ignore many priorities of swing senators, like Rubio, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and John McCain. Are all of those senators going to fold and vote for the bill anyway? Elsewhere. “Congress needs to be clear now that firing Mueller is unacceptable and un-American — we’re a nation of laws, laws that no one is above,” Max Bergmann and Max Boot write in The Guardian about the special counsel, Robert Mueller. “Failing to protect Mueller is not just moral cowardice, it’s also leaving America’s national security exposed.” Salma Hayek. There’s a good chance you have already read her op-ed on Harvey Weinstein. It drew a gigantic audience yesterday. If you haven’t read it, I recommend it. "

1738,"The editor in chief of Christianity Today did not have to wait for the votes to be counted to publish his essay on Tuesday bemoaning what the Alabama Senate race had wrought. Whoever wins, “there is already one loser: Christian faith,” wrote Mark Galli, whose publication, the flagship of American evangelicalism, was founded 61 years ago by the Rev. Billy Graham. “No one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation. Christianity’s integrity is severely tarnished.” The sight of white evangelical voters in Alabama giving their overwhelming support to Roy S. Moore, the Republican candidate, despite accusations of racial and religious bigotry, misogyny and assaults on teenage girls, has deeply troubled many conservative Christians, who fear that association with the likes of Mr. Moore is giving their faith a bad name. The angst has grown so deep, Mr. Galli said, that he knows of “many card-carrying evangelicals” who are ready to disavow the label. The evangelical brand “is definitely tarnished” by politicization from whatever side, Mr. Galli said on Wednesday. “No question about it.” He said that his readers seemed to agree with the thrust of his essay. The main criticism he received, he said, was one he agreed with: that he should have made it clearer that he was referring not to all Christians, but to evangelicals in particular. The bloc that has marched under the banner of the “Moral Majority” and “values voters” has now been tagged as the most reliable base of support for both Mr. Moore and President Trump, two politicians who are known for fanning racial and religious prejudices and who stand accused of sexual harassment by numerous women — accusations that each man denies. White evangelicals across the country delivered 81 percent of their votes to Mr. Trump last year, according to exit poll data, and backed Mr. Moore in Alabama by the same proportion on Tuesday. "
1739,"WASHINGTON — Republicans took a critical step toward notching their first significant legislative victory since assuming full political control, as the House and Senate voted along party lines on Tuesday and into early Wednesday to pass the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in decades. The $1.5 trillion tax bill, which is expected to head to President Trump’s desk in the coming days, will have broad effects on the economy, making deep and lasting cuts to corporate taxes as well as temporarily lowering individual taxes. The endeavor was not without hiccups, however, as three small provisions in the final tax bill agreed to by the House and Senate were found by the Senate parliamentarian to violate the budget rules that Republicans must follow to pass their bill through a process that shields it from a Democratic filibuster. As a result, the bill changed slightly in the Senate, and the House will now need to vote on it again since both chambers must approve identical legislation. Among the items that were deemed out of order was the title of the bill: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The approval of the bill in the House and Senate came over the strenuous objections of Democrats, who have accused Republicans of giving a gift to corporations and the wealthy and driving up the federal debt in the process. As the final vote approached in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, gave his closing argument against the bill and scolded his Republican colleagues for talking during his remarks on the floor. "
1740,"At the end of this banner stock market year, you can bet that major business publications will be naming their investor of the year. You can stop now. I have the winner, and nobody is even close when it comes to his total return on investment: Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. A recent report in The Washington Post, quoting intelligence sources, said Putin may have spent less than $500,000 to hack our last election and help (though Hillary helped much more) Donald Trump become president. And Putin’s payoff is Trump’s first year: a president who is simultaneously eroding some of our most basic norms, undermining some of our most cherished institutions and enacting a mammoth tax bill that will not make America great again. If you assume, as I do, that Putin wants to see an America that is not an attractive model for his own people or others to emulate, and that he wants an America run by a chaos president who cannot lead the West, then Trump is his dream come true, whether or not there was any collusion between them. So Vladimir Putin, come on up! You’re my Investor of the Year. You’re the Warren Buffett of geopolitics. Just do the math: On norms, we’ve grown numb to a president who misleads or outright lies every day. Different newspapers measure this differently. The Washington Post says Trump has averaged 5.5 false or misleading claims every day in office, putting him on pace for 1,999 in his first year. According to The Times, Barack Obama told 18 “distinct falsehoods” over his entire eight-year presidency, while Trump, in his first 10 months in office, “has told 103 separate untruths, many of them repeatedly.” Given the power of the president to shape our public discourse, it’s chilling to imagine what four years and 8,000 lies or misleading statements from Trump will do to trust in government in America — and how deeply that will filter into society, giving permission to anyone and everyone to lie with impunity. "
1741,"WASHINGTON — With more and more states running out of money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, parents took their case to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, pleading with Congress to provide money before their sons and daughters lose health care and coverage. But the program, known as CHIP, which insures nearly nine million children, took a back seat as lawmakers raced to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut. CHIP’s fate, it appears, is now caught up in a messy fight over an end-of-the-year deal on spending that must be struck by Friday to avert a government shutdown. “CHIP is being used as a pawn in larger debates and negotiations,” Linda Nablo, the chief deputy director of the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, said Tuesday in an interview. “It has fallen victim to the dysfunction and partisanship in Congress. And we are getting very close to the point where some children will also be victims.” Virginia sent letters last week to parents of 68,000 children warning them that CHIP coverage would end on Jan. 31 unless Congress took action. Congress has known since April 2015 that funds for the popular children’s insurance program — created and sustained for two decades with bipartisan support — would expire this year at the end of September. The Senate Finance Committee approved a five-year extension of funding for the program in early October, but did not specify how to pay for it — and Republicans insist that it must be paid for. The House passed a bill to provide five years of funds in early November, but those funds would come from public health programs set up under the Affordable Care Act and an increase in premiums for affluent Medicare beneficiaries, provisions that are unacceptable to most Democrats. House Republicans plan to send those same provisions to the Senate again this week as part of a stopgap spending bill, knowing they will be killed. "
1742,"WASHINGTON — The sting of failure on health care still lingered in the Senate on Aug. 3, when Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, summoned the Republican members of the Budget Committee to his office. We need to pass a tax bill this fall, Mr. McConnell told his colleagues, and we need a budget that allows us to do that. There was no dissent. Within two months, party leaders had hammered out a budget that steamrolled their previous concerns over adding to the federal budget deficit, in order to pave the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. In rapid order, the budget passed the Senate, then the House, putting Republicans on track to deliver a tax bill at breakneck speed to President Trump’s desk by Christmas. The $1.5 trillion bill represents the most sweeping overhaul of the United States tax code in decades, delivering deep and permanent cuts to corporations and temporary tax cuts to individuals. Early Wednesday morning, Republicans claimed victory as the Senate voted 51-48 to pass the bill, which the House passed on Tuesday 227 to 203. But in many ways, the bill represents a political and economic gamble for Republicans. A majority of Americans oppose it, and relatively few believe they will benefit personally from it, polls show. Economic analyses predict it will add more than $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next decade, an amount that would betray the party’s longstanding messaging that mounting federal debt will sap economic growth. Republicans spurned those concerns, rallying around what has been the animating ideology of their party since the Reagan era: that tax cuts will drive faster growth and national prosperity. More immediately, they followed an overwhelming desire to notch a legislative “win” for the president, their donors, the restless voters of their party base and for their own political fortunes. There were crucial steps that ensured passage, including a deficit bargain struck between Senators Patrick J. Toomey and Bob Corker in September, pressure from Mr. Trump on a controversial push to tweak retirement savings in the bill and, in the Senate, an early and crucial endorsement from John McCain of Arizona, the Republican wild card whose late defection killed the health care bill. "
1743,"WASHINGTON — The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has influenced Republican White Houses and shaped conservative policy since the 1970s, named a new president on Tuesday who has deep ties to the party’s social conservative and evangelical Christian wing as it moved to steady itself after a year of internal turmoil. Kay Coles James, who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, will fill the vacancy left this year when Heritage’s board unexpectedly removed Jim DeMint, the former senator from South Carolina who became a leading practitioner of the uncompromising, no-apologies style of conservatism that characterized the Tea Party revolt. If Mr. DeMint’s appointment in 2013 was a sign that Heritage was embracing the grass-roots energy that had proved so disruptive to the Republican Party, naming Ms. James was an acknowledgment that many inside the organization believe Heritage had strayed from its mission of acting as the intellectual and policy guide star for conservatives. Like other institutions that had grown comfortable in their roles as fixtures of the political establishment, Heritage has struggled to find a meaningful role for itself in President Trump’s Washington. Some inside the group complained that it had little influence in shaping debates on Capitol Hill that conservatives should have been far better prepared for — like the struggle over repealing the Affordable Care Act. And a few of Heritage’s largest donors and board members like Rebekah Mercer, whose family helped finance Mr. Trump’s campaign, agitated for change, arguing that the group was squandering its opportunity to lead at a time when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. Inside the organization, people viewed Ms. James as a safe choice who, while unlikely to resolve the tensions over Heritage’s direction, would not make them any worse. "
1744,"Donald Trump has often been described as the second coming of P. T. Barnum, the legendary 19th-century showman. Biographers, academics and journalists have embraced this idea, as have members of Mr. Trump’s family. “He is P. T. Barnum,” his sister once said. With a movie opening on Wednesday that is loosely inspired by Barnum’s life — “The Greatest Showman,” starring Hugh Jackman — we’re likely to hear these comparisons again. Please: Barnum would be appalled by Mr. Trump. While they share some superficial similarities, it’s the differences that stand out. Phineas Taylor Barnum is a figure frequently invoked but rarely understood. He amassed a fortune promoting a bewildering range of popular entertainments: an elderly slave masquerading as George Washington’s nursemaid; a gifted Swedish opera singer, Jenny Lind, whom he turned into an international superstar; a half-monkey, half-fish masterpiece of taxidermy that he advertised as the FeeJee Mermaid; and other attractions, dubious and genuine. Many of these he exhibited at his American Museum in Lower Manhattan. Later, he took the show on the road, touring the world with his famous circus and sideshows. Barnum’s hyperbole, his willingness to bend the truth when promoting his entertainments, his artful manipulation of the press, never mind his participation in outright hoaxes, invite comparisons with Mr. Trump. Likewise, Barnum’s fondness for living large — he built a garish Moorish mansion he called “Iranistan” — calls to mind Mr. Trump’s gilded excesses. Both men became teetotalers; both went bankrupt, only to claw their way back to the top. And then, of course, there’s Barnum’s famous saying: “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Except that Barnum never said that or anything like it, though it was a popular saying among 19th-century con artists and flimflam men. As a showman, Barnum went to great lengths to distinguish himself from these swindlers. He believed that if he accepted customers’ hard-earned cash, he had to give them their money’s worth. “No one,” Barnum declared in his autobiography, “can say that he ever paid for admission to one of my exhibitions more than his admission was worth to him.” A patron of Barnum’s museum might dispute the authenticity of some exhibits. But visitors rarely, if ever, came away feeling shortchanged or cheated. "

1746,"WASHINGTON — An end-of-the-year showdown that was once promised over delicate issues like immigration, health care and surveillance appeared to fizzle on Wednesday as key Republicans dropped their demands to shore up shaky health insurance markets and Democrats appeared to abandon their goal to force adoption of a measure protecting young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Instead, Congress moved toward a one-month punt that would keep the government funded into January and once again put off policy confrontations. As Republicans celebrated the passage of their tax overhaul at the White House with President Trump, the party’s leaders in the House and Senate worked behind the scenes to shape a stopgap spending measure to fund federal agencies and avert a government shutdown. Only days ago, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she would vote for the tax bill because she had secured a promise from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to include two health care provisions to stabilize insurance markets in an end-of-the-year spending measure. On Wednesday, she dropped that demand and said she hoped it would be passed in early 2018. “It looks like the Christmas present of lower health insurance premiums will now have to be a Valentine’s Day present,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who had joined Ms. Collins’s demand. Similarly, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, traded his vote on the tax bill, in part for a promise from Republican leaders to consider a deal to protect young immigrants brought into the United States as children, known as Dreamers. Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that if negotiators could reach bipartisan agreement on the deal in January, he would put it to a full Senate vote. "
1747,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court indicated on Wednesday that federal courts in California had moved too fast in ordering the Trump administration to disclose documents concerning its decision to end a program that protected some 800,000 young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. In an unsigned opinion, the justices instructed the lower courts to consider the administration’s arguments on two threshold legal issues before requiring that the documents be turned over. The administration contends that its decision to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was within its lawful discretion and that the courts are in any event without jurisdiction to review the matter. “Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the district court to examine a complete administrative record,” the Supreme Court’s opinion said. Should the courts reject those arguments, the opinion said, they should nonetheless consider requiring fewer documents to be produced and allow the administration to present arguments about whether particular documents are privileged. There were no noted dissents from Wednesday’s opinion, which appeared to be the product of compromise. That was in contrast to the Supreme Court’s first order in the case on Dec. 8, when the justices split 5 to 4 along ideological lines. The more conservative members of the court were in the majority, and they allowed the administration to temporarily shield the documents. The dispute arose in five consolidated lawsuits in California that accused administration officials of acting unlawfully when they abruptly rescinded the program. The plaintiffs include four states: California, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota. Judge William H. Alsup of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered the administration to turn over internal documents concerning its reasons for canceling the program. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the administration’s request to block Judge Alsup’s order, with the majority saying that the few documents provided by the administration had been inadequate in light of the magnitude of the decision to end the program. In an emergency application to the Supreme Court, the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, asked the justices to step in. He said Judge Alsup’s order was an “extraordinary departure from bedrock principles governing judicial review of federal agency action,” given the practical burdens it imposed and in its intrusion into the administration’s internal deliberations. In its opinion on Wednesday, the Supreme Court noted that the administration had produced just 256 pages of documents, of which “nearly 200 pages consist of published opinions from various federal courts.” In setting aside the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, the Supreme Court said it was not expressing any views on the merits of the dispute.

1748,"When President  Trump adds his distinctive signature to the tax bill, he will also be making a huge bet that the Republican strategy of deep cuts for businesses and wealthy individuals will fuel extraordinary growth across the board. Perhaps more than any other American political leader, Mr. Trump knows that long shots, like his own presidential bid, sometimes pay off. In that vein, he and congressional Republicans are arguing that their bitterly contested and expensive rewrite of the tax code will ultimately create more jobs and raise wages. If they are proved correct, they will be repudiating not only historical experience, but most experts. From Congress’s own prognosticators to Wall Street’s virtuosos, scarcely any independent analyses project anything like the rosy forecasts offered by the president’s top economic advisers. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the normal models just do not fully capture the high-octane “rocket fuel” embedded in the tax plan. Mr. Trump intuitively understands just how much attitudes and expectations can shape economic decisions. With a businessman in the White House, Mr. Trump argues that companies, large and small, have a renewed faith in the economy. And the corporate tax cut, combined with the rollback in regulation, will prompt waves of new investment and hiring, as middle-class Americans liberally spend the extra money in their pockets. “We’re going to easily see 4 percent growth next year,” the National Economic Council director, Gary D. Cohn, said. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared the tax plan would generate enough growth to more than pay for its $1.5 trillion cost. "
1749,"Time was when any New York politician with a grain of ambition had to show reverence for the three I’s. That would be Ireland, Italy and Israel. For anyone aspiring to high office, visiting those lands was almost as fundamental as breathing, and a balanced citywide ticket contained descendants of each I. So you had carefully assembled combos like O’Dwyer, Joseph and Impellitteri (Democrats, 1945) and Lefkowitz, Fino and Gilhooley (Republicans, 1961). The three-I rule hasn’t disappeared, though it lacks the power it once had. These days, New York politicians seem more in thrall to a one-I imperative: Iowa. That’s where Mayor Bill de Blasio was to be found this week, talking up a progressive agenda at a gathering of like-minded liberals in Des Moines. Given that Iowa sounds the opening bell in presidential races, did the trip reflect his 2020 vision? Not at all, Mr. de Blasio insisted repeatedly in an echo of Calvin (“I do not choose to run”) Coolidge. Somehow, no matter how many times he said it, not everyone was convinced. When political types book passage to Iowa and deny any thought of national office, they sound an awful lot like guys who claimed back in Playboy’s heyday that they bought the magazine solely for the Nabokov and Cheever short stories. Iowa got a heavy dose of New York in 2015 and early 2016, what with campaign tramping by Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who may represent Vermont but still speaks with the unmistakable cadences of his Brooklyn yout’. This week, in addition to the mayor, the city imposed itself on Iowans in the form of anti-de Blasio labor protests. The Transport Workers Union bought billboard space and took out ads in The Des Moines Register — “a warning to the people of Iowa” that this Bill was “phony as a $3 bill.” And the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association dispatched officers to stalk the mayor with a message that he shouldn’t be allowed “to stand on the mantle of being progressive and pro-labor when we know the truth is different.” Those were the words of the P.B.A. president, Patrick Lynch, not normally noted for worrying about the state of progressivism in America. "
1750,"DES MOINES — The House of Representatives had just passed its sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code, and Mayor Bill de Blasio unfurled his long arms in a windowless Iowa conference room to express his displeasure at what he said was a “bad day for the country.” “Now,” he said, “comes the work of dealing with it.” The bill will deeply affect New York City, but on Tuesday Mr. de Blasio was a time zone away, talking up his two-pronged plan to remake the Democratic Party and then retake Congress in 2018. Buoyed by his own re-election last month — he volunteered his winning percentage multiple times in a 30-minute interview here — the mayor said he sees himself as proof positive that his “brand” of “progressive economic populism” sells. “I think that gives me license to say, ‘Hey guys, I want to give you a good example,’” he said. “I don’t pretend to be the arbiter of all truth, but I think I have something to contribute. And I think people are listening.” So Mr. de Blasio flew to Iowa this week, tucking his nearly 6-foot-6 frame into a pair of coach seats (he had a layover) to visit the state that kicks off the presidential nominating contest. Coming here guaranteed that Mr. de Blasio would get the 2020 question — no, he says, he is not running — even as he feigned frustration that it’s been asked and answered. Some passengers recognized him and could be overheard discussing his itinerary. “Big ambitions?” one person said. “Yup,” said another. If the idea of Mr. de Blasio-to-Iowa rings familiar, that’s because it is. He did much the same in 2015, to notable failure. He tried to get Democrats to adopt his “progressive agenda,” launched a nonprofit group and promised a presidential forum. All three fizzled. He then stalled for months before endorsing his former boss, Hillary Clinton, and when he finally did, her campaign buried his blessing among an avalanche of other mayoral backers. Now he is again unapologetically opening his political aperture far beyond New York City, even before his second-term swearing-in. His 28-hour jaunt to Iowa, he said, is just the first stop. Why here and now? "
1751,"As Republican lawmakers celebrate the passage of a tax bill that will make the wealthiest Americans richer, many lower-income families are faced with the real possibility that their children will soon lose their health insurance because Congress didn’t care enough to renew funding for it. The Children’s Health Insurance Program has enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation in 1997. It covers about nine million kids from families who are not affluent by any stretch of the imagination but happen to earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. In the past, the program was typically reauthorized for five years with little controversy. Not this time. Republican leaders in Congress have been unwilling or unable to make CHIP, as the program is known, a priority since funding lapsed nearly three months ago. The situation has gotten so bad that families with young children who benefit from the program visited Capitol Hill this week to beg lawmakers to fund CHIP. This has forced state governments, which run the program, to scramble. This week, officials in Alabama said they would drop the coverage of 7,000 children and freeze the program to new enrollees on New Year’s Day. That state would have to end its program, which serves 84,000 kids in total, on Feb. 1. Virginia told parents of 68,000 children that its program could end on Jan. 31. Connecticut, Colorado and other states have issued similar warnings. All told, 16 states will run out of CHIP funds by the end of January, and another 21 will run out of money by the end of March, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Republican lawmakers say they will eventually get around to reauthorizing CHIP. First, though, they insist that Democrats must agree to cut other spending to offset some of the cost of the program. For example, they have proposed raising Medicare premiums on affluent retirees and cutting spending on public health programs created by the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have rightly balked at such demands, especially since Republicans just passed a tax bill that will mostly benefit corporations and the wealthiest families in the country while adding more than $1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. By contrast, CHIP costs just $14 billion a year, or $140 billion or more over a decade. In dismissing concerns about the program, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah epitomized the degradation of so much of the Republican Party this year. Mr. Hatch, who helped create this program with Senator Edward Kennedy, said on the floor of the Senate, almost sneering sanctimoniously, “the reason CHIP’s having trouble is because we don’t have money anymore.” Mr. Hatch and his Republican colleagues had no trouble finding boatloads of money to cut taxes on real estate developers, hedge fund managers and corporate chief executives. "
1752,"WARSAW — Poland’s president signed sweeping legislation on Wednesday to overhaul the country’s judicial system, a move critics say fundamentally undermines the rule of law in a nation that only three decades ago broke free from the yoke of the Soviet Union to embrace democracy. The new laws effectively put the Polish courts under the control of the right-wing governing party, Law and Justice. In signing them, President Andrzej Duda defied a formal warning delivered only hours earlier by the European Union, which called the legislation a “serious breach” of bedrock values like the rule of law. Once viewed as a symbol for the successful integration of former Eastern Bloc countries into the West, Poland is now seen as portending a far darker trend — a turn toward right-wing populism and away from values like pluralism and respect for dissent. The turn has underscored an emerging rift on the Continent between countries in the West like France and Germany, where the political establishment has rallied around core democratic values, and countries in the East like Poland and Hungary, where populist leaders have succeeded by appealing to the old gods of nation, faith and family. “If you had asked me two years ago if Poland would have found itself at this moment, I would have said no way,” said Michal Baranowski, who directs the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a pro-European research organization dedicated to trans-Atlantic values. “I think it comes to the surprise of many, not only in Poland but throughout the West.” Charles A. Kupchan, an adviser on European affairs during the Obama administration, said the new laws were “yet another sign of the rising tide of illiberalism that has taken hold in Central Europe.” He called the changes “inconsistent with democratic norms and values.” "
1753,"When Donald Trump’s campaign was accused of spreading “fake news,” he quickly appropriated the term for himself. The true purveyors of fake news, he claimed, were television networks like CNN and newspapers like this one. Now, as Mr. Trump and his allies seem on the verge of staging a coup against independent institutions and the rule of law — maligning the special counsel Robert Mueller and threatening a purge at the F.B.I. — the president’s supporters are appropriating yet another word for themselves. Mr. Mueller’s investigation aims to “destroy” the Trump presidency “for partisan political purposes and to disenfranchise millions of American voters,” the Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed on Saturday. “We have a coup on our hands in America.” This marks a new era in American politics. The Republican Party is no longer just obfuscating the truth or defending the president when he is accused of wrongdoing. Rather, Mr. Trump, Fox News and Republicans in Congress seem to be actively using falsehoods to prepare an assault on the institutions that allow American democracy to function. In all democracies, politicians occasionally lie to cover up scandals or exaggerate their legislative accomplishments. In the United States, the rise of the right-wing news media in recent decades has tempted politicians to play to their own supporters without worrying whether their rhetoric is inflammatory or fair. But the construction of an alternate reality that obviates the very possibility of conducting politics on the basis of truth is a novelty in this country. And it is increasingly becoming obvious that it will serve a clear purpose: to prepare the ground for egregious violations of basic democratic norms. Once any string of words is considered as true as any other, any course of action comes to seem as legitimate as any other. One moment, Mr. Mueller is a respected civil servant leading an important investigation at the behest of the Justice Department. The next, he is plotting a coup — potentially committing treason, a felony for which the law demands the death penalty. By the same token, Mr. Trump would, at one moment, be scandalously overstepping the bounds of his rightful authority in firing Mr. Mueller or pardoning his closest associates. The next moment, he would be valiantly defending the Republic. "
1754,"President Trump on Wednesday commuted the prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, whose Iowa meatpacking plant was the target of a huge immigration raid in 2008, and whose 27-year prison sentence angered many Orthodox Jews. Mr. Rubashkin made national headlines nine years ago after federal agents arrived by helicopter at the Agriprocessors plant in Postville, Iowa, and detained nearly 400 undocumented immigrants, including several children, who were working there. Mr. Rubashkin was the company’s chief executive, and the plant had been the largest kosher meatpacking operation in the country. He was later convicted of bank fraud in federal court. Many Jewish leaders have rallied behind Mr. Rubashkin, whose treatment they said was unfair, perhaps even anti-Semitic, and whose sentence they considered unduly harsh and out of line with what other white-collar criminals received. Mr. Rubashkin had tried for years to get a reduced sentence, but was repeatedly turned down by the courts. “Rubashkin has remained strong throughout his ordeal and convinced he would eventually obtain justice,” said Guy R. Cook, the lead trial lawyer for Mr. Rubashkin, in an email on Wednesday night. “Rubashkin and his family are overjoyed he is free and will be reunited with them.” In a statement announcing the commutation, White House officials said they had received letters from more than 30 members of Congress, including several members of both parties, supporting an examination of the case. “The president’s review of Mr. Rubashkin’s case and commutation decision were based on expressions of support from members of Congress and a broad cross-section of the legal community,” the White House statement said.

1755,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The Republican tax bill will soon be law. But the fight over it is just beginning. Democrats will campaign against it and hope to repeal much of it. And no matter which party is in charge, Congress and the White House will have to revisit tax policy in coming years, because this bill is full of gimmicky expiration dates. It’s an unstable bill that’s “likely to prove fleeting,” as Fordham’s Rebecca Kysar and Linda Sugin write in The Times today. So when Congress next takes up tax policy, are there any parts of the bill it should preserve? Yes. Even a bill as dreadful as this one has a few positive attributes. In particular, this bill contains the faint outlines of sensible tax simplification. They are very faint, to be clear. The status quo would be vastly preferable to this bill. But once this bill becomes the status quo, Democrats should avoid trying to repeal all of it merely for the sake of doing so. As Bloomberg’s Justin Fox notes, a lower corporate-tax rate makes sense. For years, this country’s corporate-tax code has been the worst of both worlds. The official rate has been higher than almost any other country’s, encouraging companies to distort their behavior to avoid paying that rate. Yet the government has raised relatively little money in corporate-tax revenue, because the code’s many loopholes allow companies to avoid the official rate. (I went into detail in this 2011 column.) This bill solves only the first of those two problems and solves it too aggressively, cutting the rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent. As a result, it’s a huge handout to corporate America. “But,” Fox writes, “going back to 35 percent would be a bad idea.” "

It was an attempt to step back and look at the issue with more nuance, and context is exactly what many of you, our readers, helped add. I’m honestly not sure there is another place in the Australian media landscape where you’d find such a range of views and backgrounds all together. "
1757,"President Trump’s National Security Strategy marks a dramatic departure from the plans of his Republican and Democratic predecessors, painting a dark, almost dystopian portrait of an “extraordinarily dangerous” world characterized by hostile states and lurking threats. There is scant mention of America’s unrivaled political, military, technological and economic strength, or the opportunities to expand prosperity, freedom and security through principled leadership — the foundation of American foreign policy since World War II. In Mr. Trump’s estimation, we live in a world where America wins only at others’ expense. There is no common good, no international community, no universal values, only American values. America is no longer “a global force for good,” as in President Obama’s last strategy, or a “shining city on a hill,” as in President Reagan’s vision. The new strategy enshrines a zero-sum mentality: “Protecting American interests requires that we compete continuously within and across these contests, which are being played out in regions around the world.” This is the hallmark of Mr. Trump’s nationalistic, black-and-white “America First” strategy. But the world is actually gray, and Mr. Trump’s strategy struggles to draw nuanced distinctions. Throughout, China and Russia are conflated and equated as parallel adversaries. In fact, China is a competitor, not an avowed opponent, and has not illegally occupied its neighbors. Russia, as the strategy allows, aggressively opposes NATO, the European Union, Western values and American global leadership. It brazenly seized Georgian and Ukrainian territory and killed thousands of innocents to save a dictator in Syria. Russia is our adversary, yet Mr. Trump’s strategy stubbornly refuses to acknowledge its most hostile act: directly interfering in the 2016 presidential election to advantage Mr. Trump himself. On China and Russia, I suspect the White House realists, to escape the embarrassment of a strategy that ignored Russia’s hostile behavior, agreed to lump China with Russia and almost always mention China first, to placate their nationalist colleagues who hate China but admire Russia. The result is a flawed analysis that may actually drive Russia and China closer together. In several respects, including nuclear weapons and arms control, weapons of mass destruction, counterterrorism, intelligence, cyberthreats, space policy, unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property, the strategy falls within the bipartisan mainstream of United States national security policy, differing little from that of a more traditional Republican president. In other areas, it helpfully corrects this administration’s wavering course, as in its unequivocal embrace of United States allies and partners and reaffirmation of our Article V commitment to defend NATO. The strategy recognizes the threat from pandemics and biohazards and the importance of strengthening global health security. And it maintains at least a nominal commitment to women’s empowerment and providing generous humanitarian assistance. "
1758,"WASHINGTON — President Trump issued a threat on Wednesday to cut off American aid to any country that votes for a resolution at the United Nations condemning his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Mr. Trump’s statement, delivered at a cabinet meeting in which he exulted over the passage of a tax overhaul, followed a letter to General Assembly members from the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, in which she warned that the United States would take note of countries that voted in favor of the measure. “All of these nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council or they vote against us, potentially, at the Assembly, they take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,” Mr. Trump said. “Well, we’re watching those votes,” he added. “Let them vote against us; we’ll save a lot. We don’t care.” It is difficult to see how Mr. Trump can make good on that threat because it could involve cutting off financial assistance to the country’s most strategic allies in the Middle East. Some of those programs, like Egypt’s, are congressionally mandated. While the president can hold up aid unilaterally as a form of leverage, canceling it would require new legislation. Still, the bitter confrontation at the United Nations shows the lingering repercussions of Mr. Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem, which defied world opinion and upended decades of American policy. While the decision has not unleashed the violence in the Arab capitals that some had feared, it has left the United States diplomatically isolated. "
1759,"BERLIN — Deborah Feldman has learned to follow the sun. December marks the 31-year-old Brooklyn-raised writer’s fourth winter living in Berlin, a place notorious for its long, gray months, and by now she has it down: On the rare days when the cloud cover breaks, she hurries to her local market hall, a 100-year-old, light-flooded space in Berlin’s Kreuzberg neighborhood. There, the sun shines around noon, for an hour. Then, juggling TV interviews, photo shoots, newspaper deadlines, public readings, awards ceremonies, child care and work on her new novel, Ms. Feldman moves to a west-facing terrace in a nearby cemetery, before heading to her favorite cafe table at around 2 p.m. for a final 20-minute glimpse of the sun. “I try to get all the light I can,” Ms. Feldman said, with a smile. This perseverance has characterized much of Ms. Feldman’s extraordinary life. Born into a Yiddish-speaking Hasidic Jewish sect founded by Holocaust survivors, after World War II, in Brooklyn, Ms. Feldman was raised to believe that Hitler’s extermination of the Jews was God’s punishment for European Jewish assimilation. To save the Jewish nation, she was taught that Jews must live apart from society, and abide by old Jewish rules and traditions. She documented her repressive upbringing, the arranged marriage she entered into at 17 and her decision to take her young son and leave the community in her best-selling memoir, “Unorthodox,” which was published in the United States in 2012. But even after the success of her book, Ms. Feldman never felt quite at home in the United States. She found mainstream American life disorienting. “I grew up in a shtetl,” Ms. Feldman said, referring to the economic, political and cultural bubble she lived in. “It would have been really hopeless for me to try to become American.” In one of the dramatic ironies that punctuate her story, Ms. Feldman — who was raised by a loving but traumatized grandmother (her father was mentally ill and her mother left the marriage and the community when Ms. Feldman was young) who barely survived several Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen — instead found herself drawn to Berlin.

1761,"MOSCOW — The war in rebel-held eastern Ukraine has escalated sharply this week, with the heaviest fighting in nearly a year, European observers and Western diplomats reported on Wednesday. The fighting broke out in the midst of a snowstorm overnight Tuesday and has continued unabated since, the observers say. While skirmishes are common, the heavy artillery barrages have been the thickest since a flare-up in February. Ukrainian authorities linked the escalation to the Russian military’s decision to withdraw officers from a joint Russian and Ukrainian liaison group that had assisted in monitoring the shaky cease-fire deal, known as the Minsk 2 agreement. The Russian Foreign Ministry placed the blame for that on Ukraine, saying the Ukrainians had been intimidating the officers and that “all responsibility for possible consequences lies fully on the Ukrainian side.” Since then, a Ukrainian village and a town have been hit with rocket-artillery barrages, wounding eight people and damaging about 50 homes, and at least eight Ukrainian soldiers have been killed. The fighting has also drawn perilously close to a water-treatment plant that stores poisonous chlorine gas, alarming Western officials. “This is considered extremely dangerous,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said of the fighting that has now come within about 500 yards of the plant. Pipes that transport the gas — used mostly to disinfect water today, but as a chemical weapon during World War I — are now vulnerable. "
1762,"WASHINGTON — President Trump ended a chaotic first year by achieving his most convincing legislative triumph on Wednesday, making good on his promise to deliver what he called a “big, beautiful” tax cut before Christmas and finally demonstrating the political power of unified Republican control in Washington. Mr. Trump will soon affix his signature to the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that will have broad and far-reaching implications for individual and corporate finances, and will cement the president’s political ownership of an already growing economy that he inherited from his predecessor, President Barack Obama. House lawmakers gave final approval to the tax bill on Wednesday, voting 224 to 201 to drop the corporate rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent, and to deliver tax breaks to other businesses. As Republicans seek to bolster American competitiveness and spur economic growth, the bill also includes tax cuts for individuals that are set to expire after 2025 to make the bill comply with budget rules. The president’s turbulent first year in office has been dogged by investigations, staff turmoil and legislative missteps. But with passage of the tax overhaul, Mr. Trump will enter his second year in office with a roster of Republican achievements that he and his party will try to sell to voters in the 2018 midterm elections: lower taxes, more conservative judges, fewer regulations and more restrictive borders. “This is a big week,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a longtime Trump supporter. “A wide range of people are starting to say, ‘I like him, the tweets may irritate me, but something’s happened.’ Clearly this was the pièce de résistance — this bill at this moment just before Christmas.” It is not clear whether Mr. Trump is going to sign the bill before the end of the year. Republicans need to work with Democrats to avert automatic spending cuts that could be set off as a result of the tax bill adding to the deficit. They need support from Democrats to avoid these spending cuts, and if they wait until next year, it will buy them extra time to reach such a deal. Republicans in Congress were struggling to reach an agreement that would keep the government funded into January and avoid a shutdown. "
1763,"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’re dealing with uncertainty. How will the Trump administration’s national security strategy, which doesn’t mention global warming, influence military planning for a changing world? How can city planners prepare for rising seas when we don’t know how quickly those seas will rise? How much of a lasting imprint will oil drilling leave in the Arctic wildlife refuge? If all of that is worrisome, not to fear. You’re certain to like next week’s newsletter, when we’ll  look back at some of our biggest climate coverage of 2017. This week, national security experts and environmental activists lamented that President Trump’s new national security strategy does not identify climate change as a threat. It’s a stark reversal from President Barack Obama’s strategy in 2015, which stated that rising global temperatures were an “urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.” "
1764,"It was the year when athletes got political again, very political. By the time December arrived, it seemed more routine than incendiary when Lindsey Vonn, the star American skier, made it plain in a CNN interview that she would not be accepting an invitation to the White House if it were extended after the coming Winter Olympics. She said she would be representing her nation at the Games but not President Trump. “I am proud to be an American, and I want our country to continue to be a symbol of hope, compassion, inclusion and world unity,” Vonn said later, in another sign of the times, on her Instagram account. “My travels around the world have recently made clear that this is no longer how people view the United States. You cannot pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV in Europe without noticing how people are questioning our direction.” In a different era, Vonn, with her extensive list of corporate sponsors and hard-earned prominence in a niche sport, might have been the sort of well-entrenched figure who would have determined that she had much more to lose than to gain by taking a stand (or a knee) on a polarizing matter. There are still ample risks: see Colin Kaepernick’s current employment status after leading the way on national anthem protests in the N.F.L., or the menacing messages Vonn said she received from Trump supporters. But there is no doubt that Vonn was part of a sports chorus in 2017. “I think ‘take a knee’ has really taken on a life of its own and spearheaded everything else that’s been going on,” said the former tennis champion Martina Navratilova, 61, who came out as a lesbian and often spoke up — to her own commercial detriment — during her remarkable career. “Things always kind of operate by waxing and waning. This has been a big spurt, and it’s not done yet, because it hasn’t really been resolved one way or the other as far as I can tell.” "

1766,"Congressional Republicans have finally done it: Both the House and Senate passed tax legislation. The bill has now headed to President Trump’s desk for his signature. Most dissection of the plan has focused, for obvious reasons, on the way it changes our tax bills. The Tax Policy Center found that in the first years most people would get a tax cut, although the biggest cuts are reserved for the wealthiest. By 2027, lower- and middle-income Americans would get no benefit or actually pay more in taxes. But this bill also serves as a setup for steep government cuts. Programs from Medicare to flood insurance to food stamps will be at risk the moment President Trump’s signature dries. Some reductions would be inflicted automatically. Others, Republicans will pursue with a handy justification — the revenue hole created by their own legislation. Under the Pay-as-You-Go Act of 2010, or Paygo, the Office of Budget and Management has to order automatic spending cuts if legislation passed by Congress is set to increase the deficit and the rules aren’t waived or the loss isn’t covered by new revenue. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, spending cuts would have to total $136 billion for a bill, such as the tax legislation, that increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion over a decade. What would get cut? Some programs, like Social Security and unemployment benefits, are spared. But plenty of others are seriously exposed. While there are limits on how much Medicare would be pared back, it would still be slashed by $25 billion. The rest of the $111 billion would have to come from other mandatory government programs, and because most have no protection, they would be reduced to barely any funding or nothing at all. That includes block grants for things like Meals on Wheels, farm aid like the crop insurance fund, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and the National Flood Insurance Program. "

1768,"WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on five Russian individuals on Wednesday, including the leader of the Republic of Chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses and involvement in criminal conspiracies, a sign that the Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on Russia. The move, which comes despite a more accommodating tone that President Trump has struck with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, blocks property investments that the individuals hold in the United States and forbids Americans from engaging in financial transactions with them. The Treasury Department unveiled the sanctions under the authority of the 2012 Magnitsky Act, an American law that freezes the assets — held in the United States — by Russian officials responsible for human rights abuses, and bars them from receiving American visas. The law was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention after exposing a $230 million tax-theft scam plotted by Russian officials. “Treasury remains committed to holding accountable those involved in the Sergei Magnitsky affair, including those with a role in the criminal conspiracy and fraud scheme that he uncovered,” said John E. Smith, director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. “We will continue to use the Magnitsky Act to aggressively target gross violators of human rights in Russia, including individuals responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture and other despicable acts.” Among those targeted by the sanctions were Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, and Ayub Kataev, a Chechen law enforcement official, for their roles in extrajudicial killings and torture. In 2013, Mr. Kadyrov was placed on a classified list of Russians that the Obama administration had barred from traveling to the United States and whose assets were frozen. The list of prominent Russian figures was kept secret to avoid retaliation by Mr. Putin, but Treasury made public the sanctions against Mr. Kadyrov on Wednesday. "
1769,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump is celebrating his first major legislative victory. The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in a generation is headed to his desk after the Senate’s passage on party lines (and a revote in the House on technicalities). Our columnist looked at how the tech industry was left largely unscathed by the bill, and we’ll be analyzing the measure’s broader impact.

1770,"To the Editor: Re “Republican Tax Bill Passes Senate in 51-48 Vote” (nytimes.com, Dec. 20): During the second 2016 presidential debate, Donald Trump laid the responsibility for failing to close tax loopholes, which he freely admitted to exploiting, squarely at Hillary Clinton’s feet: “Why didn’t you change it when you were a senator?” He then promised — twice — to eliminate the carried interest provision (“one of the greatest provisions for people like me”), along with offering the assurance of “big league” tax relief for the middle class. Mrs. Clinton’s reply is worth remembering: “I’ll tell you what he’s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had … Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.” One of those candidates was telling the truth. The other is now the president of the United States. HOWARD KORDER, SANTA FE, N.M. To the Editor: The 27th Amendment says any pay raise that members of Congress give themselves cannot take effect before an intervening election, so that constituents can have a voice in whether the raise was deserved. Something is terribly foul, then, when Republicans in Congress enrich themselves and their president through a blatantly self-interested tax bill, enacted with no public hearings and minimal scrutiny. In all likelihood, the new tax code will benefit many politicians much more than any raise would. It took our Republic more than two centuries to ratify the 27th Amendment. It took the 45th president and Congress less than two months to render it irrelevant. "
1771,"UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations High Commissioner for human rights, who has openly criticized powerful governments, including the Trump administration, has made the unusual decision to not seek a second four-year term, saying it “might involve bending a knee in supplication.” The decision by the official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and former diplomat, was conveyed in a short statement that was emailed to his staff early Wednesday and shared with The New York Times. His four-year term expires next September. “After reflection, I have decided not to seek a second four-year term,” he wrote. “To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication; muting a statement of advocacy; lessening the independence and integrity of my voice — which is your voice.” Most United Nations officials serve as long as their mandate allows. Of the previous human rights chiefs, not one has served a full four-year second term. It has been unclear for months whether Mr. al-Hussein’s boss, Secretary General António Guterres, would support him in seeking a second term or whether the five veto-wielding permanent members of the United Nations Security Council would use their influence to block it. Mr. al-Hussein has been critical of all of them. He has been outspoken about the Russian-backed government of Syria. He has warned of the prospects of genocide by the Chinese-backed government of Myanmar. And he has called out the Trump administration several times, most pointedly on the travel ban against citizens of Muslim-majority countries and after the demonstrations by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. "
1772,"WASHINGTON — Senior national security officials in the Trump administration are embracing a proposal to transfer to Saudi Arabia an American citizen being held in Iraq as a wartime detainee, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. A meeting last week of the National Security Council’s “deputies committee” — the No. 2 leaders of national security departments and agencies — found its members united around a goal of pursuing such a transfer for the detainee, suspected of being a low-level Islamic State fighter, who has been held in military custody as an “enemy combatant” for the past three months, the officials said. The man, whose name the government has refused to make public, was born in the United States to visiting Saudi parents, the officials said. A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to comment. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal deliberations. The Trump administration has been wrestling with what to do with the man since a Syrian militia turned him over to American forces in mid-September. Legal pressure to resolve his fate has been building since the American Civil Liberties Union filed a habeas corpus lawsuit in October challenging his detention on his behalf. The government initially wanted to prosecute the man in a civilian court for providing material assistance to terrorism, but the F.B.I. was unable to assemble sufficient courtroom-admissible evidence against him.

1774,"The jury considering the fate of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker charged with participating in an oil-for-gold smuggling scheme that violated United States sanctions against Iran, was sent home by the judge on Wednesday after deliberating for half a day without reaching a verdict. Mr. Atilla, 47, was a deputy general manager of a Turkish state bank, Halkbank, that prosecutors say was crucial to the success of the sanctions evasion. The government presented evidence that Mr. Atilla helped to devise the scheme and that he deceived United States Treasury Department officials about it. “This is a case about lies,” a prosecutor, Michael D. Lockard, said Tuesday in the government’s closing argument. “This is a case about the lies that Mr. Atilla told to cover up a multibillion dollar sanctions-busting scheme operating out of his bank.” Mr. Atilla, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he had participated in any such conspiracy or that he had engaged in wrongdoing. His lawyers painted him as the victim of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who pleaded guilty in October and has been cooperating with the government. “Hakan Atilla is a blameless pawn, collateral damage in a story that belongs in the ‘Twilight Zone,’ not in an American courtroom,” Victor J. Rocco, a lawyer for Mr. Atilla, told the jury on Tuesday in the defense’s summation. Over seven days of testimony, Mr. Zarrab, 34, said the scheme had been approved at the highest levels of the Turkish government. In 2012, he said, Recep Tayyip Erdogan — then Turkey’s prime minister, now its president — ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the operation. "

Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The Republican tax plan, which passed Congress Wednesday, has caused AT&T to open up its wallet. The telecom giant said in a press release that it will pay a $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 employees in the United States and would increase its capital expenditure budget for next year by $1 billion. (AT&T said last month it would invest an additional $1 billion if the tax bill became law.) At a news conference Wednesday, President Trump cited AT&T’s move. Is AT&T trying to get on Mr. Tump’s good side? The company is locked in an antitrust battle with the Justice Department to complete its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. The department sued to block the deal and it is scheduled to go to trial March 19. The Justice Department has pushed for AT&T to divest either CNN’s parent company, Turner Broadcasting, or its valuable DirecTV service in return for approval. Those terms have raised the question of whether the department was making good on President Trump’s campaign threat to block the deal. AT&T would not be the first company to seemingly try and get on Mr. Trump’s good side to complete a deal. Last month Broadcom’s C.E.O. held a press conference with President Trump to announce plans to move the company’s headquarters to the United States. On the day of the announcement, analysts speculated that it was done to ease approval of Broadcom’s $5.5 billion bid for Brocade, which had been delayed for a year. But the next day The Wall Street Journal reported that Broadcom was planning to make an unsolicited $103 billion bid for Qualcomm. Liz Moyer at CNBC reports: Boeing said Wednesday that it would invest $100 million in employee training and another $100 million in workplace infrastructure. It also said it would increase its corporate giving by $100 million. "
1776,"CAIRO — Vice President Mike Pence’s planned visit to the Middle East, the cradle of Christianity, ought to have had a particular poignancy in the days before Christmas. It didn’t quite work out that way. When he first floated the idea of a trip in October, Mr. Pence, an evangelical Christian, vowed to highlight the persecution of Christians at the hands of Islamic State extremists, and he scheduled meeting with several Christian leaders, which was sure to play well with his conservative American base. “Christianity now faces an exodus in the Middle East unrivaled since the days of Moses,” he said in a speech sprinkled with biblical references. “Help is on the way.” But then on Dec. 6, President Trump recognized  Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, smashing seven decades of American policy and provoking violent protests. One by one, Christian leaders publicly canceled their meetings with Mr. Pence. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority — a critical figure in the Trump administration’s ambitious plans for a sweeping Middle East peace deal — also canceled. "

1778,"WASHINGTON — It was an unsightly and painful yearlong slog, but Republicans are finally getting what they so desperately craved — a major legislative victory in the form of a consequential tax overhaul. By coupling a substantial corporate tax cut with an assortment of naked appeals to undecided lawmakers, Republican leaders pushed their tax bill through the House on Tuesday and the Senate on Wednesday, touching off a self-congratulatory tidal wave by a party that had struggled mightily through nearly all of 2017. After an embarrassing inability to repeal the Affordable Care Act — a core promise by congressional Republicans since 2010 — Republicans knew they had no choice but to deliver a tax package or face brutal repudiation by their voters and campaign donors. “Our attitude from the beginning was failure was not an option,” said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No.3 House Republican and the party’s chief vote counter. But even as they closed in on what they celebrated as a historic triumph, Republicans found another creative way to stumble. A challenge to the House-passed measure by Senate Democrats discovered three provisions — including the very title of the bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — that violated special Senate rules being used to skirt a filibuster. The flub necessitated the formality of a second House vote on Wednesday after Speaker Paul D. Ryan and his membership had already spiked the ball after initial approval of the bill on Tuesday. "
1779,"A scientist recruited by the renowned Cleveland Clinic is stuck in India because his visa is delayed. An entrepreneur courted by Silicon Valley companies had his application denied. Many green card applicants have new interviews to pass. The Trump administration has pursued its immigration agenda loudly and noticeably, ramping up arrests of undocumented immigrants, barring most travel from several majority-Muslim countries and pressing the case for a border wall. But it has also quietly, and with much less resistance, slowed many forms of legal immigration without the need for Congress to rescind a single visa program enshrined in the law. Immigration and State Department officials are more closely scrutinizing, and have started more frequently denying, visas for people seeking to visit the United States on business, as well as for those recruited by American companies, according to lawyers representing visa seekers. Foreigners already in the United States whose employers wish to extend their stays are also facing new hurdles. “I call this the real wall,” said Anastasia Tonello, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The wall is being built.” The changes show how the Trump administration has managed to carry out the least attention-grabbing, but perhaps farthest-reaching, portion of the president’s immigration plans: cutting the number of people entering the United States each year as temporary workers or permanent residents.

ordan Peele is famous, in part, for imitations — of rappers and dingbats and the 44th president of the United States. But he would be impossible to imitate. He isn’t ribald. He’s droll. Sometimes he’s not even that. Sometimes he’s quiet. Sometimes he’s sitting across from you expecting you to hold up your end of a conversation. Sometimes he’s listening and hearing you — like, really hearing you. This is the Peele who made “Get Out,” and it takes a minute to square him with the Peele from “Key & Peele.” On Halloween, we had lunch at one of those casually cool American bistros in Los Angeles where all the food seems as if it was grown out back. He chose a spot outside, not to be seen (although a few people saw him) but mostly to see. Peele, who is 38, lives in his head, and he watches the world around him intensely. I got the duck, then so did he, and while we ate I was pretty sure I could hear him thinking. It was toward the end of the meal when he saw someone he recognized. Well, he thought he did. “He’s dressed like Chris,” he said with some amusement. “Do you think he’s being Chris?” He was looking past me, so it was hard to turn all the way around to confirm with any subtlety. But Peele’s gaze made it perfectly obvious to the person approaching that Peele was looking at him. “Are you Chris from ‘Get Out’ for Halloween?” Peele asked, committing less an act of racial profiling than an uncanny identification of his own handiwork. “Get Out,” of course, is the surprise hit movie that Peele wrote and directed about a black man named Chris, who discovers that his white girlfriend’s family is running a nasty racist conspiracy. Chris has big, watery eyes that seem red from weariness (or weed) and wears a collarless blue chambray shirt over a gray T-shirt and jeans. The man Peele thought might be costumed as Chris was also black, with skin as dark and eyes as striking as those of Daniel Kaluuya, the actor who plays Chris. This impostor was indeed Chris-attired too. And the white woman he was with could also have been part of the costume. It was the sort of similarity that, once pointed out, can’t be unseen. Alas, it wasn’t Halloween for this guy, just Tuesday. He was thrilled, nonetheless, to be stopped by Chris’s inventor, and he asked Peele for a photo. Peele, who got a kick even out of being wrong, asked him for one, too. The impostor then offered an incidental, partial explanation for why “Get Out” became the phenomenon it did: No, he wasn’t Chris, “but I could be.” It has been 10 months, and we’re still talking about this movie and its alarming presentation of white racism. “Get Out” opened at the top of the box office at the end of February and has grossed many, many times the $4.5 million it cost to make. Racism is old, but Peele found a poetic new way of talking about it. He gave us language we didn’t know we lacked. For a white audience, the movie might be one of the few times they’ve been asked to identify with a regular, imperiled black person without the sweetener of a white co-star — no Spencer Tracy or Sandra Bullock here, just Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford as the Armitages, the sort of parents who’ll inquire about the history of their daughter’s interracial relationship by asking: “How long’s this been going on? This thang,” as daddy Armitage does. For a black audience, the movie could have ended right there. What does an affluent, middle-aged, suburban white dude know about a thang? And what’s he doing saying the word with this much insinuating self-delight, this much put-on jive? “I didn’t want any white saviors,” Peele said over lunch. White saviors hog the history of race in American film. Instead, his movie is full of white people whom Peele reveals as insatiable predators of blackness. "

1782,"Early in “The Greatest Showman,” P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: “Just once I’d like to give them something real.” What fun is that? Even after the long-running circus bearing his name closed up shop this year, P.T. Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There’s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: “We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.” “The Greatest Showman,” a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It’s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right. “Showman” has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year’s hit movie “La La Land” (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show “Dear Evan Hansen” (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn’t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn’t get any wittier than that. "

1786,"PRIENAI, Lithuania — It was only fitting, perhaps, that an intercontinental escapade exhibiting the awesome power of the present day sports-celebrity-industrial complex began with a late-night direct message on Twitter. At around 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 6, Erikas Kirvelaitis, a 21-year-old basketball journalist in Lithuania, sent an unsolicited question via Twitter to Harrison Gaines, a sports agent in Los Angeles with two semifamous teenage clients: Would LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball, by any chance, be interested in playing professional basketball in Prienai? Kirvelaitis had been hired only a few months earlier to do part-time communications work for Prienai-Birstonas Vytautas, a small club here in the Lithuanian basketball league. His bosses did not know at first about his Twitter gambit. It was a shot in the dark, anyway. But to Kirvelaitis’s amazement, Gaines wrote back asking for more information. And less than a week later, the young Americans were signing contracts to begin their professional careers in this unassuming town nearly 6,000 miles from home. “It was like a dream, crazy, a miracle, for our club to even have contact with them,” Kirvelaitis said. “But I’m someone who believes anything can be done if you try.” "
1787,"WASHINGTON — The House, forced to vote a second time on the $1.5 trillion tax bill, moved swiftly to pass the final version on Wednesday, clearing the way for President Trump to sign into law the most sweeping tax overhaul in decades. House lawmakers approved the tax bill 224 to 201 on Wednesday, after being forced to vote on the bill again after last-minute revisions were made to it in the Senate, which passed the measure 51 to 48 early Wednesday morning. The final House vote was essentially a formality, as the changes, which were made to comply with Senate budget rules, did not significantly alter the overall bill. But the need for a second vote gave ammunition to Democrats, who had already accused Republicans of trying to rush the tax overhaul through the House and Senate. “We are five days away from Christmas, but it feels like Groundhog Day,” said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who denounced the process by which Republicans undertook their tax rewrite as “nothing short of an abomination.” Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said, “We will be cleaning up this mess and the blunders in this bill all of next year.” "
1788,"WASHINGTON — President Trump celebrated the tax bill that Congress approved on Wednesday by characterizing it as a two-for-one victory, falsely claiming that it also made good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “When the individual mandate is being repealed, that means Obamacare is being repealed,” Mr. Trump said in a cabinet meeting. “We have essentially repealed Obamacare, and we will come up with something that will be much better.” Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he kept two key campaign promises with one bill is not accurate. Effectively, the tax bill does repeal the individual mandate beginning in 2019. The mandate is a core component of the Affordable Care Act and fines people who do not have health insurance. But the tax bill leaves every other vital part of the current health care law intact. “The A.C.A. is far more than the mandate, and the repeal of the mandate is by no means a fatal blow. Most of the A.C.A. survives, and most of its coverage gains will remain,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law and a contributing editor for the journal Health Affairs. Republicans repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act over the summer. The individual mandate was one of 12 key elements of the health care law, which also included provisions that addressed access to insurance, requirements for insurance policies and costs of coverage. "
1789,"WASHINGTON — The Republican tax bill headed for President Trump’s desk is the most ambitious test yet of his approach to economic policy — that his ideas for strengthening American business will increase the prosperity of the American people. Mr. Trump championed the plan to cut corporate and individual taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade, forgoing revenue that could have been spent on new roads, worker training or better schools, on the theory that investors will make better use of the money, creating wealth for all Americans. He is pressing to reduce federal regulation, declaring last week that the government has imposed too many rules and constraints, creating a burden that “destroys our companies” and hurts American workers. And bolstering business in the United States is the guiding principle of Mr. Trump’s approach to trade — although his vision of what will help companies competing in a global economy differs sharply from the perspectives of many corporate executives. Mr. Trump, whose worldview is that exports strengthen the economy while imports drain away the nation’s wealth, wants to erect tariffs and other trade barriers to protect American companies from foreign competition, arguing that will translate into more and better-paying jobs. In recent decades, the two political parties pursued economic policies focused on helping people directly. Republicans championed lower income taxes; Democrats emphasized expansion of the social safety net. Both parties sought to improve education through regulation and subsidies. And presidents from the two parties backed trade deals that sacrificed manufacturing jobs for a wave of imports that let consumers buy televisions, furniture and clothing at lower prices. "
1790,"Last week, we found ourselves in an unexpected place: in the very back of the top balcony in the Stockholm Concert Hall, watching as King Carl XVI Gustaf awarded medals to this year’s Nobel laureates — in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and economics. As Americans spending the year in Sweden, we were honored and surprised to learn that we had been invited. While we were inspired by the pageantry of the celebration of human achievement, we were simultaneously sobered by the realization that the Trump administration is attacking the very institutions that make Nobel Prize-winning careers possible. In doing so, our country is charting a path to its own irrelevance. The Nobel ceremony takes place each year on Dec. 10, and tickets to the 1,800-seat hall are hard to come by. Each laureate gets 35. The royal family and political figures get their share. Some tickets are given by lottery to students, who wear sailor caps with their universities’ insignia. The remaining invitations are issued according to some unknown hierarchy. Most Swedes end up watching it from their living rooms. Befitting our low rank in the hierarchy, we found out only in late November that we would be attending. We dressed as best we could — a boring suit and tie instead of tails, a borrowed cocktail dress instead of a ball gown — and made our way to the ceremony. As Americans, this was an especially good year to attend. An impressive eight of the 12 individual laureates were American. Watching the ceremony, it was easy to feel patriotic. The laureates on stage represented decades of persistent, innovative work. They showed the intellectual power of the United States’ educational system and the transformative research it produces. We thought about the thousands of students who had passed through their labs, classes and office hours. While the awards are given to only a select few, we know well that each laureate represents an entire intellectual community. But this year, the American Nobel laureates were shunned by President Trump. Breaking with recent tradition, he refused to invite them to the White House. This is difficult to understand. If you’re interested in building up and blaring out American greatness, why not show off what’s already great about the country? In this scenario, the laureates are like the proverbial canaries in a coal mine. The contrast between their warm celebration in Stockholm and their cold reception back home is a harbinger of the United States’ future irrelevance. All of the American laureates are university professors. Yet the current administration and its supporters consistently attack universities as biased, irrelevant and hyper-politicized. It ignores the many contributions that “basic research” has made to human liberty and security. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has no experience — professional or personal — with public schools and no familiarity with fundamental concepts of education. The administration uses dishonest critiques as an excuse to push its political agenda, cutting funding for research that is politically inconvenient. In our own state university system in North Carolina, conservative political appointees to the governing board have closed research centers focused on poverty and banned litigation by the Center for Civil Rights. They are exploring ways to force conservative views onto campuses through intellectual affirmative action. The United States has the best system of higher education in the world, yet this administration and its acolytes seem bent on tearing it down. "
1791,"President Trump on Wednesday was poised to sign the new tax bill, passed by Congress, which lifts a decades-old ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska. Here’s a look at what might happen now. No. Both supporters and opponents say it could be years before the first lease sale, a precursor to any drilling. The new legislation requires that the Department of Interior conduct one sale within four years and a second within seven. But there are many steps that must be taken before those sales can be held, and the process is not completely clear. Lawsuits and other actions by opponents of drilling could slow things, both before and after any lease sales. The Interior Department will have to identify lands in the 1.5 million acres of the refuge along the coastal plain, known as the 1002 area, for leases. Once the department comes up with a list of options, there will be at least one comment period in which the public will have a chance to be heard. One question mark is whether new seismic studies will be undertaken. Such studies can reveal underground formations that have high oil development potential, and the only ones that were done in the refuge are more than three decades old. Based on the old studies, the United States Geological Survey has estimated that the 1002 area contains from 5 to 16 billion barrels of oil. David W. Houseknecht, a senior research geologist with the survey, said the agency was about to re-analyze the data using improved software in hopes of reducing the uncertainty of that estimate. But new studies using modern three-dimensional technology could produce even better estimates. The Interior Department in September proposed allowing new studies, but it is unclear whether oil companies, if allowed, would undertake them, or whether the Interior Department would wait for them to be done before conducting a sale. Oil companies have bid on drilling leases in other areas with less-than-ideal information. "
1792,"A day after a dramatic recount handed Democrats a single-vote victory in a Virginia House of Delegates race, the outcome abruptly shifted on Wednesday as a three-judge panel declared the race now tied. The judges meeting in Newport News, Va., agreed to a Republican request to count a problematic ballot discarded the day before, said Philip L. Hatchett, a lawyer for David Yancey, the Republican incumbent who seemed to have lost his seat to Shelly Simonds, a Democrat. A victory by Ms. Simonds, a school board member in Newport News, would evenly split the Virginia House 50-50 and end 17 years of Republican majorities. The decision sets up a remarkable scenario: a drawing of a name from a bowl to pick the winner of the race and, with it, the balance of power in a chamber of the state legislature. The drawing will take place on Wednesday in Richmond, the State Board of Elections announced on Thursday. According to James Alcorn, the chairman of the election board, each candidate’s name will be put into an old 35-millimeter film canister, the canisters will be mixed together in a bowl, and one will be plucked by an elections official. Mr. Alcorn said the same process is used regularly to choose the order of names on a ballot. The disputed ballot in that was debated in court on Wednesday showed two bubbles filled in, one for Ms. Simonds and one for Mr. Yancey, but with a fine line struck through the Simonds vote, according to a copy obtained by The Virginian-Pilot. The voter chose Republicans for governor and in other statewide races on the Nov. 7 ballot. "
1793,"The New York Times said on Wednesday that Glenn Thrush, one of the paper’s most prominent political reporters, would remain suspended until late January and then be removed from the team covering the White House after he faced allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The decision came a month after the website Vox published a report that contained allegations from four female journalists of inappropriate behavior by Mr. Thrush. After learning Vox planned to run its article, which was published on Nov. 20, The Times began an investigation into Mr. Thrush’s conduct. The inquiry was led by Charlotte Behrendt, a lawyer in the Times newsroom, and involved interviews with more than 30 people in New York and Washington, both inside and outside The Times, according to a person briefed on the process. Ms. Behrendt compiled a report with her findings that was reviewed by Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and a group of top editors. Mr. Thrush was told of the decision on Wednesday during a meeting with Mr. Baquet. In a statement, Mr. Baquet said the company had completed its inquiry and found that Mr. Thrush had “behaved in ways that we do not condone.” “While we believe that Glenn has acted offensively, we have decided that he does not deserve to be fired,” Mr. Baquet said. Mr. Baquet also said Mr. Thrush was undergoing counseling and substance abuse rehabilitation on his own and that he would receive training “to improve his workplace conduct.” "
1794,"Two teenage unauthorized immigrants who sued the Trump administration to be allowed to obtain abortions while in custody are free to end their pregnancies, even as the legal fight continues over the policy that had prevented them from doing so. When they decided they wanted abortions this fall, the teenagers were being held in government-run shelters for young immigrants who are caught crossing the border illegally and without an adult. But the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that operates the facilities, had adopted a policy in March prohibiting federally funded shelters from taking “any action that facilitates” an abortion for an unaccompanied minor without the approval of the agency’s director. The immigrants challenged the policy in court, and on Monday, a federal judge in Washington ruled in their favor, ordering the government to allow the teenagers, referred to in court documents as Jane Roe and Jane Poe, to obtain abortions. The Trump administration quickly appealed. By Tuesday night, however, the government had stood aside: Roe was released from custody, and administration lawyers stopped attempting to block Poe from moving ahead with her abortion. The underlying issue is still being fought in court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the two women as well as a third young immigrant who was able to end her pregnancy after a court order in October, has asked the judge to allow the A.C.L.U. to continue litigating the abortion policy as a class-action lawsuit, which would seek to prevent the administration from stopping such abortions in the future. “We know that there are other young women who will need access to abortion, abortion information, and this policy will prevent them from accessing the abortion, just as it did for all the other Janes,” Brigitte Amiri, the lead A.C.L.U. lawyer on the case, said. “It is extreme and unconstitutional and just heartless.” "
1795,"The tax bill passed by Congress on Wednesday is effectively a giant bet that benefits given to companies and the wealthy will help average workers. That makes them a big risk for the Republicans who control Congress. Here are five factors to measure the policy’s success. Inequality: Republicans have done a bad job selling their plan to the public, with 55 percent of Americans opposing it, according to a CNN poll. The top 5 percent of income earners would see the biggest cuts, the Tax Policy Center said. Republicans risk the biggest backlash on this front, with reductions in tax breaks like state and local deductions hitting average Americans. Any sign that the tax bill has worsened rather than eased inequity will hand Democrats a stick to thwack Republicans in midterm elections next year. Wages: Pay increases have been disappointing given the low 4.1 percent level of unemployment. The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers said a corporate tax rate of 20 percent — just below the 21 percent on which Congress settled — would result in an average annual income increase of at least $4,000 at the end of 10 years. A visible rise in wages would be a positive effect of the tax bill. Yet it’s also one of the most dubious projections because companies will be under pressure to share earnings gains with shareholders, too. Stock market: One of President Trump’s most common brags is on the rise of markets. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tweeted “DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.” Tax cuts will probably send markets even higher — and are most likely one reason valuations are already so lofty — but because it suggests investors think higher earnings will flow to the bottom line rather than being paid out to workers, it’s perhaps not such an encouraging sign. Capital investment: Nonresidential business investment has improved after being sluggish or negative over the last two years. Spending on equipment rose 10.4 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in three years. But the type of investment is important. An increase will only matter if it helps bolster sluggish productivity. G.D.P. growth: Mr. Trump predicted tax cuts would turbocharge the economy to a 6 percent growth rate, compared with the 3.3 percent annualized expansion in the third quarter. The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated an earlier Senate tax plan would add 0.8 percent to G.D.P. over a decade. Trump’s estimate is unrealistic but a modest lift is expected. Still, the tax plan will not pay for itself, as the White House contends, and may add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. That trade-off may be this tax bill’s biggest legacy. "
1796,"Good morning on this drafty Wednesday. Over the last few years, we’ve noticed a disheartening commoditization and mass production taking hold of a classic holiday tradition. We’re talking about ugly Christmas sweaters. Call us traditionalists, but a true ugly Christmas sweater should lack any irony when it is made. Ideally, the garment’s makers genuinely think their unsightly design is quite lovely. Once upon a time, before ugly Christmas sweaters were a joke, that was the case. “A lot of the most popular designs of the ugly Christmas sweater revolution were taken from thrift shops or an aunt or grandmother’s closet,” said Brian Miller, one of the authors of “Ugly Christmas Sweater Party Book: The Definitive Guide to Getting Your Ugly On.” “They weren’t really intended to be funny or mass produced,” Mr. Miller said. “They were just gaudy and stood out when you put them on, and other people thought, ‘That’s hilarious.’” According to his research, the first large, organized ugly Christmas sweater party was at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver in 2002. About a decade ago, the trend caught on more widely. Personally, Mr. Miller favors Nordic designs from the 1970s made with high-quality wool. The mark of a good sweater, he said, “is basically something you would have opened from your great-aunt as a 10-year-old and thrown a fit. Those are the ones I love now.” "
1797,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday that 8.8 million people had signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s federal marketplace, a surprisingly large number only slightly lower than the total in the last open enrollment period, which was twice as long and heavily advertised. The numbers essentially defied President Trump’s assertion that “Obamacare is imploding.” They suggested that consumers want and need the coverage and subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act, even though political battles over the law, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, are sure to continue in Congress and in next year’s midterm election campaigns. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, reported the total in a Twitter post on Thursday. She said her agency had done a great job to “make this the smoothest experience for consumers to date.” The number of people who signed up this year was 96 percent of the 9.2 million who selected health plans or were automatically re-enrolled through the federal marketplace in the last sign-up season. “It’s a very, very strong number,” said Joshua Peck, who was the chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov in the Obama administration. “It implies that the final week of open enrollment this year was very big.” "
1798,"Eric Schmidt joined Google in 2001 to provide what amounted to adult supervision for the company’s young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He helped take Google public in 2004 and built it into a colossus. In 2011, after being appointed executive chairman, he became a prominent emissary for the company to Washington. Now, Mr. Schmidt is stepping down as executive chairman of the internet search giant’s parent, Alphabet, the company said on Thursday. He will relinquish his role at Alphabet’s next board meeting, in January. Mr. Schmidt, 62, will continue to be a member of the company’s board and become a technical adviser, Alphabet said, adding that it expects to appoint another chairman. No reason was provided for the change. In a statement, Mr. Schmidt said that he, Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, “believe that the time is right in Alphabet’s evolution for this transition.” The shift underlines how Mr. Schmidt’s influence at Alphabet has waned over time and how a new generation of leaders is firmly in charge at the giant company. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin remain at the top of Alphabet and retain voting control, but the executives they now have working for them have evolved. More of them are younger executives who rose through the ranks, such as Mr. Pichai, or are superstar executives hired from the outside, including Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer who was brought in from Morgan Stanley in 2015. Mr. Schmidt’s stepping back is expected to have little practical effect on the day-to-day operations of the behemoth operation. But it is one of the most significant personnel shifts at the internet giant since Mr. Page took over as chief executive in 2011, and especially because Mr. Schmidt has been such a willing public face of the company for so long. Internally at Google, the inclusion of Mr. Pichai in Mr. Schmidt’s statement on Thursday, alongside the names of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, was seen as a passing of the torch and the creation of a new power triumvirate. "
1799,"DUBLIN — An Irish county council on Thursday gave a golf resort owned by President Trump approval to build two sea walls, a reduced version of an earlier plan but one that still generated opposition from environmentalists. Trump International Golf Links, which owns the resort at Doonbeg, County Clare, intends to build a line of two low, concealed sea walls, 2,000 feet long and 840 feet long, on the landward side of a public beach to prevent storm waters from eroding three holes of the course. A previous application for a continuous 1.7-mile-long structure was withdrawn last year. Thursday’s decision by the Clare County Council can be appealed to the national planning authority. The resort’s new plan was supported by some local residents, who said they hoped that Mr. Trump would follow up on plans to invest millions in the property. “We’ve been campaigning for 25 years to bring investment to our community,” said Rita McInerney, a local businesswoman. “There is a not a lot of opportunity for employment here. They already employ 250 people there in the summer, and there’ll be more if they feel they can expand it. We’ll continue to work with the owners, whoever they are.” Records show that Mr. Trump paid 8.7 million euros for the resort at an auction in 2014. It had originally opened in 2002, having cost €28 million to build. Environmentalists said the new coastal walls would damage a popular public beach and vulnerable dunes and heath. Some residents also objected, saying the walls would alter tidal flows and divert storm surges into their own properties. The leader of the Irish Green Party, Eamon Ryan, who objected to the application, said the party was disappointed in the decision and would consider filing an appeal. “The best advice we had was that it would be better to move the golf holes farther inland,” he said, “where there’s room for them, rather than disrupt the beach.” Mr. Ryan said that he did not believe Mr. Trump’s ownership had influenced the council members, but that “they wouldn’t be human beings if they weren’t sensitive to the fact that the golf course in question is owned by the president of the United States.” The earlier application had included references to climate change and the threat of global warming, which Mr. Trump had previously described as a hoax, in its case for building the wall. The new application did not mention global warming. The general manager of the resort, Joe Russell, said Trump Doonbeg was pleased with the decision and had ambitious plans to expand its facilities.
