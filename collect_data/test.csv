"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared Wednesday that North Korea is “no longer a nuclear threat” to the United States even though the two sides had yet to forge a concrete disarmament plan and offered incomplete accounts of what they agreed to during this week’s summit meeting in Singapore. Rejoicing in the glow of a historic encounter, Mr. Trump returned to Washington and portrayed his agreement with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, as a signal achievement that meant that the outcast state was no longer the United States’ most dangerous problem. But the path to disarmament remained no clearer a day after the meeting. North Korea’s state-controlled news media described a step-by-step process to dismantle its nuclear weapons, with the United States rewarding it at each stage, something Mr. Trump has seemed to reject in the past. Mr. Trump’s team insisted that North Korea had agreed to an intrusive inspection regime even though Pyongyang made no mention of that. The confusion stemmed from a joint statement that was long on lofty language and short on specifics. Signed Tuesday with a flourish by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the statement offered more aspiration than action, clocking in at only 391 words. Mr. Trump was hardly sweating the details, however, convinced that his meeting with Mr. Kim, the first between leaders of their two countries, had transformed the relationship and ended an era of hostility and mutual threats of destruction. “Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,” he wrote on Twitter. “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Was Outfoxed in Singapore” (column, June 13): I usually agree with Nicholas Kristof on almost anything he writes about, but I’m not in full agreement here. The main narrative in most articles in The Times is that President Trump got played, making major concessions with virtually nothing in return. However, that’s not quite true. Even though the agreement that Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un signed lacks specifics on implementation, it does set forth basic principles of what the two nations are aiming for. Yes, Mr. Kim can play this false, as every other North Korean dictator has, but it certainly sets the stage for further discussions on the technical issues. I firmly do not like President Trump and hope he gets impeached, but I’m willing to admit that if he actually pulls this off, it is a worthwhile achievement and should be supported. Don’t forget that Mr. Trump said the United States is not removing any sanctions until there is a verifiable, significant dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. I say stay this course and see what happens. BARRY FISHER, COSTA MESA, CALIF. To the Editor: North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, runs one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world with an iron fist. He recklessly shoots test missiles over Japan and has threatened to destroy the United States with nuclear weapons. He buys luxurious items for himself and his cronies while much of his population is starving. He has imprisoned over 200,000 of his own people in horrific work camps, with many subjected to hard labor, malnourished and tortured. He has brutally killed his own relatives, including his half-brother, to secure power and has harshly treated Americans and other foreigners in captivity — who were often arrested for minor offenses — causing the death of at least one American.

"For several years, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Timothy Draper has sought to break up California, citing its unwieldy size as damaging to the state’s schools, livability and the economy. In November, California residents will get their chance to vote on his latest proposal: to divide the world’s fifth-largest economy into three separate states. Mr. Draper, who made his fortune investing in start-up companies, is proposing that the state of 40 million people be split into three entities with roughly the same populations. Northern California would comprise the upper part of the state, including Silicon Valley and San Francisco; Southern California would include a vast swath of the inland’s verdant farmland, stretching to San Diego; a third state, simply called California, would hug the coastline from Monterey to Los Angeles. If Californians approve the controversial ballot measure, which academics and others say faces many obstacles, it would still need the blessing of the California Legislature and the United States Congress. Politicians, for one, may be wary of splitting up a state that has long voted Democrat. Vikram Amar, a professor and dean of the College of Law at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, said California’s conservative-leaning inland empire (which would be part of the new Southern California) could swing Republican. “That is a risk Democrats in California and Washington, D.C., will be loath to run,” he said. Californians have long debated whether they were better as a whole or in parts. In 1941, a group of secessionists along the border of Northern California and Southern Oregon proposed creating a new state called “Jefferson.” It was called the “Yreka Rebellion” then, and was initially dismissed as a publicity stunt. It gained momentum as rural voters sought autonomy from their urban counterparts, a common refrain among Californians. "
"PARIS — A boat crowded with hundreds of Africans sailing across the Mediterranean after being turned away by Italy this week has exposed anew the shaky fault lines in Europe’s approach to the migrant crisis. On Sunday, Italy’s new far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, ordered the Aquarius, a rescue ship operated by humanitarian groups, to stop 35 nautical miles off the coast of Italy, refusing to let it dock. The ship is now on its way to Spain, which showed up its neighbors by solemnly announcing that it would “respect its international engagements” and accept the boat after Malta, too, refused it, and France stood idly by. Brussels, the seat of the European Union, looked on in relative silence. There was no common policy to receive the Aquarius and no authority to impose one if there were. The imbroglio was “symptomatic of the lack of coordination of a managed migration policy at the European Union level,” said Imogen Sudbery of the International Rescue Committee in Brussels. The Italian refusal to offer safe harbor to a ship loaded with what aid groups described as 629 migrants — including 123 minors, 11 small children and seven pregnant women — was intended to underscore a long-simmering grievance.

"To the Editor: Re “Voters in G.O.P. Punish Criticism of the President” (front page, June 13): So now it is not enough to vote for President Trump’s policies, as Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina has mostly done. He has also dared to criticize the president’s outrageous behavior, and that is no longer permissible. His opponent attacked him for “bashing our captain.” Mr. Trump is now fully unleashed, and the parallels with authoritarian leaders grow apace. The “cult of personality,” in Mr. Sanford’s words, that is dominating the Republican Party is fully formed. I am very scared. JANICE GEWIRTZ
MOUNTAIN LAKES, N.J. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House’s guest list last week for President Trump’s first dinner celebrating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan included a who’s who of diplomats from the Middle East. But the event turned out to be more notable for who apparently was not there: representatives from Muslim American groups. The night highlighted a paradox of Mr. Trump’s presidency. While he has sought to ally himself with Middle Eastern leaders, in part by at times softening his hostile tone on Islam, at home Mr. Trump has seemingly made little attempt to repair his fractured relationship with Muslim Americans — even those in his own party. Saba Ahmed, the president of the Republican Muslim Coalition and a Trump supporter, said that at the outset of the presidency, there was a “complete shutdown of engagement” with Muslim Americans. “It was quite a challenge” to work with Mr. Trump’s campaign staff, Ms. Ahmed said. “Even for the Republican Muslims who campaigned for him and helped him.” The reinstatement of the dinner, which has been hosted by three previous presidents, and the departures of some staff members with hard-line views on Islam have left her optimistic that the White House will grant more access to its Muslim supporters. “They have tarnished the image of Islam and Muslims, but I do think he is concerned about American Muslims,” Ms. Ahmed said. “The fact that he’s coming around, that he hosted the dinner, gives me a lot of hope.” "
"Archie Parnell, a Democratic House candidate who lost the support of his party after he admitted to physically abusing his ex-wife in the 1970s, handily won a primary in South Carolina on Tuesday. Mr. Parnell rose to national attention last year when he came within a hair’s breadth of winning a special election to replace Representative Mick Mulvaney in the state’s deep red Fifth District. Mr. Mulvaney left Congress in 2017 to serve as President Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget. On Tuesday, Mr. Parnell won 60 percent of the vote according to The Associated Press, easily beating three lesser known primary opponents with not as much name recognition. He will now mount another campaign against Representative Ralph Norman, the Republican who beat him in the special election last year. [Here are three key takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries.] Mr. Norman’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. In a statement posted to Facebook on Wednesday morning, Mr. Parnell said the result had left him “deeply honored and humbled.” “Tonight, the people sent a clear message to everyone,” he wrote. “You don’t have to be defined by your worst mistake. You don’t have to be cast aside. You are not alone. You can be better. And, together, we can be better.” "
"MEXICO CITY — The subtext was hard to miss. On Wednesday morning, soon after the announcement that the United States, Mexico and Canada had won the vote to be joint hosts of the 2026 World Cup, President Enrique Peña Nieto posted a video on Twitter celebrating the news. Standing in front of the presidential residence, Los Pinos, he pointed out that Mexico would become the first country to host three World Cups. He extolled the virtues of Mexico as a tourist destination, including its beaches, archaeological sites and “hospitable and warm people.” And he zeroed in on a concept that has been evasive of late in the bilateral relationship with the United States. “We’re deeply unified,” he said, of the three host countries. “Congratulations for being hosts together.” He emphasized the word “together” by clenching his fist. Mr. Peña Nieto made no mention of President Trump. But the American president could not have been far from his mind. These have been trying times for the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and the World Cup, a magnificently complicated undertaking, would seem to impose an additional test. "

"A federal judge’s ruling on Tuesday to greenlight the merger between AT&T and Time Warner is a big boost to the competitiveness of the American economy and an even bigger win for consumers and shareholders. The decision was also a total slapdown of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, which sees monopoly bogeymen around every corner. The Justice Department must now decide whether to appeal the judge’s ruling, a move that would be sheer folly and a waste of taxpayer money, given the firm rejection of every argument the government’s lawyers made. Hopefully, this decision will also clear the path for other planned cost-cutting mergers in the media and telecommunications industries. The government’s antitrust challenge to this $85 billion deal was one of the flimsiest assaults against a corporate merger in recent memory. These two companies don’t even directly compete with each other. Normally, antitrust cases are brought to block so-called “horizontal” mergers, in which companies in the same line of business — two airlines, for example — want to combine forces. Even in such instances, the antitrust laws are antiquated, given that globalized competition and the speed of technological change continually knock down industry leaders. The core argument brought by the Justice Department, in an antitrust action championed by President Trump, was that AT&T could use its new market power to raise prices exorbitantly on cable and satellite operators that want to run Time Warner TV programs — such as CNN broadcasts or HBO shows. The government’s lawyers argued that consumers’ cable bills would go up if the merger went through. The absurdity of this argument is that the Justice lawyers seemed to be stuck in the 1980s. In 2018, the number of American households getting their television or video entertainment from traditional cable providers is declining. The very notion of “watching TV” is becoming as obsolete as listening to music on a turntable. My teenage kids and their friends don’t even own TVs. They watch “Game of Thrones” on their computers or smartphones, and one of their favorite “channels” is YouTube. They can choose from thousands of programs at a very low cost. Today, any hotshot with a camera and a Facebook page can be a media company. Is that enough competition for the Justice Department? "
"Ivana Trump was back at the Plaza Hotel on Tuesday, the hotel where she once had a say over everything from the wallpaper to the chandeliers, back when she was married to Donald J. Trump. But that was long ago. Now, she had come to promote a diet that promises followers they can “eat pasta, cookies and lose weight.” It was Ms. Trump who gave Mr. Trump a definite article — she put the “the” in “the Donald” — long before he had a job that came with one, as the president. On Tuesday, as reporters crowded around her at the Plaza, she was asked how often she talks to her ex-husband. “I’m really not going to go into politics,” she said, “but we speak.” But later, when she was asked how she thought he had done at the summit meeting on North Korea, she said, “He did great.” But about that diet. It is the brainchild of Gianluca Mech. He is an Italian businessman perhaps best known for spending $200,000 to recreate, for one night last year, the Brooklyn discothèque where “Saturday Night Fever,” the 1977 homage to the bell-bottoms-and-disco-ball era, was filmed. He is extremely thin, although he said his father was obese. His “Italiano Diet” offers specially formulated low-calorie, low-carbohydrate packaged meals. There are $20 cookies dipped in dark chocolate, $24 crunchy bars with strawberries and raspberries and, for $14, fusilli pasta. Ms. Trump, who once appeared in commercials for Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, said she agreed to talk up the Italiano Diet because “obesity is like a calamity in America,” although she said that she herself did not need to shed pounds. "
"WASHINGTON — In the latest sign of the Trump administration’s outreach to religious conservatives ahead of a critical midterm election, Vice President Mike Pence told a large gathering of pastors Wednesday that the White House would continue to fight for evangelical priorities. He appealed for the community’s continued support, even as his appearance led to complaints that a religious event was being used for political gain. “This is a pivotal year in the life of our nation,” Mr. Pence told the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, where nearly 10,000 evangelical pastors gathered in Dallas. “Be assured of this, President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for what we know is right.” Mr. Pence recited a list of Trump administration actions that appealed to the conservative evangelical community, which constitutes one of the president’s biggest blocs of supporters. Among the accomplishments he cited were the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court; advancing anti-abortion priorities across the government; opening an American embassy in Jerusalem; passing tax reform; and freeing Christian hostages from North Korea. “This progress,” Mr. Pence said, “is the result of the support of men and women like so many of you, who supported our president not only in 2016 but every day since.” The Southern Baptist Convention’s annual gathering in June draws thousands of evangelical influencers from across the country, presenting a rich opportunity for the administration to reach one of its most supportive voter bases. More than 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence in 2016, and Southern Baptist churches have more than 15 million members. While the convention has at times had Republican leaders speak, its stated purpose is to focus on evangelism and missionary work. But Mr. Pence mentioned “the president” more than three dozen times in his 30 minute speech. "
"WASHINGTON — They have issued concerned news releases and sent solemn tweets. But when it came time to stand up to President Trump on tariffs this week, Senate Republicans took a pass, casting aside the party’s long-held commitment to free trade for fear of poking the bear. At least that is how Senator Bob Corker interpreted the outcome of the intraparty fight over how to combat Mr. Trump’s protectionist policies. “Gosh, we might poke the bear,” Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is retiring, said with fake outrage as he laced into his colleagues for disavowing their beliefs on trade because they are scared of the president and the prospect of losing power. The decision by Republican leaders this week to block a vote on Mr. Corker’s amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would have required the president to get congressional approval to impose tariffs on national security grounds was something of a watershed. Republican leaders maintained that the measure would have created procedural issues that could jeopardize the underlying defense policy bill. They privately called Mr. Corker’s reaction hyperbolic, and other Republicans said they would continue to make their differences with the president clear. But the amendment’s defeat, without a vote tallied, was a setback for a core Republican principle, and it played out in public on the Senate floor, underscoring just how far most congressional Republicans would go to avoid confronting Mr. Trump ahead of the November midterm elections. The increasingly lonely forces of opposition within the party are coming from those who are leaving politics or those in the chattering classes safely removed from a Republican electorate overwhelmingly aligned with the president. “There’s no question that leadership in general is wary of doing anything that might upset the president,” Mr. Corker said on Wednesday, describing his party’s following of Mr. Trump as “cultish.” "
"WASHINGTON — A former top staff member of the Senate Intelligence Committee pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to charges of lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with reporters, and his defense lawyer accused the Justice Department and President Trump of making inappropriate comments about the case that could poison the jury pool. The former staff member, James A. Wolfe, appeared before a magistrate judge at the federal courthouse blocks from the Senate office building where he used to work. Mr. Wolfe was indicted last week on three counts of lying to F.B.I. agents working on a leak investigation, but has not been charged with unlawfully disclosing classified information. At the hearing, prosecutors told Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson that they had no objections to letting him remain free for now without posting a bond, but asked for several conditions, including restricting his travel. Mr. Wolfe had surrendered his passport after he made an initial appearance this week at a courthouse in Maryland. Mr. Wolfe showed no emotion as he sat in the courtroom, occasionally rising to briefly address Judge Robinson. He left most of the speaking to one of his defense lawyers, Preston Burton, who entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Mr. Burton also sharply criticized government officials — including Mr. Trump — for making statements that he suggested impugned his client’s character by implying that Mr. Wolfe had illegally leaked national security secrets. Two of the three charges against Mr. Wolfe related to allegations that he told reporters nonpublic information that he had learned as a result of his role as a staff member of the Intelligence Committee. But none of the false statement charges accuse Mr. Wolfe of leaking classified information. "
"HOUSTON — It is unusual for the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia to see eye-to-eye, much less try to achieve common energy policy goals, even indirectly. But that is what seems to be happening, and it is taking the edge off the yearlong rise in oil and gasoline prices. Even if those countries have their own reasons for welcoming the surge in production, it is also reducing the influence of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which will meet in Vienna next week to discuss production cuts put in place in early 2017. The cheerleader, if not the ringmaster, in this effort is President Trump, who took to Twitter on Wednesday to criticize OPEC for high crude prices. “Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again,” he wrote in his second such statement since April. “Not good.” Whatever happens at the OPEC meeting, two of the biggest players in the global oil market — Saudi Arabia and Russia — appear to have already calculated that it is in their immediate interest to crank up production, effectively sidelining the Saudis’ fellow cartel members. Between them, the two countries have already each added more than 100,000 barrels a day to global oil supplies. Mr. Trump wants even more crude sloshing around the market to tamp down energy prices ahead of the congressional elections in November, and it looks like he may well get it. "

__________ Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made comments on Wednesday that are likely to go down well with supporters of President Trump’s increasingly belligerent trade policies. At the news conference after the Fed’s two-day meeting, a reporter asked Mr. Powell whether the escalating trade tensions were a risk to the United States economy and whether they might be having an impact on the investment decisions of companies. Mr. Powell said Fed officials had picked up on rising concerns about trade among business executives, and he said there were reports of companies holding off on investments. But Mr. Powell seemed to go out of his way to emphasize that there was no evidence that the trade frictions were weighing on corporate behavior. He said: Of course, Mr. Powell may have gotten carried away when he gave his response. But he said more or less the same thing minutes later. Mr. Powell is probably right that economic data shows no evidence that fears of a trade war are damping activity. But top Fed officials are often more circumspect when discussing threats to the economy, especially those that could soon become real. This Friday, the Trump administration is scheduled to announce a final list of tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, and impose them shortly after. China has said it will retaliate. "

"MOSCOW — Back when it sought the right to host the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament, Russia framed its bid as part of a concerted effort to transform its post-Soviet self into a modern, model global citizen. A female Olympic pole vault champion wooed the International Football Association by urging it to “help shape the future of Russia,” while a deputy prime minister said holding the championship would speed his country toward becoming “a completely different nation” whose people “will be brothers and sisters to the whole family of the world.” That was in December 2010. Then Russia proved that it harbored a rather different idea of brotherhood: annexing Crimea, backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, providing the missile battery that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and propping up a bloody dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in Syria. Various Kremlin critics abroad died or fell ill under mysterious circumstances, while scores of activists at home were either jailed or their organizations were shuttered. Russia made “gay propaganda” illegal and weaponized social media to meddle in Western elections. In short, when President Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, he abandoned the quest for admission to the global fraternity of dominant states. Instead, he contrived to seize a spot through his own devices. “We are not aspiring to be a globalized nation, that is gone,” said Vladimir Frolov, an independent foreign policy analyst, ‘‘Russia’s foreign policy strategy is to be a cat who walks by himself.” Russia still feels compelled, however, to try repeatedly to prove that it has great-power credibility. It cannot do it militarily — short of flexing its nuclear weapons — nor financially after four years of drifting in economic irons despite a recent buoyancy in oil prices. Major sporting events offer one plausible substitute, including the World Cup, which begins on Thursday. "

"LOS ANGELES — Antonio R. Villaraigosa was the high-riding mayor of this city for eight years. His election as its first Latino chief executive in modern times was an electrifying moment. Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat, has over the years expressed high ambitions for his future: a cabinet secretary in a Hillary Clinton White House. Governor of California. A next-generation leader for Latinos across the nation. But Mr. Villaraigosa saw those ambitions dashed last week in a dispiriting third-place finish in the primary for governor of California, a showing that not only eliminated him from contention for that office — but probably, as he acknowledged in a ruminative interview at his home in the Hollywood Hills on Wednesday, from elected life. He drew just 13 percent of the vote after a campaign calling for California to confront an economic divide that he warned threatened its future. It was a stunningly poor showing given the arc of his career: City Council, State Assembly, Assembly speaker, mayor, chairman of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. And it came even after charter school advocates financed a $23 million independent campaign on his behalf. “My message resonated in areas where people are struggling — it didn’t resonate where people are doing well,” Mr. Villaraigosa said, sitting at a dining room table in his home, near wraparound windows that offered views of the Hollywood sign, downtown Los Angeles, the Pacific Ocean and Griffith Park. “I understand Latinos voted two to one for me. They just didn’t come out in big numbers.” He faced, he said, considerable hurdles, some his own making, from the moment he decided to run to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat. “Look, I’ve been out of office for five years,” he said, after using his phone to adjust the volume of the jazzy music coming from hidden speakers scattered around the sprawling top floor of the house. “I had never run for statewide office before. I had started at a big disadvantage.” "

"MONTREAL — Canadians were still recovering from the verbal daggers President Trump lobbed at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at last weekend’s Group of 7 summit meeting in Quebec when the news came that the newly minted frenemies would join Mexico to jointly host the 2026 World Cup. As it is, Canadians are not exactly known for their international soccer prowess; the men’s soccer team is ranked 79th in the world. And they had been digesting the incongruous image of Mr. Trump courting a North Korean dictator only hours after he had called their famously mild-mannered leader “very dishonest and weak” and a top Trump trade adviser had said “there’s a special place in hell” for Mr. Trudeau. But on Wednesday, a jubilant Mr. Trump, fresh from his meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, appeared to signal, however obliquely, that soccer could unify Canada and its erstwhile best friend. “The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup,” he wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations — a great deal of hard work!” Mr. Trudeau was equally effusive. “It’s going to be a great tournament,” he wrote on Twitter. For Canadians, by nature a forgiving people, the glamour and prestige of being host to the men’s World Cup for the first time appeared to supersede a festering trade dispute, including an acrimonious battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement, a cornerstone of trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which Mr. Trump has threatened to scrap.

"Instead of hosannas greeting President Trump upon his return from Asia, a clash with Congress awaits him: Senators of both parties have just agreed to add language to the annual defense spending bill that would reverse his decision to save the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE. Mr. Trump, riding high off his meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, is sure to fight back. He will most likely claim that he knows what he’s doing, and that internal political dissent will make him look weak at a critical moment, points that his political and media allies will surely echo. But the Senate must hold its ground: Not only does ZTE pose a unique threat to American security, but Mr. Trump’s kid-glove treatment of the company raises questions about possible links between it and Trump family businesses. It would be easy to mistake ZTE for just another player in Mr. Trump’s trade wars, and his decision to let do business again with American suppliers, in exchange for a $1 billion fine, as a tactical concession to China, which requested the deal. So it’s important to keep in mind why the United States put ZTE on a sanctions list in the first place: According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other law enforcement officials, it violated export controls that are meant to keep American technology out of the hands of dangerous regimes, like North Korea and Iran. What’s worse, even after it was caught, ZTE resumed illegal shipments. It tried to conceal that by lying to federal investigators and its own investigators and lawyers. Moreover, the violations were, according to the Justice Department, part of an “elaborate scheme” that was approved by the company’s “the highest levels of management.” The $1 billion payment would be a bargain for ZTE and China: The company had a market capitalization of about $20 billion before the announcement in April of sanctions against it; it would have struggled and possibly even failed if the Department of Commerce had stood by its decision to deny it American components for its cellphones and other products for seven years. Thousands of jobs would have been lost in China. "
"To the Editor: Re “Tubman on $20 Bill? Treasury Won’t Say” (news article, June 6): The Trump Treasury’s refusal to commit to putting Harriet Tubman, a symbol of the continuing fight for civil rights, on the $20 bill is emblematic of the administration’s blatant disrespect for black women. Black women have helped lead almost every major social movement — from civil rights to women’s rights to workers’ rights to L.G.B.T.Q. rights and more — and have gone largely unrecognized for our impact. Replacing Andrew Jackson, a slave owner, with a hero who embodies the raw courage, strength and social ingenuity that happens when black women lead is the least the administration can do to amend its pattern of undermining us. Harriet Tubman, among countless other black female leaders, deserves to have her legacy honored.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and signaled that two additional increases were on the way this year, as officials expressed confidence that the United States economy was strong enough for borrowing costs to rise without choking off economic growth. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, speaking in unusually blunt terms at a news conference on Wednesday, said the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and was approaching a “normal” level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands-on role in encouraging economic activity. The Fed’s optimism about the state of the economy is likely to translate into higher borrowing costs for cars, home mortgages and credit cards over the next year as the central bank raises interest rates more quickly than was anticipated. Wednesday’s rate increase was the second this year and the seventh since the end of the Great Recession and brings the Fed’s benchmark rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. The last time the rate topped 2 percent was in late summer 2008, when the economy was contracting and the Fed was cutting rates toward zero, where they would remain for years after the financial crisis. “The decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape,” Mr. Powell said after the Fed’s two-day policy meeting. “Most people who want to find jobs are finding them.” [During a news conference, Mr. Powell said he wants to “start with a plain English summary of how the economy is doing.” He certainly did that.] "
"WASHINGTON — In the office of Attorney General Jeff Sessions hangs a portrait of his predecessor Edwin Meese III, the Reagan-era conservative. Near the desk of the deputy attorney general is a painting of former Attorney General John Ashcroft, who pressed to expand the Justice Department’s powers after Sept. 11. The department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, chose for his office a portrait of the disgraced Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, who was nearly impeached, forced to resign in 1924 and later tried twice on charges of defrauding the government. Mr. Daugherty’s visage serves as a reminder for Mr. Horowitz: Malfeasance is never far away. Equal parts auditor, investigator and cop, Mr. Horowitz has navigated his role as one of the most powerful arbiters of conflict in Washington — the investigators’ investigator — with a diplomat’s instinct for recognizing fault lines, a prosecutor’s focus on justice and a Washington insider’s knack for amassing allies on Capitol Hill. Now, he has been thrust into the clash of law enforcement and politics that has consumed much of the capital for the past two years. On Thursday, he will issue the highly anticipated findings of his examination of the F.B.I.’s handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. He is expected to castigate the decision making by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey; his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe; and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Another high-profile test looms beyond that. Mr. Horowitz, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has begun a review of aspects of the Russia investigation. His findings could land in 2020 amid the presidential race. In interviews with nearly two dozen friends, former colleagues and political leaders, a portrait emerged of Mr. Horowitz as a principled, savvy investigator. Mr. Horowitz is good-humored and even-tempered, said past co-workers, who ribbed him for his cameos as a prosecutor on “K Street,” HBO’s short-lived 2003 show about lobbyists. He delivered lines like, “You need to have at least a general understanding of the financial flow of funds,” with the élan of a career civil servant. "
"For many years, Republican voters in Virginia’s affluent and highly educated Washington suburbs tended to reward mainstream candidates who could be competitive in the general election. But on Tuesday, it was Fairfax County, the population hub of the region, that delivered victory for Corey Stewart, the flame-throwing Trump acolyte who has won national attention with his paeans to Confederate emblems. Mr. Stewart narrowly defeated Nick Freitas, a state lawmaker, thanks to a decisive win in Fairfax County. And a third candidate who has also made his name as a provocateur, E.W. Jackson, carried 14 percent in the county with the third-highest median income in America. So what is happening in Fairfax? As the county has, like other high-income suburbs around the country, become more Democratic-leaning, the Republican Party has thinned out. The moderate wing of the party has dissipated, leaving a smaller and firmly conservative activist bedrock. And such voters care little about appeals to pragmatism — they are drawn to candidates who echo the president they embrace. Across four states with contested primary elections, Democratic voters embraced the candidates favored — and in some cases handpicked — by party leaders in Washington and the states, spurning insurgents who tried to align themselves with the activist left.

"I
n the spring of 2006, Christopher Aaron started working 12-hour shifts in a windowless room at the Counterterrorism Airborne Analysis Center in Langley, Va. He sat before a wall of flat-screen monitors that beamed live, classified video feeds from drones hovering in distant war zones. On some days, Aaron discovered, little of interest appeared on the screens, either because a blanket of clouds obscured visibility or because what was visible — goats grazing on an Afghan hillside, for instance — was mundane, even serene. Other times, what unspooled before Aaron’s eyes was jarringly intimate: coffins being carried through the streets after drone strikes; a man squatting in a field to defecate after a meal (the excrement generated a heat signature that glowed on infrared); an imam speaking to a group of 15 young boys in the courtyard of his madrasa. If a Hellfire missile killed the target, it occurred to Aaron as he stared at the screen, everything the imam might have told his pupils about America’s war with their faith would be confirmed. The infrared sensors and high-resolution cameras affixed to drones made it possible to pick up such details from an office in Virginia. But as Aaron learned, identifying who was in the cross hairs of a potential drone strike wasn’t always straightforward. The feed on the monitors could be grainy and pixelated, making it easy to mistake a civilian trudging down a road with a walking stick for an insurgent carrying a weapon. The figures on-screen often looked less like people than like faceless gray blobs. How certain could Aaron be of who they were? “On good days, when a host of environmental, human and technological factors came together, we had a strong sense that who we were looking at was the person we were looking for,” Aaron said. “On bad days, we were literally guessing.” Initially, the good days outnumbered the bad ones for Aaron. He wasn’t bothered by the long shifts, the high-pressure decisions or the strangeness of being able to stalk — and potentially kill — targets from thousands of miles away. Although Aaron and his peers spent more time doing surveillance and reconnaissance than coordinating strikes, sometimes they would relay information to a commander about what they saw on-screen, and “60 seconds later, depending on what we would report, you would either see a missile fired or not,” he said. Other times, they would trail targets for months. The first few times he saw a Predator drone unleash its lethal payload — the camera zooming in, the laser locking on, a plume of smoke rising above the scorched terrain where the missile struck — he found it surreal, he told me. But he also found it awe-inspiring. Often, he experienced a surge of adrenaline, as analysts in the room exchanged high-fives. Aaron’s path to the drone program was unusual. He grew up in Lexington, Mass., in a home where red meat and violent video games were banned. His parents were former hippies who marched against the Vietnam War in the 1960s. But Aaron revered his grandfather, a quiet, unflappable man who served in World War II. Aaron also had a taste for exploration and tests of fortitude: hiking and wandering through the woods in Maine, where his family vacationed every summer, and wrestling, a sport whose demand for martial discipline captivated him. Aaron attended the College of William & Mary in Virginia, where he majored in history, with a minor in business. A gifted athlete with an air of independence and adventurousness, he cut a charismatic figure on campus. One summer, he traveled to Alaska alone to work as a deckhand on a fishing boat. During Aaron’s junior year, in 2001, he woke up one morning to a phone call from his father, who told him that the twin towers and the Pentagon had been attacked. Aaron thought instantly of his grandfather, who served for three years as a military police officer on the European front after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He wanted to do something similarly heroic. A year later, after spotting a pamphlet at the William & Mary career-services office for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a national-security agency that specializes in geographical and imagery analysis, he applied for a job there. Aaron began working as an imagery analyst at the N.G.A. in 2005, studying satellite pictures of countries that had no link to the war on terror. Not long after he arrived, an email circulated about a Department of Defense task force that was being created to determine how drones could help defeat Al Qaeda. Aaron answered the call for volunteers and was soon working at the Counterterrorism Airborne Analysis Center. He found it exhilarating to participate directly in a war he saw as his generation’s defining challenge. His pride deepened as it became clear that the task force was having a significant impact and that the use of drones was increasing. "

Stephen Colbert was not particularly impressed by the results of President Trump’s negotiations with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. At the end of the meeting, the two heads of state signed a noncommittal joint statement. Colbert scoffed at how Trump heaped praise on Kim throughout their time in Singapore. Trump had told a reporter that he was impressed by how Kim had stepped into his father’s role as leader of North Korea at just 26. Trevor Noah issued a gentle apology and a note of congratulations. The other hosts also tried to make sense out of the budding camaraderie between Trump and Kim. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “As skimpy as the summit meeting was extravagant.” That’s how one of our White House correspondents described the joint statement that President Trump and Kim Jong-un signed after their talks in Singapore on Tuesday. It calls for the “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula, but provided neither a timeline nor details about how the North would give up its weapons. Read the joint statement here. Mr. Trump made a concession, saying he would suspend joint military exercises on the Korean Peninsula, to the surprise of South Korea and the Pentagon. And “the simple act of talking” makes conflict far less likely, one of our Interpreter columnists notes in his 10 takeaways. • The president played a faux movie trailer for Mr. Kim, showing North Korea’s economic potential — beaches and condos included. We  analyzed the video, and came up with our own (dare we say better?) version. "

"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Every media and telecom giant that’s thinking of buying a rival just got some good news. AT&T won its legal fight to be allowed to buy Time Warner — a huge blow to the Justice Department, which sought to block the deal on the grounds that consumers would suffer. The chances of approval for other media takeovers look much better now. First up will be Comcast. Expect the cable giant to challenge Walt Disney’s $52.4 billion bid for most of 21st Century Fox in the next day or two. (Michael de la Merced has outlined Fox’s antitrust concerns about a potential Comcast bid, which yesterday’s ruling is likely to have allayed.) But who else could be on the hunt for deals? John Malone, who controls both the cable company Charter and content providers like Starz; Verizon; and tech giants like Apple, Google and Amazon. Andrew says the verdict is likely to rattle President Trump, a vocal opponent of the Time Warner deal. “Mr. Trump doesn’t like to lose, and that could make his administration more reluctant to police future deals that actually deserve to be blocked,” he writes in his latest column. In a sign of financial sense, the carmaker announced that it would lay off 9 percent of its staff of 37,500. The cuts will mainly hit salaried employees and won’t affect production workers at its plant in Fremont, Calif. (That’s important, given its struggle to build enough Model 3 sedans.) "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump returned to the United States early on Wednesday praising his diplomatic prowess after his meeting with the North Korean leader and declaring, “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat” from Pyongyang. In a series of Twitter posts at dawn, the president projected confidence as Air Force One landed outside Washington. After his summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, in Singapore, Mr. Trump appeared to be taking a victory lap even as critics cautioned that the nuclear threat from North Korea is far from over. But questions remained about whether the United States gave up more than it gained what had been a much-anticipated meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. North Korea state media reported on Wednesday that Mr. Kim won major concessions from the American president, including an agreement by Mr. Trump to a phased, “step-by-step” denuclearization process for the North, rather than the immediate dismantling of its nuclear capability.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The last few decades have been full of huge corporate mergers. In one sector after another — airlines, energy, finance, media, pharmaceuticals and much more — the biggest companies have gotten bigger by buying other companies. And thanks to a court ruling Tuesday, a new round of mergers may be about to begin. Judge Richard Leon ruled that AT&T could buy Time Warner, rejecting the Justice Department’s argument that the deal would reduce competition and hurt consumers. The deal is known as a vertical merger, because it involves two companies in different areas of an industry. (A horizontal merger involves competitors.) Time Warner produces content, like shows for HBO and basketball broadcasts on TNT. AT&T distributes content, through its mobile-phone business and DirectTV. Now that Leon has approved the merger, many analysts think other vertical mergers in technology and media may follow. I was disappointed by Tuesday’s ruling, because I’m deeply concerned about the degree of corporate concentration today. I think it gives big business too much power relative to consumers, workers and the government — and it is a major reason why wage growth has been so weak in recent years, while corporate profits have soared. For a good overview of the larger issues, see this 2016 article from The Economist, as well as Gilad Edelman writing in the Washington Monthly on both the problem and the people trying to solve it. As for the AT&T merger: In The Los Angeles Times, Michael Hiltzik suggests that Comcast’s 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal is a guide to what may happen next. “The historical record bristles with evidence of the bad habits of media distribution companies given the sort of control that will soon be exercised by AT&T and Time Warner,” he writes. The Open Markets Institute, which advocates for a more competitive economy, calls the decision “a big loss for the public.” (The Atlantic has just published a profile of the institute’s Lina Khan.) And Motherboard’s Karl Bode argues that the AT&T merger is especially worrisome because of the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality. “We’re entering a strange new world of less oversight and greater consolidation that’s likely to leave consumers with fewer choices, less competition, and ample opportunity for creatively-bad behavior,” Bode writes. The Times editorial board explains the biggest reason to like Leon’s decision: The Trump administration appeared to oppose the merger in part because of the president’s dislike of CNN, which Time Warner owns. It would set a chilling precedent for Washington to punish media companies over their coverage. The case for Trump. The economist Tyler Cowen has produced some of the most thought-provoking semi-defenses of the Trump presidency, as I’ve written before. On his Marginal Revolution blog, Cowen has a short new piece about the North Korea summit. My colleagues Bret Stephens and Ross Douthat also weigh in on the summit. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration signaled on Wednesday that it will try to block any effort by Congress to interfere with its plan to throw a lifeline to ZTE, the Chinese technology company that the United States government has penalized for violating sanctions. The Department of Commerce brokered a settlement with ZTE this month after Chinese President Xi Jinping asked President Trump to issue a softer penalty that would not put the company out of business. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been working on legislation that would undermine that agreement and impose a stiffer punishment on ZTE. The White House said on Wednesday that the current agreement “will ensure ZTE pays for its violations and gives our government complete oversight of their future activity without undue harm to American suppliers and their workers.” Lawmakers have been working to attach legislation on ZTE to an upcoming National Defense Authorization Act measure that is expected to pass in the Senate. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, suggested that such a move would undermine the authority of the executive branch. “The administration will work with Congress to ensure the final N.D.A.A. conference report respects the separation of powers,” Mr. Gidley said, referencing the act. The company’s shares plunged on Wednesday, losing more than 40 percent of their value in their first day of trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange since the United States government slapped ZTE with crippling penalties two months ago. Nearly $3 billion was shaved from the company’s market capitalization. "
"SINGAPORE — For America’s allies in Asia, the outcome of President Trump’s summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea has been decidedly mixed. On the good side, they no longer have to be on alert for the imminent outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula. But the widely anticipated Trump-Kim meeting on Tuesday left them with new anxieties. Mr. Trump’s concessions to North Korea exacerbated their fears about the United States’ long-term commitment to safeguarding the region. Mr. Trump’s surprise declaration during a news conference after the meeting that he would suspend military drills between the United States and South Korea — and that he hoped eventually to pull some 28,000 American troops off the peninsula — blindsided American allies, including South Korea itself. Even the Pentagon was caught off guard. More broadly, Mr. Trump’s declaration raised questions about whether his outreach to the North actually signaled an American retreat from the region. Since World War II, the United States has been a leader in East Asia, providing security assurances to allies in Japan and South Korea. But even before engaging in talks with North Korea, Mr. Trump had questioned the merits of stationing troops in the region, and made it clear he thought the United States was paying too much to support them. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he expected “major disarmament” in North Korea within two and a half years, representing significant headway in the standoff over the country’s nuclear arsenal before the end of President Trump’s first term in office. The remarks, made during a Wednesday news conference in Seoul, South Korea, came a day after Mr. Trump met with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in the first face-to-face encounter between a sitting American president and a leader of the reclusive nation. Mr. Pompeo said the administration hoped to move quickly, but acknowledged that the denuclearization process would not be immediate. “The president has said, and it’s common knowledge, the work itself takes some amount of time,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We’re prepared to execute this once we’re in position that we can actually get to a place where we can do it.” North Korea has already spun the results of the summit in its favor, claiming it had won major concessions from the United States during its discussions with Mr. Trump. The authoritarian country’s state-controlled news media said that Mr. Trump had promised to eventually lift sanctions against the North and to end joint military drills with South Korea. It also said the United States had agreed to a phased, “step-by-step” denuclearization process for the North, rather than the immediate dismantling of its nuclear capability. "
"TEHRAN — A leading human rights lawyer in Iran, Nasrin Sotoudeh, was arrested on Wednesday by security forces, taken from her home in Tehran to the notorious Evin Prison, her husband said. Mrs. Sotoudeh’s persistent activism has landed her in prison numerous times, and has made her an internationally known symbol of independence in the face of Iran’s restrictive Islamist rule. Most recently, she has been involved in defending women who had been arrested for having taken off their compulsory Islamic head scarves during public protests. The arrest comes as Iran faces increasing economic pressures stemming from President Trump’s decision in May to withdraw the United States from the 2015 agreement that limited Iran’s nuclear program. He reimposed broad sanctions against Iran, putting pressure on European businesses not to do business there. Iranian hard-liners have been empowered since the judiciary, which is dominated by hard-liners, decided last week that it would allow only a pool of 20 preselected lawyers to represent those implicated in political cases. Mrs. Sotoudeh, 55, was not one of them. On Wednesday morning, Mrs. Sotoudeh’s husband, Reza Khandan, an information technology specialist, wrote on his Facebook page that she had been arrested and taken to Evin Prison. His post, written in Persian, quoted something his wife had said: “Once in the interrogation room I told the interrogators that: ‘Of all the things that the government should do for its country, you only know one, and that’s to capture people.’” He confirmed the news in a telephone interview, adding that he did not know why she had been taken. Mrs. Sotoudeh received the European Union’s most prestigious human rights award, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 2012. Her arrest is likely to be seen as a provocation in Europe, where some countries have been trying to salvage the nuclear agreement and maintain business ties with Iran. "
"A judge who sentenced a Texas woman to five years in prison for voting illegally because she was a felon on probation turned down on Monday the woman’s bid for a new trial. “Prison is a lot closer for her today,” Alison Grinter, a lawyer for the woman, Crystal Mason, 43, said on Tuesday, noting that her client would appeal the decision to a higher court. Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County district attorney, declined to comment. Ms. Mason was convicted of illegal voting in a one-day trial held March 28 before Judge Ruben Gonzalez, a state district court judge who sentenced her that day to five years in prison. She has been free on bond pending appeal. [Where do states stand on voting rights for felons? Here’s a breakdown.] Ms. Mason, who was sentenced to 60 months in jail for tax fraud and was released in early 2016, has said that she didn’t know that she wasn’t allowed to vote in that year’s presidential election. She cast a provisional ballot at her local church after being told that her name could not be found on the rolls. The ballot was never counted. “Crystal’s name was purged from the rolls when she went to prison, but Crystal did not know that,” Ms. Grinter said in an interview on Tuesday. Whether felons can vote varies state by state, and has become a contentious issue. More than six million Americans have been stripped of their voting rights because of felony disenfranchisement laws, according to the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization that works on criminal justice reform. Two months ago, a petition was started online to have all charges against Ms. Mason, who is black, thrown out. In the petition her photo is placed next to a photo of Terri Lynn Rote, a white woman who was convicted of voter fraud in Iowa for trying to vote for President Trump twice. Ms. Rote was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $750 fine. The petition has over 38,000 signatures. As she prepared to appeal the rejection of her motion for a new trial, Ms. Mason said she had high hopes. “I showed my kids that no matter what you can get out and get your life in order,” said Ms. Mason. “But sometimes, regardless of whatever your past is, you are still going to be beat up for it.” "
"Being white in America has long been treated, at least by white people, as too familiar to be of much interest. It’s been the default identity, the cultural wallpaper — something described, when described at all, using bland metaphors like milk and vanilla and codes like “cornfed” and “all-American.” Grass is green, the sky is blue and, until very recently, a product described as “nude” or “flesh-colored” probably looked like white people’s skin. How often do white people talk about being white? Not often! So long as we aren’t hanging out with white nationalists, marrying into a family of color or chuckling over jokes about our dancing, we have endless opportunities to avoid thinking much about our own race. We generally prefer to frame identity in ethnic terms instead: Identifying as Italian or Irish or Jewish seems to come with zest, pathos and a chance to take pride in some shared history. Plain undifferentiated whiteness, on the other hand, is a “toggle between nothingness and awfulness,” writes Nell Irvin Painter, an emeritus professor of history at Princeton and author of the 2010 book “The History of White People.” The Trump era, however, has compelled an unprecedented acknowledgment of whiteness as a real and alarming force. In the months leading up to the 2016 election, as Donald Trump rallied his almost entirely white base with calls for banning Muslims and deporting “bad hombres,” Politico asked: “What’s Going On With America’s White People?” The NPR podcast “Code Switch” debuted with an episode called “Can We Talk About Whiteness?” Since handing Trump 58 percent of the white vote, we have been the subject of newspaper and magazine analyses about our race-based resentment, fear of declining status and supposed economic anxiety. The satire “Dear White People” was picked up by Netflix, and the film “Get Out,” which turned self-proclaimed Obama-supporting white people into figures of horror, became the think-piece blockbuster of 2017. Suddenly it is less tenable than ever for white people to write our whiteness out of the story of race in America or define ourselves only in terms of what we are not. Much of the sharpest examination comes, as it always has, from people of color, who have spent centuries acutely aware of how the force of whiteness operates. But these days, white people are also observing one another’s whiteness with unfamiliar intensity. When a white manager at a Philadelphia Starbucks called the police to report two black customers who didn’t order right away after one had asked to use the bathroom, a white customer, Melissa DePino, tweeted video of the ensuing arrests, adding: “All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing.” A few weeks later, a white woman named Michelle Snider confronted and filmed another white woman who called the police on a couple of black men for using a charcoal grill at an Oakland park. The caller’s image became a meme, #BBQBecky, showing up on “Saturday Night Live” and being dropped into stills from “Black Panther,” Barack Obama’s inauguration and a black Last Supper. In each of these cases, as well as a string of others, white people didn’t get the usual benefit of assumed normalcy. They were portrayed, instead, as a distinct subculture with bizarre and threatening habits. “White people” were suddenly identified as the subgroup of Americans most likely to call the police on black people over a barbecue or to complain about whether every single football player stands for the anthem — stereotypes that rang true even to other white people. "
"SINGAPORE — President Trump’s eager embrace of Kim Jong-un of North Korea this week, on the heels of an acrid falling-out with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, raised an obvious, if confounding, question: Why would an American president offend allies and cozy up to adversaries? If there was an answer in Mr. Trump’s tumultuous week on the global stage, it may be that he disregards the traditional preoccupations of American foreign policy — power and values — in favor of a more narrow worldview shaped by his experience as a businessman. “The theme that comes up, over and over, is money,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, a diplomat who advised President Barack Obama on China. Mr. Trump’s bitter clashes with Canada and Europe over trade, as well as his solicitous courtship of North Korea’s brutal dictator, all reflect this mercantile perspective. In his transactional approach to foreign policy, considerations of financial profit or cost — often measured in ways that economists deem simplistic — can outweigh virtually any other consideration. “What that means is that Trump, like a lot of businessmen, doesn’t pay much attention to Canada, or Europe, or Japan,” Mr. Bader said. “Businessmen pay attention to the growth markets: Vietnam, Brazil, India, China.” Or, as was on vivid display in Singapore this week, North Korea. That does not mean Mr. Trump is necessarily interested in North Korea as a trade partner or an investment opportunity for the United States. But his view of the challenges posed by the Korean Peninsula are colored — and perhaps limited — by his background in business. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump wasn’t on the ballot or even stateside for Tuesday’s primary elections in Virginia and South Carolina. But he loomed over both states, just as he has in nearly every nominating contest this year, underscoring how the Republican Party has become the party of Trump and that its politicians cross him at their peril. As Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina found out the hard way, in his surprise primary defeat, having a conservative voting record is less important than demonstrating total loyalty to Mr. Trump, who now enjoys higher approval ratings in his own party than any modern president except George W. Bush following the attacks of Sept. 11. And in Virginia, a far-right candidate, Corey Stewart, won the Republican Senate nomination after waging an incendiary campaign and portraying himself as a disciple of Mr. Trump. The president’s transformation of the G.O.P. — its policies, its tone, even the fate of its candidates — has never been so evident. A party that once championed free trade has now largely turned to protectionism under Mr. Trump. Sermons about inclusivity have been replaced with demagogic attacks on immigrants and black athletes. A trust-but-verify approach to foreign policy has given way to a seat-of-the-pants style in which rogue regimes like North Korea are elevated and democratic allies like Canada are belittled. Mr. Trump’s harsh attacks, including describing the news media as “the country’s biggest enemy” Tuesday, draw muted responses or silence from most Republicans these days. The party’s lawmakers have seen what he can do to their campaigns, having witnessed how Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee saw their standing with conservative voters plummet after they tangled with him. Neither is seeking re-election. While Mr. Trump has been reshaping Republican identity for nearly two years — starting with his 2016 nomination victory and the hard-line tone and platform he laid out at that summer’s Republican convention — he has never had this much opportunity to wield power over the party as he does now, including over immigration legislation and tariffs in Congress. “If you criticize him, you’re siding with the media that hates him and you’re undermining what he’s trying to accomplish,” said former Senator Rick Santorum, explaining why Mr. Trump has consolidated support. “Trump has done a good job in being a conservative president and as much as Democrats looked past what Bill Clinton said and did, Republicans are looking past what this president says and does.” "
"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal fixer, will soon be parting from the lawyers who are representing him in a potentially damaging and wide-ranging federal investigation into his business dealings, according to two people familiar with the case. Prosecutors conducting the inquiry have not yet approached Mr. Cohen to seek his cooperation, according to two people briefed on the case. But as the investigation continues, and with Mr. Cohen’s legal team in flux, the pressure on him to cooperate with the government may well intensify. Mr. Cohen’s current lawyers — a three-man team from the firm of McDermott Will & Emery — are expected to stay with him for at least the rest of the week as they struggle to complete a laborious review of a trove of documents and data files seized from their client in a series of extraordinary early-morning raids two months ago. But after that review is finished, Mr. Cohen will seek new legal counsel, the people familiar with his case said. The dispute between Mr. Cohen and his lawyers involves the payment of his legal bills, part of which are being financed by the Trump family. Mr. Cohen has also had more longstanding concerns about the lawyers: As his case moves forward, possibly toward criminal charges, he has been thinking for some time about hiring a new legal team with stronger relationships with the federal prosecutors’ office in New York that is leading the investigation, according to the people briefed on the matter. Mr. Cohen has been in the cross hairs of investigators for months, but the explosive case burst into public view on April 9 when federal agents armed with search warrants descended on his office, apartment and hotel room, hauling away eight boxes of paperwork, about 30 cellphones, iPads and computers — even the contents of one of his shredders. The materials were seized on the orders of prosecutors in Manhattan who have been trying to determine whether Mr. Cohen broke the law in any of his business projects, including hush-money payments he made to two women who claim they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The Cohen inquiry is separate from the one being run in Washington by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is looking into potential ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia. But ever since the raids involving Mr. Cohen took place, Mr. Trump’s lawyers have confronted the specter that the New York-based investigation could persuade Mr. Cohen, who has a wife and two children and faces the prospect of devastating legal fees, to cut a deal and share his intimate knowledge of Mr. Trump with Mr. Mueller’s team. Mr. Cohen, after all, worked for Mr. Trump for years as a lawyer and self-described “fix-it guy,” guarding his boss’s secrets and helping him to navigate some of the most sensitive episodes in his personal and professional life. "
"Corey Stewart, the provocative conservative who won Tuesday’s Republican primary to challenge Democratic Senator Tim Kaine in Virginia in November, has spent years courting voters on the rightward fringes of his party, often by playing to anti-immigration sentiment. He has also been accused of supporting white nationalists, an allegation that he has denied yet may cost him support this fall even among other Republicans. One of his primary opponents, Nick Freitas, urged voters in an email last week to “reject Corey Stewart’s dog-whistling of white supremacists, anti-Semites and racists.” This argument is likely to play a major role in the general election, as signaled by the first statement from Mr. Kaine’s campaign after Mr. Stewart secured the nomination on Tuesday night. “A cruder imitation of Donald Trump who stokes white supremacy and brags about being ‘ruthless and vicious,’ Corey Stewart would be an embarrassment for Virginia in the U.S. Senate,” the statement said. Here are the facts of Mr. Stewart’s history with courting the far right. In January 2017, as Mr. Stewart ran for governor, he met with and praised Paul Nehlen, an outspoken anti-Semite who is now making his second run for Congress in Wisconsin. He called Mr. Nehlen “one of my personal heroes” and said he was “so honored” to have Mr. Nehlen’s endorsement. And in a June 2017 campaign finance filing reported by CNN, he disclosed a $759 payment to Mr. Nehlen, described as a “fund-raising commission.” [Get three key takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries.] Mr. Stewart was also endorsed last year by the white nationalist Jason Kessler, who later organized the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. In February 2017, Mr. Stewart appeared with Mr. Kessler at an event sponsored by Mr. Kessler’s group Unity and Security for America, whose mission statement called for “defending Western civilization, including its history, culture and peoples, while utterly dismantling cultural Marxism.” Mr. Stewart has since distanced himself from both men. He told The Washington Post this month that he had praised Mr. Nehlen “before he went nuts and started spewing a bunch of stupid stuff,” and tweeted on Friday, “Paul Nehlen has lost his marbles and needs serious help.” "
"Between 60 and 90 percent of the world’s fresh water is frozen in the ice sheets of Antarctica, a continent roughly the size of the United States and Mexico combined. If all that ice melted, it would be enough to raise the world’s sea levels by roughly 200 feet. While that won’t happen overnight, Antarctica is indeed melting, and a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature shows that the melting is speeding up. The rate at which Antarctica is losing ice has tripled since 2007, according to the latest available data. The continent is now melting so fast, scientists say, that it will contribute six inches (15 centimeters) to sea-level rise by 2100. That is at the upper end of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated Antarctica alone could contribute to sea level rise this century. “Around Brooklyn you get flooding once a year or so, but if you raise sea level by 15 centimeters then that’s going to happen 20 times a year,” said Andrew Shepherd, a professor of earth observation at the University of Leeds and the lead author of the study. Even under ordinary conditions, Antarctica’s landscape is perpetually changing as icebergs calve, snow falls and ice melts on the surface, forming glacial sinkholes known as moulins. But what concerns scientists is the balance of how much snow and ice accumulates in a given year versus the amount that is lost. "
"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, seeking to unite his fractious conference around a compromise immigration bill, assured Republican lawmakers during a closed-door session on Wednesday that President Trump is backing the effort, though passage of the measure next week remains very much in doubt. Wednesday’s gathering came less than 12 hours after Mr. Ryan’s office announced that the House would consider immigration next week — but not bipartisan bills prompted by a desire to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Instead, lawmakers will consider a hard-line measure that emphasizes border security and the somewhat more moderate compromise measure, yet to be finalized, that still meets Mr. Trump’s standards. Mr. Ryan’s voting plan and the unfinished compromise measure were products of weeks of tense negotiations between Republican conservatives, including hard-liners in the House Freedom Caucus, and a band of rebellious Republican moderates. But in the end, the moderates stumbled before the finish line. They had been gathering signatures for a so-called discharge petition that would have forced Mr. Ryan to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor, but the effort collapsed two signatures short of the number needed. “It’s not my ideal place to be,” said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, one of 23 Republicans who signed the petition. “My ideal option would be a bipartisan bill in the House. But it’s the cards that we were dealt, and I think we’re trying to make good use of these cards.” The compromise bill will be built around four principles — Mr. Trump has called them the “four pillars” — that the president has insisted any immigration bill contain: a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers; beefed-up border security, including $25 billion for the wall the president wants to build on the southwest border; an end to the current diversity visa lottery system, which is aimed at bringing in immigrants from underrepresented nations; and limits on family-based migration, known as chain migration. Mr. Ryan told reporters that the “last thing I want to do is bring a bill out of here that I know the president won’t support.” "
"TEHRAN — After the handshakes, the signature ceremony and the diplomatic pomp of the historic meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea, many Iranians could come to only one conclusion: We should talk, too. Yes, Mr. Trump in May unilaterally pulled the United States out of the nuclear agreement between Iran and a group of world powers. Yes, he has imposed new sanctions against Iran that are scaring away European investors. Yes, Mr. Trump has a long track record of changing his mind. Despite that, some here say that perhaps Iran’s leaders should make a move similar to Mr. Kim’s and propose a meeting. If Mr. Trump can sit down with the leader of such an isolated country, with its gulags, summary executions and stockpile of nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles, why not talk to Iran? Mr. Trump has already said he is willing to authorize direct talks with Iran’s leaders to renegotiate the Iran deal. “We are a country with municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections, our 80-million-strong society is open and dynamic, we share borders” with many countries, said Masoud Daneshmand, a member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce. “Iran is a much more advanced and open society, compared with North Korea. So why wouldn’t Iran and America be able to sit down and have direct talks?” One reason is that Iran’s leaders are ideologically opposed to talking to the United States. Like North Korea, Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States. Iranian presidents visiting the United Nations for meetings have been known to duck into a restroom to avoid being seen with an American president. "
"Any ideology operating under the seismic pressures of the actual world will reveal a seam of inconsistency, a line of vulnerability running through it like a stress fracture. Free-market conservatives, for instance, have tried to square their support for big business with their professed fondness for little communities, sometimes by suggesting that the interests of both are one and the same. Eliza Griswold will tell you what happens when they’re not. Scratch that: Eliza Griswold will show you what happens when they’re not. Her sensitive and judicious new book, “Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America,” is neither an outraged sermon delivered from a populist soapbox nor a pinched, professorial lecture. Griswold, a journalist and a poet, paid close attention to a community in southwestern Pennsylvania over the course of seven years to convey its confounding experience with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process that injects water and chemicals deep into the ground in order to shake loose deposits of natural gas. Considering the animus and hardship described in this book, the title sounds almost cruelly ironic, but it comes from the land itself. Amity and Prosperity are the names of two towns in Pennsylvania’s Washington County, where “the history of energy extraction is etched into Appalachian hollows.” The people there are no strangers to industry, including its boons and disasters. Coal, steel and now natural gas: To suggest that the county’s residents have just been bamboozled by greedy industry sounds to them like the bleating of condescending elites and, for a number of locals, simply untrue. Some families have suffered while others have thrived. What Griswold depicts is a community, like the earth, cracked open. Griswold arrived on the scene in 2011, a little more than halfway through the decade of the gas rush, when technological advances made fracking cheaper — economically speaking, that is. The ecological costs have proved to be quite dear. Natural gas may burn more cleanly than oil or coal, but flushing it out requires forcing enormous amounts of water and chemicals into the earth with pressure approaching a shotgun blast. (Oklahoma and Pennsylvania have had fracking-related earthquakes as a result.) Then there’s the grim matter of the waste left over, what one candid extraction employee calls “demon water.” Griswold describes sludge in a waste pond going septic, releasing an unbearable stench “like an infected wound.” “It was the kind of fugitive scent that made Stacey feel paranoid and alone,” Griswold writes of Stacey Haney, a nurse who leased her mineral rights to Range Resources in 2008. Haney thought the money would help her and her two children, whom she was raising on her own after a divorce. Stacey tries to counter the odor with spritzings of Febreze and a steady supply of potpourri. Parts of “Amity and Prosperity” read as intimately as a novel, though its insidious, slow-motion ordeal is all too real. "

"Dear Robert De Niro, Samantha Bee and other Trump haters: I get that you’re angry. I’m angry, too. But anger isn’t a strategy. Sometimes it’s a trap. When you find yourself spewing four-letter words, you’ve fallen into it. You’ve chosen cheap theatrics over the long game, catharsis over cunning. You think you’re raising your fist when you’re really raising a white flag. You’re right that Donald Trump is a dangerous and deeply offensive man, and that restraining and containing him are urgent business. You’re wrong about how to go about doing that, or at least you’re letting your emotions get the better of you. When you answer name-calling with name-calling and tantrums with tantrums, you’re not resisting him. You’re mirroring him. You’re not diminishing him. You’re demeaning yourselves. Many voters don’t hear your arguments or the facts, which are on your side. They just wince at the din. You permit them to see you as you see Trump: deranged. Why would they choose a different path if it goes to another ugly destination? Of course this is broader than De Niro, bigger than Bee and about more than profanity. It’s about maturity, pragmatism and plain old smarts — and the necessity of all three when the stakes are this high. Many Democrats get that. Maybe even most do. In the primaries last week and on Tuesday, Democratic voters by and large chose House candidates whose appeals were tempered and whose profiles make them formidable general-election contenders. They’re the best bets for wooing less fiercely partisan voters and snatching seats currently in Republican hands. "
"MANASSAS, Va. — He once stood proudly before a Confederate flag, declaring it was not a symbol of hatred, but “about our heritage.” After the march of torch-carrying white supremacists in Charlottesville last year, which led to the death of a counterprotester, he criticized “weak Republicans” who “couldn’t apologize fast enough.” As officials around Virginia have grappled with whether to remove Confederate statues, he has compared those politicians to leaders of the Islamic State. Now Corey Stewart, a county official who for years has played to the hard-right fringe, captured the Republican nomination for Senate in Virginia. [Read more about Corey Stewart, Republicans and the fringe right.] He did so in a low-turnout primary on Tuesday when many centrist Republicans apparently stayed home, unhappy with a three-way race among candidates all professing strong loyalty to President Trump and given to fiery culture war pronouncements. Mr. Stewart, the chairman of a county board of supervisors who briefly led Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign in Virginia, received a congratulatory overnight tweet from the president, who called Mr. Stewart’s Democratic opponent, Senator Tim Kaine, “a total stiff.” "

"News item #1: The Trump administration is taking thousands of children away from their parents, and putting them in cages. News item #2: House Republicans have released a budget plan that would follow up last year’s big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy with huge funding cuts for Medicare and Medicaid. If you think these items are unrelated, you’ve missed the whole story of modern American politics. Conservatism – the actually existing conservative movement, as opposed to the philosophical stance whose constituency is maybe five pundits on major op-ed pages — is all about a coalition between racists and plutocrats. It’s about people who want to do (2) empowering people who want to do (1), and vice versa. Until Trump, the ugliness of this deal was cloaked in euphemisms. As Lee Atwater famously put it, But the reality was always there. The conservative economic agenda has never been popular, and it is objectively against the interests of working class voters, whatever their race. In fact, whites without a college degree are the biggest beneficiaries of the social safety net. Nonetheless, these voters supported the GOP because it spoke to their racial animosity. Now, to be fair, for a long time the GOP establishment managed to pull off a kind of bait-and-switch with this strategy, using race to motivate voters who would otherwise oppose its agenda, then putting the racism back in the closet once in office. George W. Bush did a lot of terrible things, but give him this much credit: he tried to dampen the xenophobia that was trying to break out after 9/11, rather than fanning the flames. "

"Wildly ambitious, thoroughly entertaining and embellished with some snaky moves, Eugene Jarecki’s documentary “The King” is a lot like its nominal subject, Elvis Presley. In part, it tells the familiar story of the poor little boy who became a king. But Mr. Jarecki has a second, larger and more complicated story he wants to address, too: that of the United States. Tying one man’s body to the body politic, he seeks to turn Presley’s life — from ravishing, thrilling youth to ravaging, putrefying fame — into the story of the country, an arc that takes the documentary from Graceland to Trumpland. Why Elvis? For Mr. Jarecki, the answer seems to be, why not? Mostly, though, there is the 1963 Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which came into Mr. Jarecki’s sights a few years back and serves as both the documentary’s roving stage and silent co-star. It’s a silver beast: huge, cumbersome-looking and temperamental. (It breaks down.)

"WASHINGTON — Behind the White House’s plan to punish China with tariffs and other restrictions is a growing concern that Beijing is using industrial policy to dominate industries of the future, at the expense of the United States and other nations. On Thursday, the Trump administration laid out its case in a 35-page report entitled “How China’s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World.” It exhaustively details the steps Chinese officials take to protect and promote their domestic industries and disadvantage foreign competitors, including the use of government subsidies, cyberespionage and forced intellectual property transfers to Chinese companies from American and other foreign firms. The United States is trying to derail China’s dominance by punishing Beijing. But it has yet to detail how it plans to build America’s dominance in industries that will power economic and job growth in the future, or cultivate what the administration officials call the “crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property.” Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump’s tariffs are designed to benefit American high-tech industries from the sort of “predation” China has used in the past. Many economists say those steps are insufficient — and possibly counterproductive — to position American companies to compete in emerging, high-tech, globalized industries. They say the administration needs a proactive strategy to bolster American innovation and technology. That includes investing in federal research and development spending, worker skills and attracting more high-caliber foreign students to American graduate programs and fostering advanced industries such as biodefense and artificial intelligence. Whether industries like semiconductors thrive going forward in the United States “will depend not on America’s success in curbing China’s progress, but rather on its ability to sustain and support innovation by U.S. companies,” Laura D’Andrea Tyson, a former top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, wrote this week.

"THE END OF THE FRENCH INTELLECTUAL
From Zola to Houellebecq
By Shlomo Sand
Translated by David Fernbach
278 pp. Verso. $29.95. Shlomo Sand explains that, when he was growing up in Israel, he read a novel by Simone de Beauvoir, who conjured for him the ideal of the lofty intellectual in its loftiest version, which is Parisian. He took Beauvoir herself to be the noblest possible exemplar of Parisian loftiness, together with her comrades Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. And he dreamed of the day when he, too, would unsheathe his mighty pen to do battle in the name of universal principle against the forces of injustice and ignorant prejudice. But then, having advanced to what sounds like a later stage of adolescence, he discovered that he had been naïve, and Beauvoir and Sartre had played less than heroic roles during the German Occupation of France. Wartime cowardice made them feel guilty about the Jews, and guilt led them in later years to overcompensate by offering too much sympathy to Israel, which was appalling. And Camus turned out to be just as bad. It was not just that, during the Algerian War, Camus declined to endorse the terrorism of the independence fighters. He, too, displayed a dismaying sympathy for Israel. And, as Sand explains in the opening pages of “The End of the French Intellectual,” the scales fell from his eyes. Sand’s readers will recognize that scales falling from his eyes is the dominant theme of his oeuvre. In the best-known of his books, “The Invention of the Jewish People,” he discovered that the Jews are not the Jews — or, at any rate, are not the descendants of their own ancestors that Jews have spent thousands of years supposing themselves to be. He discovered that, over the millenniums, Jewish communities have come into existence with no connection to the ancient Hebrews — e.g., the little-known Khazars of Central Asia, who converted to Judaism, or the Jewish Berbers of North Africa, who were led by a fabulous queen. He discovered that Jewish historians are unreliable on these questions because they have drawn their inspiration from the volkisch and racist traditions of Germany. He discovered that, even if the Jews do constitute a nation, which they do not, a Jewish state would be, by definition, an outrage against civilized political thought — as explained in still another of his books, “The Invention of the Land of Israel.” And then, having disabused himself of every possible modern Jewish belief about the Jews, still more scales dropped from his eyes, and he composed a book called “How I Stopped Being a Jew.” It is hard to know who is more colorful, the Jewish Berber queen or Shlomo Sand, the Israeli professor. In “The End of the French Intellectual,” he strings together a set of personal reflections, historical annotations and topical commentaries on the ideal of the lofty intellectual, in the course of which he finds 10 ways to say, with suitable references to master thinkers across the centuries, that intellectuals ought to uphold universal principles. And, at the same time, they ought to be honest about any biases or circumstances that might influence their thinking. He contemplates the right-wing writers of France in the 1930s, with passing notation, for some reason, of whoever among them, a few, might have had Jewish roots. He contemplates the sociology of intellectuals. He proposes a Marxist interpretation, with invocations of Karl Kautsky and Antonio Gramsci, according to which the intellectual ideal in its Parisian version rose and fell in tandem with the workers’ movement, from the late 19th century to the late 20th. And then, having polished off these desultory points, he inquires into the intellectual scene in our own time, now that the “great Parisian luminaries” are gone — the scene in Paris, that is. "

"President Trump recently made an offer to National Football League players like us who are committed to protesting injustice. Instead of protesting, he suggested, we should give him names of people we believe were “unfairly treated by the justice system.” If he agrees they were treated unfairly, he said, he will pardon them. To be sure, the president’s clemency power can be a valuable tool for redressing injustice. Just look at Alice Johnson, age 63, who was serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction until her sentence was commuted by President Trump. He should be commended for using his clemency power in that case. But a handful of pardons will not address the sort of systemic injustice that N.F.L. players have been protesting. These are problems that our government has created, many of which occur at the local level. If President Trump thinks he can end these injustices if we deliver him a few names, he hasn’t been listening to us. As Americans, it is our constitutional right to question injustices when they occur, and we see them daily: police brutality, unnecessary incarceration, excessive criminal sentencing, residential segregation and educational inequality. The United States effectively uses prison to treat addiction, and you could argue it is also our largest mental-health provider. Law enforcement has a responsibility to serve its communities, yet this responsibility has too often not met basic standards of accountability. These injustices are so widespread as to seem practically written into our nation’s DNA. We must challenge these norms, investigate the reasons for their pervasiveness and fight with all we have to change them. That is what we, as football players, are trying to do with our activism. President Trump could help. He could use his powers, including the clemency power, to make a real dent in the federal prison population. People like Alice Johnson, for example, should not be given de facto life sentences for nonviolent drug crimes in the first place. The president could stop that from happening by issuing a blanket pardon for people in that situation who have already served long sentences. Of the roughly 185,000 people locked up in federal prisons, about 79,000 are there for drug offenses of some kind — and 13.5 percent of them have sentences of 20 years or more. Imagine how many more Alice Johnsons the president could pardon if he treated the issue like the systemic problem it is, rather than asking professional football players for a few cases. There is also a systemic problem in federal prison involving the elderly, who by next year will make up 28 percent of the federal prison population. Releasing these prisoners would pose little to no risk to society. And yet from 2013 to 2017, the Bureau of Prisons approved only 6 percent of roughly 5,400 “compassionate release” applications. About half of those applications were for people who had been convicted of nonviolent fraud or drug offenses. Of those denied release, 266 died in custody. President Trump could order the release of any drug offender over the age of 60 whose conviction is not recent. That would be the morally right thing to do. Apart from using the pardon power, there are policies the president and the attorney general could implement to help. For instance, they could eliminate life without parole for nonviolent offenses. Currently, more than half of those sentenced to die in federal prison are there for nonviolent offenses, and 30 percent of people sentenced to life (or de facto life) are there for a nonviolent drug crimes. Compare that with the state level: Only 2 percent of those sentenced to life (or de facto life) are there for drug offenses. These changes, if President Trump were to make them, would positively affect the lives of thousands of people and have a lasting beneficial effect on many more people in the future. The president can implement these changes with his pardon power and other executive decisions. His ability to change the lives of people for the better is immense. We hope he uses it, not just for the few, but for the many. President Trump, please note: Our being professional athletes has nothing to do with our commitment to fighting injustice. We are citizens who embrace the values of empathy, integrity and justice, and we will fight for what we believe is right. We weren’t elected to do this. We do it because we love this country, our communities and the people in them. This is our America, our right. We intend to continue to challenge and encourage all Americans to remember why we are here in this world. We are here to treat one another with the kindness and respect every human being deserves. And we hope our elected officials will use their power to do the same. "

"To the Editor: Re “Trump Administration Leaves U.N. Human Rights Council” (news article, June 20): The main problem with the United Nations Human Rights Council is not merely “frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.” Instead, it is the council’s Agenda Item 7, which dedicates an entire agenda item to scrutiny of only Israel. All other 192 United Nations member states are not subject to a specific agenda item. The Human Rights Council will not be effective until it eliminates this discriminatory policy. SALO AIZENBERG

"WASHINGTON — The House resoundingly rejected a far-reaching immigration overhaul on Wednesday, despite a last-minute plea from President Trump, as internal divisions in the Republican ranks continued to hobble legislative efforts to protect the young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. The 121-to-301 vote was an embarrassment both to Mr. Trump and to House Republican leaders, who had spent weeks trying to bring together conservatives and Republicans with moderate views on immigration — and ended up with little to show for the effort. In the end, nearly as many Republicans voted against the bill, 112, as for it, 121. The defeat provided the latest display of the Republican Party’s disunity in Congress on immigration. And it highlighted the continuing inability of both the House and the Senate to resolve the fate of the Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children. Many of those undocumented immigrants have been shielded from deportation under an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which Mr. Trump moved last year to end. Republicans in the House are now likely to turn their focus to narrower legislation that would seek to keep migrant families together at the border, an issue that senators are also looking to address. But with the Fourth of July approaching and lawmakers close to returning home for a recess, it was not clear how quickly a narrower measure might move forward. The House is scheduled to finish its work for the week on Thursday and not return until July 10. A Republican aide said the chamber would not take action on the family separation issue until after the recess. The frustrations over immigration in Congress are matched by the confusion in the Trump administration. A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction on Tuesday stopping the administration from separating children from their parents at the border and ordering that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days.

"China and Russia, apparently seeking to exploit an American wish to lower spending at the United Nations, want to cut more than 200 jobs related to human rights and the prevention of sexual abuse in the organization’s peacekeeping missions, according to diplomats and budget-negotiation documents. Human rights advocates said such cuts, if accepted, would severely hurt United Nations peacekeeping operations covering some of the world’s most vulnerable countries. Roughly 450 jobs are devoted to the protection of human rights and the deterrence of sexual abuse in the peacekeeping system, diplomats said. The push by China and Russia comes at a time when the Trump administration is distancing itself in some ways from the United Nations — although the United States is still the host country and remains by far the biggest financial contributor. At the same time, China in particular is exerting more influence at the organization as its economic importance and contributions increase. China and Russia have long complained about the human rights work of the United Nations, especially in its peacekeeping missions, which they see as falling outside the scope of what the blue-helmeted soldiers of troop-contributing countries should be doing.   "
"BEIJING — When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with President Xi Jinping of China on Wednesday, he hoped to start a conversation on China’s position in the South China Sea. He left knowing just how firm Mr. Xi is on the issue. “We cannot lose even one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors,” Mr. Xi told him, according to Chinese state media. “What is other people’s, we do not want at all.” Disagreements between Washington and Beijing over the Chinese military’s expanding presence in the South China Sea and the American policy toward Taiwan were two of the most prominent issues raised during meetings between Mr. Mattis and senior officials in Beijing, the first stop on a trip that will take him to South Korea and Japan. Mr. Mattis, who has assailed the Chinese military for its expansion in the South China Sea, made clear the Pentagon’s stance on contested waters, stressing the need for freedom of navigation in the region and China’s adherence to international law, according to defense officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. During a meeting with his counterpart, Gen. Wei Fenghe, Mr. Mattis reminded the general of Mr. Xi’s remarks during a 2015 White House visit when Mr. Xi said he had “no intention to militarize” islands in the South China Sea, according to the officials. At a conference in Singapore this month, Mr. Mattis accused China of “intimidation and coercion” for placing surface-to-air missiles and other military equipment on islands in the South China Sea, many of which are also claimed by Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.

"WASHINGTON — The stunning defeat on Tuesday of Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat and a potential future speaker, threw the future of the septuagenarian-led caucus into chaos, opening the door to a new generation of leadership and a push leftward. As shock in the capital over Mr. Crowley’s New York primary loss to a 28-year-old first-time candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, gave way to calculation, House Democrats began floating challengers to Representative Nancy Pelosi, their leader. The current leadership slate reacted defensively to the threat of a purge, while a handful of other lawmakers braced for their own primary challenges from the left. Ms. Pelosi dismissed questions about the growing appetite in her ranks for new leaders, and the demand from the party base for more liberal representatives. “Well, I’m female, I’m progressive — what’s your problem?” she said. “Two out of three ain’t bad.” But rank-and-file House Democrats made clear in dozens of interviews that whether the party takes back the majority or not in November, there would be a push to depose Ms. Pelosi, the 78-year-old former speaker. “There will be an insurgency; I just don’t know who’s leading it,” said Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri. “But I can assure you that I am as certain of that as I am that today is Wednesday.” The question of who would lead an insurgency offered Ms. Pelosi some reassurance, but it also raised the threat of the unknown. For over a year, she has known that Mr. Crowley or Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, her 79-year-old second in command and longtime rival, would be her most obvious challengers. Both are white men with roots in the more centrist wing of the party. "
"Mark Mazzetti, an investigative reporter and editor in The New York Times’s Washington bureau, was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize earlier this year for reporting on Donald Trump’s advisers and their connections to Russia. Mr. Mazzetti recently reflected on his work at the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference in Orlando, Fla. This is an edited excerpt from his presentation.  We spent the last year investigating the president, and that was not really something we specifically set out to do. After the election, we had a group that was formed to look at how Trump was going to change government — Washington. We already knew it was going to be this unusual, unorthodox administration, so we built a team that was designed to look at a broad canvas and sort of spend some time on stories and go in the directions we wanted. Then Russia happened. All of a sudden, our focus changed, our group changed slightly, and we realized pretty quickly that this story was consequential, highly competitive, and it would probably be an investigation unlike we had done before. A lot of times, you go into an investigation and you know the broad contours of what you’re looking at — where you think you want to look. Not that you know the conclusions, but you know roughly the places to go. In this Trump-Russia-Mueller investigation, there was really no map or a sense of where things might end up, or even if there was anything at the bottom of the story. That was sort of in our heads, and still is in our heads, about how to be careful about what we write, to never go too far or assume too much. We came into this environment where the president said that everything we wrote, not just The New York Times but our competitors, was fake news and that we made up everything from whole cloth. So it was this frustrating and maddening — but at times exhilarating — and a hugely satisfying story; and we learned some things along the way. The last year was actually my first year as an actual editor — I was an editor and a reporter — but I learned a lot of things the hard way of being an editor. These were some of the things that I learned. If You Hit A Dry Hole, Stop Drilling "

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • For 30 years, Justice Anthony Kennedy has occupied a spot in the middle of the court’s ideological spectrum, often providing the deciding vote in closely divided cases. While he lent support to liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty, he sided with conservatives on voter access, gun control measures and campaign spending by corporations. The 81-year-old justice announced his retirement on Wednesday. Here’s our lead article about the news, and an assessment of Justice Kennedy’s influence by our Supreme Court reporter. We also looked at how the justice has voted over three decades. He doesn’t like being called the court’s swing vote: “The cases swing,” he said in 2015. “I don’t.” • Separately on Wednesday, the court dealt a major blow to organized labor, ruling that government workers who choose not to join unions may not be required to help pay for collective bargaining. "
"In 30 years on the Supreme Court — the past 13 as the swing justice — Justice Anthony Kennedy has been the decisive vote in cases on issues ranging from abortion to affirmative action. Yet his legacy will be defined primarily by his opinions in the area of gay rights, where he wrote the major majority opinions expansively reading the Constitution to protect gay Americans. Even though these cases have prompted some to call Justice Kennedy the “first gay justice,” his legacy remains unsettled and uncertain. His gay-rights decisions will now face a hostile majority on the court, which is likely to overturn, cut back or nullify at least some of them. And he has made it surprisingly easy. When Justice Kennedy joined the court in 1988, it was no friend to gays and lesbians. Two years earlier, the court had upheld a Georgia law making it a crime to engage in intimate conduct with a person of the same sex. It dismissed the argument that the Constitution protected gay intimacy as “facetious at best.” Gay and lesbian citizens found a champion in Justice Kennedy. In 1996, he led the court in overturning a Colorado law barring cities from protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination. Justice Kennedy wrote that laws targeting gay people based in “animus” were unconstitutional. In 2003, he wrote for the court in Lawrence v. Texas, invalidating a law criminalizing same-sex sodomy and overturning the dismissive 1986 decision. Justice Kennedy also wrote the court’s two most important decisions on same-sex marriage. The court in 2013 struck down a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal benefits to gay couples married under state law; Mr. Kennedy wrote that same-sex marriages were “worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages.” In Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Justice Kennedy said these relationships were “central to individual dignity and autonomy.” The 5-4 decision made marriage equality the law of the land, but beyond that Justice Kennedy’s opinions were important for giving legitimacy to the love and relationships of people long shamed for those very feelings of intimacy. "
"WASHINGTON — For months, their sparring had been indirect, stern letters exchanged, pointed threats traded through the news media. But on Thursday, the ever-intensifying skirmishes between Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and conservative House Republicans broke into an ugly public fight. On the House floor, Republicans voted in lock step to give the Justice Department seven days to produce sensitive documents related to the Russia inquiry and the F.B.I.’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email use. Though nonbinding, the measure was intended to put Mr. Rosenstein on notice that House lawmakers were willing to take punitive action — potentially including impeachment — if their demands were not met. In the House Judiciary Committee, conservative Republicans hauled Mr. Rosenstein and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, before television cameras to accuse them of hiding information from Congress to protect their own interests. In Mr. Rosenstein’s case, some Republicans charged outright misconduct related to the investigation into Russian election interference. The two leaders, both appointed by President Trump, defended the special counsel investigation and their response to congressional investigators, even as they said they had been deeply troubled by the findings of a Justice Department inspector general’s report released this month on the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton email case. “There are mechanisms to resolve this without threatening to hold people in contempt,” Mr. Rosenstein said, urging lawmakers to work with him rather than threaten him. “We are not in contempt of this Congress. We are not going to be.” Democrats accused Republicans of concocting a political distraction to further bloody the reputation of the Justice Department as it investigates President Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Judiciary Committee Democrat, called the floor vote “clearly a pretext for a move against Mr. Rosenstein that the majority already has planned.” "

"The Federal Reserve on Thursday gave clean bills of health to most of the largest American banks, allowing them to return money to shareholders, but it forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to freeze such payouts around last year’s levels. The Fed said that all of the nation’s very biggest banks — Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase — passed the second round of the central bank’s “stress tests,” which gauge whether financial institutions have enough capital and are sufficiently well-managed to continue lending during periods of financial upheaval. The tests were intended to gauge the health of 35 banks, and regulators said they would allow 34 of them to pay dividends and buy back their own shares, a boon for investors who have been eager to benefit from the banks’ record profits. The banks will almost certainly use their collective success to amplify their argument that, 10 years after the financial crisis, they do not need to be as tightly regulated, and that they deserve relief similar to what their much smaller peers received earlier this year when President Trump signed a bill easing parts of the Dodd-Frank law, the landmark bank oversight legislation enacted in 2010. The six largest American banks got permission to pay out a combined sum of more than $125 billions in the form of increased dividends, which reward investors for every share of stock they own, and share buybacks, which increase the value of a company’s stock by reducing the number of shares outstanding. The only bank to fail the stress test was the American arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bank, which Fed officials sharply criticized for “widespread and critical deficiencies” in how it handles its capital and manages its finances. The Fed’s grievances mean Deutsche Bank will be restricted from transferring money from the United States to its Frankfurt headquarters, potentially making its Wall Street operations less lucrative at a time when the bank’s top executives are already mulling cuts to that business. "
"WASHINGTON — The retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy from the Supreme Court could significantly reshape environmental law in the decades ahead and potentially make it easier for the Trump administration to roll back Obama-era climate change policies in the coming years, legal experts said. In his 30 years on the court, Justice Kennedy was frequently a crucial swing vote on major environmental questions. While he tended to be skeptical of expansive federal regulations that intruded on private property rights, he was also willing to break with the court’s conservative wing in favor of more aggressive government action to limit air and water pollution. Perhaps most notably, in 2007, he sided with the court’s four liberal justices in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency to rule that the E.P.A. had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. That case laid the groundwork for many of the Obama administration’s major climate policies, including the Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants. “One can comfortably say that he was the single most influential justice for environmental law over the past 30 years,” said Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Harvard. “Many of those cases were sharply divided, but the one constant was that Kennedy was in the majority in every single case but one. He was the justice that advocates always tried to persuade, because he was persuadable.” President Trump is widely expected to nominate a more conservative justice to fill the vacancy. If that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, he or she would give the court a five-seat conservative majority that is likely to take a dimmer view of federal environmental regulation. It is far from certain that a new court would quickly overturn Massachusetts v. E.P.A. and take away the government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases altogether, legal experts said. The court has already upheld that ruling twice in subsequent cases, and, during oral arguments in 2014, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. indicated that he considered the case an established precedent. "

"Ali Watkins, the New York Times reporter whose email and phone records were secretly seized by the Trump administration, will be transferred out of the newspaper’s Washington bureau and reassigned to a new beat in New York, The Times said on Tuesday. Ms. Watkins, 26, had been the subject of an internal review by The Times after revelations that she had a three-year affair with a high-ranking aide on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she covered for several news organizations before joining The Times in December. The aide, James Wolfe, 57, who handled classified material for the committee, was arrested last month as part of a leak investigation in which the Justice Department also seized Ms. Watkins’s communications, an unusually aggressive move against a journalist that prompted an outcry from press advocates. Mr. Wolfe was charged with lying to the F.B.I. but not with leaking classified information; he has pleaded not guilty. [Read more about how Ms. Watkins’s relationship with Mr. Wolfe rattled the world of Washington journalists.] Ms. Watkins, who had been covering federal law enforcement at The Times, will be assigned a mentor and moved to a new beat in New York “for a fresh start,” the paper’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, wrote in a memo to the newsroom. “We hold our journalists and their work to the highest standards,” Mr. Baquet wrote. “We are giving Ali an opportunity to show that she can live up to them. I believe she can.” He added: “I also believe that The Times must be a humane place that can allow for second chances when there are mitigating circumstances.” "
"LANCASTER, Pa. — Last week I wrote about why political parties across the industrial world are fracturing from the top down. Today I’m writing about the political units that are working. On this Fourth of July, if you want to be an optimist about America, stand on your head. The country looks so much better from the bottom up. I know — the current cliché is that we’re a country divided by two coasts, two coasts that are supposedly diversifying, pluralizing, modernizing and globalizing, while in flyover America everyone is high on opioids, cheering for President Trump and waiting for 1950 to return. That’s totally wrong. Our country is actually a checkerboard of cities and communities — some that are forming what I call “complex adaptive coalitions” and are thriving from the bottom up, and others that can’t build such adaptive coalitions and are rapidly deteriorating. You can find both on the coasts and both in the interior — and you can find both in just one little corner of south-central Pennsylvania. I was invited in April to give a paid book talk here in Lancaster, and I was so blown away by the societal innovation the town’s leaders had employed to rebuild their once-struggling city and county that I decided to return with my reporter’s notebook and interview them. My original host was the Hourglass, a foundation founded by community leaders in Lancaster County in 1997, when the city of Lancaster was a crime-ridden ghost town at night where people were afraid to venture and when the county’s dominant industrial employer, Armstrong World Industries, was withering. Some of the leading citizens decided that “time was running out” — hence “Hourglass” — and that no cavalry was coming to save them — not from the state’s capital or the nation’s capital. They realized that the only way they could replace Armstrong and re-energize the downtown was not with another dominant company, but by throwing partisan politics out the window and forming a complex adaptive coalition in which business leaders, educators, philanthropists, social innovators and the local government would work together to unleash entrepreneurship and forge whatever compromises were necessary to fix the city. "
"WASHINGTON — The string of insults, misstatements, exaggerations and outright falsehoods emanating from the White House began just after sunrise. In the space of a few hours, President Trump on Tuesday took credit for averting a war with North Korea, charged without proof that President Barack Obama had secretly granted citizenship to thousands of Iranians as part of nuclear disarmament negotiations and appeared to suggest that customers of the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson were psychic. He called a sitting congresswoman “crazy” and “corrupt.” He branded the National Security Agency’s handling of millions of telephone call records “a disgrace” — and suggested it was connected to the special counsel investigation into whether his campaign worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 elections. “Witch Hunt!” he wrote at the end of that tweet. The posts on Twitter spanned a range of foreign and domestic issues, and seemed to hew to two clear themes: Attacks on Mr. Trump’s perceived rivals, and trumpeting of what he considers his proudest achievements in the face of public criticism. This is partly true. “Many good conversations with North Korea — it is going well!” Mr. Trump tweeted, one day after a series of reports that the North is chugging forward with nuclear testing, despite its “denuclearization” pledge. “In the meantime no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining.” Then, with Trumpian flair, he added: “If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!” Mr. Trump is at least partly right: There have been no missile or nuclear tests since November, a “freeze” that many, including some Democrats, said was a necessary first step toward removing North Korea’s nuclear weapons.

"WASHINGTON — Over the past several weeks, protesters, Democratic lawmakers and candidates, and even some federal agents have demanded an end to the government agency known as ICE, railing against President Trump’s immigration policies, which have produced heart-wrenching images of migrants being stopped at the southwestern border. But the campaign against ICE may be conflating an alphabet soup of government agencies and their various roles in immigration enforcement. ICE, for example, was not separating migrant families illegally entering the United States from Mexico. Here’s an explanation of what it is doing. ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was created in 2003, as a part of the government’s reorganization after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ICE is one of three agencies that absorbed and assumed the functions of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (which was previously housed under the Justice Department) and the United States Customs Service (which was part of the Treasury Department). The other two Homeland Security agencies that took some of those responsibilities are Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Citizenship Services. No. That’s Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency for the Border Patrol, which is responsible for patrolling, monitoring and securing the United States’ borders with Mexico and Canada. "
"I have devoted a substantial part of my intellectual life to defining and defending conservatism, as a social philosophy and a political program. Each time I think I have hit the nail on the head, the nail slips to one side and the hammer blow falls on my fingers.

"President Trump boasted Tuesday on Twitter about his ability to write. Specifically, he defended his seemingly random use of capitalization. His method? He said he uppercases certain words for “emphasis” — not because they should, in fact, be capitalized. (His tweet, which was later deleted and reposted, also used an incorrect homophone — “pour” instead of “pore” — and contained a dangling modifier. But that’s a story for another day.)

"THURSDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, I know you’re frustrated. Well, some of you are. Other people probably solved this puzzle as if it were nothing, and bully for them, I say. But some of us need more help than that. I tumbled to the fact that there was a trick to this theme fairly quickly, mostly because of the cursing. When one particular trick is present in a puzzle, you’ll know it because you’ll find yourself not being able to fill in many entries, hence the cursing. The trick is revealed in the Theme section below. Randolph Ross is back, and he offers us a respite from the peace and fun of a midweek day off from work, instead getting us thinking about the alleged inner workings of our government agencies.  And why not? How much fun, relaxation and not having to think about the goings-on in the world can one person take? 26A: “Wee wee?” is another way of saying “A smaller version of something small,” and the answer is the contraction LI’L. And yes, I know what the clue looks like it implies. Don’t laugh. This is my job. 30A: Usually when you see a clue like “Ain’t right?,” the puzzle is looking for a correction to the grammar (or, AIN’T the “right” way), so the answer would be ISN’T.  Today, the answer is ARE. 46A: Wordplay alert! “Chest thumper, for short?” could be an abbreviation for a braggart, but how would you do that? Instead, think about another kind of chest thumper: an emergency medical worker, or E.M.T. 58A: Bucks could be slang for money, but today “A couple of bucks?” is DEER. 61A: No, the puzzle isn’t calling you names. “Big jerk” is a funny clue for giving something a YANK. Mr. Ross goes undercover with four government agencies hidden in the puzzle as rebus elements. The rebus is the part that might be frustrating for some people, so I will repost “Yes, You Can Write More Than One Letter in a Square,” which explains what a rebus is, as well as how to enter one in the puzzle on the web and on your devices. For example, at 27A, “Outlet for the Loire” is BAY OF BISCAY, but because we have only nine squares for the answer, we squoosh F.B.I. into one square, so that the entry reads BAYO[FBI]BISCAY.  At the same time, the crossing, 4D’s DATE OF BIRTH should be written in as DATEO[FBI]IRTH. The revealer is at 40D, clued as “What the four undercover orgs. in this puzzle might do,” and the answer, according to Mr. Ross, is WIRE TAP. This is a reminder that Mr. Ross’ notes are the opinion of one person, and to let you know that the puzzle was approved without knowing the genesis of the theme. For that reason, I ask readers to keep comments civil and about the puzzle. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Your thoughts? "
"Many Americans were shocked last week when Attorney General Jeff Sessions turned to the Bible — specifically, Paul’s epistle to the Romans — to justify President Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents. This scriptural justification for a political decision should not have surprised anyone, because Mr. Trump’s administration has consistently treated the separation of church and state as a form of heresy rather than a cherished American value. Attacks on the wall of separation established by the founders — which the religious right likes to call “a lie of the left” — are nothing new. What has changed under Mr. Trump is the disproportionate political debt he owes to extreme religious conservatives, whose views on church-state issues — ranging from the importance of secular public education to women’s and gay rights — are far removed from the American mainstream. The very meaning of the phrases “religious liberty” and “religious freedom”— traditionally understood as referring to the right of Americans to practice whatever faith they wish or no faith at all — is being altered to mean that government should foster a closer relationship with those who want to mix their Christian faith with taxpayer dollars. This usage can be found in numerous executive orders and speeches by Mr. Trump and his cabinet members. Changes in language have consequences, as the religious right’s successful substitution of “pro-life” for “anti-abortion” has long demonstrated. Religion-related issues, especially if buried in lengthy government documents, can often seem obscure, but they dominated the news at the end of June, when the Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump’s travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries and struck down a California requirement that anti-abortion, state-licensed pregnancy clinics provide notice to their clients that abortion is an option. These significant rulings were immediately overshadowed by the retirement from the court of the frequent swing voter Anthony M. Kennedy, which now gives Mr. Trump the opportunity to nominate a predictable religious conservative who would most likely support the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While it is impossible to overstate the long-term importance of the next court appointment, Mr. Sessions and many of his fellow cabinet members offer textbook examples of the everyday perils of entangling religion with politics. Mr. Sessions’s citation of the opening verse of Romans 13, which declares that every soul must be “subject to the governing authorities” and that there is “no authority except that which God has established,” inflamed an already bitter debate over immigration.

WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and architect of President Trump’s aggressive effort to rewrite the government’s rule book on environmental regulations, resigned on Thursday in the face of numerous ethics investigations that doomed his tenure. Despite Mr. Pruitt’s efforts to nurture a close relationship with the president, Mr. Trump himself announced the resignation in a tweet sent from Air Force One. He thanked Mr. Pruitt for an “outstanding job” and said the agency’s deputy, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, would take over as the acting administrator on Monday. Mr. Pruitt in his resignation letter cited “unrelenting attacks on me personally” as one of the reasons for his departure. Mr. Pruitt had been hailed by conservatives for his zealous deregulation, but he could not overcome a spate of questions about his alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and cozy relationships with lobbyists. Mr. Pruitt also came under fire for enlisting aides to obtain special favors for him and his family, such as reaching out to the chief executive of Chick-fil-A, Dan T. Cathy, with the intent of helping Mr. Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn, open a franchise of the restaurant. The resignation appeared to happen quickly. On Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt attended two Fourth of July parties, one at the White House and another at the Interior Department. One attendee who spent time with him said he spent the night mingling, shaking hands, watching the fireworks and showing no indication that he planned to step down. His chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, also gave no hint of what was ahead. An individual close to Mr. Pruitt said the president acted after he found one particular story in recent days embarrassing: a report that Mr. Pruitt had asked Mr. Trump to fire Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, so that Mr. Pruitt could run the Justice Department. The idea had been discussed privately for months by the president, who occasionally asked advisers if it was a good idea, according to two people familiar with the discussions. But seeing those deliberations being aired publicly, amid a string of other damaging reports, focused Mr. Trump’s attention, a person close to the president said. Fresh allegations that Mr. Pruitt had retroactively altered his public schedule, potentially committing a federal crime, had also escalated concerns about him at the White House, according to a White House aide. On Thursday afternoon, around 1:30, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, reached out to Mr. Pruitt to tell him the time had come. Mr. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who built his career on lawsuits against the agency he would eventually lead, remained a favorite of Mr. Trump’s for the majority of his tenure at the E.P.A. He began the largest regulatory rollback in the agency’s history, undoing, delaying or blocking several Obama-era environmental rules. Among them was a suite of historic regulations aimed at mitigating global warming pollution from the United States’ vehicles and power plants. [Mr. Wheeler shares Mr. Pruitt’s zeal to dismantle climate change regulations. Read more here.] Mr. Pruitt also played a lead role in urging Mr. Trump to follow through on his campaign pledge to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, despite warnings from some of the president’s other senior advisers that the move could damage the United States’ credibility in foreign policy. Under the landmark accord, nearly every country had committed to reducing emissions of planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. In 2017, Mr. Pruitt made headlines for  questioning the established science of human-caused climate change, contradicting decades of research by scientific institutions, including his own agency. Although Mr. Pruitt was harshly criticized for the remarks, they did not affect his good standing with a president who has also mocked climate science. Mr. Trump has repeatedly told associates that Mr. Pruitt has done what he has wanted in terms of cutting regulations, so he has been reluctant to let him go. Mr. Pruitt, for his part, had made himself available to the president as a confidant. He ingratiated himself in part by offering himself as a sounding board on topics ranging from the North American Free Trade Agreement to to the Russia investigation, and he would join in as the president criticized the attorney general, Mr. Sessions. He often lunched at the White House mess in hopes of running into the president. But White House advisers, including Mr. Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, for months have implored Mr. Trump to get rid of Mr. Pruitt. Ultimately, the president grew disillusioned with Mr. Pruitt after the accusations of impropriety and ethical missteps overshadowed Mr. Pruitt’s policy achievements. In recent days, people who have spoken with Mr. Trump said he sounded exasperated with his E.P.A. administrator’s negative headlines. “It’s one thing after another with this guy,” one person close to Mr. Trump quoted the president as saying. Mr. Pruitt is the subject of at least 13 federal investigations, and a government watchdog agency concluded that he had broken the law with his purchase of a $43,000 secure telephone booth. He was also under investigation for his 2017 lease of a bedroom in a condominium linked to a Canadian energy company’s powerful Washington lobbying firm, and for accusations that he demoted or sidelined E.P.A. employees who questioned his actions. The former E.P.A. administrator had come under criticism for lavish expenditures on foreign travel, including a trip arranged for him by a lobbyist to Morocco, a country where the E.P.A. has no policy agenda. His domestic travel also came under fire after a former staff member told congressional investigators that his boss often sought to travel to Oklahoma, where Mr. Pruitt owns a home, directing his employees to “find me something to do” there so he could justify charging taxpayers for the expense. A New York Times report earlier this year detailed Mr. Pruitt’s lavish spending and questionable practices in his home state. O n Thursday The Times reported on new questions about whether aides to Mr. Pruitt had deleted sensitive information about his meetings from his public schedule, potentially in violation of the law. While Democrats have criticized Mr. Pruitt since his nomination, in recent months even conservative Republicans had taken the unusual step of criticizing and questioning his ethics. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has started an investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s actions at the E.P.A., the first such Republican-led inquiry into a Trump administration cabinet member. Joni Ernst and Charles E. Grassley, two Republican senators from Iowa, a farm state with a solid bank of Trump voters, have both publicly criticized Mr. Pruitt. Last month, the conservative National Review, which once championed his appointment, called on Mr. Pruitt to resign. On Tuesday, Laura Ingraham, the conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “Pruitt is the swamp. Drain it.” On May 2, Mr. Gowdy’s staff began conducting transcribed, behind-closed-doors interviews with Mr. Pruitt’s closest aides. Partial transcripts from one of those interviews revealed that Mr. Pruitt used one of his top aides last year essentially as a personal assistant, having her help him search for an apartment as well as try to procure a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel. In addition, Mr. Pruitt faced irritation from the White House after The Atlantic magazine reported that Mr. Pruitt’s office gave raises to two aides, even though the White House had declined to approve the raises. The E.P.A. has denied any wrongdoing on Mr. Pruitt’s behalf. As the scandals mounted through the spring, Mr. Pruitt was called to testify before several House and Senate committees. Although they were routine budget hearings, they ended up serving as forums for lawmakers to interrogate Mr. Pruitt about his management practices. Mr. Pruitt, who is deeply religious, spent considerable time in the days before the hearings in prayer, according to a person close to him. He got through the hearings battered but intact, after deflecting blame for numerous issues onto his staff, particularly his chief of staff, Mr. Jackson, whom he blamed for making controversial decisions such as the illegal purchase of the $43,000 secure telephone booth. But the tactic of blaming his employees cost him loyalty. In recent months, nearly a dozen political appointees have quit or been fired from the E.P.A. More recently, many of those staffers have been called to testify to investigators on the House Oversight Committee, which had launched a probe into Mr. Pruitt’s expenditures. The results of that investigation were expected to be the subject of a Senate hearing next month. Inside the E.P.A. on Thursday, as news of Mr. Pruitt’s departure spread, some career employees said that the mood was jubilant but quiet given that many people were out of the office around the July 4 holiday. Some employees met for early drinks at Mackey’s Public House, a bar near the E.P.A. It remains unclear how well some aspects of Mr. Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda, and his effort to undo the environmental work of his predecessors, will stand the test of time. In his haste to cripple government regulation and publicize his success, Mr. Pruitt and his officials have failed to follow important procedures, and courts have already struck down at least six of his rollback efforts. His removal will deal a blow to his political aspirations. People close to Mr. Pruitt have said that he had been using his prominence in the Trump administration to position himself for a run for state office in Oklahoma. His sights, some said, were set on a possible presidential run in 2024. Instead, Mr. Pruitt is now the latest in Mr. Trump’s purge of top administration officials. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge in California on Thursday denied a request by the Trump administration to suspend California’s so-called sanctuary policies that limit cooperation between federal immigration authorities and state and local law enforcement. In a decision praised by opponents of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Judge John A. Mendez of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California ruled that the state’s decision not to assist in federal immigration enforcement was not an “obstacle.” “Standing aside does not equate to standing in the way,” the judge wrote in a 60-page ruling that was at times impassioned. Judge Mendez described the case as presenting “unique and novel” questions about the balance in the country between state and federal powers. “The Court must answer the complicated question of where the United States’ enumerated power over immigration ends and California’s reserved police power begins,” the judge said.

"Good Thursday. Wan this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. More than $2.5 trillion in deals were announced during the first half of the year, putting M.&.A. in 2018 on pace to surpass $5 trillion. That would be the largest yearly total on record. DealBook’s Stephen Grocer has some insights on those numbers, including: • Many of the biggest deals, particularly those in the media business, are bids to fend off competition from tech companies. • Cross-border deals totaled $1 trillion, despite trade tensions — though it could be too early for that rancor to have an effect. • The largest portion of deals are takeovers of American companies. There’s also a warning: Other recent peaks in merger activity have been followed by a recession. Potential trade wars, regulatory uncertainty and rising interest rates could mean this boom will end the same way. More M.&A. news: Deal makers’s paydays should be more closely tied to whether the transactions they put together work out in the long run, the FT’s John Gapper argues. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. President Trump and Congressional Republicans aren’t giving up on their attempts to take health insurance away from millions of Americans. Here’s a quick guide to their efforts: • A coalition of conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation and others, recently released a new repeal plan. It’s similar to last year’s Cassidy-Graham bill. It would reverse Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and end protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Various Trump administration officials — including Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services — claim the bill wouldn’t hurt people with pre-existing conditions, but those claims are simply untrue. At least 20 million people would likely lose coverage if the new Republican plan becomes law, estimate Aviva Aron-Dine and Matt Broaddus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The White House praised the plan, as Mary Ellen McIntire of CQ Now noted. If Republicans keep control of Congress in this year’s midterm election, they are likely to make a new run at passing a plan along these lines next year. Every single Republican health care plan drafted so far would deprive a large number of people of insurance coverage and raise costs for many others. The main point of the plans, in fact, is to reduce federal spending on health care — largely to reduce taxes on the affluent. Health care is very much on the ballot this year. • In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to take steps to weaken Obamacare through executive action. Its boldest attempt is its decision to stop defending the law against a lawsuit filed by some Republican state officials. That attempt seems unlikely to succeed in the long run, given that both conservative and liberal legal experts have criticized it, Aron-Dine told me. But if it did succeed, she added, it would be catastrophic. It would repeal much of the private-market part of the law, leaving only the Medicaid expansion fully in place. A second sabotage attempt is less ambitious — but more certain to do at least some damage. Last month, the Trump administration announced it would expand so-called short-term insurance plans, which aren’t subject to minimum coverage requirements. Some number of (currently) healthy people will sign up for these bare-bones plans, raising costs for everyone. And, of course, if those healthy people end up getting sick, they may regret having signed on. The administration will likely announce the details on these short-term plans in the coming weeks. The bottom line: The recent expansion of Medicaid in Virginia was a major piece of good news on health care. Thirty-three states have now expanded Medicaid as part of Obamacare, and other states, like Nebraska and Utah, may soon follow. But all of this progress is in danger if Republicans keep control of Congress. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) After a trip across the United States that included a stop at Skid Row in Los Angeles, a United Nations official remarked that “contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound.” Another U.N. official said after a visit, “You almost forget you are in Los Angeles.” The L.A. Times has called the explosion of homelessness in Los Angeles in recent years “a national disgrace,” and Mayor Eric Garcetti has said the issue is “the moral crisis of our time.” To give readers a visual understanding of what that looks like across the city, as extreme wealth and poverty collide in public spaces, including libraries, parks and beaches, we went on a tour across the county, and published this piece. In an age of growing economic inequality, the well-off have been able to seclude themselves away from the impoverished. But that has changed over the years in Los Angeles, as the growth in the homeless population has forced the rich and poor to interact more often. Rigo Veloso, who had been homeless in Malibu before moving into an apartment on a resident’s ranch, said that many people he encountered while living on the streets were friendly and compassionate, but many others, he said, “would judge you, and not treat you like a human being.” “It takes your dignity away,” he said. “I’ve been called a maggot.” Indeed, as local authorities grapple with how to spend millions of dollars on housing and other services for the homeless, community leaders are also trying to address the issue at the most basic human level, urging residents to say hello and make eye contact with those living on the streets. “If you talk to most homeless people they will say one of the hardest things is they felt invisible,” said John Maceri, executive director of The People Concern, a social services agency that helps homeless people. “It is dehumanizing. You don’t have to give money to say hello to people, to acknowledge them.” "
"In the Italian film “Life Is Beautiful,” a Jewish bookstore owner uses creative stunts to distract his child from the horrible reality of being held in a Nazi concentration camp. I was reminded of that movie recently as I found myself part of an eerily similar heartbreaking moment. As lawyers with the Texas Civil Rights Project, my team has been working around the clock to document hundreds of cases of children taken from their parents since the Trump administration started its “zero tolerance” immigration policy. Under that policy, the government charges every immigrant apprehended at the border with illegal entry, a misdemeanor offense — regardless of whether they’re fleeing violence and seeking asylum, or traveling with children. Before zero tolerance, immigration and Department of Justice officials exercised their discretion on whether to press criminal charges against some immigrants and asylum seekers, particularly those traveling with children and those with special circumstances. Each morning for the last three weeks, my colleagues and I have gone to the federal courthouse in McAllen, Tex., seven miles from the Mexican border. We arrive no later than 7:45, pass the metal detectors at the security check, and make sure to get to the eighth floor by 8. By that time, the courtroom is already nearly full. On a typical morning, some 70 to 80 men and women are brought to court and put in handcuffs with shackles around their ankles. A vast majority are first-time border crossers. A public defender asks the group whether any are traveling with children and have been separated from them. Struggling with the handcuffs, it’s not easy for them to raise their hands. Sometimes, to answer in the affirmative, they must stand up. The criminal proceeding begins at 9 a.m., and depending on how many separated parents are there each day, we have maybe five to seven minutes to speak with each parent beforehand. Hopefully, that’s enough to get the most basic information about them and the children taken from them — names, dates of birth, country of origin. They’re frightened and confused, and most don’t speak English. I tell them in Spanish that I’m a lawyer working on family separations and that I can try to help get their children back. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has drafted a new proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, one that is far less stringent than the climate plan finalized in 2015 by former President Barack Obama.      "
"WASHINGTON — A trade war between the world’s two largest economies officially began on Friday morning as the Trump administration followed through with its threat to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products, a significant escalation of a fight that could hurt companies and consumers in both the United States and China. The penalties, which went into effect at 12:01 a.m., prompted quick retaliation by Beijing, which said it immediately put its own similarly sized tariffs on American goods. Previously, the Chinese government had said it would tax pork, soybeans and automobiles, among other products China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the United States “has launched the biggest trade war in economic history so far.” The escalation of the trade war from threat to reality is expected to ripple through global supply chains, raise costs for businesses and consumers and roil global stock markets, which have been volatile in anticipation of a prolonged trade fight between the United States and almost everyone else. On Thursday, President Trump showed no signs of backing down from his fight, saying aboard Air Force One that the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in goods would quickly be followed by levies on another $16 billion of Chinese products. And Mr. Trump continued to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods. For now, it is unclear how — or whether — the trade war might conclude. Mr. Trump’s threats have been met with vows from China to retaliate, a stalemate that will require one side to blink first in order to avoid a protracted fight. With no official talks scheduled between the two countries, and disagreements within the Trump administration about how best to proceed, a quick resolution seems increasingly unlikely. "
"Jaroslaw Kaczynski is not a man to back down. His zealous vision of a “Fourth Republic” is an idealized Catholic Poland stripped of Communist remnants and Western social liberalism. And on his second try to achieve it, he will not be deterred — not by the European Union, not by protesters, and definitely not by the courts. That is what makes his current conflict with the Supreme Court so fateful, for Poland and for Europe. The courts are an especial bugaboo for Mr. Kaczynski. When Law and Justice, the party he founded with his identical twin, Lech Kaczynski, first held power between 2005 and 2007, the courts blocked parts of their nationalist agenda. After the party was defeated in parliamentary elections — and after his brother, then president, was killed in a plane crash in Russia (which he insists was Russia’s doing) — Jaroslaw Kaczynski honed his tactics and his zeal. He did not seek office when Law and Justice retook Parliament in 2015, pushing more acceptable candidates to the fore. But he is the real power behind the government and its assault on the courts, first seizing control of the Constitutional Court, which is supposed to ensure that laws do not violate the Constitution, and then going after the Supreme Court, the country’s highest court. The tactic was to lower the retirement age for judges to 65 and then to stack the high court with party loyalists. Tens of thousands of Poles, including Lech Walesa, went into the streets on Tuesday, chanting “Solidarnosc” as they once did against the Communists; the European Union, which has already formally threatened Poland with sanctions, including a suspension of its voting rights over its assault on judiciary independence, opened a new “infringement procedure” that could lead to a suit against Poland in the European Union Court of Justice. "
"In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more of this series here. Here, New York Times reporters and editors explain the “lede-all,” a story form that weaves together many narrative threads and leads the coverage of an event. Simon Romero needed internet service. He was on deadline, reporting from Haiti the day after the 2010 earthquake, and editors were waiting on his article. On a hunch, he hired a driver to take him to a hotel that was miraculously still standing. There, by candlelight, with a generator and a satellite internet connection, Mr. Romero filed a draft of his “lede-all,” a story that captured the devastating situation unfolding on the ground, and set the stage for the weeks of reporting that would follow. The lede-all is one of the most important and challenging story forms employed by reporters at The New York Times. As the name suggests, a lede-all leads the coverage of an event, weaving together many narrative threads, some of which are expanded upon in their own separate articles. It’s a form that is reserved for news of significant scale and consequence. In decades past, when print schedules determined when stories were published, a reporter might have had a day, or an afternoon at least, to craft a lede-all. Now, with news breaking on multiple platforms in real time, the lede-all has to provide an authoritative big-picture sense of the moment in a matter of hours. “It’s the grand summation before you get into the granular; it’s the significant before you get to the specific,” said Sewell Chan, an international news editor. Patrick Healy, now The Times’s politics editor, and another politics reporter, Jeremy Peters, wrote the lede-all the day after the 2016 presidential election. The events of the previous night called for an article that could capture the shock of the nation, the elation of Donald J. Trump’s supporters and the devastation of those who had supported Hillary Clinton. It needed to incorporate reactions from voters, Mrs. Clinton, President Barack Obama, other politicians, foreign leaders and President-elect Trump, all while using “writing that feels worthy of the hugeness of the moment” and communicating to future generations “what a crazy day this was in America,” Mr. Healy said. Logistical challenges, like those Mr. Romero encountered in Haiti, can further complicate the writing process. Amy Chozick typed out her lede-all for Hillary Clinton’s Nevada primary caucus win while plugged in to an outlet at a “Sex and the City” slot machine in Las Vegas. (Mr. Healy co-wrote the story, from New York.) “The security guard said, ‘You can’t sit here unless you’re gambling,’ so I was sticking quarters in while I typed,” Ms. Chozick said. “I ended up winning $40!” Even under ideal circumstances, lede-alls are a feat of information management. They often incorporate feeds: information provided to the writer by reporters who are focused on specific aspects of the story, like a victim’s family, voter reactions or an official response. It’s the lede-all writer’s job to process and incorporate these feeds, communicating with colleagues about the kind of information she still needs and where the story is going. Sometimes a lede-all has to be updated live as an event unfolds and new information becomes available. It is, as more than one journalist has said, a team effort. The contributor line at the bottom of Mr. Romero’s article indicates that eight other people contributed reporting from four more locations. “It’s a testament to the strength of The Times at such a crucial moment,” Mr. Romero said. When done right, all the pieces come together, and the lede-all becomes a rough draft of history — something that was on Mr. Healy’s mind the morning after the 2016 presidential election. “This is going to be a story,” he said, “that people may read a hundred years from now.” "

China, professing “shock,” has promised to respond, without specifying how. Asian and European markets were rattled by the news this morning. U.S. markets were set to open lower, too. The new U.S. tariffs appear focused on Chinese manufacturing, covering electronics, textiles and auto parts, as well as minerals used in gadgets and batteries. Bloomberg points out that China’s response may have to stretch beyond tariffs, because the country imports only about $130 billion worth of goods from the U.S. Options include making it harder for American companies to operate in China, canceling orders for U.S. goods, or even putting tariffs on American energy. Rupert Murdoch’s media company increased its bid for control of the European satellite broadcaster this morning, surpassing Comcast’s.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s trade war is expected to temporarily bolster United States economic growth, in part because Beijing tried to beat the clock on Mr. Trump’s tariffs by stocking up on American soybeans, crude oil and other exports. Economists are predicting that the gross domestic product for the second quarter could reach 5 percent when the preliminary numbers are released on July 27. The United States trade gap with China has narrowed, as more American products were shipped to Beijing ahead of the tariffs, which went into effect on July 6. But both effects are expected to be fleeting, and the short-term economic improvement could turn into a long-term loss if both countries follow through with their threats to continue escalating tariffs against each other. “They will dance, they will sing, they will say, look at the plunge in the trade deficit in the second quarter,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. “That is of course complete drivel.” The United States is engaged in multiple trade wars at once as it imposes tariffs on metals from the European Union, Mexico, Canada and other nations. But it is waging an even bigger fight with China, a dispute that threatens to engulf broad swaths of the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration has accused the Chinese of a variety of trade abuses, including intellectual property theft and denying American companies equal access to China’s market. Mr. Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion worth of Chinese products and has threatened to hit as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods with levies. On Tuesday, the administration released a list of an additional $200 billion in products that could face tariffs as soon as September. China had already responded with tariffs of its own, on soybeans, pork, automobiles and other products and signaled that its next wave of tariffs could include American oil exports. "
"Several readers have written to The Times to express their concern with our use of the phrase “catch and release” in our recent coverage of the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. “ ‘Catch and release’ is a sport fishing term for the practice of catching fish and releasing them, alive, back into the water,” Tim Pierce from Berlin, Mass., wrote in a letter to the editor on Wednesday. “The Trump administration uses it as part of a strategy to dehumanize immigrants. The Times must not be complicit in this process of dehumanization, and must reject this biased term.” We asked our deputy national editor Kim Murphy to respond. The phrase “catch and release” has been used off-and-on to describe immigration policy since at least the administration of George W. Bush. President Trump has made it a favorite term for what he considers the government’s lack of vigilance in detaining migrants who cross the border illegally. For too long, he argues, the government has allowed migrants in such cases to be released from detention and simply show up for their immigration hearings in order to remain, possibly for years, in the United States. Such a policy, he believes, encourages more migrant families to embark on dangerous journeys, persuaded by precedent that freedom waits at the other end. Mr. Trump is a master of catchphrases; he uses them so often that news organizations can be tempted to adopt them, often tongue-in-cheek, as shorthand for government policy. “Drain the swamp” (trim government bureaucracy). “Big, beautiful wall” (fortify the border). “Worst trade deal ever” (Nafta). “Greatest theft in the history of the world” (China). “Rocket man” (North Korea). “Fake news” (fill in the blank). “Catch and release” has had a way of seeping into news coverage because it so succinctly describes a complex set of responses to illegal immigration and asylum law. I personally would never have thought of it as a way of equating human beings to fish. Yet of course by adopting a fishing metaphor, it does precisely that. Here on the National desk, we’ve asked all our immigration writers to think carefully before using this phrase, making sure they include it only in reference to the administration’s use of the phrase; we don’t want to make it ours. Please share your thoughts in the comments. "

"KUANTAN, Malaysia — Amanda Lacaze grabbed her iPhone and rattled off the names of the special minerals needed to make it. The screen was polished with lanthanum and cerium. The inside has a magnet made with neodymium and praseodymium. Those minerals almost certainly came from China. Ms. Lacaze’s job is to give the world an alternative source, in case a global trade war spirals out of control and China cuts off supply. Right now, she can’t. Her company, Lynas Corporation, can provide only a fraction of the minerals — known as rare earths — that China produces. And even that source isn’t a sure thing: The work is so volatile, complex and expensive that Lynas once came close to collapsing. “There were times where we were sitting there and I’m saying, ‘Can we really afford to put coffee into the staff rooms?’” Ms. Lacaze said. The Trump administration amped up its trade fight with China on Tuesday when it threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, ranging from frozen catfish fillets to copper wires to piston engines. China has threatened to match them dollar for dollar. But it has other ways to retaliate beyond tariffs. It could refuse to buy American products, like planes from Boeing. It could intensify regulation of American companies doing business on the mainland. It could threaten to offload a piece of its huge portfolio of Treasuries, which could rattle the bond market. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Three important buildings, designed by three important architects, tell the story of modern Los Angeles and its newspaper. The first was designed by Gordon B. Kaufmann and built in 1935 as a new and modern home for The Los Angeles Times, and its distinctive Art Deco style has been an iconic fixture of the city’s skyline. The second, designed by Rowland H. Crawford, is an office tower built in 1948 as the home for a new afternoon newspaper. That project failed, partly because the old street cars went away as the city embraced the automobile, but the building endures. The third was designed by William L. Pereira, a 1973 office building to accommodate the top brass of the Times Mirror Co., the newspaper’s corporate parent. It was built at a time when the paper was growing under the publisher, Otis Chandler, who expanded the paper’s coverage, elevating it into the upper echelon of the country’s great newspapers. Together they are known as Times Mirror Square, and now that the staff of The Los Angeles Times is moving to another section of the county, conservationists are fighting to save the building from development plans by the complex’s owner, the Onni Group. “These three buildings tell the story not just of The Los Angeles Times, but of Los Angeles,” said Richard Schave, a local conservationist and historian who runs the tour company Esotouric.

"With apologies to “Animal House’s” Otter, Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court is not the time “a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody’s part.” Then again, Otter’s frat brother Bluto did go on to become a United States senator, so maybe it makes sense. I refer to the decision of Senate Democrats to wage a tooth-and-nail battle to oppose Kavanaugh, an effort that is likely doomed to fail and equally likely to hurt Democratic chances in the fall. Who knew Chuck Schumer was so content with his job as Senate minority leader? Let’s count the ways in which the Democrats aren’t helping themselves. Kavanaugh will almost certainly be confirmed. Democrats who had pinned their hopes on flipping Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski probably aren’t going to get their wish, since both Republican moderates voted to confirm Kavanaugh to his current judgeship in 2006 and have since spoken approvingly of his nomination. Rand Paul can also be counted on to feign political independence, but he usually falls into line. Of course it’s possible Kavanaugh will make a bad public impression, like Robert Bork. Or maybe there will be a #MeToo revelation, like with Clarence Thomas. Or maybe Democrats will figure out a way to kick a vote past the midterms. In which case, Democrats can seize their chances. For now, however, the first question Democrats ought to ask themselves is whether they really have political capital to waste on a losing battle. Fierce opposition to Kavanaugh hurts Democrats. This was already going to be a difficult year for Senate Democrats, who are defending 10 seats in states won by Trump. Everyone knows that North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Indiana’s Joe Donnelly are vulnerable, which is why they voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch last year. Florida’s Bill Nelson is struggling, too, as is Missouri’s Claire McCaskill. So please explain the logic of convincing Democratic voters in these states that the Kavanaugh nomination is the moral battle of our time — and then putting their senators to the choice of looking like political sellouts if they vote for Kavanaugh, or moral cowards if they don’t (and vice versa)?

"In the year and a half since Barack Obama left office, dozens of books have been written about his administration, including memoirs by his official photographer, stenographer, speechwriter, communications director, his foreign policy advisers and his director of national intelligence, not to mention the Obamas’ own forthcoming memoirs. But only one book includes a scene where Obama bursts into a motorcycle gang clubhouse in Delaware, casually toting a sawed-off shotgun, to rescue Joe Biden from a mob of angry, heavily armed bikers. “Looks like you all know who my pal is,” Biden tells his antagonists with satisfaction. “He’s the guy who killed Bin Laden,” one of the stunned bikers says. The unlikely scenario sprung from the twisted mind of Andrew Shaffer, author of “Hope Never Dies,” a new mystery novel starring the 44th president and his vice president as a pair of crime-busting amateur sleuths. It’s the first in a planned crime series, with Obama playing a cerebral, detached, analytical Holmes to Biden’s bumbling, impulsive Watson. The novel, out this week, is a roughly 300-page work of political fanfiction, an escapist fantasy that will likely appeal to liberals pining for the previous administration, longing for the Obama-Biden team to emerge from political retirement as action heroes. But it’s also at times a surprisingly earnest story about estranged friends who are reunited under strange circumstances. "
"A Border Patrol agent who obtained the confidential travel records of a Washington journalist and used them to press her about her sources last year is under investigation for misuse of government computer systems, according to an official briefed on the inquiry. The agent, Jeffrey A. Rambo, who usually worked in the San Diego area, was temporarily assigned at the time to the National Targeting Center, a facility in Sterling, Va., operated by Customs and Border Protection that stores data on the travel of millions of Americans and foreigners. Such information is supposed to be used only under strict rules by immigration and law enforcement officials. Now the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general and investigators from the border agency are examining whether Mr. Rambo used the travel data improperly or illegally and whether anyone else was involved. Press advocates have expressed alarm that a government official would use sensitive private information in what they say amounted to a blackmail attempt against a journalist. On June 1, 2017, Mr. Rambo, 33, contacted Ali Watkins, a reporter for Politico at the time who now works at The New York Times, saying that he needed to meet her in Washington immediately. He told Ms. Watkins that he worked for the government but declined to give his name or agency. In a lengthy conversation at a bar near Dupont Circle, Mr. Rambo claimed to be helping the F.B.I. with investigations into leaks of sensitive material to journalists. He eventually revealed that he knew the details of a trip to Spain that Ms. Watkins had taken with James A. Wolfe, security director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who was then her boyfriend. According to accounts Ms. Watkins provided to friends and editors, Mr. Rambo hinted that he might disclose their relationship to The Washington Post and pressed her to become his informant and report to him on other journalists and their sources.

"Iran has denied as “laughably absurd” a detailed Israeli claim that intelligence agents stole clandestine Iranian documents this past winter that reveal what Israel has called Iran’s extensive past research on nuclear bombs. The Iranian denial, issued by the country’s United Nations mission, was in response to articles in The New York Times and other publications in recent days about the detailed claim by Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous foreign threat. The Times article, published in Monday’s print editions, and similar accounts in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, were based on a partial viewing of the documents by journalists from those publications at the invitation of the Israeli government. Israeli officials also provided new details on how they said the documents had been obtained — through a secret raid on a Tehran warehouse on Jan. 31 by agents of the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, equipped with blowtorches. The trove included what the Israelis described as 50,000 pages and 163 compact discs of memos, videos and plans for building weapons. There was nothing in Israel’s claim that suggested the Iranians were still engaged in such activity, which American intelligence reports have said ended in 2003. But the documents suggested not only that Iran had been deceitful but also that its work in weaponizing nuclear power had been far more sophisticated and organized than initially suspected. The authenticity of the documents, which purport to be at least 15 years old, has not been independently confirmed. Iran has always denied accusations by Israel and others that Iranian nuclear work was meant for military purposes, a denial that Iran’s United Nations mission reiterated in response to Israel’s latest claim. “Iran has always been clear that creating indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is against what we stand for as a country, and the notion that Iran would abandon any kind of sensitive information in some random warehouse in Tehran is laughably absurd,” a spokesman for the Iranian mission, Alireza Miryousefi, said in an emailed statement. “It’s almost as if they are trying to see what outlandish claims they can get a Western audience to believe.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel first announced the results of the seizure in April after he had given President Trump a private briefing. Just days later, Mr. Trump made good on his longstanding vow to renounce the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that was negotiated by the Obama administration and the governments of five other major powers, including major European allies of the United States.

"Does it seem strange that, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Monday by the Justice Department, a Russian woman stands accused of “acting as an agent of a foreign government” in part because she hoped “to establish a back channel of communication” with American politicians at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington? It shouldn’t. As Jeff Sharlet, an associate professor of English at Dartmouth, has pointed out, the National Prayer Breakfast has long offered “a backdoor to American power.” And America’s homegrown Christian nationalists have evinced an admiration for Russia’s authoritarian leader that appears to have grown apace with his brutality. On Tuesday, Maria Butina, a 29-year-old Russian whose name was spelled Mariia in court papers, was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy and acting as an unregistered foreign agent for the Russian Federation.  According to the complaint unsealed on Monday, Ms. Butina’s promotional activities for Russian political interests included attending the National Prayer Breakfast twice. The National Prayer Breakfast was initiated in 1953 by a Methodist minister, Abraham Vereide, who had been leading Congressional prayer groups for a decade. The annual breakfast now attracts close to 4,000 participants and is hosted by members of Congress. But the real force behind the event remains Mr. Vereide’s Fellowship Foundation, also known as “The Family,” whose fundamental mission is to create a ruling consortium of Christ-centered political and community leaders. “The Family considers #nationalprayerbreakfast a recruiting device,” Mr. Sharlet, who has published two books about the group, tweeted on Monday. Lobbyists and foreign governments look forward to the event as a way to meet powerful people without, as Mr. Sharlet has reported, having to go through the State Department and normal vetting processes.

To understand the kind of re-election battle Representative Dana Rohrabacher is facing, take a look at a billboard overlooking Newport Boulevard in Costa Mesa. Larger-than-life images of Mr. Rohrabacher and President Trump face a quote attributed to Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader: “There are two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.” Mr. Rohrabacher’s relationship with Russia is again under scrutiny. On Tuesday, he said that he had met with Maria Butina, who was indicted on charges of conspiracy and acting as a foreign agent, on a 2015 trip to Russia. But Mr. Rohrabacher dismissed the charges against her as “bogus.” And a day earlier, he gave the most enthusiastic defense of the president’s remarks in Helsinki. Mr. Rohrabacher’s close ties to Russia have provoked criticism from politicians even in his own party. And Democrats hope his support for the Kremlin will help lead to his defeat this November. But it is unclear whether that support will become a central issue in the campaign. Several voters in the district said they saw the outrage as a side issue propped up by Democrats.     "

"China has become a global leader in policy and diplomacy on limiting the effects of climate change, but it still needs to take significant steps to curb its own carbon dioxide emissions, according to a report released on Thursday. The report, written by David Sandalow, a former United States energy official now at Columbia University, takes a broad look at emissions and coal use in 2017 in China, which is by far the world’s top emitter of the heat-trapping gases that accelerate climate change. The study also analyses recent policy moves on climate by the country’s government and by the Communist Party. China has wide-ranging climate policies, enshrined in the national Five-Year Plans and in blueprints at provincial and local levels. As a result, the report says, it is on its way to meeting major climate change goals, including lowering a measure known as carbon intensity, having carbon dioxide emissions reach a peak no later than 2030 and having a fifth of energy come from non-fossil-fuel sources by that year. At the same time, the report says, if China’s carbon emissions continue at the current pace, nations will find it harder to meet important climate change policy goals — most notably limiting the average global temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, above preindustrial levels. Even if China’s emissions decrease after 2030, that goal could be much harder to achieve unless they then drop rapidly.  "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It’s become a pattern: President Trump says something outrageous. He later grudgingly retracts his statement, or members of his administration retract it on his behalf. And then he quickly undermines the retraction. It happened with the attacks by white supremacists in Charlottesville and with other race-baiting issues. This week alone, the pattern has been visible multiple times, on Russia and NATO. So what explains it? What could Trump possibly be accomplishing with this blatant dissembling? Something important and devious, actually. He is sending two different messages, each intended for a different audience. With the initial statement, he’s talking to his primary audience. Often, that audience is his political base, and Trump is signaling that he’s with them: He, too, is a white nationalist, or at the very least he’s sympathetic to them. He believes that dark-skinned people live in miserable countries, that Mexicans are rapists, that Muslims should be banned from America and that some white supremacists are “very fine people.” Over the past week, for whatever reason, Trump’s primary audience has seemed to be Vladimir Putin. Trump repeatedly sent messages that Putin must have liked — that NATO is a mess, that Russia didn’t interfere in the election and that the Trump administration would consider handing over an American citizen to Putin’s government for questioning.

"ISTANBUL — Even before President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was inaugurated last week, he began elbowing his way into the front ranks of the globe’s strongmen. Hours before taking the oath of office — after 15 years already in power — Mr. Erdogan published a 143-page decree changing the way almost every government department and public body in the country operates. In the days since, he has issued several equally lengthy decrees and presidential decisions, centralizing power and giving him the ability to exert control in nearly all areas of life with almost unchecked authority. At a moment when democratic systems around the world are under increasing pressure, Mr. Erdogan, who was re-elected in June, is among those leaders, like Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Viktor Orban of Hungary, who are using the levers of democracy to vastly expand their authority. Among the changes Mr. Erdogan has put in place under the new presidential system are these: • The prime minister’s office has been abolished; • The military has been brought under firmer civilian control; • The president will draft the budget and choose judges and many top officials; • The president can dismiss Parliament and call new elections at will; "
"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has long demanded that the Palestinians acknowledge his country’s existence as the “nation-state of the Jewish people.” On Thursday, his governing coalition stopped waiting around and pushed through a law that made it a fact. In an incendiary move hailed as historic by Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition but denounced by centrists and leftists as racist and anti-democratic, Israel’s Parliament enacted a law that enshrines the right of national self-determination as “unique to the Jewish people” — not all citizens. The legislation, a “basic law” — giving it the weight of a constitutional amendment — omits any mention of democracy or the principle of equality, in what critics called a betrayal of Israel’s 1948 Declaration of Independence, which ensured “complete equality of social and political rights” for “all its inhabitants” no matter their religion, race or sex.

"To the Editor: Re “A Victory Is Declared on the War on Poverty” (news article, July 13): The fact that President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers declared “that America’s long-running war on poverty ‘is largely over and a success’” can mean only two things: Either those top officials are totally disconnected from the reality on the ground, or they are willfully misrepresenting the actual situation in order to find ways to reduce the government’s responsibility to help those most in need in our society. My strong suspicion is that it is the latter. By supporting the latest tax giveaway to the wealthy and the big corporations, they manage to create huge budget deficits that will justify shredding the safety net for the poor. What better pretext could they use than to claim that the poverty problem no longer exists and therefore the poor can be left to their own devices to help themselves?

"Iran’s central banker was fired on Wednesday in the first senior shake-up since the United States abandoned the nuclear agreement nearly three months ago and restored sanctions, moves that worsened an already weak Iranian economy. The dismissed official, Valiollah Seif, governor of the central bank for five years, had been widely assailed for what critics called his mismanagement of Iran’s monetary policy, which contributed to a steep drop in the value of the country’s rial currency. Some also faulted Mr. Seif for failing to foresee that the Trump administration would withdraw from the nuclear agreement, which had eased economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear work. President Trump’s decision, announced in May, accelerated a capital flight from Iran that hastened the rial’s decline, unnerving Iranians who saw it as a warning of economic calamity. Mr. Seif may have been further impaired by the Trump administration’s decision, after reimposing sanctions, to blacklist him for what it called his role in money transfers to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization that the United States regards as a terrorist group. The blacklisting made it difficult for international bankers to deal with Mr. Seif without risking American penalties. His departure, announced in Iran’s state-run media, made Mr. Seif the first top official in President Hassan Rouhani’s government to fall since the nuclear agreement began to unravel. Analysts expect more dismissals because of the tough new economic reality facing the nation of 80 million, where inflation and unemployment are on the rise. "
"This Thursday the Trump administration faces a deadline handed down earlier this summer by a United States District Court judge: reunite the children separated from their parents at the border by federal law enforcement. There’s no way the White House will pull it off. Reports indicate that hundreds of parents will not be seeing their children because the government can’t locate the parents or has already deported them. This entire catastrophe isn’t just the result of a deliberately cruel and incompetently implemented policy, though it is certainly that. These sundered families are the latest casualty of “zero tolerance” — a misguided mind-set that bludgeons the people it targets, no matter how vulnerable. For a generation, American policymakers have been addicted to zero tolerance as a response to all social ills: crime, drugs, sexual violations — even misbehaving schoolchildren. Start with crime. In the 1980s and 1990s, federal and state governments went on a criminal justice binge, vastly expanding our criminal codes, especially in the “wars” against crime and drugs and deploying zero-tolerance policing. The result is that some 70 million Americans have a criminal record — a number equal to Americans with a college degree, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. We remain the nation that “incarcerates a larger share of its population than any other,” according to a recent Pew Research Center report. This despite the fact that crime in the United States is at a modern low. But zero tolerance wasn’t just part of the criminal justice system. Under federal mandate, it became entrenched in schools. Among those caught was a 14-year-old girl in Ohio who, in 1996, gave a Midol tablet to a friend for her menstrual cramps. Administrators at her public junior high school found out, and the girl who supplied the Midol was suspended as a drug dealer.   She was black, and the family brought a suit claiming racial discrimination. They ultimately won, but those who have tracked the implementation and consequences of zero-tolerance policies have documented how black and brown people are disproportionately punished by them. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — Qualcomm called off its $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after Chinese regulators did not rule on the transaction amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The company had already cautioned that the deal was likely to be scrapped, assuming no last-minute approval by Chinese authorities came by a midnight deadline. Both NXP and Qualcomm formally announced the termination on Thursday. NXP said it would receive a $2 billion termination fee from Qualcomm as a result, while Qualcomm said it would buy back up to $30 billion of its stock. The transaction failed after a series of trade moves by the Trump administration, including tariffs on numerous Chinese goods, and retaliatory measures from China. Trade experts had said China appeared to be withholding approval of the Qualcomm deal to gain negotiating leverage. Eight other jurisdictions, including the United States, had already approved Qualcomm’s purchase of the Dutch chip maker. China was the exception, dragging the review process out to more than 20 months. The developments followed actions by President Trump to aid Qualcomm earlier this year. In March, he blocked a $117 billion hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm by a rival chip maker, Broadcom, after a federal committee said an acquisition would reduce research spending on wireless technology essential to national security. "
"WASHINGTON — The United States and the European Union stepped back from the brink of a trade war on Wednesday, after President Trump said the Europeans agreed to work toward lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and to buy billions of dollars of American soybeans and natural gas. The surprise announcement, made by Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, defused, for the moment, a trade battle that began with Mr. Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum exports and threatened to escalate to automobiles. “We’re starting the negotiation right now, but we know very much where it’s going,” Mr. Trump said, standing next to Mr. Juncker at a hastily scheduled appearance in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Juncker said, “I had the intention to make a deal today, and we have made a deal today.” The two sides, he said, had agreed to hold off on further tariffs, and work toward dropping the existing ones on steel and aluminum, while they tried to work out a deal to eliminate tariffs, nontariff barriers and subsidies on industrial goods, excluding autos. It was hard to say, given Mr. Trump’s bluster and unpredictable negotiating style, if the agreement was a genuine truce or merely a lull in a conflict that could flare up again. Twice, Mr. Trump’s aides have negotiated potential deals with China, only to have him reject them and impose further tariffs. Cutting these trade barriers to zero would be an extraordinarily complex political challenge on both sides of the Atlantic. And Mr. Trump stepped back from punitive tariff threats for some relatively minor European concessions: the purchase of soybeans to make up for a steep falloff of buying by China, and the promise to purchase liquefied natural gas once the United States builds more export terminals, which are far away. For weeks, the president has portrayed the European Union as fleecing America with unfair trade, but he put away his saber as farm state Republicans were begging for relief. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — For nearly two years, Facebook has appeared bulletproof despite a series of scandals about the misuse of its giant social network. But the Silicon Valley company’s streak ended on Wednesday when it said that the accumulation of issues was starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business — and that the costs are set to continue playing out for months. Facebook reported on Wednesday that growth in digital advertising sales and in the number of its users had decelerated in the second quarter. The company’s leaders, including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, added that the trajectory was not likely to improve anytime soon, especially as Facebook spends to improve the privacy and security of users. Facebook has grappled with months of scrutiny over Russian misuse of the platform in the 2016 American presidential campaign and the harvesting of its users’ data through the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The results were among the first signs that the issues had pierced the company’s image and would have a lasting effect on its moneymaking machine. In response, Facebook’s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading, erasing more than $120 billion in market value in less than two hours. If those losses hold up through regular trading on Thursday, the one-day stock decline will be the biggest in Facebook’s history. “This is a fork-in-the-road situation for Facebook,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, a marketing research firm. He said the challenges included regaining public trust as well as increasing the number of people joining Facebook and the time they spent on the platform. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The trade war with the European Union appears to be off, at least for now. At a surprise news conference, President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they would work toward lowering tariffs and other trade barriers. Details of the agreement were scant but hinted at collaboration against Chinese trade practices. At the same time, a very different story was unfurling. The release of a secret recording Tuesday night by Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, has unraveled some of the false statements the president has used as a shield against tough questions and embarrassing stories. _____ 2. The news from Washington took some other interesting twists, in a fairly compressed time frame. While President Trump was announcing a trade truce with the E.U., Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed President Trump’s case that, despite his conciliatory appearance last week with Vladimir Putin, Mr. Trump was being tough on Russia.

"The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees will cut more than 260 jobs and curtail mental health services and mobile health clinics, it announced on Wednesday, the first reduction since the United States suspended tens of millions of dollars in funding this year. “These cuts are unprecedented in their scope and depth and their consequences are likely to be dramatic, widespread and unpredictable,” Christopher Gunness, the agency’s spokesman, said in an email. The cuts are the first outcome of a significant American reduction in contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or Unrwa. The Trump administration has provided about $60 million this year. That reflects a drop of more than 80 percent from the $360 million the United States contributed in 2017. Historically, the United States has been one of the biggest donors to Unrwa, which provides food, education, health services and employment to many Palestinians classified as refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The agency said its food assistance program would remain in place until the end of the year, but Mr. Gunness said he feared that agency-run schools would not open on time, in August, because of funding shortages. “We may have over half a million kids on the streets of the Middle East — more than half of them in Gaza — rather than in U.N. schools,” he said. “Whose interests does that serve?” The job cuts are spread out between the West Bank and Gaza. The agency said it would not renew the contracts of 154 workers in the West Bank and 113 in Gaza. In addition, 584 other workers will shift to part-time jobs. Trump administration officials have said any restoration of aid will be partly dependent on what they consider improvements in the agency’s efficiency and accountability. They also said other countries should share more of the financial burden. Critics of the funding cut have asserted that the United States was retaliating against Palestinians for their angry responses to its decisions favoring Israel in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian dispute, notably the recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Pierre Krähenbühl, the commissioner general of Unrwa, said in a June interview with The New York Times that the funding cut had put the agency in its worst financial situation since its creation in 1949, a year after Israel was founded, and could disrupt vital services. In response to the cuts, the agency initiated a fund-raising campaign that collected $238 million between March and June. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A secret Trump recording, violence at Pakistan’s polls and a flag fracas for Australia. Here’s what you need to know: • A betrayal or “a new path”? President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, released a secret recording in which Mr. Trump appears to have direct knowledge about hush money paid to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Here’s how the audio clip has unraveled a web of false statements by Mr. Trump and his aides. Mr. Trump reacted at once: “What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad!” But Mr. Cohen’s lawyer said that his client is “on a new path — it’s a reset button to tell the truth and to let the chips fall where they may.” Separately, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Mr. Trump before Congress, saying he had “proof” that the president is willing to confront Moscow for its interference in American elections and misbehavior around the world. The White House, meanwhile, said a planned follow-up meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia will be postponed until after the investigation of the special counsel is concluded. _____ "
"Beware of oil companies bearing gifts. Recently, the lobbyists and former Senators Trent Lott and John Breaux, backed by companies like Exxon Mobil and Shell, have been campaigning for a federal tax on carbon dioxide emissions. This would increase energy costs, but all revenue from the tax would be returned to the public. A family of four might receive a $2,000 check from the government every year. And we would all have an incentive to reduce our use of carbon-based fossil fuels in favor of clean energy. Most environmentalists, including us, desperately want a meaningful tax on carbon. But several of the people involved in this proposal have shown little previous interest in climate change. The oil industry had few better friends than Mr. Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, and Mr. Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, when they were in office. So what is going on here? Well, Mr. Lott and Mr. Breaux aren’t simply proposing a tax, but a deal: a carbon tax in exchange for two other things. First, they want “an outright repeal of the Clean Power Plan,” which allows the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions and which the Trump administration is moving to cancel. Second — and most consequentially — they want to give fossil fuel companies immunity from lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for damage they have done to the climate. As their proposal puts it, “Robust carbon taxes would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters.” Not coincidentally at all, 14 local and county governments and the State of Rhode Island filed such lawsuits in the last year, trying to make big oil companies pay their fair share for climate adaptations — the fortifications against the consequences, for instance, of rising seas, extreme weather and prolonged droughts. (The Rockefeller Family Fund has funded organizations that support the goals of these lawsuits.) Making the polluter pay is a bedrock environmental principle and a matter of simple justice. If the companies most responsible for climate change can escape liability, then ordinary citizens will have to shoulder the burden of adapting to the changing climate, which over the next few decades will cost this country trillions of dollars. What Big Oil really fears, much more than a modest price on carbon, and what it is trying to escape through the proposed deal, is having to pay for its own actions. Climate science has made major advancements recently and can now demonstrate quite precisely the extent to which human-caused climate change is responsible for extreme weather. Peer-reviewed science can also show what percentage of greenhouse gas pollution any particular company has emitted since the Industrial Revolution. "
"Sean Spicer has written a book. And to promote it in interview after interview, he seems willing to relive his darkest moments as White House press secretary. A National Public Radio host grilled him last week about President Trump’s inauguration crowd, yet again. A BBC anchor told him Monday that he had “corrupted discourse for the entire world.” Fox News was gentler, asking his mother what it was like to raise “this amazing child.” (“Oh come on,” she replied, with a laugh.) “Some interviews are obviously more enjoyable than others,” Mr. Spicer told The New York Times in a phone interview on Wednesday. The confrontational BBC interview in particular has been shared with relish by his critics online, with some journalists calling the exchange “brutal” and “savage.” Emily Maitlis, the BBC anchor of “Newsnight,” grilled Mr. Spicer on his infamous first briefing, in which he falsely said that Mr. Trump’s swearing-in a day earlier had drawn the “largest audience to ever witness an inauguration.” Ms. Maitlis called the news conference the start of a “corrosive culture” in the United States and beyond and said Mr. Spicer had corrupted the political conversation “by going along with these lies.” "
"Facts don’t matter to millions of Americans anymore. That is just the truth. Republicans bewitched by Donald Trump have devalued the import of truth. It is a sad truth and a dangerous one. What is the operational framework of a society when the truth ceases to be accepted as true? There may be precedents in other countries, but one would be hard pressed to find a precedent here. It is becoming cliché now to say that we are in uncharted territory with Trump and his regime, but that is precisely where we are. There is tremendous possibility for peril, but luckily for Trump and the country, we have so far avoided all-out catastrophe. There is no guarantee that our lucky streak will be extended. Every day there is no catastrophe, every day yet another never-before-seen, outrageous scandal emerges from this administration and Trump is not destroyed by it, it strengthens him and numbs us and steels his supporters. The more he lies without paying a price for it, the more he weakens the power of the truth to defend right and condemn wrong. And he expands his latitude to lie more. "
"WASHINGTON — By the end of the night, Austin Juersivich, an 18-year-old attending a conservative leadership conference for high schoolers, had nearly lost his voice. That didn’t stop him from beaming. “That tells you how much I liked it,” Mr. Juersivich, of Akron, Ohio, said with a raspy voice on Tuesday. The four-day gathering, organized by Turning Point USA for about 700 high-school-age conservatives from across the country, is being marketed as a leadership conference that gives teenagers the tools needed to network, organize and campaign while hearing from a who’s who of politics and the news media. “They’re teaching us about how to handle politics and how to live in a world where some things aren’t good to say in public and how to deal with backlash on that,” said Genna Montalbano, a rising junior from Houston. But an elegant dinner Tuesday night at Trump International Hotel featuring Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Donald Trump Jr. and Turning Point USA’s 24-year-old founder, Charlie Kirk, revealed that more than anything, this week is a chance for the teenagers to reject the stereotype that their generation is exclusively liberal and to finally be themselves, “Make America Great Again” hats and all. “You are the only real rebels left in this country,” Mr. Trump said, to thunderous applause. For some, the conference is an opportunity to swap stories about the struggle to express their conservative opinions at school. Jarrett Wiggonton, an 18-year-old from Virginia, said that at a recent pep rally, his and his friends’ Trump signs and paraphernalia were confiscated by teachers. "
"Mr. Pompeo is exaggerating the Trump administration’s support for the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. While the administration “gets credit for compliance, clearly it was Congress pushing the administration’s hand” to pass the law, said Alina Polyakova, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution. The law, which was enacted in August, imposed new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. It also upheld earlier sanctions that President Barack Obama had enacted through executive orders and it limited President Trump’s ability to lift sanctions against Russia. The legislation passed with overwhelming support — a veto-proof majority vote of 98 to 2 in the Senate and 419 to 3 in the House. Mr. Pompeo is right that Mr. Trump eventually signed the law. But the president did so reluctantly after the White House pushed to weaken the bill. Even as he signed it into law, Mr. Trump called the bill “seriously flawed” and said that it “included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.” As the law requires, the administration imposed economic sanctions in March on individuals and organizations linked to Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.  In April, American sanctions were issued against some of Russia’s richest men and top government officials. More sanctions were imposed in June on individuals and organizations accused of directly supporting efforts to carry out cyberattacks in the United States and in Ukraine as well as on digital infrastructure around the world.

"Lanny J. Davis’s client list, like his quintessentially Washington career as an all-purpose lawyer, lobbyist, crisis consultant and television-talker, is lengthy, international — and more than occasionally contradictory. Mr. Davis has represented Harvey Weinstein and Penn State, a Ukrainian oligarch with links to President Trump’s indicted former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an Ivory Coast strongman whom Mr. Davis today insists he was trying to help dislodge as part of a secret arrangement with the State Department. Now, Mr. Davis — best known as a high-profile spinner for Bill and Hillary Clinton, first in the White House and then on any cable news network that would have him — has set off on perhaps his least likely partnership: He is defending Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, who released a recording this week of a conversation that suggests Mr. Trump knew about hush money payments to a former Playboy model. It was Mr. Davis who went on CNN on Tuesday evening to tell the world about their gambit. “Don’t believe me, I’m a Democrat,” Mr. Davis said, addressing “red America” as he stared into the camera. “Believe your own ears.” That strategy, those who know Mr. Davis say, is “classic Lanny,” for better or worse, a sort of valedictory turn for an avatar of the capital’s forever-booming image-buffing industry. His book’s subtitle, lifted from his time as Mr. Clinton’s special counsel and as a self-described crisis guru, advises: “Tell it early, tell it all, tell it yourself.” For Mr. Cohen, this has translated to an aggressive defense in the news media — as much reputational management as legal wrangling — responding in kind to Mr. Trump and his team where other lawyers might be inclined to lie low, with federal prosecutors watching closely. "
"The White House barred a CNN journalist from attending a public appearance by President Trump in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, an apparent act of retaliation that drew immediate rebuke from news organizations and signaled the latest escalation of Mr. Trump’s hostilities toward the news media. Kaitlan Collins, a White House correspondent for CNN, said she was called into the West Wing and chastised by administration officials for what they deemed “inappropriate” questions that she had asked of Mr. Trump during an Oval Office photo opportunity earlier in the day. The officials — Bill Shine, the newly appointed deputy chief of staff, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary — then informed Ms. Collins that they would not allow her to attend Mr. Trump’s public remarks with the president of the European Commission, an event that was otherwise open to the media. “They did not like the questions I asked President Trump about the news of the day,” Ms. Collins said. It is standard practice for reporters to ask questions of Mr. Trump at the end of photo ops, where the president often engages at length even as his aides try to shuffle the reporters from the scene. On Wednesday, Ms. Collins — who attended as a pool reporter, representing the major television networks — asked Mr. Trump several times if he had concerns about the loyalty of his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, whom the president had tweeted about on Wednesday morning. "
"WASHINGTON — A group of House Republicans escalated their feud with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, on Wednesday, introducing articles of impeachment in a long-shot bid to oust the official overseeing the special counsel inquiry into Russian election interference. The move was seen as much as a political maneuver as an act of congressional oversight. The group of 11, led by Representatives Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio, would need the support of a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to convict Mr. Rosenstein. The resolution they filed does not require the entire House to vote before Congress adjourns for its summer recess on Friday. But it could provide President Trump with more ammunition to attack Mr. Rosenstein, who has been in Mr. Trump’s cross hairs since he appointed the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to investigate Russia’s plot to manipulate the 2016 presidential election and whether any Trump associates were complicit. Republican lawmakers have been sparring with Mr. Rosenstein for months. They accuse the Justice Department of being less than forthcoming with documents related to several of its most sensitive investigations, including the Russia inquiry. “It’s time to find a new deputy attorney general who is serious about accountability and transparency,” Mr. Meadows said in a statement on Wednesday. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s confrontation with China is beginning to ripple through American academic and research institutions, as a crackdown on visas for certain Chinese citizens has left the higher education community wondering how it will adapt to the administration’s effort to stop intellectual property theft and slow China’s push for technological supremacy. Educators and academic groups fear that the additional scrutiny could hinder scientific innovation, alienate talented applicants or intensify aggressions toward Chinese scientists already in the country. Academics are already wrestling with the increased attention. At an aerospace conference in Georgia last month, Ella Atkins, a University of Michigan professor, recalled a colleague approaching her with a dilemma. The colleague, an assistant professor at another university, had recently led and submitted a research proposal for a federal grant. But he worried that because he was Chinese, the judges would be biased against his team. “He said, ‘I need to figure out how to take myself off as the P.I., the principal investigator, if that’s going to compromise our project’s chances of being accepted,’” Ms. Atkins said, declining to name the academic for fear of jeopardizing his proposal. The professor, she added, was even considering withdrawing from the project completely to avoid holding back his co-researchers. It is a sentiment that some, such as Representative Judy Chu, Democrat of California, believe underscores a tone of racism behind the policy change. The restrictions, she said, equate to targeting “an entire ethnic group of people for suspicion that they’re spies for China.” "
"The Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, no stranger to speaking his mind and creating controversy, on Wednesday added fuel to an already confusing and rancorous debate about how the N.F.L. plans to handle players who demonstrate during the playing of the national anthem this season. At the opening of the Cowboys’ training camp in Oxnard, Calif., Jones said that all his team’s players would be required to stand on the field for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” They would not be able to stay in the team’s locker room, something allowed under the league’s revised policy on the anthem. “Our policy is you stand during the anthem, toe the line,” Jones told reporters. Jones added that President Trump’s tweets criticizing the league’s handling of the players who protest had been “problematic” for the N.F.L. Jones’s comments came as the league and N.F.L. Players Association continue to discuss how to revise the anthem policy yet again. A number of players have chosen to kneel or raise a fist during the playing of the anthem, to draw attention to racism and police brutality. In May, the owners unilaterally said that players would be obligated to stand on the field for the national anthem but would have the option of staying indoors. The league reserved the right to fine teams whose players protest on the field during the anthem, while the teams, in turn, can penalize those players. Previously, players were obligated to be on the field during the anthem, but only encouraged, not forced, to stand while the song was being played. "
"An American pastor held on espionage charges in Turkey, the focus of an intensive campaign by top United States officials seeking his freedom, was moved from jail to house arrest on Wednesday because of health concerns. Andrew Brunson, a 50-year-old evangelical pastor from North Carolina, has been held for more than a year and a half in a case that has aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and the United States, longtime allies. He is one of 20 Americans who were charged after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016. President Trump spoke to Mr. Erdogan by phone about the case, and posted a message on Twitter last week urging the Turkish leader to “do something” to free the pastor. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also took to Twitter to say that while the United States welcomed the “long overdue news that Pastor Brunson has been moved from prison to house arrest,” the measure was “not enough.” “We have seen no credible evidence against Mr. Brunson, and call on Turkish authorities to resolve his case immediately in a transparent and fair manner,” Mr. Pompeo wrote. Just last week, a court in Turkey’s western Izmir Province upheld an earlier decision to place Mr. Brunson in jail while he awaited the continuation of a trial on charges of terrorism and espionage. His lawyer appealed the decision, citing unspecified concerns over Mr. Brunson’s health, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. "
"The economy may be humming, but for American car companies, the year is looking less bright. All of Detroit’s Big 3 automakers issued downward revisions on Wednesday in their financial forecasts for the year, with each highlighting rising commodities costs that stem in part from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The adjustments, made as the companies announced their second-quarter earnings, sent their shares down sharply. Ford Motor recorded the worst showing of the three, as net income fell by nearly half to $1.1 billion from the same period ago. Aside from higher materials costs, Ford is struggling in Europe, South America and especially China, where it has spent heavily in recent years to expand but made just $3 million in the quarter and has watched its sales fall. “The deterioration in this important global market has been swift,” Jim Farley, Ford executive vice president and president of global markets, said in a conference call. He said Ford’s joint ventures in China suffered from uncompetitive costs, weak dealer networks and a shortage of sport-utility vehicles in its model line. Ford is now “taking urgent action,” although its troubles will linger, he said. Casting a further cloud over the company was news it was postponing a daylong meeting with analysts scheduled for September, when Ford was supposed to detail the turnaround plan of its chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett was hired in May 2017 to reinvigorate Ford, but the lack of details on Ford’s plans have frustrated some analysts. “The postponement of the capital markets day is a pretty big deal, Jim,” Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley said on the call. In an unusually blunt question, he then wondered about Mr. Hackett’s future with Ford. “Will you be the one delivering the message or will someone else be doing it?” Mr. Jonas asked. After replying at some length about the progress he felt the company had made, Mr. Hackett concluded by saying: “And hell, yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we’re going and what we want to get done. So I think there should be zero question about that.” "
"WASHINGTON — The White House said on Wednesday that President Trump wants to delay a planned follow-up meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia until after the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is concluded — which the White House predicted would be next year. “The president believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over, so we’ve agreed that it will be after the first of the year,” Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said in a statement. Last week, Mr. Trump unexpectedly said he would invite Mr. Putin to Washington in the fall — a move that some interpreted as a show of defiance by Mr. Trump after a storm of criticism over his meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Trump directed Mr. Bolton to deliver the invitation. But the Kremlin had not yet accepted the invitation, raising questions about whether Mr. Putin was interested. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Moscow, Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, acknowledged receiving the invitation but declined to say whether Mr. Putin would visit Washington this year. Mr. Ushakov said that the leaders had not discussed the future meeting while in Helsinki, but that Mr. Bolton had later conveyed the invitation to Russian officials. Mr. Ushakov said Russian and American officials had reached “an understanding that a meeting must take place,” but that “practical aspects will be discussed later.” He said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would, in any case, have an opportunity to meet at a Group of 20 gathering in November in Argentina, and that “maybe there will be other international events which Trump and Putin will take part in.” "

mran Mohammad survived on Manus Island through sheer discipline. He got up every morning at dawn to run, cooked for large groups at night and in between he wrote a 1,200-page autobiography, by hand, in English. But the experience of Australia’s offshore detention center — where he was held despite his status as a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar — also nearly broke him. When I first met him in Manus, he whispered in public spaces, his eyes ever-darting, as if trying to hide from threats unseen. When we said goodbye, I remember thinking: If this guy ever gets out, he’s going to succeed wildly, or he’s going to be crushed by modern life. Now he is in the United States — and I’m still not sure which way he’s heading. We met in New York last week. He’d been resettled in Chicago a few weeks earlier, and he was traveling with another Rohingya refugee from Manus and an Australian couple from Queensland who flew to the United States to see them after years of long-distance support. As a foursome, they were a case study in hope and trauma. Imran looked physically stronger. He told me his life in the United States, as part of the refugee resettlement deal first brokered by President Barack Obama, started with elation. "
"Good Wednesday morning. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The Trump administration has promised America’s farmers $12 billion to offset economic damage from its trade wars. President Trump’s tariffs have provoked retaliatory levies on American pork, beef, soybeans and sorghum. It’s only a “short-term solution,” according to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. It still faces criticism. Farmers would rather sell goods than receive handouts. And if the World Trade Organization decides it’s an unfair subsidy, it could open the way to yet more retaliation. Then, as the editorial board of the NYT argues, there are the other candidates for trade aid: Elsewhere in trade: Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, will offer Mr. Trump ideas for easing tensions today (it could be a sticky meeting). Many U.S. manufacturers are taking tariffs in their stride (Apple may become an exception). The trade war could dampen Chinese enthusiasm for U.S. oil. And here’s how to spot if tariffs damage the economy. The Main Street Investors Coalition says it represents retail investors with no voice in corporate America. But it’s trying to reduce the influence of pension funds and large 401(k) plans, where most little guys keep their money. Andrew examined the organization, and found it had nothing to do with mom-and-pop investors: Empowering individual investors might sound noble. But this coalition knows full well that individual investors rarely mount proxy contests, so its plans would probably leave boards and managers more secure.

"So the Ivanka Trump brand is over: kaput, shutting down, soon to be no more. Really? Don’t be silly. The Ivanka Trump brand is alive and well and working in the West Wing as a special adviser to President Trump. It’s the Ivanka Trump fashion line that is closing, as announced on Tuesday by the first daughter. The one was only ever a shadow expression of the other — or rather, a homage of sorts to what she liked to wear. Which was exactly the problem. The company was based on the premise that there was a group of women who would want to buy, with hard dollars and cents, the image Ms. Trump herself was selling to the world. The one she disseminated so relentlessly via guest appearances on her father’s television show and stories in Vogue and books and on her own Instagram page: Herself as the glassy blond embodiment of the woman who had it all — a big job, family, a perfect blow out, time to exercise. The promise for sale was that you could try this image on with the ease of slipping on a power sheath dress. It’s the promise of every celebrity- or personality-driven fashion line. It’s why Uniqlo was willing to pay so much for Roger Federer to become a brand ambassador; why Coach wanted to team up with Selena Gomez. Why so many actors and athletes now see their next career step as clothing, and why so many are willing to back them in that move. It’s not about aesthetic vision or achievement. Certainly, Ms. Trump’s clothing and accessories, polished and derivative as they were, weren’t changing anyone’s ideas about the ways fabric related to the body or the possibilities of form. The brand equity and value lies with the fame and myth of the personal brand, not the fashion brand. There’s a reason, after all, Ms. Trump did not name her line Gilded Futures, or some other such vague, kitschy title. And there’s a lesson in the last year and a half of this line for anyone who is tempted to conflate life and a shell-pink car coat. L'État, as Louis XIV said, c’est moi. The brand was her. The idea that she could dissociate herself from that sales pitch by “stepping back” from the company when she went to Washington was always patently silly. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Many Americans pay close to $100 a month for smartphone service. And this pricetag isn’t some natural reflection of the service’s value. In many other countries, smartphone plans cost much less. The economists Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago and Mara Faccio of Purdue estimate that Americans pay $50 billion per year more than they would if they instead were paying European prices — for the same quality service. That translates into about an additional $30 per month for every American household. Zingales discusses this research in a Times op-ed and argues — correctly, I believe — that it highlights the problem with antitrust policy in the United States. We have allowed companies to grow too large, to the point that many of them have outsize power. They can raise prices, as they are doing in the cellphone market, as well as hold down wages and unduly influence government policy. Europe has taken antitrust more seriously and fought back against corporate gigantism. The recent fine against Google, for its behavior in the smartphone market, is just one example. “The United States invented antitrust and for decades has been the pioneer in its enforcement. Not anymore,” Zingales writes. “A recent paper shows that in the last two decades, enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California has staked out a leadership role in harnessing alternative energy. But solar arrays and wind turbines are intermittent electricity sources: They don’t always produce power when it’s needed, and at times they generate so much that California must give some away to its neighbors. So the state has been looking at ways to better manage all the carbon-free energy that officials have required power companies to create. One undertaking is particularly ambitious: a $3 billion plan by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to turn Hoover Dam into a giant battery, soaking up some of that solar and wind energy for later use. “Our challenge is: How do we get to 100 percent green?” Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said. “Storage helps. There’s no bigger battery in our system than Hoover Dam.” [Read more about the plan, including video, photos and an interactive look at how the project would expand the dam’s mission.] The proposal is the latest in a growing pool of ideas that California is grappling with to curb carbon emissions and combat climate change. As one of his last efforts before leaving office, Gov. Jerry Brown has set out to expand the state’s electric grid operator into a regional manager for most, if not all, of the West. A bill before the Assembly would expand the California Independent System Operator into a regional authority that utilities in other states could join. "

__________ Starbucks conducted racial bias training. Dick’s is no longer selling assault weapons. Patagonia is suing the president. In each case, a chief executive took a stand — a growing trend in corporate America. This kind of “C.E.O. activism,” which thrusts companies into politics, has been on the rise for a few years now. But recently it seems that hardly a week goes by without a senior executive inserting themselves into a contentious debate over social issues. Many Americans have noticed the trend. The public relations firm Weber Shandwick has released its third annual report on the trend, and DealBook got an early look at the study. The results underline the degree to which — whether companies like it or not — this appears to be the new normal. Here are some of the takeaways from the survey of more than 1,000 Americans: ■ People are increasingly aware of C.E.O. activism. More than a third view it favorably. ■ Nearly half of respondents believe C.E.O. activism can influence government policy. Democrats and Republicans agree that it can make an impact. ■ Less than 40 percent of respondents believe C.E.O.s “have a responsibility” to speak out. About two-thirds of Republicans said C.E.O.s should “stick to business.” ■ The top issues people want C.E.O.s to address? Training, equal pay and sexual harassment. Bottom of the list: gun control, nationalism, marijuana legalization and abortion. In a predictable effort to avoid ruffling feathers, the Weber study doesn’t call out many specific examples of activism. It doesn’t touch on Delta’s tussle with the National Rifle Association after the Parkland, Fla., shooting. There is no mention of the unraveling of the presidential advisory councils last year, when dozens of top C.E.O.s turned their backs on President Trump over his response to the Charlottesville, Va. white nationalist rally. Actually, the word “Trump” is conspicuously absent from the report. Nonetheless, the study serves as a reminder that business and politics are more entangled than ever before. “While most C.E.O.s are not accustomed to participating in the political arena,” writes Andy Polansky, the C.E.O. of Weber, “they and their companies need to be prepared to navigate these uncharted waters, whether they remain silent or not.” "
"Jason Spencer, the Georgia Republican lawmaker who was fooled into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet on the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen’s television series, intends to resign effective July 31. The decision was announced early Wednesday in an email from the office of David Ralston, the Georgia House speaker. It was the first real-world consequence of Mr. Cohen’s Showtime series, “Who Is America?” The show has pranked a long list of sitting and former lawmakers, including the former Vice President Dick Cheney; Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California; and the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The episode featuring Mr. Spencer aired on Sunday, and he initially resisted calls to resign, even from within his own party. Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, said in a post on Twitter on Monday that “the actions and language used by Jason Spencer are appalling and offensive.” Mr. Spencer lost his primary in the spring in his bid for a fifth term and initially said he would serve out his final five months, but the drum beat became too loud. [Sacha Baron Cohen is duping Republicans. Is he the James O’Keefe of the left?] By the time the speaker’s office announced the resignation, a fierce bipartisan effort to cast Mr. Spencer out of office had taken shape. It was clear that he would face sustained public and private pressure, and black lawmakers had planned a state Capitol news conference for Wednesday morning to demand that Mr. Spencer step aside. State Senator Lester Jackson, a Democrat from Savannah and the chairman of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, had vowed that he and other colleagues could not “continue to tolerate the well-documented and outright bigotry and reprehensible conduct” by Mr. Spencer. But Mr. Spencer faced some of the most intense condemnation from his own party, whose leaders, despite being focused on the final days of a contested primary runoff for governor, sensed deep political risk in a fast-growing state.

"OSTERSUND, Sweden — A Swedish student activist stopped the deportation of an Afghan man this week by refusing to take her seat on a packed Turkish Airlines flight, and her dramatic video of the tense standoff has gone viral. The student, Elin Ersson, initially bought a ticket because she believed that a 26-year-old man from Afghanistan was being deported to Kabul from Landvetter Airport in Gothenburg via Istanbul. When she got on the plane, the 26-year-old was not there, but an Afghan deportee in his 50s was with the Swedish authorities. Ms. Ersson, 21, live-streamed the standoff on the flight late Monday on Facebook, and footage of the 14-minute video shows her in tears, at times being confronted by crew members and angry passengers. But she also garnered some support. “I’m not going to sit down until this person is off the plane,” she says in the video, “because he is most likely to get killed if he is on this plane when it goes up.” As Ms. Ersson narrates the video — which had 2.7 million views as of Wednesday afternoon — a male voice with an English accent can be heard calling her “frightening” and telling her to think of the children on the flight. “I am doing what I can to save a person’s life,” she responds. “As long as a person is standing up, the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation, and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal, and I have not committed a crime.” "
"Reba McEntire, Cher, Philip Glass and Wayne Shorter will receive this year’s Kennedy Center Honors, the annual Washington distinction for artists who have made extraordinary contributions to culture. And in a first for the 41-year history of the awards, which have always gone to individuals, the Broadway musical “Hamilton” will receive a special honor. “I believe that this is a work that has transformed how we think about using art to talk about who we are as a society,” Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, said in an interview. Though typically a nonpartisan event, and one of the highlights of the Washington social calendar, the Kennedy Center honors presentation has not escaped the politicization of entertainment since the 2016 election. Last year, with a couple of the honorees, including the television producer Norman Lear, expressing discomfort with the president, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, withdrew from attending, “to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction,” marking just the fourth time a president missed the event. It is still unclear if the Trumps will attend this year; the White House referred questions to Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, who said it was too early to say. At least two of the honorees have criticized Mr. Trump, as has Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton.” A representative for Cher, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has compared the president to Hitler, did not return a request for comment. But in a statement through the Kennedy Center, she said, “When I was very young, I saw ‘Dumbo’ and ‘Cinderella’ and knew then what I wanted to be and the path my life would take and here I am! I am very grateful to the Kennedy Center.” "
"CHICAGO — For nearly five decades, the Title X family planning program has provided much needed funding for reproductive health care for millions of uninsured and underinsured people, covering basic services from cancer screenings to contraception to treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Now, the Trump administration is proposing a so-called domestic gag rule that would strictly limit how clinics that get this funding can refer patients for safe, legal abortions. Under the proposal, clinics will face a choice: either adhere to unacceptable restrictions on how they practice medicine or be cut off from funding that allows them to provide for millions of patients. As a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, I can attest that this proposal is bad medicine; as a medical ethicist, I can also affirm it is an assault on both the patient-provider relationship and the autonomy of patients and health care providers. The consequences of the proposed rule, which is open for public comment through July 31, go beyond abortion access: It would greatly restrict patient access to effective and necessary services, from contraception to preventive care. The rule demands physical and financial separation requirements between areas that use Title X funding and those that use nonfederal funds to provide abortion services — separate physical spaces, accounting records, health records, phone numbers and more — demands that seem intended to make it impossible for clinics to operate effectively. The proposed rule is clearly an attack on Planned Parenthood, which cares for over 40 percent of Title X patients. But it also violates a more fundamental tenet of medical care: that providers be able to counsel patients about their medical options free from external interference by politically motivated rules that aren’t based on evidence. For several years, I worked at a Title X-funded clinic on the West Side of Chicago, caring primarily for patients who lacked insurance. I saw firsthand what it meant for people to have access to both preventive care and providers who were able to counsel them effectively — and what it meant when they didn’t.   I remember one patient in particular.  She was in her late 30s, and uninsured. She came to our clinic with an unintended pregnancy. She had been told, inaccurately,  that because of a medical condition, no method of hormonal birth control was safe, so she relied on condoms alone; in other words, she had received the sort of misinformation that Title X-funded clinics can help to combat.

"The police have made an arrest in connection with the destruction of President Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this week by a man with a pickax. A suspect, who has been identified as Austin Clay, 24, was arrested on Wednesday and released early Thursday morning, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Department’s online records. He had been held on bail of $20,000 on a charge of felony vandalism, Officer Ray Brown, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said. It is not clear who posted bail for Mr. Clay. James Otis, 54, who attempted to remove Mr. Trump’s star by smashing it with a pickax and sledgehammer in October 2016, said he had rushed to Mr. Clay’s aid but missed his mark — by the time he had arrived to help, Mr. Clay had already been released. The administrator of a GoFundMe page billed as raising money for the bail did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Clay’s next court date will be Aug. 15. “He’s a young kid,” Mr. Otis said by phone. “I’m sure he was very angry about something Trump had done. I wanted to help him because I had been in his footsteps a few years earlier. He’s got a lot to deal with.” Mr. Otis said he plans to help Mr. Clay find a lawyer or help out in any way that he can. Mr. Otis pleaded no contest to felony vandalism in February 2017. He agreed to pay $4,400 for the damage, and was sentenced to three years’ probation and 20 days of community service. "
"WASHINGTON — Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, told skeptical senators on Wednesday that the Trump administration has taken a truckload of punitive actions against Moscow as “proof” it is tough on Russia as the White House walked back an invitation for President Vladimir V. Putin to visit Washington this fall. Yet during a combative three-hour Senate hearing, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly declined to provide specifics about a one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Mr. Putin last week in Helsinki, Finland — including the possibility of relaxing sanctions on Moscow, military cooperation in Syria or the future of Crimea. Mr. Pompeo angrily dismissed questions about the deep gulf between the administration’s tough policies on Russia and Mr. Trump’s own warm statements about Mr. Putin. “You somehow disconnect the administration’s activities from the president’s actions,” Mr. Pompeo told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “They’re one and the same.” And for the first time, Mr. Pompeo acknowledged that North Korea is continuing to produce nuclear fuel for its weapons program, even as the administration claims progress toward the goal of denuclearization. “Yes, they continue to produce fissile material,” he told the committee, using the term for nuclear material that can be used in a bomb.

"This year’s Venice Film Festival will include new movies by Paul Greengrass, Alfonso Cuarón and the Coen Brothers, the festival announced at a news conference on Thursday. The 75th edition of the event opens on Aug. 29 and runs through Sept. 8. Damien Chazelle’s “First Man” — his first feature since the Oscar-winning “La La Land” — will open the festival. It stars Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong, and tells the story of the astronaut’s race to become the first person to walk on the moon. Other highly anticipated films in the lineup include “The Sisters Brothers,” a comedy Western starring Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal; Rick Alverson’s “The Mountain,” starring Jeff Goldblum as a doctor who performs lobotomies; and the British director Mike Leigh’s “Peterloo,” about a notorious massacre of political protesters in 19th-century England. Those films are among 20 that will compete for the Golden Lion prize for best film. They will appear alongside television series, documentaries and a host of other movies that are not competing for that main prize. "
"WASHINGTON — Just before Election Day, when The Wall Street Journal uncovered a secret deal by The National Enquirer to buy the silence of a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Donald J. Trump, his campaign issued a flat denial. “We have no knowledge of any of this,” Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the newspaper. She said the claim of an affair was “totally untrue.” Then last week, when The New York Times revealed the existence of a recorded conversation about the very payment Mr. Trump denied knowing about, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, described the recording as “exculpatory” — suggesting it would actually help Mr. Trump if it became public. Finally, the tape has become public. And it revealed the statements by Ms. Hicks and Mr. Giuliani to be false. The recording, which was broadcast by CNN late Tuesday night, shows Mr. Trump was directly involved in talks about whether to pay The Enquirer for the rights to the woman’s story. The recording, and the repeated statements it contradicts, is a stark example of how Mr. Trump and his aides have used falsehoods as a shield against tough questions and unflattering coverage. Building upon his repeated cry of “fake news,” he told supporters this week not to believe the news. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening,” the president added. "
"WASHINGTON — Melania Trump has freedom over her own remote control. Though the standard operating procedure on Air Force One now requires televisions on board to be tuned to Fox, the president’s preferred channel, Mrs. Trump ultimately has freedom over what she watches, the East Wing said Wednesday. The statement was delivered in response to a report in The New York Times describing the president’s displeasure over Mrs. Trump’s television being tuned to CNN on the first couple’s recent European trip. In a statement sent to CNN, the first lady’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said that it was “kind of silly” to ask what the first lady watches on TV, then added, in parenthesis, “any channel she wants.” The statement is consistent with one message the East Wing has tried to drive home on behalf of Mrs. Trump over the past year and a half. She has repeatedly directed her aides to declare that she operates independently of her husband. Examples abound. The separate events held on her trip through Europe with Mr. Trump earlier this month? “Mrs. Trump looks at her role independently,” Ms. Grisham said of activities that included visiting children and playing lawn bowls in London with the prime minister’s husband. The events the first lady held throughout the spring in her efforts to end bullying, despite being told to focus on something less controversial given her husband’s pugilistic tendencies? “Of course she knows there is going to be criticism, but she is an independent woman,” Ms. Grisham told reporters. The concern over the first lady’s health after a weeklong hospital stay and weeks out of the public eye? “Mrs. Trump has always been a strong and independent woman who puts her family, and certainly her health, above all else, and that won’t change over a rabid press corps,” Ms. Grisham said in June. And what about that jacket, inscribed with “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” that Mrs. Trump wore on the way to visit children held in detention centers near the United States border? “No one tells the first lady what to do,” Ms. Grisham said. “Our office has nothing to do with what clothing choices she makes and this situation was no different.” As far as the first lady’s channel-changing independence goes, Mrs. Trump and her office stay abreast of coverage of the White House, particularly anything about the East Wing. And she has said in the past that she prefers fictional TV dramas. She is a fan of the show “Empire,” and enjoys the Shonda Rhimes-created drama “How to Get Away With Murder.” She does not enjoy reality TV. On Wednesday, Ms. Grisham did not answer a question from The New York Times asking if Mrs. Trump agreed with her husband that his supporters should not believe what they hear in the news. "
"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposed on Wednesday to curtail Obama administration loan forgiveness rules for students defrauded by for-profit colleges, requiring that student borrowers show they have fallen into hopeless financial straits or prove that their colleges knowingly deceived them. The DeVos proposal, set to go in force a year from now, would replace Obama-era policies that sought to ease access to loan forgiveness for students who were left saddled with debt after two for-profit college chains, Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, imploded in 2015 and 2016. The schools were found to have misled their students with false advertisements and misleading claims for years. Afterward, the Obama administration forgave hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans and began rewriting regulations to crack down on predatory institutions and bolster borrowers’ ability to seek debt relief from the federal government. But higher education institutions, including historically black colleges and universities and for-profit educators, maintained the new rules were far too broad and subjected them to frivolous claims that carried significant financial risks. In June 2017, just one month before the Obama rules were to take effect, Ms. DeVos announced that she would block and rewrite them. Now the Trump administration is proposing new rules that would require borrowers to prove that they have fallen into deep financial distress to file a claim for debt relief, or to prove that the higher education institutions they attended had intentionally misled them. The department would also require that relief applicants divulge personal information that could have impacted their job prospects beyond their college experiences, including drug test results, health concerns and performance evaluations. The proposal would establish a federal standard for what constitutes “misrepresentation” on the part of institutions, requiring that claims show “reckless disregard” through false or deceptive claims. It would also impose penalties on institutions that show signs of poor financial health, such as a high number of loan defaults or court judgments. "
"WASHINGTON — A lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by maintaining a financial interest in his company’s Washington hotel cleared a critical hurdle on Wednesday when a federal judge allowed the case to move forward. In the first judicial opinion to define how the meaning of the Constitution’s anticorruption clauses should apply to a president, Judge Peter J. Messitte of the United States District Court in Greenbelt, Md., said the framers’ language should be broadly construed as an effort to protect against influence-peddling by state and foreign governments. He ruled that the lawsuit should proceed to the evidence-gathering stage, which could clear the way for an examination of financial records that the president has consistently refused to disclose. The Justice Department is expected to forestall that by seeking an emergency stay and appealing the ruling. The two constitutional clauses at issue restrict a president’s ability to accept financial benefits or “emoluments” from domestic or foreign governments, other than his official salary. No federal judge before has ever interpreted what those bans mean for the president. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland, say that Mr. Trump is violating those bans by accepting profits from the Trump International Hotel, a five-star hotel just blocks from the White House that is frequented by foreign and state officials. The judge earlier ruled that the local jurisdictions had standing to sue because the Trump hotel arguably siphons off business from their convention centers or hotels. Mr. Trump has resisted efforts to force him to provide more details about his personal finances, and in particular has refused to release his tax returns. Questions about Mr. Trump’s possible business dealings in Russia or with Russians have come up in connection with the inquiry being conducted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. "
"For a business that concerns itself with fit and figure flattery, it has taken the fashion industry an unusually — some might say, unforgivably — long time to recognize the obvious fact that we are not all the same size. Worse, labels that did address those who are size 14 and over were relegated to a category all their own, as if they were not part of mainstream fashion. Now, however, a handful of pioneering companies are changing that pattern with inclusive sizing that covers both ends of the spectrum. Best of all, these labels don’t make a big show of it. They simply make cool clothes in a variety of sizes. Introduced in 2015, Universal Standard’s mission was simple: Make shopping as fun, and accessible, for a size 26 as it is for a size 6. The founders, Alexandra Waldman and Polina Veksler, thought that approach was sorely missing, even as the industry grapples with the fact that 67 percent of women in the United States wear a size 14 or above. “A lot of brands still think the solution to the problem is to launch a plus-size category,” Ms. Waldman said. “That is not the answer. We need to stop segregating women into two groups because the truth of the matter is that it’s not so much a size thing, but a style thing.” Ms. Waldman noted that the clothes being designed for women in double-digit sizes do not have the level of design or quality of smaller sizes. “It’s mostly a semi-disposable, hodgepodge of fast fashion,” she said. Universal Standard aims to bring the same attention to style, fit and fabric as any other contemporary label — an aspirational aesthetic that’s size accessible. It’s no wonder the label caught the attention of J. Crew, which collaborated on a summer capsule collection that’s as sophisticated as it is wearable. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Promises $12 Billion in Aid to Prop Up Farms” (front page, July 25): America’s hard-working agricultural producers deserve guaranteed access to markets, not government handouts. If President Trump believes  that his tariffs are the right move, he should be strong enough to persuade farmers of their wisdom or weather the political consequences, as opposed to buying them off with taxpayer money. Nic Arp
Iowa City To the Editor: Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, calls President Trump’s promise of $12 billion to America’s farmers “gold crutches,” a political payoff to limit the pain from Mr. Trump’s trade war.  A better analogy comes from your article on the taped conversation between the president and Michael Cohen about hush money for the Playboy model Karen McDougal (“Cohen Releases Tape of Trump, Adding to Feud,” front page, July 25). The president’s M.O. is consistent. In both cases, he turns to financial payments to try to get out of trouble and minimize personal damage. In Ms. McDougal’s case, we don’t know who fronted the hush money. In the case of the farmers, we do: It will come from you and me in order to buy a key Trump constituency’s silence, loyalty and votes. Richard Kazis

"Fewer than 50 pages into Beth Macy’s “Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company That Addicted America,” one of the many opioid users she talks to — this one a mother in Virginia — explains how her addiction started in the early 2000s, after routine gallbladder surgery. “The doctor didn’t force me to take them,” she said of OxyContin and Percocet, two powerful painkillers she was instructed to take concurrently. But her doctor, she assumed, was a “high-standard person, someone you’re supposed to trust and believe in.” If you want a glimpse into how the opioid crisis began, the woman’s words are a good place to start. She was aware of her own choice in the matter, but her physician instructed her to double up on highly addictive narcotics. An expert, someone supposed to know better, had betrayed her trust. Books like “Pain Killer,” by Barry Meier, a reporter for The New York Times, and “Dreamland,” by the journalist Sam Quinones, have covered the opioid crisis in detail, but they appeared before the 2016 election, when the places in the country most affected by the epidemic went for Trump. With “Dopesick,” her third book after “Factory Man” and “Truevine,” Macy has waded into a public health morass that has also become a political minefield. Commentators on the left have pointed out the gaping discrepancy between the sympathy extended to today’s opioid users, who are mainly white, and the brutal, racist handling of the war on crack. “Dopesick” touches on these political developments, but its emphasis lies elsewhere. Macy’s strengths as a reporter are on full display when she talks to people, gaining the trust of chastened users, grieving families, exhausted medical workers and even a convicted heroin dealer, whose scheduled two-hour interview with the author ended up stretching to more than six hours. Macy captures an Appalachian landscape in a state of emergency and in the grip of disillusionment, but there’s little here that’s new. Indeed, that’s part of her point — not enough has changed. Like Quinones and Meier, she traces the beginning of the current epidemic to 1996, when Purdue Pharma released OxyContin with the claim (preposterous in hindsight) that its new pills would be less addictive than other opioids on the market. Yes, OxyContin contained more medication than the others, but its time-release formula (the “contin” was pharma-speak for “continuous”) would frustrate an impatient addict looking for a quick high. "
"Workers may finally be getting a bigger piece of the economic pie — at least in Europe. Just don’t ask why, or whether it will last. In the decade since the financial crisis, much of the global economy has recovered and is back on stable footing. Companies are reporting record profits, unemployment levels are plummeting and overall global growth is back on track. Wages in most developed countries, however, have barely budged. The economic puzzle has ramifications for global political as well as financial stability. Resentment among middle- and lower-class workers, and the feeling they were not getting a fair share of economic growth, helped elect Donald J. Trump and contributed to the rise of right-wing parties in parts of Europe. “This is one of the big economic questions of our time,” said Ángel Talavera, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London. Europe may offer an exception to that trend. Wages in the eurozone are rising again after years of stagnation, a welcome development not only for working people but also for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. The central bank has been pulling out all the stops to push inflation back toward a level considered healthy for growth. But wage increases are effectively a prerequisite for sustained inflation, and, until recently, the bank had been frustrated by the failure of eurozone citizens’ paychecks to rise along with strong economic growth. "
"My fellow Americans: It is my honor today to announce the formation of a new political party, which I am calling “the Republican Party.” You can be forgiven for thinking, Wait, don’t we already have one of those? But please. Under Donald Trump, the Republican Party, at least as we once understood it, has become a fantastical entity, a creature not wholly unlike the Abominable Snowman, or the Chupacabra, or the mythical Squonk of central Pennsylvania, the imaginary creature that spends its days deep in the forest, weeping in despair at its own hideousness. “There is no Republican Party,” said John Boehner, a former Republican speaker of the House, back in April. “There’s a Trump Party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.” While the Republican Party naps, the thing that has arisen in its place bears an eerie resemblance to another party in American history, one that we thought was gone for good. But more about that in a moment. In the meantime, I’d like to present the platform of my new Republican Party. It consists of things formerly believed by, you know, the Republican Party. "
"Good morning on this stillrainy Wednesday. Among the ways to get around this city — rickshaw, subway, scooter, ferry — we now have one more option: dockless bikes. Over the last week or so, more than 300 free-standing bikes were rolled out in the Rockaways, and more are on their way this weekend. The bikes are part of the city’s dockless bike-share pilot — think Citi Bike without the parking spot — and they will be installed in the Bronx, southern Brooklyn and Staten Island in the coming months. Using the bikes is a breeze. We spent the day yesterday testing them out at the beach. When we stepped out of the Beach 90th Street subway station at Rockaway Beach, we found one of the bikes waiting for us. There appeared to be one on every nearby block — parked in front of bakeries, playgrounds and up and down the boardwalk. To ride, we downloaded separate apps from Pace and Lime (the two operators), signed up for accounts, flipped up kickstands and off we went. The bikes are much the same, but Pace bikes require that you lock them to a designated bike rack or pole, while Lime bikes must be left in designated zones. Both Pace and Lime’s bikes cost $1 every 30 minutes. If you want to try them out, we suggest this weekend when Lime will be adding 100 pedal-assist bikes to its fleet. (Legislation allowing them in the city goes into effect on Saturday.) The bikes make pedaling easier and allow riders to travel faster and farther with less energy. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump abruptly announced on Thursday that the United States would impose “large sanctions” on Turkey for detaining an American pastor accused of aiding a failed coup attempt there in 2016, escalating a bitter dispute among the two NATO allies. Mr. Trump’s declaration on Twitter appeared to be more of a muscular threat than an official statement of policy; the administration made no announcement of specific punitive measures against the Turkish government, and the White House declined to provide any details about the steps it was ready to take. It came one day after Andrew Brunson, 50, an evangelical pastor who has been imprisoned in Turkey for 21 months, was moved from jail to house arrest because of health concerns. Mr. Brunson is one of 20 Americans charged after the failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. His case has elevated tensions between the United States and Turkey even as Mr. Trump has sought warmer relations with Mr. Erdogan. On Thursday, Mr. Trump ratcheted up the pressure for Mr. Brunson’s immediate release, telling Mr. Erdogan in a private phone call that the pastor’s continued imprisonment was unacceptable, according to a White House official who described the conversation on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly. And the president vowed on Twitter to impose substantial sanctions on Turkey for Mr. Brunson’s detention. "
"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday gave the green light to a lawsuit seeking to block the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying plaintiffs had made a plausible case that the move was a deliberate attempt by the White House to discriminate against immigrants. The ruling, by United States District Judge Jesse M. Furman in Manhattan, set the stage for a trial this fall that is expected to delve into how and why the Trump administration decided in March to add a question to the next census about citizenship status. The plaintiffs, which include state and local governments and advocacy groups, claim that asking residents to verify their citizenship would “fatally undermine” the accuracy of the head count because both legal and undocumented immigrants would refuse to fill out the form. A reduced count in areas with large immigrant populations could reduce Democratic representation when new state and congressional districts are drawn in 2021, and skew the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and other spending. Judge Furman rejected a claim that Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who made the decision to add the question to the census form, lacked the authority to do so. But the judge said the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ross’s actions, including his shifting explanation of what he did and why, raised questions about his true intent. Mr. Ross originally said he acted at the request of the Justice Department, which he said needed better citizenship data to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But he later admitted — and Commerce Department documents confirmed — that he had discussed the citizenship question with administration officials from almost the beginning of his tenure in the department, and that he or his aides had asked the Justice Department to request that the question be added. "
"It didn’t take long last week for President Trump to blast America’s latest economic foe, the European Union, for imposing a $5.1 billion antitrust fine on Google’s parent company. “I told you so!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Calling Google one of “our great companies,” he asserted that the European Union “has truly taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!” Let’s put aside the fact that Google controls more than 90 percent of the internet search market in most of the union’s member states, according to the European Commission (compared with just 63.5 percent of the market in the United States). That makes it hard to argue that the Europeans have somehow “taken advantage” of Google. But on the merits of the antitrust case, Mr. Trump has a point. It’s hard to find any antitrust expert, European or American, who has endorsed the logic or outcome of the ruling by the European Commission. The commission, which is the union’s executive arm and oversees its competition policy and antitrust law, found that Google had run afoul of those regulations in several respects. But the heart of the decision involved Google’s insistence that mobile phone manufacturers that use its Android operating system and want to preinstall the Google Play app store must also install a suite of Google apps, including the company’s search engine, its Chrome browser and its mapping, calendar and photo programs. "
"WASHINGTON — Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a powerful hard-line conservative who has been embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal from his days as a college wrestling coach, announced on Thursday that he will run to succeed Paul D. Ryan as House speaker. Mr. Jordan’s bid is sure to roil the already shaky succession of power that Mr. Ryan set in motion when he announced that he would retire at the end of the year. Publicly, Republican leaders have backed the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California. Privately, some Republicans have said Mr. McCarthy would not be able to unite the fractious party, and the No. 3 Republican in the House, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, is waiting in the wings. Now comes the divisive figure of Mr. Jordan, who has the backing of the small but important House Freedom Caucus, which he founded, and outside conservative groups that have been pushing him to run. He has divided Republicans repeatedly with his aggressive tactics, most recently this week by filing articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. Mr. Ryan responded Thursday by saying he would not back the action, and the House left for its monthlong August recess without taking it up. “I don’t think we should be cavalier with this process or with this term,” the speaker told reporters. “I don’t think that this rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.” But in some sense, the political damage to Republicans was done. Looking for a foil ahead of the midterm elections, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, latched on, suggesting that conservatives had moved to impeach Mr. Rosenstein merely to divert attention from the former college wrestlers who have accused Mr. Jordan of knowing about sexual misconduct at Ohio State University and doing nothing.

"To the Editor: Re “Pompeo Defends President as Being Harsh With Russia” (news article, July 26): Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is no wallflower. He’s a West Point graduate, at the top of his class, and I remember his grilling then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her 11 hours of testimony on the Benghazi hearings when he was a representative. His questions were withering, but Mrs. Clinton held her own and then some. So I expected Mr. Pompeo to be a bulldog in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But I also expected a fierce pushback from the senators on that committee. These men and women are our elected representatives, and I expect them to react to stonewalling by breaking through that wall — although I do applaud Senator Bob Corker for his principled stand as committee chairman. Mr. Pompeo’s performance was pompous and sarcastic. He was incredibly disrespectful to duly elected officials, and he was among their ranks at one time! He referred to backing up a truck with documents to prove Donald Trump’s zeal in holding Russia accountable. The only truck I want backing up is a moving van to the White House door. Len DiSesa

"To the Editor: Re “The Truth About ‘Trump Country,’” by Sarah Smarsh (Op-Ed, July 20): People’s use of the convenient “Trump country” label to describe the states that voted for the president not only lacks nuance, but is also a subliminal tool of differentiation and condescension that only exacerbates the growing urban and rural divide that plagues America. This term is wielded to write off these places as just aberrations from what supposedly smart and sane politics would yield. It contributes to the sentiment on the left that these people in rural areas who voted for a perceived huckster and demagogue are a lost cause, that now that these people cast their lot with this man, it is beyond conceivable to engage with them, understand them and empathize with them. This notion is pervasive, but for Democrats to take back the Midwest and make inroads in the South, it must be expunged. Tyler Coady
Nashville To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh misses the mark in blaming the media for its alleged one-dimensional portrait of the working class. “Elites” are fully aware that people of color actually make up a good bit of the working class. That Trump supporters do not all rant about race or immigration does not absolve them of attaching themselves to a demagogue who does, to say nothing of the misogyny, disrespect for veterans and public servants, willful ignorance of world affairs and other disgraces. It is time to stop blaming “liberals” for the ascent of Donald Trump. His supporters (and enablers) got us into this mess and continue to abide his venality. As Ms. Smarsh acknowledges, not all Trump voters — even in the heartland — fit the working-class stereotype. Many of them are well educated, gainfully employed, Chardonnay-drinking professionals with summer homes and are set for life. In a word, elites. Helene Kopal
Katonah, N.Y. To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh notes a rise in populism, not just on America’s right wing, but the socialist left wing as well. As a psychologist I am privileged to hear people’s uncensored opinions about the world in the context of their lives. Almost everyone I speak to believes he or she is being victimized by “big business” or “big government,” depending on which cable news stations they watch. The problem is not with business or government itself, but how “big” institutions tend to objectify people. As these institutions continue to grow in influence, over Trump country and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez country, so will populism on both sides grow. John G. Cottone
Stony Brook, N.Y. To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh is caught in the very trap she accuses “the college-educated white liberals” of being in. She seems to assume that the white liberal elite is monolithic and thinks that working-class folks wield bats and belittle women. Her whole premise is off. The college-educated folks in this country are as varied across the board as those with just a high school degree. Her specious argument is unhelpful to the healthy discussion this country desperately needs to have about its future. Margaret A. Lambert

"MUMBAI, India — Last year, the Trump administration blocked a Chinese company from buying an Ohio-based aluminum maker, Aleris, citing concerns about national security. Will President Trump and his advisers feel differently about an Indian company purchasing Aleris instead? On Thursday, one of India’s biggest industrial conglomerates, the Aditya Birla Group, announced that its aluminum and copper subsidiary had struck a deal to buy Aleris for $2.6 billion, including the assumption of existing debt. The transaction would make the Birla subsidiary, called Hindalco, the second-largest aluminum producer in the world by volume, after China Hongqiao Group. Under federal rules, the deal requires approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a secretive panel of government officials that advises the president on whether to stop acquisitions of American companies by foreigners. In recent years, the panel, known as Cfius, has been particularly skeptical of Chinese companies seeking to buy American businesses in important industries like computer chips and financial services.

"To the Editor: In “A Case Against Marijuana,” by David Leonhardt (Opinion Today newsletter, July 20), we’re told that more marijuana research is needed. Here’s all the research you need: Marijuana use in America has been widespread for over 50 years. If there were any alarming social or health effects, we’d know by now. There’s no justification for America’s draconian marijuana laws. Marijuana as a societal ill, when measured against alcohol, tobacco, sugar, guns, driving, climate change, Donald Trump and fast food, comes out looking like a breath of fresh air.

"The Commerce Department recently asked for public comments on the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. When the deadline for submissions hit, more than 2,000 individuals, businesses and organizations had had their say. The vast majority were opposed to the tariffs. Following are edited excerpts from some of those comments. During the Great Recession of 2007-2009, Honda did not lay off any of its full-time permanent associates in the U.S., and we have continued to increase our employment numbers since then. If the concern is that imports are damaging the national economy, Section 232 [of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962] is not the right tool to address the problem. There is an arsenal of weapons in U.S. trade law that enable the government to address economic risk. Actions can be brought for dumping, countervailing duties, patent infringement and safeguard protections, to name a few. VWGoA [Volkswagen Group of America] does not see how continuing imports of automobiles and automotive parts at current levels could impair U.S. national security. This proposition — supported by no U.S. motor vehicle manufacturer — is implausible. VWGoA’s plant has created 12,400 full-time jobs in Tennessee and helped attract 17 supplier companies to the Chattanooga area. These supplier companies in turn have invested over $275 million in Tennessee and, in so doing, created an additional 1,100 jobs. VWGoA’s manufacturing operations likewise have increased local and state tax revenues by $53.5 million annually. "

Here’s what you need to know: • “We’re going to run Pakistan in a way it’s never been run before.” Imran Khan, a former cricket star and fierce critic of the U.S., addressed the nation after early election results showed his party decisively ahead, and put him on the cusp of becoming prime minister of the nuclear-armed nation. Mr. Khan vowed to fight corruption, improve relations with China and seek “mutually beneficial” ties with the U.S. He said he would create a just welfare state, as the Prophet Muhammad did centuries ago. Above, an election rally in Karachi this week. The extent of Pakistan’s poverty, he said, would keep him from ever living in the prime minister’s mansion. “I would be embarrassed,” he said. Friends and foes alike describe Mr. Khan as relentless, charming and highly unpredictable. Yet his links to the powerful Pakistani military have drawn concern: Rights groups said the army and intelligence officers pressured, threatened and blackmailed rival politicians. _____ "
"Frank Bruni, a Times Op-Ed columnist, hosted an online conversation with two prominent Democrats: Representative Tim Ryan, a congressman from Ohio; and Jane Harman, the director and president of the Wilson Center and a former congresswoman from California. They discussed the challenges and opportunities that the 2018 midterms pose for Democrats. Frank Bruni: The week began with a few polls that show that Democrats have an advantage of over 10 percentage points when voters are asked if they theoretically prefer to vote for a Democrat or a Republican in a House race. Is a blue wave on the way? Jane Harman: I’ve seen lots of waves crest a week before the election. Democrats need to have a strong, positive message. Bruni: And are you hearing such a message, or is the party still fumbling around for it? Harman: Democrats announced a strong economic message (“a better deal”) early in the year, but it hasn’t gotten much traction. Sadly, most of the rhetoric is focused on how bad the Republican leadership is in Congress and the enormous number of mixed messages by the administration. Bruni: Few congressional primary-race victors have received as much attention, and generated as much big-picture debate, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What does and what doesn’t she say about the Democratic Party right now and about its best course to win the House? Tim Ryan: As someone who at 29 years old took on two sitting Democratic members of Congress to get to Congress, I’m always inspired by the energy of the insurgent-type campaigns. We have many inspiring candidates, mostly women, running all over the country. To help end the corruption of the current political system. "
"Michael Lewis has spent his career excavating subjects that seem, at first glance, almost aggressively boring: esoteric areas like sabermetrics, heuristics, mortgage-backed securities and credit-default swaps, algorithmic trading based on high-frequency financial data, sovereign debt. No matter how arcane the material, he invariably finds some fascinating narrative thread to suck readers in. His latest work, about government bureaucracy, is no exception. “The Fifth Risk,” which W.W. Norton will publish in October, paints a dire picture of the chaos and mismanagement in the departments of Energy, Agriculture and Commerce during the transition from President Barack Obama to President Trump. Within these seemingly dull, benign bureaucratic systems, Mr. Lewis encountered devoted public servants struggling with understaffed and neglected agencies while confronting potentially catastrophic risks. In the Department of Energy, which oversees international nuclear risk, understaffing means there might not be enough inspectors to track down black market uranium. Proposed cuts within the Department of Agriculture could dilute critical anti-poverty programs like school lunches and food stamps. “I was shocked by the richness of the material,” Mr. Lewis said. “Buried in the middle of this is a civics lesson, for myself as much as anyone else.” The book began last year as a series of dispatches for Vanity Fair, where Mr. Lewis was a contributing writer for a decade. (He has since left the magazine and shifted his longform journalism to Audible, the audiobook producer and retailer). Mr. Lewis went to Washington to report on how different departments were adapting under the Trump administration. His dreary-sounding assignment was to study the material that had been prepared for political appointees coming in to head the departments under the new administration. (Agriculture employees, for example, had prepared a 13-volume overview of its programs that spanned 2,300 pages). He found it riveting. In another section, which will be released as an audio original by Audible next week, Mr. Lewis writes about the Department of Commerce, and efforts by AccuWeather chief executive Barry Myers, who has been nominated to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to privatize weather forecasting. [ Read more about how Mr. Lewis and other best-selling authors who are writing audio originals ] Although he’s covered political campaigns, writing about the inner workings of government was a first for Mr. Lewis, who is best known for narrative page-turners like “Moneyball” and “The Big Short.” He says he approached it the same way he’s infiltrated other seemingly impenetrable institutions. “It’s not that different from writing about Wall Street, these big, gray institutions that are suddenly interesting,” he said. “From a literary point of view, Trump has electrified the material by the threat of neglect and mismanagement on a scale that we haven’t seen before.” "

"Gender Letter is a weekly take on news and culture. Tell me what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. My friend’s question was simple: Are there any foods that help ease the intensity of hot flashes? She went online hoping to find a community of women who could help her navigate a transition — menopause — that half the population will experience. What she found instead were recommendations for drugstore supplements like ginseng and ... tofu. I was surprised, but I shouldn’t have been. Women’s health issues and biological processes have long been shrouded in secrecy and shame. Who among us hasn’t hidden our pad or tampon wrappers under a wad of toilet paper, lest we appear unattractive or messy? The result: We feel alone, often at a young age, when we are anything but.

"When President Trump accused Twitter of “shadow banning” Republicans in a tweet on Thursday morning, it was the latest salvo in a long-running debate over whether social media platforms suppress conservative users because of their political views. The president’s tweet came a day after a widely circulated article published by Vice News said that Twitter was shadow banning “prominent Republicans.” But many in the tech world said the Vice story — which was shared by prominent conservatives on Twitter, including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy; James O’Keefe; and Donald Trump Jr.  — was based on a misunderstanding of the concept of shadow banning that could make an already tense debate more acrimonious. So, what is going on here? What is shadow banning? Was Twitter actually doing it? Why is the president involved? We’ve got you covered. When a person is shadow banned, their posts on a platform are rendered essentially invisible to everyone but themselves. Their experience using a site may not change — they feel like they are still posting normally — but other people cannot see the material they produce, said Monica Stephens, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies social media. “Shadow banning is when you are algorithmically being kind of shut down, and that often has to do with, particularly, the content that you are posting,” Ms. Stephens said. “Maybe it doesn’t violate the terms of service, but they make it so other people can’t see that content.” "
"WASHINGTON — When he ran against Donald J. Trump in 2016 for the Republican presidential nomination, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky quipped that “a speck of dirt would make a better president” than the bombastic businessman from New York. Then came President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, his government’s interference in a White House campaign in which Mr. Paul barely made a ripple and last week’s presidential summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, which pretty much everyone but Mr. Paul deemed a diplomatic disaster. Suddenly, in the mind of the junior senator from Kentucky, Mr. Trump has soared from lower than that speck of dirt to high enough for Mount Rushmore. “The hatred for the president is so intense that partisans would rather risk war than give diplomacy a chance,” Mr. Paul fumed on the Senate floor last week in a long defense of Mr. Trump’s Helsinki meeting. “This is crazy.” As the lonely Senate voice extolling Mr. Trump’s diplomatic acumen, Mr. Paul has become the commander in chief’s wingman. He has nabbed broad visibility for views once deemed fringe, and coveted White House access: “Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it!” the president tweeted. It was the senator’s idea to suspend the security clearances of Mr. Trump’s political enemies, an idea embraced at the lectern by the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Growing up here in the 1970s, Kyungah Ham would occasionally find propaganda leaflets sent from North Korea via helium balloons. Like her classmates, Ms. Ham turned in the leaflets at school, where she was given a reward for doing a small part in South Korea’s simmering ideological war with its neighbor. In 2008, when Ms. Ham found another North Korean leaflet — this one under the gate of her parents’ home — it felt like an alien object, blown in from a different planet. By then, she was a multimedia artist who had come to distrust much of the history she’d been taught, and she knew that South Koreans were sending leaflets of their own over the border. That got her wondering: Could she communicate directly with people who, through a geopolitical tragedy now 65 years old, she is forbidden to contact? It was the birth of what might be the art world’s most extraordinary, ongoing collaboration. For a decade, Ms. Ham has been producing designs on her computer that are printed and smuggled into North Korea through intermediaries based in Russia or China. Then a group of anonymous artisans, whom she has never met or spoken to, are paid to convert them into embroideries, using exquisitely fine stitching. With bribes and subterfuge, the works are smuggled back out. Ultimately, they are shown and sold at galleries and exhibitions. The most ambitious pieces are large-scale renderings of luminous, glittering chandeliers, some nearly 12 feet wide and 9 feet high, that from a distance look like photographs set against black backdrops. Get closer, and a filigree of stitches appear. Both chandelier and backdrop have been painstakingly composed of silk thread. On one level, her embroideries are an attempt to reunite through art people who were forcibly separated in 1953 through war. The work marries the strength of the South (technology) to the strength of the North (craftsmanship), and it is confected through a hazard-filled maze. "
"In his first inaugural address in 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio invoked the names of legendary reformers, from Fiorello La Guardia to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and said that in their honor and spirit, he would “commit to a new progressive direction in New York.” The anticipation for many of Mr. de Blasio’s supporters was particularly keen because it built on the sense that his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had presided over the city’s growth in a way that benefited the well-off and left the poor behind. But midway through his fifth year in office, Mr. de Blasio has disappointed some of his most loyal backers, who point to a range of issues, from criminal justice reform and homelessness to the protection of immigrants, where the mayor has fallen short of his promises. On Monday, Mr. de Blasio found himself having to explain why, after enacting a policy to end solitary confinement in city jails, the city Department of Correction increased the number of inmates shipped upstate, where they were put in solitary. He defended the actions as rare and necessary for safety. Other promises have also run up against reality. The city has not succeeded in opening new neighborhood-based homeless shelters as fast as Mr. de Blasio had vowed. His recurring pledge to raise taxes on high-earners has been dashed in Albany, where the mayor holds little sway and has been embroiled in a yearslong feud with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. "

"A powerful commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps escalated the invective duel with President Trump on Thursday, calling his threat against Iran’s president “cabaret-style rhetoric” in remarks that political analysts called worrisome. The commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who wields enormous influence in Iran, may emerge as its future leader and is considered a terrorist mastermind by the United States. He said that Mr. Trump should pick a fight directly with him and not Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. In a Twitter message on Sunday posted in all-capital letters, Mr. Trump warned Mr. Rouhani that he would suffer “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before” if he threatened the United States. Top aides to Mr. Rouhani dismissed Mr. Trump’s warning, apparently viewing it as an attempt by the American president to replicate his strategy of threats against another adversary, North Korea. But General Suleimani’s public challenge to Mr. Trump appeared to signal that the Iranian hierarchy felt obliged to send a more assertive reply. "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump called a truce with the European Union over trade, the general outlines of his plan sounded familiar. It echoed of earlier negotiations — the ones started under President Barack Obama and shelved by Mr. Trump last year. Mr. Trump, in many ways, is taking credit for solving a crisis of his own making. After taking office, he criticized the deals of his predecessor and cut off trade talks with the European Union. He raised the stakes by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, prompting retaliatory measures by the European Union. Then he stoked the tensions by calling Europe a “foe.” Now, Mr. Trump, in hashing out an agreement on Wednesday with president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, is declaring victory. He said the two sides would work to lower tariffs and other trade barriers. They would reduce bureaucratic roadblocks to industrial goods flowing across the Atlantic, while ending conflicting regulations for drugs and chemicals. The United States was pursuing much the same under Mr. Obama through a deal called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. And the collapse of the deal still smarts for large segments of American and European business who had fervently hoped to create a trans-Atlantic version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The European Union has repeatedly told the Trump administration that it would be happy to revive trade talks. “Most of the deal is stuff we were already on the verge of agreeing on in the T.T.I.P. negotiations, before that deal got deep-sixed after Trump’s election,” said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents exporters. “But at least the President is talking about more open trade instead of how great tariffs are.” Both European and American officials resisted comparisons to previous negotiations. But it was not immediately clear what would set the new talks apart from those carried out by the Obama administration, beyond their more limited scope. Unlike with the previous round of negotiations, European officials said that the agricultural sector would be excluded from a deal with the Trump administration. "
"We live in the age of extinction, a quiet catastrophe that surely ranks as one of the great ecological and moral crises of our time. The best tool for saving America’s imperiled animals and plants is the Endangered Species Act, first passed by Congress in 1973. But you wouldn’t know it from what’s been happening recently in the nation’s capital. Last week, the Trump administration proposed major changes to the law. Although some offered welcome clarifications and efficiencies, others would strike at the core of the law that now protects more than 2,000 threatened and endangered species, from the largest animal on the planet, the blue whale, to the Florida perforate cladonia, a two-inch lichen found only in the state. Among the most worrisome is a proposal that would allow cost considerations to influence whether a species qualifies for protection or should be left to its fate. Decisions are now based on the best available science, and references to economic impacts are prohibited. Introducing cost criteria would circumvent the science that keeps the listing process honest. The plan also would give the administration the discretion to  scale back protections for some species listed as threatened in future determinations. The administration’s proposal joins legislative efforts to retool the law. In examining them, we should ask two questions: Will these changes increase populations of endangered species, or at least slow their decline? And will they advance cooperation and reduce conflicts between the federal government and states, industries and landowners? Almost none of these recent proposals pass this test. Several weeks ago, Senator John Barrasso, a Republican of Wyoming, introduced perhaps the most comprehensive proposal in over a decade to retool the law. His bill promotes the longstanding desire of many, mostly Western, states to claim control over endangered species management. If it were to become law, the bill would hurt efforts to save many species. "
"Over 100 years ago, Coco Chanel transformed herself from peasant orphan into the founder of a fashion empire. She was the avatar of a new century — unmarried and independent, a woman who took lovers and took off her corset. Chanel’s alluring life became her most bankable commodity. Women clamored for Chanel products (or inexpensive imitations of them) not just for their sleek looks, but because those products seemed to grant entry into the designer’s enviable world. By turning her initials into a logo — those famous interlocking C’s — Chanel crystallized her marketable identity into a recognizable badge of prestige. Chanel invented a business model that fashion companies still use, wherein success depends as much on a glamorous life narrative as on particular garments. Within this model, which I call “immersive dreamscapes,” customers buy not just products but also aspirational identities. By acquiring merchandise bearing logos or signatures, they label themselves with the desired identity. Not coincidentally, Chanel’s movement peaked in influence between the two world wars, precisely as fascism became a pan-European force. Like luxury-logo fashion, fascism enticed followers with an alluring narrative about an exclusive world  (the myth of the superior Aryans)  and a logo  (the swastika)  betokening membership in that world. Chanel traveled in fascist circles and invented her double-C insignia in 1921, just one year after the Nazis adopted the swastika, which they treated like a fashion label, stamping it on jewelry, clothing, even lingerie, in addition to military uniforms. To be clear, wearing Chanel does not make one a Nazi. But the joint rise of her brand and fascism came about because both tapped into and manipulated certain all-too-human, paradoxical yearnings, particularly resonant at the time: to belong to a select elite and to lose oneself in a crowd, to conform. Chanel was deeply in dialogue with her era’s politics; as is Ivanka Trump. We can trace the descent of “dreamscape” businesses from Chanel, to Ralph Lauren (Bronx-born Ralph Lifshitz, peddling a dream world of polo-playing WASP privilege), through Tory Burch, directly to Ms. Trump, whose brand, which she announced this week was shutting down, employs both her full signature and an initial insignia, although her logo feels rather unmemorable. (Her “IT” motif bears a curious resemblance to back-to-back C’s.) "
"Prepare to be excited about a blockbuster economic report on Friday morning — but not too excited. Preliminary data from the Commerce Department is expected to show that United States gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in April through June. Some economists think growth may have topped 5 percent — a figure reached only once in the eight years of the Obama administration as the economy recovered from the recession. While he said he didn’t know the actual number, President Trump didn’t wait to herald the rosy news. At an event in Iowa on Thursday, he said he was expecting a very strong result, noting predictions that ran to 5 percent or higher. “It could be very close,” he said. “Could even happen.” “We’ll take anything with a four in front,” he added. [Update: On Friday the government said that the economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate last quarter.] Even a number starting with a four, though, will almost certainly be misleading. Several one-time factors — including a surge in exports tied, at least in part, to Mr. Trump’s trade policies — probably combined to pump up growth in the second quarter. Those effects won’t last, and economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Pretty much no one outside the White House thinks a growth rate of 4 percent is sustainable in the long term. Still, recent data does suggest that the pace of growth has picked up this year. Some economists think full-year growth in gross domestic product could hit 3 percent in 2018 for the first time since 2005. “The bottom line is that the economy is doing better,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton.

"SAN FRANCISCO — The finger-pointing over the scuttled $44 billion transaction between the chip makers Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors has begun. Richard Clemmer, chief executive of NXP, had some harsh words on Thursday for officials in China over the deal’s collapse amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The acquisition was terminated after it failed to secure regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before a deadline set by the companies at midnight Eastern time on Wednesday. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Clemmer said Chinese authorities gave no explanation for withholding approval for the transaction. He said that there were no government requirements or regulations that the deal did not meet, adding that Qualcomm and NXP had both agreed to undisclosed concessions to address antitrust concerns raised by Chinese authorities. “For the issues they raised, remedies were provided and they agreed on those remedies,” Mr. Clemmer said of Chinese officials. “There was no clear explanation of why they wouldn’t approve it.” Mr. Clemmer and NXP had tried for nearly two years to get the deal done. In 2016, Qualcomm and NXP had struck an agreement to combine. But the transaction could not be completed until it had obtained regulatory approval from nine jurisdictions. Eight of those, including the United States, had approved the deal; China had been the lone holdout. The situation was complicated by the Trump administration’s recent trade moves, including placing tariffs on numerous Chinese goods. Trade experts said Chinese authorities appeared to be withholding approval of the Qualcomm and NXP deal to gain negotiating leverage in retaliation. "
"A federal judge in Oregon issued a ruling this week in favor of transgender students, saying that forcing them to use restrooms that correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth would violate civil rights law. In a 56-page opinion released Tuesday, Judge Marco A. Hernández of Federal District Court in Portland said that transgender students should be allowed to use bathrooms that match the gender they identify with. The ruling upheld the policy of a school district in Dallas, Ore., that allowed a male transgender student to use the boys’ restrooms, showers and locker rooms. The judge dismissed claims by some students and parents saying that other male students experienced “embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension and stress produced by using the restroom with students of the opposite sex.” Judge Hernández wrote in his opinion, “Forcing transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity would undoubtedly harm those students and prevent them from equally accessing educational opportunities and resources.” An evolving battle over transgender rights is taking place across the country, and it has been waged most prominently over access to school bathrooms. In 2016, North Carolina legislators ignited a nationwide controversy when they passed a law requiring people in publicly owned buildings to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender they were assigned at birth.

"As an economist who shares President Trump’s belief that we should be cutting taxes and shrinking government, I might be expected to be enthralled by his policies. But that is not the sentiment I and many other libertarians feel when it comes to his decision to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum and a host of other products made overseas, particularly in China. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they had reached an agreement to step back from a trade war and to discuss ways to lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and possibly increase European imports of American soybeans. But the outcome of those talks is far from certain, and trade tensions between the United States and China remain very high. What is driving the president’s apparent eagerness to impose tariffs is a simple and wrongheaded idea that plays to a large part of his base: A trade war will spur job growth in America. He is trying to use tariffs to give a leg up to American industries against countries that manufacture the same products that we do — whether steel, aluminum or cars — but more efficiently. And who could be against that if it creates more jobs? In reality, however, creating jobs alone does not make for a strong economy. What we really want is to increase production. And to achieve that, we need to allocate labor as efficiently as possible. One way to do that is to ensure that if other countries can make certain goods more efficiently than we can, we trade with them for these items, rather than manufacture them ourselves. The result is cheaper goods, which is to our advantage. But tariffs do nothing to improve this efficient allocation of labor. They also do not increase or decrease employment. They just shift jobs around, and almost always in a manner that hurts the economy. As an illustration, assume Mr. Trump is the governor of New York. He is devoted to making the Empire State “great again.” Right now, both New Yorkers and Iowans raise pigs — but Iowa produces far more than New York. So Governor Trump sets up a protective tariff against the importation of Iowa-raised pork. Will this make New York great again? "
"On Feb. 12, 1946, Tech. Sgt. Isaac Woodard Jr. boarded a bus in Georgia to return home to his wife in South Carolina after completing service in New Guinea and the Philippines. During the ride, Woodard, who was black, asked the bus driver if he would have time to “take a piss” at the next stop. The driver, objecting to Woodard’s language, said, “Boy, go on back and sit down and keep quiet and don’t be talking out so loud.” Fresh from serving his country in wartime, the soldier shot back: “Goddamn it, talk to me like I’m talking to you. I’m a man just like you.” An hour later during a scheduled stop in Batesburg, S.C., the incensed bus driver called over local law-enforcement officers, telling them that the soldier’s foul mouth offended a white female passenger. The police confronted Woodard and dragged him out of sight of the other passengers to unleash a barrage of baton strikes and punches to the face that ruptured his eyeballs. Still in uniform, he was taken to jail and held overnight. The next morning, his eyesight now permanently gone, the police gave him a hot towel and some eye drops and left him at the nearest veterans’ hospital. Woodard survived war overseas only to be blinded by the war at home. Civil rights leaders met with President Harry Truman seven months later to encourage him to end lynch-mob violence against black Americans. After hearing stories of a black veteran and his wife who were executed in a hail of bullets in Georgia, another mutilated with a meat cleaver and blowtorch in Louisiana and the violent blinding of Woodard, Truman’s face fell pale. He rose from his chair and exclaimed: “My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that! We’ve got to do something!” The next day Truman informed his attorney general that policy was needed to prevent lynchings and, in December, Truman created the President’s Committee on Civil Rights to look into racial violence and civil rights. A year later, the committee published its report proposing a number of reforms, including the abolishment of poll taxes, anti-lynching legislation and exempting members of the armed forces from segregation within the military and in society at-large. Though anti-lynching legislation died in Congress and the poll tax was deemed a constitutional issue, Truman could act on the desegregation of the armed forces on his own. July 26 marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9981, Truman’s landmark directive to desegregate the United States military — and the signature achievement of his nascent civil rights program. He declared it was his administration’s policy that “there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.” Truman took this action despite significant resistance from defense leadership. Kenneth Royall, then secretary of the Army, argued that the Army shouldn’t be used as an “instrument of social evolution.” The Marine Corps commandant, Clifton Cates, complained that “the problem of segregation is not the responsibility of the Armed Forces but is a problem of the nation,” and that it was dangerous to use the military to change the nation’s racial politics. Overruling the Pentagon, Truman employed the military in a racial-desegregation social experiment in hopes of improving the American one. His use of executive powers signaled a commitment to a more inclusive version of the United States. Fast forward to today, and President Donald Trump is also using the military to practice his version of racial politics. The last several months have seen the Trump administration come under fire for its policies allowing the deportation of undocumented veterans under certain circumstances, undocumented family members of active-duty military personnel and the discharge of immigrants serving in the military hoping to earn citizenship. Trump has deployed the National Guard to the nation’s southern border in response to crossings by asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, proclaiming, “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military.” He has even proposed using the military’s budget to pay for the wall. And after facing significant backlash for his zero-tolerance immigration policy that separated migrant children from their parents, he signed an executive order to stop the practice and directed immigrant families be interned on military bases instead. Though some of these actions are not unique to Trump, they cannot be divorced from his rhetoric on immigrants of color throughout his campaign and presidency. The approaches by Truman and Trump are representative of a larger truth: If you want to know what a president believes, examine his use of the military. This is not just a question of national security and international relations; it’s reflected in domestic issues like race relations, gender equality and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Often to the chagrin of defense leaders, presidents have used the military to test-run preferred social policies because congressional approval isn’t required, making implementation easier. The decision to use the military to advocate for social policy never occurs in a vacuum and is rarely the result of personal politics alone. The military is an effective vehicle within the commander in chief’s direct authority that can help make the case to the country and demonstrate responsiveness to specific constituencies. "
"July 26 marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9981, President Harry Truman’s directive to desegregate the United States military. To commemorate the milestone, Theodore Johnson compares Truman’s strategic use of the military to make the country more inclusive to President Trump’s politics that equate immigrations with national security and has stoked racial tensions on a national scale. Both approaches demonstrate that the military is an effective vehicle for pushing broader social policies and influencing the mood of the United States. "
"The filmmaker Michael Moore’s movie “Fahrenheit 11/9,” about the presidency of Donald Trump, is scheduled to open in September. His nonfiction show, “Michael Moore TV Nation,” will have its premiere on TBS in October. But first there’s the 14th annual Traverse City Film Festival in Michigan, from July 31 to Aug. 5. Mr. Moore founded the festival and movies, and honorees have his imprint. For the 2016 festival, all of the selections from the United States were directed by women. (“I just wanted to make the statement that 2 to 4 percent of the films made by Hollywood are made by women,” he said. “That’s just wrong.”) In 2017, the festival showcased work by filmmakers from countries affected by the Trump administration’s travel ban. The documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple won a “Mid-Life Achievement” award in 2014; this year, Jane Fonda will receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. (Mr. Moore won an Academy Award for best documentary feature  in 2003 for “Bowling for Columbine.”) Many of the films are shown at the State Theater and the theater Bijou by the Bay, both renovated under Mr. Moore’s direction and run by the festival. Both show first-run features and the State offers 25-cent morning movies (classics like “The Band Wagon” and  “Anatomy of a Murder”). The popcorn recipe is Mr. Moore’s. He lives within walking distance of the theaters and seems to be everywhere during the festival (I was in the audience one summer for a late-night showing of “The Shining,” for which his introduction was both scholarly and hilarious.) Here, edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Moore. What inspired you to renovate the State movie theater and start a film festival in Traverse City? My family had vacationed up there every summer; we’d rent a cabin somewhere, and then we decided to build a cabin and live there full time. I had been there for about three years and was constantly going by this boarded-up movie theater. They had kept it climate-controlled, they had patched the roof. There was no leaking, there was no mold; it was in pretty decent shape for a 100-year old theater. I said this thing shouldn’t be closed, this should be open. "
"A heavily funded Democratic group will spend tens of millions of dollars to mobilize voters in the Republican-leaning states where control of the Senate is likely to be decided this November, stepping in to fill a void left by years of decay in Democratic infrastructure at the state and local level. Senate Majority PAC, the principal “super PAC” supporting Democratic efforts to capture the chamber, intends to steer at least $20 million into the voter-mobilization campaign ahead of the midterm elections, officials with the group confirmed. The program, which follows a similar — successful — Democratic effort in Alabama last year, underscores the degree to which outside groups that can take massive donations have supplanted the traditional role of political parties. The initiative by Senate Majority PAC — which will run through an affiliated nonprofit group, Majority Forward — will span more than a dozen states where Senate seats are at stake. But it is to focus on four states above all: Missouri and Indiana, where endangered Democrats are seeking re-election, and Arizona and Tennessee, where strong Democratic challengers are running for open seats currently held by Republicans. Those four races are among the country’s most competitive. And for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of them, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states. Republicans currently hold the Senate by a slim majority, with 51 seats, but Democrats are largely on defense this year because so many of their senators in red states are running for new terms. Paul Dunn, a strategist for Senate Majority PAC, said that in those four states, Democrats need both to drive up turnout among left-leaning voters and to make inroads in more conservative communities.

"About 700 teenage conservatives visited the nation’s capital this week for a four-day leadership conference organized by Turning Point USA, a group founded in 2012 to promote activism skills among high school and college students and help young conservatives network with leaders in the movement. Many of the biggest names in the Trump administration and conservative activist circles, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions (who echoed the crowd’s chants of “lock her up” during his speech to the conference on Tuesday), former White House spokesman Sean Spicer, Donald Trump Jr. and billionaire Mark Cuban, led sessions at the conference about battling liberal college bias, opposing big government, protecting the Second Amendment and promoting free markets. We sat down with a few attendees to hear what it’s like for them to be red in schools they say are overwhelmingly blue. The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity. Daniel Jakob, 15, is a high school student from Tenafly, N.J. Why are you here? The mainstream media makes it seem like the left is winning, but being here and seeing all these conservatives, it lets me know I’m not the only young conservative here. It’s nice to be with a group of people I can relate to while at the same time contributing to the cause to further endorse conservatism. What does “conservative” mean to you? I’m a conservative because I believe the government should be fair and that the Constitution shall not be infringed. Where I live in North New Jersey, to get a license for a gun is really difficult. Without a gun in your house, you’re vulnerable, and not just from terrorists or criminals but also from the government, because the whole point of the Constitution is to protect us from the government. Things like gun control that the left are trying to implement, that’s what they’re trying to take away, the right to protect ourselves. Are your classmates also conservative, or are you an outlier? A majority of kids in my high school are liberal. I do know a few conservative kids. All my teachers are very liberal. Whenever I’m in a class and I share my political opinion, I’m basically the bigot, that’s what I’m called. In my literature class we were reading “1984,” and my teacher compared “1984” to President Trump’s America, and when I refuted that, the class just shut me down. "
"Ken Kurson is a confidant of Rudolph W. Giuliani. He is a onetime speechwriter for Donald J. Trump. And he is a close friend of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who appointed Mr. Kurson to run his weekly newspaper, The New York Observer. This spring, those relationships appeared to yield a prestigious offer from the Trump White House: a seat on the board of the National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal body that doles out millions of dollars a year in grants to cultural institutions. First, Mr. Kurson had to undergo a government background check. As part of that process, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned about allegations that he had harassed a New York doctor in 2015, according to Mount Sinai Hospital, where the doctor worked. In late spring, the F.B.I. interviewed Mount Sinai doctors and others about the alleged harassment, according to several people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss a delicate situation. The female doctor had become so worried that Mount Sinai arranged for someone to accompany her to and from the hospital for at least a few days, two of the people said. “In November 2015, Mount Sinai began an investigation into allegations of harassment made by two of our doctors against Ken Kurson,” the hospital said in a statement. “We also took measures to protect our staff and the alleged harassment ceased shortly thereafter. We are cooperating with the F.B.I. on their current background check of Mr. Kurson.” Mr. Kurson said in an interview last week that he withdrew from consideration for the government post around early June, citing the amount of paperwork involved in the vetting process. "
"On a hazy day in early February, some of the most powerful men in India’s government gathered at Chhatrasal Stadium in New Delhi, an arena famous for its boisterous wrestling bouts. The men had come for a different kind of spectacle — a biographical film epic, whose initial episodes (out of 57 total) would be shown for the first time that evening. At the center of a makeshift stage, surrounded by smiling politicians and cabinet members, was the person whose life was being celebrated: a slender figure in saffron robes with a long, dark beard, his chest-length hair tied in a bun. He needed no introduction. This was Baba Ramdev, one of the most famous men in India. Ramdev took the microphone and introduced the phalanx of several hundred Hindu religious students, known as brahmacharis, sitting in neat rows on the field. Everyone repeat after me: “Bharat mata ki jai!” he shouted. The crowd raised their arms and pumped their fists as they chanted the words — “India my motherland is great” — that have become a defining slogan of the Hindu nationalist movement. One by one, the dignitaries rose to recount Ramdev’s extraordinary career: how he brought physical fitness to the Indian middle class with his mass yoga camps and television empire; how he built his medicine-and-consumer-goods company, Patanjali Ayurved, into a multibillion-dollar colossus. “Swamiji has changed the direction of the world, the thinking of the world,” one speaker shouted, referring to Ramdev with an affectionate honorific. “That is how great he is. Swamiji has changed India, which was going toward the West — its dress and food and culture — and has changed its direction to yoga!” At last silence fell, and the 50-foot screen flickered to life. For the next hour, India’s political elite watched in humble silence as Ramdev’s life unfolded, from his birth in a remote rural village to his early days as a lissome yogi (the remaining episodes had been condensed into trailer form). As a film, it was a shambolic melodrama that seemed to treat Ramdev almost as a divine messenger. But as an expression of the Indian public’s feelings, it wasn’t far off the mark. Ramdev has been compared to Billy Graham, the Southern Baptist firebrand who advised several American presidents and energized the Christian right. The parallel makes some sense: Ramdev has been a prominent voice on the Hindu right, and his tacit endorsement during the landmark 2014 campaign helped bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power. He appeared alongside Modi on several occasions, singing the leader’s praises and urging Indians to turn out for him. Ramdev has called Modi “a close friend,” and the prime minister publicly lauds Patanjali’s array of ayurvedic products — medicines, cosmetics and foodstuffs. Although Modi campaigned heavily on promises to reform India’s economy and fight corruption, there were frequent dog whistles to the Hindu nationalist base, some of them coordinated with Ramdev. A month before Modi’s landslide victory, a trust controlled by Ramdev released a video in which senior leaders of Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (B.J.P.), including the current ministers of foreign affairs, internal security, finance and transportation, appeared alongside him with a signed document setting out nine pledges. These included the protection of cows — animals held sacred in Hinduism — and a broad call for Hindu nationalist reforms of the government, the courts, cultural institutions and education. After Modi won, Ramdev claimed to have “prepared the ground for the big political changes that occurred.” "
"At the Rally to Restore Sanity in 2010, Jon Stewart delivered a funny political speech to a crowd of his fans on the mall in Washington, D.C. He praised reasonableness, compromise and the virtue of working together with our opponents. Insanity however proved resilient. Last month, he told an audience that it was an error to mistake cultural power for real power, adding: “I, being a part of that machine and mechanism, do feel oddly culpable.” For Mr. Stewart, who more than anyone elevated the political stature of the late-night talk show, to make such a concession is jarring. But it fits the mood right now, one defined not by the army of his television successors but by the Australian stand-up Hannah Gadsby. Her ferocious special “Nanette” tapped into a growing cultural anxiety about the limits of comedy. She skewered the nature of jokes, arguing that because they inevitably lead to incomplete stories, they evade difficult truths. [Hannah Gadsby on the toll of performing “Nanette.”] The media gravitated to her bracingly categorical argument. Slate announced that “Nanette” was evidence that comedy was “broken,” and a Vulture review concluded from her argument that jokes “can’t really challenge or change anything — and are therefore more conservative than progressive.” Such critiques are just as common in the conservative media. Reviewing Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, “Who Is America?,” a critic for The Federalist lamented, “Comedy is supposed to connect us as humans. Now it’s tearing us apart.” When did comedy become the worst medicine? It is a relatively new development. Until recently, comedy had been rapidly expanding, increasingly co-opting areas of our culture previously dominated by sober voices. One of the most memorable responses to the Sept. 11 attacks was David Letterman’s emotional on-air speech processing his grief, which set a precedent for talk-show hosts offering healing words after national tragedies. Corporations and business schools now regularly hire troupes like Second City to teach them how the principles of improv can help their bottom line. But the role of comedy has particularly moved into the political sphere. Before he left the series in 2015, Mr. Stewart’s “Daily Show” was a trusted news source for many young people, frequently earning him comparisons to Walter Cronkite, and political analysis with funny quips became part of the nightly ritual of comedy. When Sarah Silverman spoke alongside then-Senator Al Franken at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the fact that a onetime comedian and a current one were playing roles at the highest level of presidential politics didn’t even seem notable.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The U.S.-E.U. trade war halts, scientists discover water on Mars and a new exhibition showcases Gala Dalí’s life. Here’s the latest: • The U.S. trade war with the E.U. appears to be off, at least for now. At a surprise news conference, President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, above left, said they would work toward lowering tariffs and other trade barriers, temporarily defusing a battle that began with Mr. Trump’s tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. Given Mr. Trump’s unpredictable negotiating style, it was not clear whether the agreement was a genuine truce or merely a lull in a conflict that could flare again. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s tariffs may be starting to hurt the Big 3 automakers in Detroit, all of whom revised their financial forecasts downward, sending their shares down sharply. _____ "
"KNOXVILLE, Iowa — Today President Trump is visiting Dubuque, Iowa, where every year at harvest time, millions of tons of grain come via rail and truck to be loaded onto barges on the Mississippi River and shipped to Mexico, China and much of the rest of the world. Harvest puts coin into the hands of farmers, and they and their communities — indeed all of America — profit. Not this year. The president is here to trumpet a $12 billion plan to aid American farmers. Why do they need aid? For Iowans, it’s because 33 percent of our economy is tied, directly or indirectly, to agriculture, and Mr. Trump recklessly opened trade wars that will hit “Trump country” — rural America — hardest and that have already brought an avalanche of losses. Indeed, the impact of his tariffs will probably be felt by family farms and the area for generations. So perhaps visiting Dubuque is the least he could do. The cost of being shut out of overseas markets for soybeans, beef, pork, chicken and more will be in the billions. Once those markets are gone, they will be difficult to recover. Commodity prices continue to drop, and good weather suggests an excellent crop is in the making, which will drive prices further down. Brazil is ready to step in with increased soybean production, and China has already shifted its purchasing power there. But the fallout will not just be tallied in statistics. In farm country, U.S.A., the Trump tariffs have poured gas on what has been a slow-burning conflagration. Rural America is about to undergo a major demographic shift. President Trump didn’t start it, but he has accelerated a crisis that might have taken a generation or two to play out. Now it might take only a few years. "
"Nov. 4, 2020 In the end, a bitterly fought election came down to the old political aphorism, popularized during Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 run against George H.W. Bush: “It’s the economy, stupid.” This time, however, it was the Republican incumbent, not his Democratic challenger, who benefited from that truism. Donald J. Trump has been decisively re-elected as president of the United States, winning every state he carried in 2016 and adding Nevada, even as he once again failed, albeit narrowly, to gain a majority of the popular vote. Extraordinary turnout in California, New York, Illinois and other Democratic bastions could not compensate for the president’s abiding popularity in the states that still decide who gets to live in the White House: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Yet, unlike 2016, last night’s outcome came neither as a political upset nor as a global shock. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have consistently polled ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and her running mate, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, since July. The New York Times correctly predicted the outcome of the race in every state, another marked change from 2016. In exit poll interviews, Mr. Trump’s supporters frequently cited the state of the economy to explain their vote. “What part of Dow 30,000 do the liberals not understand?” Kevin O’Reilly of Manchester, N.H., told The Times. Senators Warren and Brown never seemed to find a compelling answer to that question, despite an economy that continues to struggle with painfully slow wage growth, spiraling budget deficits and multiplying trade wars that have hurt businesses as diverse as Ohio soybean farmers and California chipmakers. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump welcomed “a new phase in the relationship between the United States and the European Union” on Wednesday, after reaching an agreement to hold off on imposing further tariffs and to work toward dropping existing ones on steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the Rose Garden with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. (Not in attendance: A CNN reporter who was barred for what the White House deemed “inappropriate” questions.) The U.S. has already imposed billions of dollars in tariffs on European products for what the Trump administration has labeled unfair trade practices, raising costs for American companies and consumers. • Separately, the federal budget deficit is growing much faster than economists had predicted, in part because the amount of corporate taxes collected by the federal government has fallen after the tax overhaul. "
"Corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in years. Headline numbers suggest the economy is doing pretty well under President Trump. The stock market, however, is starting to signal that the good times might not last for many. On the surface, stocks look to be performing well. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is up more than 6 percent this year, and it is close to getting back to the historic high it hit earlier this year. A deeper look, however, suggests there is increasing concern among stock investors. A small group of the largest technology companies has driven much of the recent rally. The stocks of other types of companies have not performed nearly as well, in part because of worries that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will harm corporate profits. The stock market is not a perfect predictor of the future, but the lackluster performance of a large part of it may portend a difficult period for many companies in which they pull back on their businesses and perhaps shed jobs in the process. The trade talks announced on Wednesday between the United States and the European Union could prevent an escalation of the fight between the two trading partners. Some investors have been betting that Mr. Trump’s bellicose stance was a bargaining tactic. Stocks jumped after news of the talks was reported. But a joint statement from the United States and the European Union merely laid out their intentions to talk and did not provide many details. Failure to make progress in negotiations with the European Union and continued tensions with China could dampen investors’ spirits. "
"Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. That in the face of this onslaught Republicans now control the White House, both branches of Congress, both legislative branches in 32 states and the Supreme Court is a testament to the continuing electoral liabilities of the Democratic Party and the vulnerable spots of the liberal agenda. Nearly half the country’s voters support a president who embraces upwardly redistributive policies that many of them do not benefit from. Why? Because on race, religion, abortion, LGBTQ rights and immigration, President Trump — unlike previous Republican presidents — has given his voters exactly what they want. This is patently true in the case of immigration. As The Washington Post reported in June, “The Trump administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants, slashed refugee programs, criminalized unauthorized border crossings” and secured a ban on travelers from six majority-Muslim nations. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. "
"Good Thursday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) The latest earnings report suggests its scandals are finally starting to hurt. Growth in users and advertising has slowed, and the company doesn’t expect its figures to improve quickly, especially as it spends more on privacy and security. Facebook’s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading. That wiped $120 billion off the company’s market value — and $17 billion off Mark Zuckerberg’s. The earnings conference call was dramatic, too, Barron’s reports. Particularly when one of the analysts on the line — Ross Sandler of Barclays — translated a forecast of revenue growth declining “by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially” into a drop to “around 20 percent by the fourth quarter of this year.” Daniel Ives of GBH Insights counsels calm: Shira Ovide at Bloomberg Opinion doesn’t agree: Nor does Dan Gallagher at Heard on the Street: Elsewhere in technology: Facebook faces more Senate questioning in September over foreign interference, the WSJ reports, alongside Google and Twitter.

Rao in London. ____________________________ President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said after a meeting yesterday that they would work toward lowering tariffs and other barriers. The Europeans also agreed to buy more American soybeans and natural gas. "
"When President Trump met with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, at the White House, the two said they were entering a new phase in their relationship. Crucial to that will be natural gas. Demand for natural gas — a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil — is rising worldwide, and the United States is a growing supplier of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G. The European Union, meanwhile, wants to diversify its energy supply, which remains somewhat dependent on Russia, with which it has a difficult relationship. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the 28-nation European Union would be “a massive buyer of L.N.G.,” before adding, “We have plenty of it.” Any such shift won’t happen overnight, though. In simple terms: Europe’s consumption of natural gas is increasing, and its domestic production is falling. Its imports have risen rapidly in recent years, and will most likely increase further in the future. “The question is: Where will these increased imports come from?” said Marco Alverà, chief executive of SNAM, an Italian natural gas infrastructure company. Many of the region’s power plants are switching from being fired by coal, which has high levels of carbon emissions, to running on gas, which is significantly better for the environment (though not entirely clean). "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Millions of people from across the world visit Yosemite National Park each year for an opportunity to take in the sweeping vistas at one of America’s most treasured natural preserves. But hundreds of visitors were ordered to evacuate the park Wednesday as firefighters struggled to contain the encroaching 38,000-acre Ferguson Fire, which has roared for nearly two weeks and remains just 25 percent contained. Dry conditions have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the flames. “The conditions are incredibly strenuous, and we’re seeing triple-digit temperatures in places,” said Dan McKeague, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. “Some sections are extremely remote. Access is limited because there aren’t a ton of existing roads.” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., said that long-term drying caused by rising global temperatures has exacerbated the risk of wildfires in the western United States. “Over decades there has been a trend toward less moisture in the soil and forest, and that is affecting how dry the vegetation is becoming in summer,” he said. Mr. Swain said the drought several years ago and resulting bark beetle infestations in forests have combined with rising temperatures to create difficult conditions for containing wildfires. Scott Gediman, a park ranger and spokesman for the National Park Service, said the last major closing because of fire at Yosemite was in 1990 during the A-rock Fire. A flood in 1997 closed the park for about two and a half months, he said, and since then there have been partial closings every so often. "
"LAHORE, Pakistan — Imran Khan, a charismatic cricket star who has fiercely criticized American counterterrorism policy in a region plagued by extremism, appeared poised on Thursday to become Pakistan’s next prime minister. After preliminary results showed his party decisively ahead in an election that critics say was deeply marred, Mr. Khan addressed the nation on television, outlining what he would do as prime minister. He said he would fight corruption at the highest levels, improve relations with China, seek a “mutually beneficial” relationship with the United States and create a just welfare state along the lines of what the Prophet Muhammad did centuries ago. “We’re going to run Pakistan in a way it’s never been run before,” he said. He also said he would never live in the prime minister’s mansion. In a country of so many poor people, he said, “I would be embarrassed” to stay in such a house. For years, Mr. Khan had tried but failed to take the reins of this nuclear-armed Islamic republic, which has struggled with poverty, economic stagnation and instability and which is increasingly torn between its two biggest allies: China and the United States. But this time around, he found a powerful ally in Pakistan’s military. In recent months, army and intelligence officers pressured, threatened and blackmailed politicians from rival parties, human rights groups have said, steadily thinning out Mr. Khan’s competition. "
"BRUSSELS — When he arrived in the Oval Office for negotiations over their growing trade war, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, brought a small gift for President Trump, a renowned admirer of military commanders. It was a photograph of the cemetery in Luxembourg where Gen. George S. Patton is buried. Mr. Juncker, a wily, if often maligned, former prime minister of tiny Luxembourg, added an inscription, alluding to the shared sacrifice of Americans and Europeans during World War II. “Dear Donald,’’ it read. “Let us remember our common history.” Mr. Juncker left the Oval Office on Wednesday with a deal — or at least a truce — that for the moment has defused the Trump administration’s growing trade war with Brussels, while bringing relief across Europe, especially in Germany. Yet if Europe’s political and business leaders are cautiously optimistic that an economic crisis has been averted, they are also wary, given their history with Mr. Trump in the 18 months since he has taken office. Even as Mr. Trump cast the meeting on Wednesday as a great success, and offered gratitude to Mr. Juncker, the question is whether the deal represents a meaningful improvement in the severely strained trans-Atlantic alliance, or is simply another example of the unpredictable approach of a president who has spent months mocking and undermining European leaders — even describing the European bloc as a “foe.” “The question is, how much do you give in to a bully?” asked Maria Demertzis, the deputy director of Bruegel, an economic research institute in Brussels. “This could just be perfunctory, and if it just stops extra tariffs, that’s fine. But you can’t really depend on Trump. His understanding of global trade is bilateral balance, which is as good as arbitrary, given global supply chains. And it depends on what side of the bed he wakes up on tomorrow.” "

It’s not clear exactly what either one is saying or what they mean. We now know that President Trump and his aides have repeatedly lied about the efforts to cover up an alleged affair he had with a former Playboy model. Almost everything else — including whether the tape creates new legal problems for Trump — is unknown at this point. For anyone trying to follow this story, I’d offer one overarching tip: You should put zero weight on the claims made by Trump and his team, including Rudy Giuliani. They have shown that they’re willing to lie whenever it suits their cause. Giuliani’s earlier description of the Cohen-Trump tape — from just six days ago — now appears laughably inaccurate. I am not saying that Trump and Giuliani are always lying. When the truth helps them, they speak it. But the mere fact that they make a claim shouldn’t alter anyone’s judgment about its likely veracity. Related, from The Washington Post: “The government has seized more than 100 recordings that Cohen made of his conversations with people discussing matters that could relate to Trump and his businesses and with Trump himself talking.” Georgia. The Cook Political Report yesterday upgraded the chances of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia. The Republican, Brian Kemp, is still favored, Jennifer Duffy of The Cook Political Report writes, but only modestly, because he’s an extreme candidate who may turn off swing voters. One statistic in Duffy’s piece captures why Kemp remains favored. Abrams generated enormous excitement in the primary. She’s an appealing candidate — the first female African-American gubernatorial nominee in any state — with an uplifting message. When I watched her victory speech on primary night, I thought I might be witnessing a new national star. And yet for all the excitement about Abrams, turnout in the Republican primary was still higher than in the Democratic primary. In fact, more Republicans voted in this week’s runoff — won by Kemp — than Democrats voted in the original primary. There are simply more Republican than Democratic voters in Georgia. Yes, Abrams can significantly improve her chances by turning out even more progressives — especially younger and nonwhite voters — in the general election. But she almost certainly needs to win over some traditional Republican voters too. The extreme nature of Kemp’s campaign should help. So should her populist message. It’s a fascinating race. “Wait a second, you might be thinking, Hillary Clinton lost Georgia by only 5 percentage points in 2016. And Georgia has been getting bluer. Is Abrams’s climb really that steep? Yes, it is,” Perry Bacon Jr. wrote for FiveThirtyEight earlier this year. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

"The former cricket great Imran Khan is on the verge of becoming prime minister of Pakistan. Innumerable jocks have turned into politicians around the world, starting from the high school quarterback who is elected class president. But the confluence of all-time great athlete and head of government represented by Khan is rare. If you don’t follow the sport, you might not know that Khan was not merely a garden-variety professional athlete, but was probably the greatest cricketer ever from Pakistan, a country where cricket is by far the dominant sport. He is also one of the sport’s best ever all-rounders, players who can both bat and bowl well. Now on the cusp of the top office in the land, he is looking for a rarely achieved double. Among those who have served in high office around the world are Lasse Viren (four track gold medals, Finland parliament), Sebastian Coe (two track gold medals, M.P., now Lord Coe), Vitali Klitschko (heavyweight champion, mayor of Kiev), Manny Pacquiao (multiple boxing championships, Philippines senate), Romário (World Cup Golden Ball, Brazil senator), and Ilie Nastase (tennis star, Romanian senate). But none of them were presidents or prime ministers. The closest to achieving what Khan is poised to achieve may be George Weah, a productive striker who was the winner of soccer’s highest award, the Ballon d’Or, in 1995, playing for A.C. Milan. Last year, he was elected president of Liberia. He and Khan sit at the top of the pile for now. At least until LeBron James, Usain Bolt or Roger Federer takes a shot at high office. In the United States, you could almost fill a Congress with former pro athletes who have served: Their numbers have included the A.F.L. quarterback Jack Kemp, who was also a vice-presidential nominee. He was joined as a legislator by the baseball Hall of Famer Jim Bunning; the basketball superstar Bill Bradley; the decathlete Bob Mathias; football stars Steve Largent, J.C. Watts, Jon Runyan and Heath Shuler; Tom McMillen of the N.B.A.; and the sprinter Ralph Metcalfe, among many others. "
"On Wednesday, a federal district court made history. Judge Peter J. Messitte of Maryland allowed a lawsuit to move forward against President Trump, alleging that he is violating the Constitution by continuing to do business with foreign and domestic governments. In doing so, he became the first federal judge ever to rule on the meaning of the word “emolument” in the Constitution. Coverage of the lawsuit, which was brought by two of us (with the third, Mr. Eisen, among the co-counsels), has sometimes cast doubt on the usefulness of the Emoluments Clauses, which we have argued forbid presidents from using their office to “profit, gain or advantage.” Critics have noted how rarely they have been deployed. That’s why Judge Messitte’s ruling is so important: It opens a path to enforcement of the ethics regime that the framers developed as a bulwark against corruption in the highest office in the land. The decision could not be more timely. As our suit makes clear, the head of the executive branch of our government is more embroiled in commercial activities, from his hotel near the White House to business deals half a world away, than any president in American history. The Foreign Emoluments Clause — specifically, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution — declares that “no Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” The Domestic Emoluments Clause — Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 — states that “The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.” By ruling that the word “emolument” in these clauses means “profit,” “gain” or “advantage” in essentially any form from a foreign or domestic government, Judge Messitte has correctly found a way to enforce the framers’ anti-corruption mechanism. The framers understood the potential corrosive influence of commercial profit in the executive and wrote the Constitution “against a background of profound concern” regarding “possible foreign influence upon the president (and, to be sure, upon other federal officials),” as Judge Messitte noted. They designed the Emoluments Clauses as a prophylactic measure to prevent actual corruption and the specter of corruption — where a foreign power (or a domestic government) buys favorable policy decisions by engaging with the head of the executive branch commercially, outside the normal avenues of state.

"GRANITE CITY, Ill. — President Trump came to a newly revived steel mill here on Thursday to take credit for jobs created by American tariffs against China and other steel exporters. But his triumphal message was muddied by the woes of Midwestern soybean farmers, who have been caught in the crossfire of Mr. Trump’s multifront trade war. “To see an old big monster plant like this reopening, that is a great honor,” he declared to a raucous crowd, clad in a mix of hard hats and “Make America Great Again” baseball caps. “The days of plundering American jobs and wealth — those days are over.” “I could be one of you,” the president added. “I’d be happy if I was, because you’re opening up plants all over the country.” Mr. Trump introduced his daughter Ivanka, who congratulated the workers at the plant, where the owner, United States Steel Corporation, has begun firing up the second of two blast furnaces after a long shutdown. Then, she thanked her father for “enabling it to happen.” At the Granite City Works on Thursday, Donald J. Trump was the only thing bigger than U.S. Steel. With his obligatory attacks on the news media, his leisurely digressions into his 2016 election victory, his professions of affection for strongmen like Kim Jong-un of North Korea, and the thumping classic-rock soundtrack, Mr. Trump could have been at one of his political rallies. Still, the president’s trip to the Midwest on Thursday, which included a stop in Iowa, also cast a light on farmers, whose soybean exports dried up after China struck back over the tariffs. While praising President Xi Jinping as a friend and a “great guy,” he said China was punishing farmers so it could continue its longstanding practice of stealing technology from American companies. "
"The federal government reported Thursday that it would meet a court-ordered deadline to reunite the last “eligible” migrant families separated at the Southwest border, but hundreds of children remained in federal custody as a result of a contentious immigration policy that has drawn international condemnation. Officials with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency reunited 1,442 of the last group of children with their families and said they expected to complete all “eligible” reunifications by midnight Thursday, Pacific time. “By the court deadline this evening, we are on track to reunite all eligible parents within ICE custody,” said Chris Meekins, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services. But in a day that saw government officials and community volunteers scrambling to bring families together, multiple reports of failed reunifications raised questions about whether the deadline had in fact been met. Further confusing the issue was a change in the way the government tallied its progress, with the latest report counting children rather than parents, a reversal from prior reports. “The data is dynamic,” a government official said of the discrepancy in a conference call with reporters. Even if Thursday’s deadline was met, the government’s work to address the effects of the family separation policy was far from over. The parents who were deemed eligible for reunification represent only about a third of all those who were separated from their children after crossing the border, a practice that began last summer and escalated in May.

"Delays in China that led Qualcomm to call off its acquisition of a rival microchip maker had nothing to do with escalating trade tensions with the United States, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Thursday. Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors first announced their $44 billion union nearly two years ago. Qualcomm is based in San Diego and NXP in the Netherlands, but both do significant business in China, which is why its antimonopoly authorities had say over whether the deal would go through. But as frictions between the United States and China intensified this year, Beijing’s prolonged antitrust review came to be seen as a form of leverage over the negotiations. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods this month, and Beijing immediately retaliated with levies of its own. Chinese regulators never formally rejected the deal, which had been approved by eight other jurisdictions, including the United States. But Beijing dragged its review out to more than 20 months. Speaking Thursday at a news conference after Qualcomm said it was expecting to walk away from the deal, Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, denied the link to trade, according to a transcript posted on the ministry’s website. Qualcomm and NXP formally announced the cancellation later on Thursday. “As of what I know, the case is about antimonopoly law enforcement,” Mr. Gao said, referring reporters to the State Administration for Market Regulation, which has official oversight of antitrust matters. The market regulator has not commented on the matter recently. "
