"In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more of this series here. Here, New York Times reporters and editors explain the “lede-all,” a story form that weaves together many narrative threads and leads the coverage of an event. Simon Romero needed internet service. He was on deadline, reporting from Haiti the day after the 2010 earthquake, and editors were waiting on his article. On a hunch, he hired a driver to take him to a hotel that was miraculously still standing. There, by candlelight, with a generator and a satellite internet connection, Mr. Romero filed a draft of his “lede-all,” a story that captured the devastating situation unfolding on the ground, and set the stage for the weeks of reporting that would follow. The lede-all is one of the most important and challenging story forms employed by reporters at The New York Times. As the name suggests, a lede-all leads the coverage of an event, weaving together many narrative threads, some of which are expanded upon in their own separate articles. It’s a form that is reserved for news of significant scale and consequence. In decades past, when print schedules determined when stories were published, a reporter might have had a day, or an afternoon at least, to craft a lede-all. Now, with news breaking on multiple platforms in real time, the lede-all has to provide an authoritative big-picture sense of the moment in a matter of hours. “It’s the grand summation before you get into the granular; it’s the significant before you get to the specific,” said Sewell Chan, an international news editor. Patrick Healy, now The Times’s politics editor, and another politics reporter, Jeremy Peters, wrote the lede-all the day after the 2016 presidential election. The events of the previous night called for an article that could capture the shock of the nation, the elation of Donald J. Trump’s supporters and the devastation of those who had supported Hillary Clinton. It needed to incorporate reactions from voters, Mrs. Clinton, President Barack Obama, other politicians, foreign leaders and President-elect Trump, all while using “writing that feels worthy of the hugeness of the moment” and communicating to future generations “what a crazy day this was in America,” Mr. Healy said. Logistical challenges, like those Mr. Romero encountered in Haiti, can further complicate the writing process. Amy Chozick typed out her lede-all for Hillary Clinton’s Nevada primary caucus win while plugged in to an outlet at a “Sex and the City” slot machine in Las Vegas. (Mr. Healy co-wrote the story, from New York.) “The security guard said, ‘You can’t sit here unless you’re gambling,’ so I was sticking quarters in while I typed,” Ms. Chozick said. “I ended up winning $40!” Even under ideal circumstances, lede-alls are a feat of information management. They often incorporate feeds: information provided to the writer by reporters who are focused on specific aspects of the story, like a victim’s family, voter reactions or an official response. It’s the lede-all writer’s job to process and incorporate these feeds, communicating with colleagues about the kind of information she still needs and where the story is going. Sometimes a lede-all has to be updated live as an event unfolds and new information becomes available. It is, as more than one journalist has said, a team effort. The contributor line at the bottom of Mr. Romero’s article indicates that eight other people contributed reporting from four more locations. “It’s a testament to the strength of The Times at such a crucial moment,” Mr. Romero said. When done right, all the pieces come together, and the lede-all becomes a rough draft of history — something that was on Mr. Healy’s mind the morning after the 2016 presidential election. “This is going to be a story,” he said, “that people may read a hundred years from now.” "

"Good Wednesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The White House said yesterday that it would impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods just days after slapping levies on $34 billion worth. China, professing “shock,” has promised to respond, without specifying how. Asian and European markets were rattled by the news this morning. U.S. markets were set to open lower, too. The new U.S. tariffs appear focused on Chinese manufacturing, covering electronics, textiles and auto parts, as well as minerals used in gadgets and batteries. Bloomberg points out that China’s response may have to stretch beyond tariffs, because the country imports only about $130 billion worth of goods from the U.S. Options include making it harder for American companies to operate in China, canceling orders for U.S. goods, or even putting tariffs on American energy. Rupert Murdoch’s media company increased its bid for control of the European satellite broadcaster this morning, surpassing Comcast’s. Fox’s latest offer values Sky at about $32.5 billion; Comcast’s in April valued it at $30.5 billion. Will Comcast counter the new bid? And how high might it go? The cable company loves Sky’s mix of content, its distribution channels and its rights to show the English Premier League, so a big fight is plausible. "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s trade war is expected to temporarily bolster United States economic growth, in part because Beijing tried to beat the clock on Mr. Trump’s tariffs by stocking up on American soybeans, crude oil and other exports. Economists are predicting that the gross domestic product for the second quarter could reach 5 percent when the preliminary numbers are released on July 27. The United States trade gap with China has narrowed, as more American products were shipped to Beijing ahead of the tariffs, which went into effect on July 6. But both effects are expected to be fleeting, and the short-term economic improvement could turn into a long-term loss if both countries follow through with their threats to continue escalating tariffs against each other. “They will dance, they will sing, they will say, look at the plunge in the trade deficit in the second quarter,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. “That is of course complete drivel.” The United States is engaged in multiple trade wars at once as it imposes tariffs on metals from the European Union, Mexico, Canada and other nations. But it is waging an even bigger fight with China, a dispute that threatens to engulf broad swaths of the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration has accused the Chinese of a variety of trade abuses, including intellectual property theft and denying American companies equal access to China’s market. Mr. Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $34 billion worth of Chinese products and has threatened to hit as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods with levies. On Tuesday, the administration released a list of an additional $200 billion in products that could face tariffs as soon as September. China had already responded with tariffs of its own, on soybeans, pork, automobiles and other products and signaled that its next wave of tariffs could include American oil exports. "
"Several readers have written to The Times to express their concern with our use of the phrase “catch and release” in our recent coverage of the Trump administration’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. “ ‘Catch and release’ is a sport fishing term for the practice of catching fish and releasing them, alive, back into the water,” Tim Pierce from Berlin, Mass., wrote in a letter to the editor on Wednesday. “The Trump administration uses it as part of a strategy to dehumanize immigrants. The Times must not be complicit in this process of dehumanization, and must reject this biased term.” We asked our deputy national editor Kim Murphy to respond. The phrase “catch and release” has been used off-and-on to describe immigration policy since at least the administration of George W. Bush. President Trump has made it a favorite term for what he considers the government’s lack of vigilance in detaining migrants who cross the border illegally. For too long, he argues, the government has allowed migrants in such cases to be released from detention and simply show up for their immigration hearings in order to remain, possibly for years, in the United States. Such a policy, he believes, encourages more migrant families to embark on dangerous journeys, persuaded by precedent that freedom waits at the other end. Mr. Trump is a master of catchphrases; he uses them so often that news organizations can be tempted to adopt them, often tongue-in-cheek, as shorthand for government policy. “Drain the swamp” (trim government bureaucracy). “Big, beautiful wall” (fortify the border). “Worst trade deal ever” (Nafta). “Greatest theft in the history of the world” (China). “Rocket man” (North Korea). “Fake news” (fill in the blank). “Catch and release” has had a way of seeping into news coverage because it so succinctly describes a complex set of responses to illegal immigration and asylum law. I personally would never have thought of it as a way of equating human beings to fish. Yet of course by adopting a fishing metaphor, it does precisely that. Here on the National desk, we’ve asked all our immigration writers to think carefully before using this phrase, making sure they include it only in reference to the administration’s use of the phrase; we don’t want to make it ours. Please share your thoughts in the comments. "

"KUANTAN, Malaysia — Amanda Lacaze grabbed her iPhone and rattled off the names of the special minerals needed to make it. The screen was polished with lanthanum and cerium. The inside has a magnet made with neodymium and praseodymium. Those minerals almost certainly came from China. Ms. Lacaze’s job is to give the world an alternative source, in case a global trade war spirals out of control and China cuts off supply. Right now, she can’t. Her company, Lynas Corporation, can provide only a fraction of the minerals — known as rare earths — that China produces. And even that source isn’t a sure thing: The work is so volatile, complex and expensive that Lynas once came close to collapsing. “There were times where we were sitting there and I’m saying, ‘Can we really afford to put coffee into the staff rooms?’” Ms. Lacaze said. The Trump administration amped up its trade fight with China on Tuesday when it threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, ranging from frozen catfish fillets to copper wires to piston engines. China has threatened to match them dollar for dollar. But it has other ways to retaliate beyond tariffs. It could refuse to buy American products, like planes from Boeing. It could intensify regulation of American companies doing business on the mainland. It could threaten to offload a piece of its huge portfolio of Treasuries, which could rattle the bond market.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Three important buildings, designed by three important architects, tell the story of modern Los Angeles and its newspaper. The first was designed by Gordon B. Kaufmann and built in 1935 as a new and modern home for The Los Angeles Times, and its distinctive Art Deco style has been an iconic fixture of the city’s skyline. The second, designed by Rowland H. Crawford, is an office tower built in 1948 as the home for a new afternoon newspaper. That project failed, partly because the old street cars went away as the city embraced the automobile, but the building endures. The third was designed by William L. Pereira, a 1973 office building to accommodate the top brass of the Times Mirror Co., the newspaper’s corporate parent. It was built at a time when the paper was growing under the publisher, Otis Chandler, who expanded the paper’s coverage, elevating it into the upper echelon of the country’s great newspapers. Together they are known as Times Mirror Square, and now that the staff of The Los Angeles Times is moving to another section of the county, conservationists are fighting to save the building from development plans by the complex’s owner, the Onni Group. “These three buildings tell the story not just of The Los Angeles Times, but of Los Angeles,” said Richard Schave, a local conservationist and historian who runs the tour company Esotouric.

"With apologies to “Animal House’s” Otter, Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court is not the time “a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody’s part.” Then again, Otter’s frat brother Bluto did go on to become a United States senator, so maybe it makes sense. I refer to the decision of Senate Democrats to wage a tooth-and-nail battle to oppose Kavanaugh, an effort that is likely doomed to fail and equally likely to hurt Democratic chances in the fall. Who knew Chuck Schumer was so content with his job as Senate minority leader? Let’s count the ways in which the Democrats aren’t helping themselves. Kavanaugh will almost certainly be confirmed. Democrats who had pinned their hopes on flipping Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski probably aren’t going to get their wish, since both Republican moderates voted to confirm Kavanaugh to his current judgeship in 2006 and have since spoken approvingly of his nomination. Rand Paul can also be counted on to feign political independence, but he usually falls into line. Of course it’s possible Kavanaugh will make a bad public impression, like Robert Bork. Or maybe there will be a #MeToo revelation, like with Clarence Thomas. Or maybe Democrats will figure out a way to kick a vote past the midterms. In which case, Democrats can seize their chances. For now, however, the first question Democrats ought to ask themselves is whether they really have political capital to waste on a losing battle. Fierce opposition to Kavanaugh hurts Democrats. This was already going to be a difficult year for Senate Democrats, who are defending 10 seats in states won by Trump. Everyone knows that North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Indiana’s Joe Donnelly are vulnerable, which is why they voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch last year. Florida’s Bill Nelson is struggling, too, as is Missouri’s Claire McCaskill. So please explain the logic of convincing Democratic voters in these states that the Kavanaugh nomination is the moral battle of our time — and then putting their senators to the choice of looking like political sellouts if they vote for Kavanaugh, or moral cowards if they don’t (and vice versa)?

"In the year and a half since Barack Obama left office, dozens of books have been written about his administration, including memoirs by his official photographer, stenographer, speechwriter, communications director, his foreign policy advisers and his director of national intelligence, not to mention the Obamas’ own forthcoming memoirs. But only one book includes a scene where Obama bursts into a motorcycle gang clubhouse in Delaware, casually toting a sawed-off shotgun, to rescue Joe Biden from a mob of angry, heavily armed bikers. “Looks like you all know who my pal is,” Biden tells his antagonists with satisfaction. “He’s the guy who killed Bin Laden,” one of the stunned bikers says. The unlikely scenario sprung from the twisted mind of Andrew Shaffer, author of “Hope Never Dies,” a new mystery novel starring the 44th president and his vice president as a pair of crime-busting amateur sleuths. It’s the first in a planned crime series, with Obama playing a cerebral, detached, analytical Holmes to Biden’s bumbling, impulsive Watson. The novel, out this week, is a roughly 300-page work of political fanfiction, an escapist fantasy that will likely appeal to liberals pining for the previous administration, longing for the Obama-Biden team to emerge from political retirement as action heroes. But it’s also at times a surprisingly earnest story about estranged friends who are reunited under strange circumstances. "
      
"A Border Patrol agent who obtained the confidential travel records of a Washington journalist and used them to press her about her sources last year is under investigation for misuse of government computer systems, according to an official briefed on the inquiry. The agent, Jeffrey A. Rambo, who usually worked in the San Diego area, was temporarily assigned at the time to the National Targeting Center, a facility in Sterling, Va., operated by Customs and Border Protection that stores data on the travel of millions of Americans and foreigners. Such information is supposed to be used only under strict rules by immigration and law enforcement officials. Now the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general and investigators from the border agency are examining whether Mr. Rambo used the travel data improperly or illegally and whether anyone else was involved. Press advocates have expressed alarm that a government official would use sensitive private information in what they say amounted to a blackmail attempt against a journalist. On June 1, 2017, Mr. Rambo, 33, contacted Ali Watkins, a reporter for Politico at the time who now works at The New York Times, saying that he needed to meet her in Washington immediately. He told Ms. Watkins that he worked for the government but declined to give his name or agency. In a lengthy conversation at a bar near Dupont Circle, Mr. Rambo claimed to be helping the F.B.I. with investigations into leaks of sensitive material to journalists. He eventually revealed that he knew the details of a trip to Spain that Ms. Watkins had taken with James A. Wolfe, security director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who was then her boyfriend. According to accounts Ms. Watkins provided to friends and editors, Mr. Rambo hinted that he might disclose their relationship to The Washington Post and pressed her to become his informant and report to him on other journalists and their sources.
