"WASHINGTON — The indictment of 13 Russians filed on Friday by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, details the secret workings of the Internet Research Agency, an organization in St. Petersburg, Russia, that disseminates false information online. According to American intelligence officials, the Kremlin oversaw this shadowy operation, which made extensive use of social media accounts to foster conflict in the United States and erode public faith in its democracy. But the Kremlin’s operation relied on more than just its own secrecy. It also benefited from the secrecy of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Their algorithms for systematically targeting users to receive certain content are off limits to the public, and the output of these algorithms is almost impossible to monitor. The algorithms make millions of what amount to editorial decisions, pumping out content without anyone fully understanding what is happening. The editorial decisions of a newspaper or television news program are immediately apparent (articles published, segments aired) and so can be readily analyzed for bias and effect. By contrast, the editorial decisions of social media algorithms are opaque and slow to be discovered — even to those who run the platforms. It can take days or weeks before anyone finds out what has been disseminated by social media software. The Mueller investigation is shining a welcome light on the Kremlin’s covert activity, but there is no similar effort to shine a light on the social media algorithms that helped the Russians spread their messages. There needs to be. This effort should begin by “opening up” the results of the algorithms. In computer-speak, this “opening up” would involve something called an open application programming interface. This is a common software technique that allows different programs to work with one another. For instance, Uber uses the open application programming interface of Google Maps to get information about a rider’s pickup point and destination. It is not Uber’s own mapping algorithm, but rather Google’s open application programming interface, that makes it possible for Uber to build its own algorithms for its distinctive functions. "
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed down its new set of congressional district lines on Monday, replacing those drawn by Republicans after they captured the state legislature in 2010. The state’s highest court had earlier ruled those lines unconstitutional. The new map, The Times’s Nate Cohn said, “comes very close to achieving partisan balance.” Republicans, who held a big advantage under the old lines, plan to challenge the new ones in federal court. It’s a huge fight, with enormous ramifications. But as they argue over what lines should go where, I ask you to consider a more fundamental question: Why have lines at all? You’re thinking: “Why have lines? Because we have to! We have to have congressional districts!” Well, yes, under current law we do. But Congress can change that law. And in our deeply polarized age, there’s an argument to be made that we might be better off if it did so. There is nothing in the Constitution that says we have to have congressional districts. Article 1, Section 2, says merely that “the House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states.” No particular method is prescribed. And indeed, in the early days of the republic, states did not uniformly use what we now call “single-member district” voting. Most did. But a few states used what was then called “general ticket” voting. Under this system, there were no districts. In those states in the first congressional elections, the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists put up slates, and the side with the winning slate took all or most of the seats. "
"MEXICO CITY — With Venezuela suffering one of the most severe economic collapses of modern times, the beleaguered administration of President Nicolás Maduro announced on Tuesday that it had begun a presale of virtual currency backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves. The government, which had announced plans for the new digital currency late last year, said the initiative was a response to a financial crisis marked by a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation. The country is suffering desperate scarcities of food and medicine, soaring crime rates and the collapse of public services and the health system. The crisis has driven hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee the country seeking a better life. The Maduro administration hopes that sales of the digital currency, known as the petro, will help its treasury pay off debt and increase imports of vitally needed goods, as well as raw materials for manufacturing. Venezuelan officials also asserted that the new digital currency — the first to be issued by a nation — would allow investors to do an end run around sanctions imposed against their country by the Trump administration. These sanctions ban the purchase in American markets of new securities issued by the Venezuelan government, and outlaw business dealings with Mr. Maduro and several top administration officials. “For big problems, big solutions,” Mr. Maduro said Tuesday night at a ceremony in Caracas. “We Venezuelans are indomitable.” "
"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence had planned to secretly meet with a high-level delegation of North Korean leaders while he was at the Winter Olympics in South Korea this month, but the North Koreans canceled at the last minute, according to the State Department. “We regret the failure to seize this opportunity,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said Tuesday. The canceled meeting is the latest twist in the evolving American strategy to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs, which Western intelligence agencies say will soon be able to threaten the continental United States. It also adds a remarkable coda to the strange tableau during the opening ceremony of Mr. Pence sitting in a reviewing stand less than 10 feet away from Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as the two stared fixedly ahead without acknowledging each other. At the time, Trump administration officials explained that they would have been open to a meeting with their North Korean counterparts, but only if Mr. Pence delivered a tough message and only if it occurred away from TV cameras. What they did not disclose then was that they believed both of those conditions had been met for an encounter already scheduled to occur. "
"WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is resisting giving up his access to highly classified information, prompting an internal struggle with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, over who should be allowed to see some of the nation’s most sensitive secrets, according to White House officials and others briefed on the matter. Mr. Kushner is one of dozens of White House officials operating under interim security clearances because of issues raised by the F.B.I. during their background checks, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the clearances. The practice has drawn added scrutiny because of Rob Porter, the former staff secretary who resigned under pressure this month after domestic abuse allegations against him became public. Mr. Porter’s post entailed handling and reviewing the flow of documents to and from the president, which routinely includes highly classified material. He had been allowed to continue in the job for more than a year with a stopgap clearance even though the F.B.I. had informed the White House of the damaging accusations against him. Mr. Kushner’s clearance has afforded him access to closely guarded information, including the presidential daily brief, the intelligence summary Mr. Trump receives every day, but it has not been made permanent, and his background investigation is still pending after 13 months serving in Mr. Trump’s inner circle. Now Mr. Kelly, his job at risk and his reputation as an enforcer of order and discipline tarnished by the scandal, is working to revamp the security clearance process, starting with an effort to strip officials who have interim clearances of their high-level access. In a memo issued on Friday, Mr. Kelly said he would revoke top clearances for anyone whose background check had been pending since June 1 or earlier, and review such clearances every month thereafter. Mr. Kushner, frustrated about the security clearance issue and concerned that Mr. Kelly has targeted him personally with the directive, has told colleagues at the White House that he is reluctant to give up his high-level access, the officials said. In the talks, the officials say, Mr. Kushner has insisted that he maintain his current level of access, including the ability to review the daily intelligence briefing when he sees fit. "
"The teenagers of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who a week ago lost 17 of their classmates and school staff members in a mass shooting, have emerged as passionate advocates for reform, speaking openly of their anger in the hope of forcing a reckoning on guns. But in certain right-wing corners of the web — and, increasingly, from more mainstream voices like Rush Limbaugh and a commentator on CNN — the students are being portrayed not as grief-ridden survivors but as pawns and conspiracists intent on exploiting a tragedy to undermine the nation’s laws. In these baseless accounts, which by Tuesday had spread rapidly on social media, the students are described as “crisis actors,” who travel to the sites of shootings to instigate fury against guns. Or they are called F.B.I. plants, defending the bureau for its failure to catch the shooter. They have been portrayed as puppets being coached and manipulated by the Democratic Party, gun control activists, the so-called antifa movement and the left-wing billionaire George Soros. The theories are far-fetched. But they are finding a broad and prominent audience online. On Tuesday, the president’s son Donald J. Trump Jr. liked a pair of tweets that accused David Hogg, a 17-year-old who is among the most outspoken of the Parkland students, of criticizing the Trump administration in an effort to protect his father, whom Mr. Hogg has described as a retired F.B.I. agent. Mr. Hogg, the high school’s student news director, has become a sensation among many liberals for his polished and compelling television interviews, in which he has called on lawmakers to enact tougher restrictions on guns. Just as quickly, Mr. Hogg attracted the disdain of right-wing provocateurs like The Gateway Pundit, a fringe website that gained prominence in 2016 for pushing conspiracies about voter fraud and Hillary Clinton. In written posts and YouTube videos — one of which had more than 100,000 views as of Tuesday night — Gateway Pundit has argued that Mr. Hogg had been coached on what to say during his interviews. The notion that Mr. Hogg is merely protecting his father dovetails with a broader right-wing trope, that liberal forces in the F.B.I. are trying to undermine President Trump and his pro-Second Amendment supporters.

"As surely as there are camels’ backs and straws to break them, moments arrive when citizens say they’ve had enough, when they rise up against political leaders who do not speak for them and whose moral fecklessness imperils lives. We may be witness to such a moment now with the protests by American teenagers sickened — and terrified — by the latest mass murder at the hands of someone with easy access to a weapon fit for a battlefield, not a school. These kids have had enough. They’ve had enough of empty expressions of sympathy in the wake of the sort of atrocities they’ve grown up with, like last week’s mass shooting that took 17 lives at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Enough of the ritualistic mouthing of thoughts and prayers for the victims. Enough of living in fear that they could be next in the cross hairs of a well-armed deranged killer, even with all the active shooter drills and lockdowns they’ve gone through. Enough of craven politicians who kneel before the National Rifle Association and its cynically fundamentalist approach to the Second Amendment. They are asking in what kind of country are children sent off to school with bulletproof book bags strapped to their backs — capable, one manufacturer, Bullet Blocker, says, of “stopping a .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, 9mm, .45 caliber hollow point ammunition and more.” “I was born 13 months after Columbine,” a 12th grader named Faith Ward said on Monday, referring to the school massacre in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, the dawn of the modern wave of school shootings. Ms. Ward spoke to a television reporter at an anti-gun demonstration outside her school in Plantation, Fla. “This is all I have ever known,” she said, “this culture of being gunned down for no reason, and this culture of people saying, ‘Oh, let’s send thoughts and prayers’ for three days, and then moving on. And I’m tired of it.” So are we all. It is too soon to tell if this righteous anger augurs a sustained youth movement for gun sanity, going beyond the occasional protest. We hope it does. It’s time, once again, for America to listen to its children. Who among us have more at stake than they? "
"Cameron Kasky, a 17-year-old at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who survived last week’s mass shooting, wrote a beautiful essay for CNN.com that declared: “At the end of the day, the students at my school felt one shared experience — our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools. But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account. This time we are going to pressure them to take action. This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses.” Cameron, God bless you for that sentiment. But just one piece of respectful advice: If your generation and mine want to get serious about a gun control crusade, we all need to get out of Facebook and into someone’s face: the N.R.A.’s. This fight can’t be won on Twitter or Instagram. They do get people into the streets. But social media have created a world of faux activism — “Hey, I tweeted about it” — that the bad guys take advantage of. The N.R.A. is not just in the chat rooms. It’s in the cloakrooms of Congress and state legislatures. And it’s there with bags of money and votes it uses to reward lawmakers who do its bidding and hurt those who don’t. I loved seeing the 100 students from your high school taking buses Tuesday to Florida’s capital to directly press lawmakers. That’s a great start. I hope every high school follows. But, ultimately, nothing will change unless young and old who oppose the N.R.A. run for office, vote, help someone vote, register someone to vote or help fund someone’s campaign — so we can threaten the same electoral pain as the National Rifle Association, which, according to PolitiFact, spent $203.2 million between 1998 and 2017 funding its candidates, defeating gun control advocates and lobbying. This is not about persuading people with better ideas. We tried that. It’s about generating raw electoral power and pain. Because most of the G.O.P. members of Congress who do the N.R.A.’s bidding care about only one thing: their jobs. The pay of a typical congressman is $174,000 — and free parking at Reagan National Airport — and they will sell themselves to whoever can generate the votes to enable them to keep both. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed on Tuesday to repatriate a Guantánamo Bay detainee to Saudi Arabia, missing a deadline set in his 2014 plea deal and dealing another blow to the struggling military commissions system at the wartime prison. The detainee, Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi, agreed in February 2014 to plead guilty to terrorism-related offenses involving a 2002 attack by Al Qaeda on a French-flagged oil tanker off the coast of Yemen. Under the pretrial agreement, if he cooperated, he was to be sent home within four years to serve the remainder of his sentence in Saudi custody. But on Tuesday, the four-year anniversary of that deal arrived, and Mr. Darbi remained at the American prison. The Department of Defense still hopes the transfer will take place soon, but diplomatic arrangements with the Saudi government are incomplete, Cmdr. Sarah Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Haza al-Darbi’s transfer from Guantánamo detention to Saudi Arabia will not take place today,” she said, adding: “We await assurances from the Saudi Arabian government to move forward on his departure. Al-Darbi will remain at Guantánamo until all transfer details are concluded.” The missed deadline came days after a military commissions judge indefinitely shut down the case against another Saudi detainee — who is accused of orchestrating the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole, and against whom Mr. Darbi testified as part of his cooperation — after more than six years of pretrial hearings.

"These three young theater figures are moving into the public eye with confidence and a determination to expand horizons for themselves and their audiences. Playwright, ‘An Ordinary Muslim’ When Hammaad Chaudry was 19, he moved away from Edinburgh, where he grew up the son of Pakistani immigrants, to attend the University of Surrey, about an hour outside of London. He planned to be a lawyer. But after marching to protest the war in Iraq, Mr. Chaudry grew more interested in political activism — and he found his law studies to be tedious and unfulfilling. He found his voice elsewhere: writing plays. At the end of his first year at university, he joined a writing program at the Royal Court Theater in London geared toward young Muslim writers. He would eventually pursue a master’s degree at Columbia University, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Tony Kushner took Mr. Chaudry under his wing. His thesis play, “An Ordinary Muslim,” tells the story of Azeem Bhatti and his wife, Saima Khan, as they navigate the complicated intersection of their Pakistani heritage and contemporary British culture.

"To the Editor: Re “Trump Quiet in a U.S. War on Meddling” (news analysis, front page, Feb. 18): After the 9/11 terror attacks, Americans remembered the horror of that day and mobilized at every level to both recover and push back against our enemies. We understood that such terrorists were an existential threat. Now, after the established Russian cyberattacks intended to divide Americans and to tip the election in Donald Trump’s favor, we are once more looking to our leaders for recovery and pushback. If President Trump refuses or is unable for some reason to provide that leadership, then others must fill that vacuum. Russia is not our friend; Russia is an enemy bent on destabilizing our country and weakening our position among nations. MARY F. WARREN, WHEATON, ILL. To the Editor: President Trump apparently fears that acknowledging Russian interference in the 2016 election would delegitimize his presidency. His first response to the recent indictments and evidence that Russians interfered in that election was to tweet, “No collusion.” But his refusal to acknowledge the continuing threat, and direct the resources of our government to stop it, amounts to that very complicity. This abject failure to preserve, protect and defend our constitutional right to free and fair elections from a foreign threat makes him unfit to be president. PETER MOORE, SEATTLE To the Editor: I do wish that all living former presidents would raise their voices in unison to counter President Trump’s selfishness, ignorance, and lies and distortions of the truth, and so affirm the American way of life and government.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump — under pressure from angry, grieving students from a Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last week — ordered the Justice Department on Tuesday to issue regulations banning so-called bump stocks, which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons like those used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas. A day earlier, Mr. Trump signaled that he was open to supporting legislation that would modestly improve the national gun background check system, and on Tuesday night, he posted on Twitter that Democrats and Republicans “must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!” But Mr. Trump’s first embrace as president of any gun control measures was dismissed by gun control supporters as minor. The National Rifle Association supports the background check legislation and also backs bump stock regulation, although not an outright ban. Speaking at the White House days after a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Mr. Trump said that he had directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to develop the regulations. “We cannot merely take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,” Mr. Trump said at a ceremony as he conferred the medal of valor on public safety officials. “We must actually make a difference.” In Florida on Tuesday, the Republican-controlled State House rejected an effort to immediately consider a bill to ban large-capacity magazines and the type of assault rifles used in last week’s attack, even as students from Stoneman Douglas High School watched from the gallery.

"Many months after it became clear that Russians exploited Facebook to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, the reach and impact of Russia’s activities on the social network are still not fully known. The indictment announced on Friday in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, charged 13 Russians and does not accuse Facebook or Instagram of any wrongdoing. But the names of those two networks appear 41 times in the indictment. The dribble of information about Russian actors’ use of Facebook, as well as confusing messages coming from the company, has raised even more questions. Here’s a look at what we know and what other information Facebook might be able to provide. So far, Facebook executives have implied that the influence campaign was minor in the scheme of things. The company has released numbers that suggest the Russians reached a large number of people. In testimony to Congress last year, Colin Stretch, Facebook’s general counsel, said that roughly 126 million people may have been “served content” from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll factory, over a two-year period. But Mr. Stretch added that this content was a smidgen of the total content available across Facebook: And on Friday, Rob Goldman, Facebook’s vice president for ads, noted that more than half of the Russian Facebook ads (56 percent) were served after the 2016 election.

"UNITED NATIONS — In a heated session of the United Nations Security Council that appeared to serve little but to reinforce intractable divisions between Israelis and Palestinians, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, accused Israel of acting like “a state above the law,” before Israel’s ambassador said that Mr. Abbas was “part of the problem.” Amid the name-calling, no one seemed to acknowledge the surprise presence of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, who sat quietly with the American delegation in the Security Council chamber. Mr. Trump has charged him with forging “the ultimate deal” between the Israelis and Palestinians, though there has been little movement on that front. Mr. Abbas was appearing before the Security Council for only the second time, after a 2011 visit in which he advocated Palestinian statehood. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Abbas expressed an “absolute readiness to reach a historic peace agreement,” but said the United States had “not clarified its position.” For his part, the Israeli ambassador, Danny Danon, praised the Trump administration for “working very hard to make progress toward peace.” Mr. Kushner was joined in the Council chamber by Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, with whom he is said to be drafting a peace proposal. No details about that proposal were publicly revealed at the United Nations on Tuesday, though Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt held an hourlong closed-door meeting with the Security Council after the session. Josh Raffel, a White House spokesman, said the administration was still working on its plan, “which is designed to benefit both the Israeli and Palestinian people.” "
"MELBOURNE, Australia — More than five years ago, on two different continents and only days apart, an Australian woman and an Australian man entered indefinite detention. For the woman, a defense lawyer at the International Criminal Court, being arrested was a relatively brief but harrowing affair, punctuated by armed men, dark rooms and aggressive interrogation. For the man, a co-founder of WikiLeaks, detention continues, though some might say voluntarily. The lawyer, Melinda Taylor, would go on to represent the man, Julian Assange. Ms. Taylor, now 42, has earned a reputation for defending the rights of individuals condemned by the court of public opinion before they have set foot inside an actual courtroom. Her clients have included Mr. Assange and Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan strongman. Mr. Assange, perhaps best known for publishing leaked United States military documents, has remained inside the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012, after the Swedish authorities issued a warrant for his arrest over a rape accusation. He made headlines again in January when Ecuador announced it had granted him citizenship, and planned to give him diplomatic status, in an effort to evict him from the embassy without his being extradited. Though Sweden is no longer seeking his extradition, Mr. Assange has said he fears that the United States will prosecute him over the document leaks. “I think the situation is untenable, and that there has to be a solution now, not later,” Ms. Taylor said of Mr. Assange. “He’s at risk of an ongoing prosecution by the United States.” "

"WASHINGTON — A federal judge blocked AT&T’s move to obtain communication logs between the Justice Department and the White House on Tuesday, hampering the phone giant’s argument that politics played a role in the government’s decision to halt a merger with Time Warner. Judge Richard J. Leon of United States District Court in Washington, who is overseeing a trial over the deal, said AT&T did not sufficiently show in pretrial discussions that it was treated differently from other companies. “Defendants have fallen far short of establishing that this enforcement action was selective,” Judge Leon said. The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. The merger would transform the media landscape by combining a television and movie giant with one of the nation’s biggest media distributors. “We respect the judge’s decision and look forward to the upcoming trial,” said Dan Petrocelli, lead trial lawyer for both Time Warner and AT&T. In a statement, the Justice Department said, “We are pleased with and respect today’s decision, which will permit the parties and court to focus on the case at hand.” "

On Sunday, Chazzie and five other transgender children and teenagers from across the country hung out in an elegant prewar apartment on the Upper West Side, ahead of their Tuesday appearance on NBC’s “Megyn Kelly Today.” For some, it would be their news media debut.

"MONTREAT, N.C. — The Rev. Billy Graham will lie in repose Monday and Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., and his funeral will be held on March 2, a family spokesman said late Wednesday.

The procession will end at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, where the public can pay respects while he lies in repose. Mr. Graham, 99, died on Wednesday at his home in Montreat, N.C., about 20 miles east of Asheville. Mr. DeMoss said the funeral to be held on March 2 would be private.

"WASHINGTON — Whenever there is a mass shooting, the National Rifle Association has a well-rehearsed response: Say very little until the inevitable discussion about gun control cools down. But as the leaders of the country’s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization’s online video channel. Its hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a “deep state” campaign to undermine President Trump. “Coastal, socialist media elites hate guns so much,” said one of the hosts, Grant Stinchfield, a Second Amendment activist based in Dallas and a radio commentator, that they would take everyone’s away, “leaving only criminals, of course, with the firepower — and all of us at the mercy of evil.” Critics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization’s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House.

"WASHINGTON — Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly heckled at a nationally televised forum on Wednesday night in Florida after they refused to back new gun control measures. The spokeswoman for the N.R.A., Dana Loesch, offering the group’s first public comments after a shooting last week at a Florida high school, strongly defended the gun advocacy group’s positions in front of students and teachers from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “People who are crazy should not be able to get firearms,” she said, insisting that enforcement of mental health laws, not new gun restrictions, would prevent future massacres. Mr. Rubio, Republican of Florida, also drew the ire of the crowd for refusing to support a ban on assault weapons and for saying that he intended to continue accepting money from the N.R.A. and other groups that support his pro-gun agenda. Ms. Loesch and Mr. Rubio appeared during the two-hour forum, broadcast on CNN from a site near Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Fla., knowing full well that they would be assailed by the gathering of people directly affected by the mass shooting last week. President Trump and Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, both declined invitations to participate in the town hall-style meeting. "
"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court issued four decisions on Wednesday, including ones on international terrorism, whistle-blowers in securities cases and civil rights suits filed by prisoners. The court unanimously rejected an attempt by victims of three 1997 suicide bombings in Jerusalem to seize Iranian artifacts housed at the University of Chicago. The plaintiffs had won a $71.5 million judgment against Iran, which they said had been responsible for the bombings. They sought to seize the artifacts — some 30,000 clay tablets and fragments bearing ancient writings known as the Persepolis collection — to help satisfy the judgment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, said the artifacts were shielded by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, a federal law that generally bars seizing the assets of foreign states. The law has some exceptions, but Justice Sotomayor said they did not apply to the antiquities. The Trump administration had filed a brief supporting Iran. “The United States emphatically condemns the terrorist actions that gave rise to this case, and expresses its deep sympathy for the victims and their family members who have pursued legal action against Iran,” it said. “The United States is committed to vigorously pursuing those responsible for violence against U.S. nationals.” But the brief argued that the exceptions in the immunities law did not apply. “The property at issue here consists of ancient Persian artifacts, documenting a unique aspect of Iran’s cultural heritage, that were lent to a U.S. institution in the 1930s for academic study,” the administration’s brief said. “Execution against such unique cultural artifacts could cause affront and reciprocity problems.” "
"Amy Chua has Donald J. Trump’s number. Not literally (I’m guessing), but unlike some of her elite peers at Yale University, where she teaches law, Chua isn’t endlessly flummoxed by the president’s ability to brag about how rich and “very greedy” he is while also resonating with his working-class supporters. As she explains in “Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations,” what Trump has figured out, whether through cynical deliberation or primordial reflex, is how tribalism works. As much as progressives try to define elitism in terms of money, the establishment that Trump and his supporters rail against is culturally — not economically — defined. “The tribal instinct is all about identification,” Chua writes. The president’s base “identifies with him at a gut level.” And it’s not as if elites get severed from their own gut feelings by their Ivy League degrees. “What these elites don’t see is how tribal their cosmopolitanism is,” she writes. “For well-educated, well-traveled Americans, cosmopolitanism is its own highly exclusionary clan, with clear out-group members and boogeymen — in this case, the flag-waving bumpkins.” With “Political Tribes,” Chua — who is perhaps best known for “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother” (2011), a not entirely ironic memoir about her severe “Chinese-style” (her words) parenting methods — is on familiar terrain. All of her books revolve around culture and identity. In “World on Fire” (2003), she described how introducing free markets and democracy to a country can inflame existing ethnic divisions. “Day of Empire” (2007) posited that global powers gained strength through cultural tolerance rather than exclusion. In “The Triple Package” (2014), she and her husband, Jed Rubenfeld, argued that specific cultural traits made for group success (a problematic provocation, to say the least). “Political Tribes” reads like a return to Chua’s pre-Tiger Mother work: accessible history structured around a simple thesis. Just as American elites don’t understand sectarianism at home, she argues, they don’t understand sectarianism abroad. Members of our foreign policy establishment are so enamored of market reforms and democratization that they’re “spectacularly blind to the power of tribal politics.” "

Elsewhere in Asia, a U.S. congressional delegation from the Senate and House Committee on Armed Services is visiting Taiwan, meeting there with President Tsai Ing-wen and her senior ministers, a dialogue likely to irritate Beijing officials. _____ "

"It is now tragically apparent that degrading the Islamic State has not created an opening for peace in Syria. Instead, the country’s vicious president, Bashar al-Assad, and his enablers in Russia and Iran have exploited the battlefield successes against ISIS to unleash a new round of carnage on civilians, as the leaders of the United States and other world powers largely stand by, unwilling or unable to do anything to stop it. Shame on them all. The Assad-led bombardment of eastern Ghouta, a Damascus suburb of about 400,000 people and one of the last rebel-held areas, is being called one of the most violent episodes of the seven-year war. Since Sunday at least 310 people, many of them children, have been killed. That’s in addition to nearly 500,000 Syrians killed countrywide since 2011. Ghouta has been under siege for years, although it’s technically part of a negotiated de-escalation zone, leaving the district facing chronic shortages of food, medicine, medical personnel and other necessities. This week’s massive attack — which has involved rocket fire, shelling, airstrikes and helicopter-dropped barrel bombs that struck hospitals and other civilian infrastructure — intensified the misery. It seems intended to force rebels to surrender so the government can reclaim the territory. Most of the civilian casualties resulted from airstrikes on residential areas, the United Nations’ human rights office said. There have been signs that a government ground assault may soon follow. Photos posted on social media are excruciating. Terrified children, faces and bodies covered in blood. Shrouded corpses lined up on dirty concrete floors. Wounded patients on gurneys writhing in agony, lacking medical attention or even drugs to ease their pain. António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, called Ghouta a “hell on Earth.” If there was any doubt about the barbarity of the pro-Assad forces, it was dispelled by Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan, leader of the government’s Tiger Force. “I promise, I will teach them a lesson, in combat and in fire,” he said in a video shared by pro-government social media accounts. “You won’t find a rescuer. And if you do, you will be rescued with water like boiling oil. You’ll be rescued with blood.” "
"WASHINGTON — The parents of the first lady, Melania Trump, have obtained lawful permanent residency in the United States, a lawyer for the couple confirmed Wednesday, but it remains unclear how or when the couple received their green cards. The lack of clarity about when and how Viktor and Amalija Knavs obtained their legal residencies raises questions about whether the couple secured their residency through family-based immigration, which President Trump calls chain migration and has said he wants to restrict. Immigration experts said it would have been the most direct, and most likely, way for Mrs. Trump’s parents, formerly of Slovenia, to get their green cards. Their immigration lawyer, Michael J. Wildes, declined to offer any details. “It’s a privilege to help this family, but I have to respect their privacy as well,” Mr. Wildes said in a brief interview. “Immigration is in our DNA,” he added. “We have to take great pride, no matter where somebody hails from, in that legacy.” Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, wrote in an email that she would not comment on Mrs. Trump’s parents because “they are not part of this administration, and deserve their privacy.” The Washington Post first reported the Knavses’ immigration status.

"Perhaps you read this week that Donald Trump has replaced James Buchanan as the worst president in the history of the United States. This was in a survey of experts in presidential politics — people who have an opinion about whether Chester A. Arthur was better than Martin Van Buren. Trump came in last, with a score of 12 out of 100. Choose the best way to look at this: A) Why are you reminding me about that man? Why can’t we talk about “Black Panther”? B) Never thought I’d reminisce about the good old days with Richard Nixon. C) Hey, at least it’s a story — nobody’s ever going to ask you what it was like living under Gerald Ford. D) God, I’m so tired of talking about Donald Trump. I hope this is going to lead to a discussion of James Buchanan. Good news! We are going to talk about James Buchanan right now. Perhaps you’re wondering how his fans are taking his promotion to second worst. "
"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Natasha Singer, a technology reporter for The Times in New York, discussed the tech she’s using. You report on digital privacy, health and education technology. What are your most important tools for doing your job? We’re living in a surveillance economy where sites and apps can track and categorize our every online move. In that ecosystem, encrypted communication services have become some of my most important reporting tools. For people who would rather not reach me through my corporate Gmail account at The Times, I use ProtonMail, an encrypted email service. I also use Signal, an encrypted text messaging and calling service. And I do some online research through Tor, a browser that masks your online address so sites can’t track your physical location. I also use DuckDuckGo, a search engine that doesn’t store your search history. My wariness of tracking developed when I was a cub reporter in Moscow. On one of my first stories there, I invited a Russian legislator, who was a democracy advocate, to lunch at a restaurant near the Kremlin. She arrived and immediately started combing through a vase of flowers on the table, checking for government listening devices. After that, I often interviewed Russian democracy activists during walks in local parks and forests. It made an impression on me that even the mere idea of being surveilled can chill people’s behavior. "
"The Trump administration is considering a North Carolina regulator who questions mainstream climate science to be the next White House environmental adviser, just weeks after withdrawing a previous nominee who held similar views. Donald van der Vaart, the former secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, said in a telephone interview that he had been in discussions with the White House for several positions in recent months, most recently to possibly lead the Council on Environmental Quality, which is responsible for coordinating federal environmental policy. In the interview, Mr. van der Vaart expressed skepticism about the extent to which humans have contributed to climate change, a view that puts him at odds with scientific findings and echoes the views of other senior administration officials. He also expressed a willingness to challenge the legal foundation of federal climate-change policy, the 2009 Environmental Protection Agency decision known as the “endangerment finding,” which declares that greenhouse gases are harmful to human health and must be regulated. “I’m not going to say ‘no,’” Mr. van der Vaart said when asked if he would support repealing the endangerment finding. Some activists who deny established climate-change science, like Myron Ebell at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, support Mr. van der Vaart’s potential nomination, saying he combines more than 25 years of regulatory experience with a unique background as both a lawyer and chemical engineer. In addition, Mr. Ebell said, Mr. van der Vaart’s climate views are closely aligned with those of the previous nominee, Kathleen Hartnett White, who was withdrawn from consideration this month. "
"Having failed in its effort to have Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration has been relentlessly trying to destroy the health care law on its own. The latest move in that demolition derby came this week, when officials proposed giving insurance companies more leeway to sell junk health plans. The Department of Health and Human Services wants to let companies sell temporary health insurance policies that last up to 364 days, up from 90 days now. Officials say that would benefit people who are struggling with rising health insurance costs, because the plans tend to be cheaper than those on the insurance exchanges created by the A.C.A., or Obamacare. Not mentioned in the department’s talking points is the fact that these policies often do not cover things like mental health services, substance abuse treatment, cancer drugs and maternity care. As a result, people who buy such skimpy plans could end up being hit with exorbitant bills if they actually need medical care. The Obama administration limited these short-term plans to three months because they are meant to be a stopgap for people between jobs or in other temporary situations. The Trump administration would effectively encourage younger and healthier people to stop buying comprehensive policies on the Obamacare exchanges. As a result, insurers selling A.C.A. plans would be left covering an older and sicker population, forcing them to increase premiums. This would not be devastating to most of the people who use exchanges, because they receive federal subsidies that limit how much they have to pay. But it could really hurt middle-class families who earn too much to qualify for government assistance (about $82,000 for a family of three) and are already facing big premium increases. People in this group would have the terrible predicament of spending a lot of money buying health insurance or taking a chance by buying a skimpy temporary plan, hoping that nobody in the family gets sick or injured. "
"Is there a duty, even for those who fear how President Trump governs, to serve in the administration? The debate, which began after Mr. Trump’s election, has often been revisited during his presidency, most recently when Rachel Brand resigned this month as associate attorney general. She said that she did it solely to take a “dream job” as Walmart’s top lawyer, but it’s easy to imagine that she also left because of the stress of serving in the Trump administration’s Justice Department. If so, she is not the only one finding government service difficult at this time. Even under the best circumstances, the hours for senior officials are often long and the pay is low compared with what colleagues in the private sector earn. Under Mr. Trump, the challenges are particularly daunting. The president and his senior advisers have little use for government professionals. Agencies from the State Department to the Bureau of Prisons are understaffed. The president has crossed once-bright ethical lines, refusing to release his tax returns or to completely dissociate himself from his business while hiring family members for critical positions. Most disturbingly, the president and his surrogates often attack government institutions, including many that are among America’s most respected. Mr. Trump declared the F.B.I. and the Justice Department “disgraceful” and even singled out some public servants by name. Most recently, it was his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, after he accused Russia of “disinformation, subversion and espionage.” The president promptly called him out in a tweet because the general “forgot to say” that it was “Crooked H, the D.N.C. and the Dems” who colluded with Russia. I’ve been a Trump critic, and I find this behavior appalling. But I still urge those in government and those thinking about joining — including my own students — to carry on. To know why, think about the opposite: What if people of character leave government and the best young people do not join? Government service as a noble profession has been under attack since at least the Reagan administration, and I worry that the Trump administration will be the last stage in a steady decline of respect for public service. Government then becomes a Fox News caricature of it — a collection of timeservers, toadies and incompetents. Such a turn would strengthen the argument for shrinking government further. "
"It was a day of tense exchanges, emotion-packed speeches and confrontation as lawmakers, students and parents sparred on Wednesday over what to do about shootings in American schools. From the nation’s capital to Florida’s State House, people affected by gun violence delivered pain-laced addresses to crowds of passionate supporters, and President Trump listened to a group he had summoned to discuss the problem. There was also some poignant symbolism. Here are some of the most remarkable moments: At an intense town hall-style meeting Wednesday night, Diane Wolk Rogers, a history teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., confronted a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association over the Second Amendment. How did allowing the 19-year-old shooter in last week’s massacre to own an assault rifle represent “a well-regulated militia” as is written in the amendment, she asked. “Using supporting detail,” Ms. Wolk Rogers said to thunderous applause at CNN’s “Stand Up” town hall, “explain to me how an 18-year-old with a military rifle is well regulated.” Dana Loesch, the national spokeswoman for the N.R.A., said the phrase in the Second Amendment was meant to protect the rights of anyone who “could operate and service their firearm.” Her answer was roundly booed. "
"Representative Claudia Tenney, a first-term Republican from Central New York, said in a radio interview on Wednesday that “so many” mass murderers “end up being Democrats.” Democrats immediately condemned her remarks, which came a week after 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Fla., and called on her to apologize for politicizing gun tragedies. One of Ms. Tenney’s colleagues in the House, Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat of Virginia, wrote on Twitter that she “owes America a sincere and abject apology.” And her expected Democratic challenger this year, State Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, said in his own Twitter post that her “toxic rhetoric” was “a new low” and that “inserting politics into a national tragedy is beyond the pale & disgusting.” It is not clear that any group keeps a list of the political affiliation of mass killers. The Southern Poverty Law Center released a report this month that counted 100 people killed or injured by “alleged perpetrators influenced by the so-called ‘alt-right’” between 2014 and 2018. Some individual shootings have appeared politically motivated, at least in part. James Hodgkinson, who opened fire last year on Republicans during their practice for an annual bipartisan congressional baseball game, had written anti-Trump and anti-Republican remarks on social media ahead of the attack. He wounded several people, including Representative Steve Scalise, a top Republican lawmaker, though only the gunman died in that shooting. Ms. Tenney made her sweeping claim on the “Focus on the State Capitol” radio program hosted by Fred Dicker. Ms. Tenney said she feared lawful gun owners “are going to be targeted now” even though “in their demographic they have the least amount of crimes of virtually any other demographic.” Mr. Dicker jumped in: “But they tend to be Republican. They tend to be white. Most gun crimes are occurring in what’s euphemistically called the inner cities involving minorities and they’re the ones the Democrats generally are going to bend over backwards to protect.” Ms. Tenney eventually continued, “Obviously there’s a lot of politics in it. And it’s interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats. But the media doesn’t talk about that either.” In a statement on Wednesday night, Ms. Tenney elaborated but didn’t provide information about her claim: “I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy. While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists.” Ms. Tenney, a former state legislator, was elected to Congress in 2016, and her district is expected to be among the most hotly contested in New York this fall.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A dramatic moment at the White House: A father who lost his daughter in the Parkland, Fla., massacre made an impassioned plea to President Trump to ensure school safety. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot?” asked Andrew Pollack, above. The president is facing mounting pressure to take action against gun violence. Mr. Trump said his administration would be “very strong on background checks” of those wishing to purchase guns, and put “a very strong emphasis on the mental health of somebody.” ____ 2. There were also tense moments at the Statehouse in Tallahassee, Fla., where students from Parkland demanded a ban on military-style firearms, like the one used to kill 17 people at their school. "
"The State of Mississippi on Wednesday awarded a tax break worth up to $6 million for a hotel project involving the Trump family business, a public subsidy that could indirectly benefit President Trump. The board of the Mississippi Development Authority approved the so-called tourism tax rebate, which had been requested by the development’s local owners, Dinesh and Suresh Chawla. The Trump Organization will brand and manage the hotel and collect fees from the Chawlas for doing so. The subsidy, to be paid out over a period of many years, is expected to offset nearly a third of the Chawlas’ projected $20 million in costs for building the hotel, which is scheduled to open this fall in Cleveland, Miss. The property, called Scion West End, is to be the first in a new line of four-star Scion hotels that the Trump Organization announced late in the 2016 presidential campaign. The state’s approval of the tax rebate is the culmination of more than two years of efforts by the Chawlas that predate their partnership with the Trumps, according to emails obtained by The New York Times through a public records request. After the Chawlas announced plans last June to team up with the Trumps, Suresh Chawla alerted an array of personal contacts and state and local officials, including an aide to Mississippi’s governor, Phil Bryant, in emails with the subject line “Trump Hotels Coming to the Mississippi Delta.” In December, the Chawlas formally applied for the tax rebate from the state development agency, which is led by Glenn McCullough Jr., an appointee of Mr. Bryant, both of whom are supportive of President Trump. In an email on Wednesday, Dinesh Chawla said he and his brother were pleased by the approval, though they said the development agency had not notified them of it. "
"WASHINGTON — When the sister of Kim Jong-un made her historic visit to the Winter Olympics in South Korea two weeks ago, saying nothing but commanding noisy press coverage, the South Korean news media quickly called her “North Korea’s Ivanka.” Now, President Trump is sending the real Ivanka. The question is whether Ms. Trump, with her fashion industry glamour, can counter the news media narrative set by a mysterious North Korean woman, Kim Yo-jong, who is a director of her totalitarian government’s propaganda and agitation department. White House officials recoil at any parallel between the dictator’s sister and the president’s daughter. But the comparison is obvious, if invidious, given their family pedigrees. And Ms. Trump may benefit by another comparison: to Vice President Mike Pence, who sat near Ms. Kim during the opening ceremony of the Olympics and seemed unable to strike the same chord as she did with South Koreans. He later missed out on a meeting with North Korean officials after they canceled at the last minute. Administration officials acknowledge that Ms. Trump, who will arrive in South Korea on Friday to watch the closing ceremony of the Games, could smooth some of the tensions that flared during the vice president’s visit, even if they insist that is not the purpose of her trip. While Mr. Pence met with North Korean defectors and condemned Mr. Kim for human rights abuses, officials said Ms. Trump would keep her focus on reaffirming the bonds between the United States and South Korea and cheering on American athletes. “Their talent, drive, grit and spirit embodies American excellence,” she said in a statement on Wednesday. "
"WASHINGTON — An anguished father mourning his 18-year-old daughter vented his anger and pleaded for safer schools. A fear-stricken student who watched classmates die last week wept openly as he called for banning assault weapons. A mother who lost her 6-year-old son in a school shooting just over five years ago warned that more parents would lose their children if President Trump did not act, adding, “Don’t let that happen on your watch.” One by one at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, survivors of school shootings and family members of victims shared their stories and their calls to action. The extraordinary public exchange with the president gave voice to an intensely emotional debate over how to respond to the latest gun massacre in an American school. A week after a gunman opened fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and prompting a rash of student-driven lobbying for new gun restrictions, Mr. Trump met for more than an hour with grieving people in search of solutions. News cameras captured the unusual listening session, revealing an emotional give-and-take between a president and private citizens that is typically shielded from public view. Mr. Trump used the event to pitch his own ideas about how to prevent such debacles in the future, polling the group about whether they supported allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed weapons, an idea he said could have halted the carnage in Parkland. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump attacked his own attorney general on Wednesday, asking in a Twitter post why Jeff Sessions has not been investigating Democrats for Russian interference in the 2016 election. In his tweet, Mr. Trump revived his offensive on Mr. Sessions, whom he once called “beleaguered,” and continued his days-long Twitter comments on the ongoing special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling. It was the latest instance of the president publicly criticizing federal law enforcement. Mr. Trump has been questioning why the Obama administration did not do more to stop Russian interference, and he has said that his administration has been tougher on Russia than that of his predecessor. “Why aren’t they the subject of the investigation?” Mr. Trump asked. The president regularly uses Twitter to question why the Justice Department is not investigating his political opponents. Mr. Trump has denied that Russia was involved in the 2016 election meddling. But an indictment announced last week against 13 Russians and three companies described a sophisticated, multiyear Russian influence campaign designed to sow discord across the American democratic process. On Tuesday, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, announced charges against the 19th person in the sprawling probe that has dogged Mr. Trump’s presidency. Mr. Trump does not think Mr. Sessions — one of his earliest supporters — has done enough to protect him from the Russia probe. The president has publicly said he never would have hired Mr. Sessions if he knew the attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia investigation. The attorney general’s recusal last year was the first in a series of steps that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Mr. Trump had once considered firing Mr. Mueller, but he backed down after the objection of a senior adviser. In recent months, Mr. Trump has become more critical of federal law enforcement and has called senior officials at the F.B.I. biased against him. "
"LONDON — A court in Bahrain sentenced a prominent democracy advocate on Wednesday to five years in prison for tweets about abuses in prisons and the Saudi-led war in Yemen, continuing the crackdown that crushed the Arab Spring uprising there seven years ago. The sentencing of the advocate, Nabeel Rajab, is the latest step in a long crackdown on dissent in Bahrain, a tiny island kingdom that is home to the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet. Backed by rulers in neighboring Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain’s Sunni Muslim royal family has used tanks, riot police officers, sweeping arrests and tight censorship to thwart demands for democracy among the Shiite Muslim majority, and the resulting conflict has inflamed sectarian tensions around the region. The repression has presented Washington with one of the most awkward conflicts between its professions of support for human rights and its military commitments in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Rajab, 53, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, is a leader of the pro-democracy movement that came to life in 2011, during the Arab Spring uprisings across the region. He was sentenced to three years in jail the next year, on charges of inciting protests against the government, and he has spent much of the intervening time in and out of prison on a series of charges related to his criticism of the monarchy. He is already serving a two-year sentence handed down in July for comments he made in television interviews, and faces more charges related to an Op-Ed published in The New York Times in 2016, “Letter From a Bahraini Jail.” In it, Mr. Rajab recounted a recent meeting with John Kerry, then the secretary of state “I would like to ask Mr. Kerry now: Is this the kind of ally America wants?” he wrote. “The kind that punishes its people for thinking, that prevents its citizens from exercising their basic rights?” Mr. Rajab was sentenced on Wednesday for statements he posted on Twitter in 2015. He was charged with “insulting national institutions” for accusing the authorities of torture at Jaw Prison, and sharing a report by Human Rights Watch that detailed conditions at the prison. He was charged with “insulting a neighboring country” for criticizing Saudi Arabia’s war against an Iranian-allied faction in Yemen, and he was accused of spreading false or malicious news during wartime because he faulted Bahrain for its participation in the Saudi-led coalition bombing Yemen. As those charges were pending, Mr. Rajab reiterated his criticisms last May in another opinion column in The New York Times appealing to President Trump on the eve of his trip to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. “It fills me with shame that my country, Bahrain, is bombing Yemen, with United States support,” Mr. Rajab wrote, adding, “What I have endured is a small fraction of what the people of Yemen have suffered, largely because of the military intervention of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and their allies.” "
"Few people expected that the Pennsylvania congressional map, which the state Supreme Court ordered redrawn to undo Republican gerrymandering, would prove to be as favorable to Democrats as the one adopted by the court on Monday. Perhaps the easiest way to convey the cause for surprise: The new map is better for Democrats — by nearly every measure — than the maps that Democrats themselves proposed. How could that be? It is hard to explain.  Perhaps all four Democratic map proposals reflected an earnest effort to reach a compromise with Republicans. The more likely explanation is that Democrats did not believe it was realistic to demand such a favorable map, since it would require a series of Democratic-leaning choices. And the court order did not specify that the maps should aim for partisan balance, which might have justified a more Democratic map. Apparently, a more favorable map was quite realistic; after all, it is now a reality, one that gives a significant boost to Democratic hopes of retaking the House. It’s a reality because the newly adopted map consistently makes subtle choices that nudge districts in the direction of Democrats. Many of those choices are easy to spot on a map. Every potentially competitive Republican-held district juts out to add Democratic areas, like adding York to the 10th District, Lansdale to the First District, Reading to the Sixth District, Stroudsburg to the Seventh District, South Philadelphia to the Fifth District, or Mount Lebanon and Penn Hills to the 17th.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Syria’s ever-more-brutal war, Poland’s fight over the future of Europe and the latest from the Olympics. Here’s the news: •  The Syrian government, with its Russian and Iranian allies, is fighting to regain control of western Syria, whatever the cost. Violence that has been escalating over weeks hit a sudden peak. Syrian and Russian planes struck eastern Ghouta, a rebel-held enclave near Damascus, in one of the worst bombardments in years. At least 200 people, many of them children, were reported killed. And Turkish jets and artillery attacked pro-government militias for a second day to keep them from reaching the northwestern city of Afrin to reinforce Kurdish militias. The Syrian government’s support for the Kurds threatens to unravel months of diplomatic maneuvering by Russia and Iran. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. After a shooting left 17 people dead at a Florida high school last week, Stephen Colbert expressed solidarity on Tuesday with the students who are calling for gun control legislation. And he lashed out at politicians who oppose these measures. On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah expressed disgust with commentators on Fox News who suggested that gun control measures would not prevent school shootings. Noah mocked them for suggesting more creative — and, he thought, harebrained — solutions. On Tuesday’s “Late Show,” Colbert also took a moment to highlight the most recent allegations of infidelity that have emerged against President Trump. The New Yorker recently published a report that the onetime Playboy model Karen McDougal had engaged in an affair with Trump in 2006, the same year he allegedly started an affair with the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Colbert was particularly amused that The National Enquirer reportedly paid $150,000 for the story, but decided not to run it. "
"In January, you became the first woman nominated for an Oscar for best cinematography, for your work on “Mudbound.” Did you know that it was going to be a male-dominated profession when you first started out? I don’t know that I was entirely conscious of it, because I started in photography, which is closer to 50-50. There’s this idea that there are more female cinematographers now because cameras are lighter, which is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. Cinematography speaks to everything that women do inherently well: It’s multitasking, it’s empathy and it’s channeling visuals into human emotion. Little by little, I realized that I was an anomaly, but I tried not to focus on it, or to, at least, see it as a way to stand out in the crowd and bring something to the table that most people don’t. What movies did you first see that made you think about cinematography? I gravitate much more toward realism realism in the work that I do, but magical realism got me hooked on film. I think it was my first time realizing that there was something besides popcorn movies. I caught the Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro bug: “Delicatessen,” “The City of Lost Children.” Wong Kar-wai’s “Chungking Express,” “Happy Together” and “Fallen Angels.” Emir Kusturica’s “Time of the Gypsies” and “Black Cat, White Cat.” It was a reflection of the literature I liked: Gabriel García Márquez and Salman Rushdie. “Mudbound” feels like a very timely movie, with its focus on racism and rural poverty. When I read the script, Obama was president. We didn’t ever think in a million years Trump would get elected. I thought it was timeless, but I didn’t realize it would be as timely as it ultimately proved to be. What were your inspirations for shooting it? The Farm Security Administration photographers were a huge part of my inspiration for “Mudbound.” I was always very much interested in photojournalistic work — people like Robert Capa, James Nachtwey, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks. It was always about capturing human emotion in a very real, authentic way. "
"WASHINGTON — Mitt Romney did not vote for Donald J. Trump in 2016. Representative Martha McSally of Arizona may not have, either, but she will not say. And Senator Dean Heller of Nevada now insists that he did cast his ballot for Mr. Trump, but for many months, he would not reveal his vote. Senator Bob Corker supported Mr. Trump, but seemed to regret it last year when he concluded that the country had deposited an unruly toddler in the Oval Office. Yet as these Republicans pursue a Senate run this year — or in the case of Mr. Corker, reconsiders one — they are essentially making peace with a president they once shunned. Their hopes for a détente with Mr. Trump, who effectively staged a hostile takeover of a party he joined only in 2012, reflect the realization that rank-and-file Republicans have come to embrace the president. There is little appetite on the right for Trump skeptics in the halls of Congress. “To the activists, those who vote consistently in Republican primaries, it’s very much Trump’s party,” said Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who effectively decided against running for re-election because he did not want to accommodate such voters. The reversals by Mr. Trump’s onetime foes are as revealing as they are glaring. Mr. Corker, who once suggested that the president required day care and that he might blunder the country into World War III, has mounted a charm offensive to win back the president’s affection — a prerequisite if the senator is to delay his retirement plans and capture the Republican nomination in Tennessee. Mr. Romney, who in 2016 excoriated Mr. Trump as an amoral con man, graciously accepted the president’s Twitter-born endorsement on Monday night. Their change of heart has triggered no small amount of eye-rolling. Yet while both men have been accused of acting out of expedience by the left and among the thinning ranks of anti-Trump Republicans, what is striking is how easy a president often consumed with slights has made it for his former critics to bind up old wounds.

"Two of the most important facts about the global economy over the last decade are these: A giant financial crisis led to mass unemployment in many countries and years of disappointing growth. And despite a seeming barrage of technological innovation, productivity growth has been the weakest in decades. Maybe it’s not a coincidence. That is the provocative conclusion of new research from the McKinsey Global Institute, the in-house think tank of the consulting giant, that suggests we should change how we think about the advancements that make society richer over time. It implies that as the economy returns to full employment, an outburst of faster growth in productivity — and hence economic growth — is a real possibility.            This idea should excite both conservatives and liberals. It suggests that the Trump administration’s ambitions for faster growth driven by rising productivity aren’t as outlandish as warier forecasters have argued. And it tends to back arguments by liberal-leaning commentators that the Federal Reserve ought to move cautiously in raising interest rates, in hope that the economy will more fully repair itself from damage caused by the 2008 recession and its aftermath. For years, McKinsey researchers have tried to understand what drives productivity growth from the ground up. They’ve studied how innovations that enable a company to make more goods and services per hour of labor spread across the economy. The latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy — what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it — but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don’t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials,  forces them to think creatively about how to do so.

"WASHINGTON — Border Patrol officers are working without permission on private property and setting up checkpoints up to 100 miles away from the border under a little-known federal law that is being used more widely in the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. In Texas, a rancher has accused the Border Patrol of trespassing after he said he found a surveillance camera the agency placed on his property. In New Hampshire, border officers working with state officials conducted what the American Civil Liberties Union described as illegal drug searches after residents were arrested at immigration checkpoints set up on a major interstate highway. One of the checkpoints was set up just before a local marijuana festival. And recently in Florida, New York and Washington State, Border Patrol officers have been criticized for boarding buses and trains to question riders — mostly American citizens — about their immigration status. Trump administration officials defend the government’s decades-old authority to search people and property, even without a warrant, far from the border. They call it a vital part of preventing weapons, terrorists and other people from illegally entering the United States. But officials conceded that some of the searches — particularly those aboard Greyhound buses or Amtrak trains on domestic routes — had increased since the Obama administration. And under President Trump, field supervisors have regained the authority to order the searches, instead of officials at Border Patrol headquarters in Washington. "
"SYDNEY, Australia — President Trump’s infamous first phone call with Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was classic Trump: demanding, transactional and eager to reject established agreements. But when the two leaders meet in Washington on Friday, that call will be treated as dead and gone. Officials and experts argue that Mr. Trump and Mr. Turnbull have become closer over the past year — especially as the United States seeks to play a larger role in the region, countering China and North Korea. “Strategically, we’re very aligned,” said Amy Searight, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The alliance is becoming more and more important as an anchor for regional stability.” Even as Mr. Trump’s provocative approach to foreign affairs has rattled some of America’s traditional alliances, Australia has adapted and found points of connection. Here’s a look at the three most important issues that are reshaping relations between Australia and the United States — and the challenges that both countries face in trying to work through them. "
"Seated in her Brooklyn studio, Kara Walker laughed often when recounting the process of building a performative sculpture, “Katastwóf Karavan,” for Prospect New Orleans. Its title incorporates the Haitian Creole word for “catastrophe,” and the artist’s two-year journey to make the work was a long, strange trip indeed. The piece was intended to debut with the rest of this citywide triennial for art in November, but a blowup between the organizers and Ms. Walker, as well as the complicated and expensive nature of the piece, forced them to present it as a coda of sorts. The long-delayed installation goes on view Feb. 23 to 25 — the final weekend for “Prospect.4: The Lotus in Spite of the Swamp.” Located in Algiers Point right on the Mississippi River, the sculpture is a large pioneer-style wagon whose sides feature Ms. Walker’s signature silhouettes in water-cut steel, depicting violent scenes between masters and slaves in the Old South. Inside, there is a custom steam-powered calliope (a propane tank heats water in a boiler, turning it into steam, which creates sound through large locomotive-style whistles). It will play songs of “black protest and celebration,” the artist said, both programmed and live, at regular intervals, by the jazz pianist Jason Moran. “We Shall Overcome” and the Marvin Gaye hit “What’s Going On?” are both on the playlist. Ms. Walker admitted to going down several “rabbit holes” in an effort to make a piece that satisfied her: The self-funded fabrication cost her $250,000. She created small, 10-inch-long versions and sold them to recoup some expenses. Although now she’s calm, cool and collected, she also recounted being “very angry” with the Prospect organizers in the fall when she got their email questioning the cost of shipping the piece from New York to New Orleans and its presentation. Fences were eventually mended, Prospect paid, and “everything has been on track” since the beginning of the year, she said. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • An outcry echoed across the U.S. on Tuesday, as lawmakers were pressed again to take action after a deadly mass shooting. President Trump called for a ban on so-called bump stocks, devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to be fired more quickly, although they weren’t involved in the attack at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last week. (Watch how bump stocks work.) The president has also signaled that he’s open to legislation to strengthen the national system for background checks, a measure the National Rifle Association also supports. • Nevertheless, gun control activists said they were bracing for another disappointing battle with lawmakers.

"President Trump’s tough talk on trade and the tariffs he recently imposed on imported washing machines and solar panels, as well as the ones he threatened on foreign steel and aluminum, would seem straight out of the populist playbook. But in terms of targeting the real grievances of his popular base, they largely miss the mark. The early history of American populism, culminating in the New Deal, suggests a more productive and less damaging kind of populism. When populism succeeds, it does so not by cosmetic gimmicks but by going after the roots of economic injustice directly. At the 1896 Democratic National Convention, the 36-year-old former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan delivered what became one of the most famous lines of American political oratory: “You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” Bryan’s immediate target was the gold standard, an emblem of the globalization of his day, which he blamed for the economic difficulties of what he called the “toiling masses.” Bryan ran for president that year as the joint candidate of the Democratic Party and of the People’s Party, also known as the Populist Party. The populists of the late 19th century had many grievances, but the flames of their discontent were fanned by opposition to economic globalization. Under the gold standard, markets for money, goods, capital and labor had become intertwined among nations as never before. As John Maynard Keynes would later rue, a well-to-do inhabitant in a major capital city like London “could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.” Global competition also drove American agricultural prices down. And the rules of the gold standard enforced tight money and credit conditions — what we would today call austerity policies. The consequent economic distress among farmers in the South and the West fueled the populist movement. The populists viewed the railroads as well as the financial and commercial interests of the Northeast, the defenders of the gold standard, as their main opponents. Throwing off the shackles of the gold standard and reclaiming national monetary sovereignty became their rallying cry. Populism in the 21st century is as much a reaction to globalization as its late-19th-century version. While the backlash in the United States and Europe differs in specific details, the broad outlines are similar. Large segments of the workers in these advanced economies — older, less-skilled manufacturing employees and the communities they live in — have seen their earnings decline or stagnate and their relative social status take a big hit. These groups see governments as increasingly in the pocket of financial and business elites, the big winners of globalization. The discontent in turn fuels populist leaders who promise to wrest control from faceless global market forces and re-empower the nation-state. "

"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What it takes to be a whistle-blower. • Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid. • Untangling the productivity mystery. • How Skadden got involved in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up.  Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower. A provision in the Dodd-Frank Act defines a “whistle-blower” as someone who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.” That seems simple enough, but the Securities and Exchange Commission made something of a hash out of the requirement by taking an expansive view in a rule aimed at protecting an employee from retaliation even if the person only reports information internally. In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.’s rule. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition—tell the S.E.C.—Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, a media mea culpa. It’s not easy to be self-critical in public. So kudos to Perry Bacon Jr. for his new FiveThirtyEight piece, “How the media bungled the John Kelly story.” Bacon includes himself — and many others — among those who misjudged the goals of President Trump’s chief of staff, and Bacon tries to understand why. His honesty makes his argument more persuasive. Tax politics. The Republican playbook on taxes looks like this: Package a huge tax cut for the rich with a small tax cut for everyone else, and then criticize Democrats for being against middle-class tax cuts. It’s been a mostly successful strategy, too. In 2008, President Barack Obama finally came up with a successful response. He proposed larger middle-class tax cuts than John McCain, his opponent, and kept bragging about those cuts. By the final weeks of the race, Americans saw Obama as more of a tax cutter than McCain was. Today’s Democrats are at risk of being dragged back into the old politics of tax cuts. Since President Trump’s tax bill passed, Republicans keep talking about the middle-class benefits in the law, and the poll numbers for both Trump and congressional Republicans have risen. Recent television ads in Indiana and Missouri — taken out by the Koch brothers’ advocacy group — are typical. They’re meant to damage those states’ Democratic senators, who are both running for re-election. “Senator Claire McCaskill said she’d support tax cuts for hard-working Missourians,” the narrator in one ad says, “but when she had the chance, she said no, voting against tax cuts for you, standing with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, instead of us.” "
"Hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — young adult immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children — could face possible deportation unless Congress can find a solution in the coming weeks. In September, President Trump announced he would not renew the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, that provides these young people with certain temporary protections. The program is set to expire on March 5. What should Congress do? What should Americans who care about this issue do? In this lesson, students learn more about the immigrants affected by this political standoff; evaluate the policy proposals being debated; and explore ways to have their voices heard on one of the most contentious issues in American politics. _________ Warm Up Barometer or Paired Activity: Share the four statements below with students and ask them to decide whether they agree or disagree with each. You may choose to have them spend a few minutes writing why they agree or disagree as well. Agree or Disagree Statements: • Throughout American history, immigrants have helped make the United States a better, stronger nation.
• New immigrants continue to make the United States a better, stronger nation.
• Undocumented immigrants living in the United States should be allowed to live, work and raise families here, and should only be deported if they commit serious crimes.
• Immigrants who enter or stay in the United States without the appropriate legal documents are breaking the rules. They are not vetted like other immigrants, and they are not waiting in line the way the system requires. If you do this as a barometer activity, post the terms “Strongly Agree” and “Strongly Disagree” at opposite ends of the classroom. Ask students to stand up and move to a spot in the classroom that most aligns with their beliefs about each statement. After you have read a statement and students have taken a stand on the continuum, ask a few volunteers to explain why they decided to stand where they did. If you choose to do this in pairs, have students talk together about their reactions. In both cases, you may want to first set ground rules about the language students should use to ensure that discussion of these issues is respectful. "
"The Rev. Billy Graham, a North Carolina farmer’s son who preached to millions in stadium events he called crusades, becoming a pastor to presidents and the nation’s best-known Christian evangelist for more than 60 years, died on Wednesday at his home in Montreat, N.C. He was 99. His death was confirmed by Jeremy Blume, a spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Mr. Graham had dealt with a number of illnesses in his last years, including prostate cancer, hydrocephalus (a buildup of fluid in the brain) and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Mr. Graham spread his influence across the country and around the world through a combination of religious conviction, commanding stage presence and shrewd use of radio, television and advanced communication technologies. A central achievement was his encouraging evangelical Protestants to regain the social influence they had once wielded, reversing a retreat from public life that had begun when their efforts to challenge evolution theory were defeated in the Scopes trial in 1925. But in his later years, Mr. Graham kept his distance from the evangelical political movement he had helped engender, refusing to endorse candidates and avoiding the volatile issues dear to religious conservatives. “If I get on these other subjects, it divides the audience on an issue that is not the issue I’m promoting,” he said in an interview at his home in North Carolina in 2005 while preparing for his last American crusade, in New York City. “I’m just promoting the Gospel.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It is usually jazz that plays in the background at Eso Won Books, a cherished independent bookseller in Los Angeles that for almost three decades has catered to African-American readers, but sometimes it is David Bowie, Nirvana or just really loud rock music. James Fugate came to Los Angeles from Detroit in the late 1980s, and after a short time running the bookstore at Compton College, he and his partners opened their own store in South Los Angeles. The bookstore has been open nearly every day since — only once or twice, in Mr. Fugate’s memory, has it closed. Once, he said, was in 2006, when Barack Obama, then a senator, came to town for a book signing and the crowds were too large for his shop to accommodate. February is Black History Month, and there are still events to catch all over the city — at the Los Angeles Public Library, which is hosting art exhibitions, dance performances and a genealogy workshop; at the California African-American Museum; and the Aquarium of the Pacific, which is hosting a festival this weekend. (For listings of events, click here and here.) And at Eso Won Books, whose space has long been a gathering place for black intellectual life in the Leimert Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles, every month is Black History Month. Two presidents have visited — Mr. Obama and Bill Clinton — and Ta-Nehisi Coates has called Eso Won his favorite bookstore in the world. These days the store’s best-selling book is “When They Call You a Terrorist,” by Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter. “Fire and Fury,” the inside look at the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, has also been a big seller. Yet even as black heritage is being celebrated, there are persistent anxieties over demographic shifts that in recent decades has seen South Los Angeles — although not Leimert Park itself — tilt from a predominantly black area to one dominated by Latinos. “Anyone that walks through our doors, we are going to help them,” said Mr. Fugate, who owns the store with his partner, Tom Hamilton. “If they are Hispanic, and they need something, a book we don’t carry, yeah we’ll be happy to order it for them.” The same goes, he said, for the white woman who visits with a list of mystery books.

"To the Editor: On the wall in my office is a 1996 photograph taken in Budapest. Among the 10 portrayed facing the camera are a former president of Hungary, Arpad Goncz; Louis Freeh, then the F.B.I. director; Janet Reno, then the attorney general; and me. We were celebrating the first anniversary of the 1995 founding of the International Law Enforcement Academy. The brainchild of Mr. Freeh, the Budapest-based academy supports training for law enforcement personnel from 26 countries in Central and Eastern Europe and in Central Asia. In 2005, Robert S. Mueller III, then the F.B.I. director, attended the academy’s 10th anniversary celebrations. Mr. Freeh, the Hungarian government and I had two goals in mind: training law enforcement personnel in the former Soviet bloc in appropriate policing and investigative methods, as enjoyed by the United States and Western Europe, and encouraging these disparate police officials to begin to talk to one another, a practice unknown in the Communist days. The results in uprooting crime and heading off terrorism have been outstanding. I am persuaded that neither President Trump nor Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who released the memo critical of the F.B.I., has ever heard of the academy, but the American public deserves to know how its interests are being effectively served by the F.B.I. throughout Central and Eastern Europe.

"There are two Russian scandals connected to the 2016 campaign. One deserves the attention that it’s getting. The other is closer to — what’s the term I’m looking for? — fake news. The real scandal involves the Russian hacking operation against the Democratic National Committee. This was a genuine crime, a meaningful theft, which led to a series of leaks that were touted by the Republican nominee for president often enough that we can assume that Donald Trump, at least, thought they contributed something to his victory. The fact that members of his family and inner circle were willing and eager to meet with Russians promising hacked emails, the pattern of lies and obfuscation from the president and his team thereafter, and the general miasma of Russian corruption hanging around Trump campaign staff — all of this more than justifies Robert Mueller’s investigation, and depending on what his team ultimately reports it might even justify impeachment. But alongside and around this real scandal you have the other Russian efforts to influence the election and its aftermath, the outlines of which have been apparent for some time, but which have earned a new wave of agitated attention thanks to Mueller’s battery of indictments against a Russian troll farm and the various goblins, kobolds and boggarts it employed. Their efforts added up to a lot of social media activity and a few events in meatspace, in which the Russians had the clever idea to organize demonstrators on both sides of our great American divide. Memes were distributed, millions of dollars spent, fake accounts employed — all to encourage not just the specific political goal of elevating Trump (and Bernie Sanders) and discrediting both party establishments, but the broader ambition of widening our internal fissures, inflaming our debates, making our imperium more ungovernable at home and thus weaker on the global stage. Such conduct is certainly worthy of indictment, legal and rhetorical. What it is not worth is paranoia and hysteria, analogies to Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11 attacks, and an “America under attack”/“hacking our democracy” panic that give the Russian trolls far too much credit for cleverness and influence and practical success. Because on the evidence we have, nothing they did particularly mattered. The D.N.C. hack was genuinely important because it involved a real theft and introduced a variable into the campaign that would not otherwise have been present. But the rest of the Russian effort did not introduce anything to the American system that isn’t already present; it just reproduced, often in lousy or ludicrous counterfeits, the arguments and images and rhetorical tropes that we already hurl at one another every day.

In this edition: Pyeongchang’s environmental legacy, an interview with a Trump adviser who resigned last week and a look at climate education in the United States. Last month, we told you about how climate change may limit the available sites for future Winter Olympics. The organizers of the Pyeongchang Games say they want to do their part to limit their impact on global warming. That raises a question: How sustainable are the Olympics? The Pyeongchang organizing committee estimates the Games will generate 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, of which roughly a third will come from transporting athletes and spectators to South Korea and housing them. The emissions total is a bit more than Barbados produces in a year. The organizers are raising funds to buy carbon offsets, but how much they secure won’t be finalized until the end of the month. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday enthusiastically embraced a National Rifle Association position to arm highly trained teachers to fortify schools against mass shootings like the one last week. Mr. Trump, who said the armed teachers should receive extra pay as an incentive, promoted his idea as demands for stronger gun control intensified across the country. “You give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free, you have now made the school into a hardened target,” Mr. Trump said. The president estimated that 10 percent to 40 percent of school employees would be qualified to handle a weapon — he offered no data for the claim — and said he would devote federal money to training them. Mr. Trump has cycled through a number of proposals — including some gun limits deemed unacceptable by the N.R.A. — in the days since the rampage killed 14 students and three adults last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. On Thursday, he returned to an idea championed by the gun rights group. “I don’t want teachers to have guns, I want certain highly adept people, people that understand weaponry, guns — if they really have that aptitude,” Mr. Trump said during his second White House meeting in two days to discuss how to respond to the latest school shooting in the United States. He promoted the idea even as a sheriff’s deputy who had been the only armed guard at the high school resigned on Thursday after surveillance video showed that he never tried to enter the school to confront the shooter. Tim Burton, a Coral Springs police officer assigned to a nearby elementary school who responded to the shooting, said in an interview on Wednesday that he had seen the deputy, Scot Peterson, in a school parking lot, “seeking cover behind a concrete column leading to a stairwell.” "
"President Trump’s nominee to lead the Indian Health Service has withdrawn his name from consideration for the position, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Humans Services said Wednesday. The withdrawal of the nominee, Robert Weaver, follows Wall Street Journal reports that said he had inaccurately represented his qualifications to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs after his nomination in October. Mr. Weaver joins a growing list of Trump nominees who have withdrawn from consideration after questions arose about their fitness for their assigned posts. Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico and the vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, said in a statement that the move seemed “appropriate given the serious questions recently raised about his suitability to lead a vitally important health agency.” Mr. Udall has not yet received a formal notice of the withdrawal. The Indian Health Service could not immediately be reached for comment. Neither could Mr. Weaver. According to The Journal, Mr. Weaver, a member of the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma, claimed that he had previously held a supervisory position at St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Joplin, Mo. But former hospital officials said that they did not recognize his name, The Journal said, and that they believed Mr. Weaver’s role had involved entry-level duties, such as registering patients. The Journal later reported that Mr. Weaver, who had asserted his financial management skills to the Senate committee, had failed to perform important financial duties in a recent position. The Indian Health Service, a branch of the Department for Health and Human Services, provides care for 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in 36 states. The agency, tasked with providing health services to some of the nation’s most rural regions, has long been plagued by financial and leadership troubles. A 2016 inspection by the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that staffing shortages at some Indian Health Service hospitals “sometimes force the hospital to turn patients away” and affect the ability of the hospitals to “ensure a sanitary environment.” In a statement Wednesday night, Mr. Udall urged the Trump administration to conduct a more comprehensive review of its next nominee to lead the agency. “Now the Trump administration must honor its trust responsibilities to American Indians and Alaska Natives and nominate — and fully vet — a director with the strongest possible combination of leadership and fiduciary skills as well as experience running a large public health system,” Mr. Udall’s statement said. “I urge the administration to work to prioritize upholding the government-to-government relationship by seeking tribal input as it begins the process of selecting a replacement nominee,” it continued. “Indian Country deserves better.” The Indian Health Service has not had a permanent leader since 2015.

"CHESTER, Ill. — Randy Clover is something of an anomaly — the president of a union local here that represents Illinois state employees, and a Republican precinct leader who voted for President Trump. But he has no doubt about what will be at stake next week at the Supreme Court: the financial and political clout of one of organized labor’s last strongholds. The court will hear arguments on Monday about whether the government employees represented by Mr. Clover’s union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, must pay the union a fee for representing them in collective bargaining. Conservative groups, supported by the Trump administration, say the First Amendment bars forcing government workers from having to pay anything, and the court has sent strong signals that it agrees with that argument. If it does, unions like Mr. Clover’s stand to lose fees not only from workers who object to the positions they take in negotiations but also from anyone who chooses not to join a union but benefits from its efforts. To hear Mr. Clover tell it, the case is the culmination of a decades-long assault against the labor movement. “The case was started by the governor to destroy unions,” Mr. Clover said, referring to Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who has been at war with Illinois’s public-sector unions. “It’s trying to diminish the protections that unions have for their members.” A ruling against public unions is unlikely to have a direct impact on unionized employees of private businesses, because the First Amendment restricts government action and not private conduct. But unions now represent only 6.5 percent of private sector employees, down from the upper teens in the early 1980s, and most of the labor movement’s strength these days is in the public sector. Groups financed by conservative donors have worked hard to weaken public unions, and denying them the ability to impose mandatory fees on workers has been a long-sought goal. The argument almost succeeded in 2016, when the Supreme Court seemed poised to rule that the fees were unconstitutional. "
"When a gunman slaughtered 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in 2016, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, described it as a moment of revelation — a tragedy so grave that it helped prompt his decision to seek a second term. A year and a half later, with no gun violence legislation having been enacted in the interim, Mr. Rubio is again at the center of a churning national debate about public safety and gun control. In a state now stricken by a second catastrophic shooting, Mr. Rubio is under intense scrutiny. So far, he has struck an unsteady balance between firmly supporting gun rights and appearing proactive in response to atrocities at home, with decidedly mixed results. In a televised town hall-style meeting on CNN Wednesday night, Mr. Rubio gamely strained to convince grieving parents and students from Parkland, Fla., that they should view him as an ally. He suggested he might back specific new regulations on weaponry, perhaps including a ban on high-capacity magazines, which allow a gunman to fire a huge number of rounds without reloading. But in a lengthy and emotional colloquy with Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Mr. Rubio politely refused to endorse a ban on assault weapons, drawing jeers from the audience and visibly frustrating Mr. Guttenberg. Mr. Rubio leaned further into a different idea on Thursday, saying in an interview that he might file legislation to ban certain large magazines, though he acknowledged that he had yet to settle on a specific proposal or discuss the idea with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. “I hope that we can put together a package that I intend to be in the lead on, together with others,” Mr. Rubio said.

"NEW DELHI — Donald Trump Jr., who has spent the week in India pitching new luxury high-rises that bear his family’s name, took the stage before a crowd of about 200 on Thursday. “Building a Better Mumbai,” the banner behind him proclaimed. “We’re actually delivering true luxury,” Mr. Trump told the guests, who were greeted by a red carpet, lit candles and a jazz band. “We’re actually delivering buildings in the Indian marketplace that you can take out of that marketplace, put in any cosmopolitan of the world and say, ‘This is on par with some of the best.’” The Trump Organization is reaping the windfall from India’s admiration for President Trump. He may have low approval ratings at home, but he appears well liked in a country with one of the fastest-growing populations of millionaires in the world. The Trump brand “spells glamour more than luxury,” said Kalyani Chawla, a brand consultant and former executive at Christian Dior in India who attended the event. “I think it’s all about Donald Trump, honestly,” she said, “any idea of Donald Trump in general, regardless of the fact that even he’s surprised he’s the president of the United States.” But even before the president’s son arrived in India to press the flesh and do the deals, his trip was creating controversy over its potential for blurring the lines between the Trump White House and the Trump Organization. As Mr. Trump hopped from city to city, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, sought assurances from the United States Embassy in Delhi that it was not helping Mr. Trump. And ethics experts seemed unable to overstate the incongruity of a sitting president’s son drumming up business overseas. "
"WASHINGTON — Even as he was managing Donald J. Trump’s campaign for president, Paul Manafort lied to banks to secure millions of dollars in cash loans as part of a decade-long money laundering scheme, according to charges unsealed by the special counsel on Thursday. Mr. Manafort exaggerated his income by millions of dollars to take out mortgages on homes in SoHo and the Hamptons that he had purchased years earlier in part with income illegally funneled through offshore bank accounts, according to the indictment. The laundered money — which totaled $30 million — came from Mr. Manafort’s work as a lobbyist and political consultant to Viktor F. Yanukovych, the Russia-aligned former Ukrainian president. But after Mr. Yanukovych was ousted in 2014 and fled to Russia, Mr. Manafort’s income quickly dwindled. The 32-count indictment describes a complex plot that Mr. Manafort then undertook to leverage money from his real estate with the help of his longtime business partner and campaign deputy, Rick Gates. The charges do not involve Mr. Trump or his campaign and are not significantly different from ones filed against the men in October. But they outline new criminal behavior and appear to be the latest attempt by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to pressure Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to cooperate with his inquiry to avoid a lengthy prison sentence. The men have said they have nothing to offer Mr. Mueller on the central question of the investigation: whether any associates of Mr. Trump coordinated with Russia’s attempts to disrupt the 2016 election. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates have pleaded not guilty, and a spokesman for Mr. Manafort denied wrongdoing. “Paul Manafort is innocent of the allegations set out in the newly filed indictments, and he is confident that he will be acquitted of all charges,” the spokesman, Jason Maloni, said in a statement. “The new allegations against Mr. Manafort, once again, have nothing to do with Russia and 2016 election interference/collusion.” "
"To the Editor: In the 1950s and ’60s, when the Southern states remained committed to racial segregation, many of us marched and spoke out against this blight on our democracy. But marching wasn’t enough to end this abuse of African-Americans. Nor were court orders sufficient to overcome this national embarrassment. As the Kennedys and Lyndon B. Johnson understood, substantial change would come only with congressional action — not simply through marches and sermons, however essential they may have been, but by changing the laws of the land. The young people who are protesting today are the advanced wave of what must come next: gun control legislation that takes weapons meant for battlefields out of our schools, off the streets and away from disturbed individuals with no respect for human lives. And the way to achieve these legislative advances is through the ballot box. Every reasonable voter in this country should make a candidate’s position on gun control a test of his or her ballot. ROBERT DALLEK, WASHINGTON The writer is the historian and author of presidential biographies. To the Editor: Re “In Halls of Power, Gun Survivors Urge Action” (front page, Feb. 22): President Trump advocates arming some teachers with guns. When the SWAT teams enter the building, how will they know whom to shoot? I foresee a lot of innocent teachers losing their lives simply because they have a gun in their hands. But this is what bothers me even more: Will future teacher hirings be based on whether or not a person is willing to carry a firearm instead of on teaching ability? "
"LOS ANGELES — In Hollywood, the run-up to the 90th Academy Awards, which will be held on March 4, has been dominated by the discussion about sexual misconduct and abuse of power. The Golden Globe Awards became a de facto rally for the Time’s Up movement, with actresses wearing black to protest sexual harassment and Oprah Winfrey delivering a scorching speech. The Screen Actors Guild Awards, which had a female-only lineup of presenters, were focused on gender inequality and other social ills. At the Baftas, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, domestic violence activists, inspired by the Time’s Up campaign, swarmed the red carpet. But in this #MeToo era the people behind the Oscar telecast have a message: Our show will be focused on films, not the cultural moment around them. “We want to make it as entertaining as possible — reverential and respectful but also fun and emotional,” said Jennifer Todd, one of the lead producers of the Academy Awards, which will be hosted for the second year in a row by Jimmy Kimmel. “The Oscars should be a spectacle. Fun and funny and great performances.” “It should also be a giant commercial for the movie business, which we all need to keep going,” Ms. Todd said, noting that the show would emphasize the 90th anniversary milestone. Channing Dungey, president of entertainment at ABC, which will broadcast the ceremony live, echoed Ms. Todd in a separate interview. “We certainly want to honor and respect Time’s Up and allow that message to be heard,” Ms. Dungey said. “But we’re trying to make it more planned than spur of the moment — it has its moment and then doesn’t feel like it overshadows the artists and films being honored.” "
"What makes teenagers amazing — or infuriating, if you’re in an argument with one — is they don’t know what they’re not supposed to be able to do. They haven’t learned that being smart means being cynical about what you can accomplish. They haven’t been hard-wired with platitudes and euphemisms. They haven’t internalized a list of questions that are too naïve or impolite to ask. At CNN’s town hall on gun violence Wednesday, “Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action,” this resulted in something you rarely see on TV: accountability. A week after 17 people died in a mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., a group of angry, grieving constituents was questioning public officials as if they worked for the public. It’s not unusual for news programming after a tragedy to be cathartic or argumentative — cable news can’t resist emotion and conflict. But this was both at once, and that made it something remarkable. The town hall, moderated by Jake Tapper, was part debate, part memorial (it ended with “Shine,” a song written and sung by students), part public trial for the political and educational system. "
"Four states in the Northeast with relatively strong gun laws banded together on Thursday to form a gun safety coalition, filling what the states called a vacuum of federal action by pledging to share registries of people prohibited from owning firearms in individual states. The states — New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island, all of which have among the lowest rates of gun deaths per capita in the country — will directly share information like the names of people who have been deemed mentally unfit to own a gun, people who have a domestic violence restraining order against them and people who have a warrant out for their arrest. The states will also share details about how guns are trafficked and sold within their borders and designate universities that can collaborate on regional gun violence research, according to a memorandum of understanding signed by the states’ governors, all Democrats. “This is a federal government that’s gone backwards on this issue,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on a conference call with the other governors and reporters, outlining his dim hopes for new restrictions in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Florida. “President Trump has pledged allegiance to the N.R.A. and he’s delivered for them.” Mr. Cuomo cited a proposal in Mr. Trump’s budget to cut funding to the federal background check system. Some details about how the agreement will work in practice remain murky. The patchwork of state law means that states cannot necessarily restrict gun sales to everyone on another state’s no-gun list. And gun control advocates said states are already supposed to report to the national background check system people prohibited from owning guns under the parameters of state law, and not only those restricted by federal law. But officials working on the coalition said the agreement would reinforce and expand what they share, including the names of people, for example, who have been voluntarily hospitalized for mental illness and are prohibited by some states from owning guns. "
"Russian meddling in the politics of the United States and most every other Western country demands a tough response, but it should not come as a surprise. President Vladimir Putin has long believed that such interference is an effective way to assert the Kremlin’s might. And President Trump’s characteristically egocentric reaction, focusing exclusively on how it affects him, is likewise, sadly, in character. What may be most disconcerting in the entire affair is what it says about the state of democracy in the country that is supposed to be the model for the world. Whether the Russian web brigades actually affected the outcome of the presidential election, or any other, is impossible to tell. The fake news, false identities, cyberattacks and other tactics outlined in the Justice Department indictment last week seemed aimed at people who probably already got that sort of ranting from plenty of zany, homegrown sources. But therein lies the true danger: that the polarization in American politics, society and life has become so yawning that people on the far right, and to some degree on the left, are prepared to accept the most appalling and transparent lies to bolster their beliefs. As Amanda Taub and Max Fisher wrote in “The Interpreter” column in The Times on Sunday, “The false information and political advertisements that the Russians are accused of spreading could ring true only to those already predisposed to suspect the worst.” Not so many years ago, fake quotes like one in which Hillary Clinton praises Shariah law, or reports suggesting that Black Lives Matter activists are killing police officers, would have been dismissed as the rants of sick extremists. That they evidently find credence in at least a part of the population says far more about the state of public discourse than about Russia. "
"On Wednesday, after listening to the heart-rending stories of those who lost children and friends in the Parkland school shooting — while holding a cue card with empathetic-sounding phrases — Donald Trump proposed his answer: arming schoolteachers. It says something about the state of our national discourse that this wasn’t even among the vilest, stupidest reactions to the atrocity. No, those honors go to the assertions by many conservative figures that bereaved students were being manipulated by sinister forces, or even that they were paid actors. Still, Trump’s horrible idea, taken straight from the N.R.A. playbook, was deeply revealing — and the revelation goes beyond issues of gun control. What’s going on in America right now isn’t just a culture war. It is, on the part of much of today’s right, a war on the very concept of community, of a society that uses the institution we call government to offer certain basic protections to all its members. Before I get there, let me remind you of the obvious: We know very well how to limit gun violence, and arming civilians isn’t part of the answer. No other advanced nation experiences frequent massacres the way we do. Why? Because they impose background checks for prospective gun owners, limit the prevalence of guns in general and ban assault weapons that allow a killer to shoot dozens of people before he (it’s always a he) can be taken down. And yes, these regulations work. Take the case of Australia, which used to experience occasional American-style gun massacres. After a particularly horrific example in 1996, the government banned assault weapons and bought such weapons back from those who already had them. There have been no massacres since. "
"President Trump called again on Thursday for the opening of more mental hospitals to help prevent mass murders like the one at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Yet ramping up institutional care, experts say, likely would not have prevented most of the spree killings regularly making headlines in this country. “We’re going to be talking about mental institutions. And when you have some person like this, you can bring them into a mental institution, and they can see what they can do. But we’ve got to get them out of our communities,” the president said during a meeting at the White House with state and local officials. In the 1960s, states across the country began to close or shrink mental hospitals after a series of court decisions that limited the powers of state and local officials to commit people. The decline continued for decades, in part because of cuts in both state and federal budgets for mental health care. Those institutions housed people with severe mental disorders, like schizophrenia, who were deemed unable to care for themselves. And while spree killers may be angry and emotionally disordered, few have had the sorts of illnesses that would have landed them in hospital custody. The latest school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, 19, was clearly troubled and making threats, and he was stockpiling weapons. But he had no mental diagnosis. He has been described as angry, possibly depressed, perhaps isolated — not so different from millions of other teenagers. "
"OXON HILL, Md. — It did not seem like a coincidence that the very first panel of this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference took direct aim at the state of journalism in the United States. The opening session on Thursday, “An Affair to Remember: How the Far Left and the Mainstream Media Got in Bed Together,” began with a YouTube-style mash-up of the year’s biggest media blunders. The audience jeered Joy Behar of “The View” and Jim Acosta of CNN; it whooped at a clip of President Trump thundering at Mr. Acosta, “You are fake news.” This annual gathering is usually a moment to hammer out what divides the fractious conservative movement. What it has revealed so far is what unites it: contempt for “#fakenews” and the journalists that the former Breitbart News writer Ben Shapiro memorably described as “advocates of leftism, masquerading as objective truth-tellers.” Mr. Shapiro, 34, a provocateur with a growing following among millennial conservatives, brought the crowd to its feet when he declared, “The media are lying about you, they are lying about me.” Some attendees turned toward the reporters gathered in the back of a hotel ballroom here and gave them a taunting thumbs down. But Mr. Shapiro was far from the most prominent speaker whose fiery media criticism delighted the conservative faithful. Vice President Mike Pence accused journalists of “fawning” over the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Her sphinx-like appearance beside Mr. Pence at the Winter Olympics in South Korea this month drew wide attention. "
"WASHINGTON — The Rev. Billy Graham, the evangelist and presidential pastor who died this week, will become the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, lawmakers announced Thursday. “It’s not his style to have that kind of attention paid to him,” Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for the family, said of Mr. Graham. “But the family and those of us who knew him are very honored by it, particularly given how rare it is for a private citizen to be afforded this honor.” The gesture, which is reserved for the country’s “most eminent citizens,” is authorized by a congressional resolution or approved by congressional leadership once permission is given by the person’s family, according to the Architect of the Capitol. It is generally reserved for presidents, lawmakers and soldiers, who lie in state. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wrote a letter to Mr. Graham’s son, the Rev. Franklin Graham, on Thursday asking that “Americans have this opportunity to pay their respects to Rev. Graham” for his “long and distinguished service to the nation.” Franklin Graham posted on Twitter, saying, “My father would be honored.” Mr. Graham will lie in honor for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Ryan said in a news release. His pine plywood coffin with a wooden cross was made by inmates at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell will hold a bicameral service after the arrival of the coffin. Votes in the House were canceled for the two days Mr. Graham’s body will be in the rotunda, with final votes for the week being held Tuesday, the office of the House majority leader said. "
"The White House’s senior adviser on energy and climate change stepped down last week after being denied a full security clearance for smoking marijuana about five years ago. Now he is speaking his mind about the Paris climate agreement that President Trump has disavowed. “I’m going to say something controversial,” the former adviser, George David Banks, said in an interview. “The Paris agreement is a good Republican agreement. It’s everything the Bush administration wanted.” Mr. Banks stood by Mr. Trump’s decision last summer to withdraw the United States from the global accord, despite having urged him behind the scenes to remain in. Since then, a large part of his work as the White House adviser on international energy issues has been to quietly seek ways that the United States might rejoin the deal. That came to an abrupt end last week when Mr. Banks resigned after being told he would not be granted a full security clearance. In a wide-ranging interview days after leaving his position, Mr. Banks spoke about the surprise of being told that the three or four times he had smoked marijuana between 2009 and 2013, which he had self-reported to the F.B.I. in April 2017, were the reason for the security rejection. He also spoke about his efforts to persuade Mr. Trump to remain open-minded about the Paris agreement, and the likelihood of the United States formally rejoining the accord during Mr. Trump’s presidency. “A lot can happen between now and 2020,” Mr. Banks said, referring to the date when countries can formally leave the Paris agreement. He pointed to the president’s recent comment, which he made during a news conference with Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, that “we could conceivably go back in” to the deal. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The head of the N.R.A., Wayne LaPierre, above, offered a fierce defense of the Second Amendment in his first public remarks since the massacre in Parkland, Fla. He warned against a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms” at a Conservative Political Action Conference gathering in Maryland. President Trump endorsed arming teachers to protect students from school shootings. He said that teachers who were qualified to handle a weapon would get a bonus, and that he would devote federal money to training them. And footage showed that an armed guard at Stoneman Douglas remained outside the building for “upwards of four minutes” during last week’s shooting. We discussed the gun control debate on “The Daily.” ____ "
"For nine months in Kandahar, Afghanistan, I went through the same routine every day. I put on my uniform and tied my boots. I put a magazine in my 9-millimeter handgun and locked it in my hip holster. I put a 30-round magazine in my M4 and slung it over my shoulder. If the day included a patrol, I put on my body armor. I usually carried a knife and at least one tourniquet. Every day, our team discussed base security to identify where we were most prone to attack. That was my standard procedure while serving with the United States Army in a combat zone. When I left active duty in 2014, I never expected that those skills would be applicable to my next job, as a high school teacher in San Jose, Calif. But the reality is that much of what I learned in the Army is horrifyingly relevant in the classroom. My school conducted drills similar to those that took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., even before a gunman opened fire last week and killed 17 people. Our first drill, during which staff practiced sheltering students and barricading doors, exposed countless weaknesses, making it obvious to me that we were woefully unprepared to protect our charges. My classroom would be one of the first an attacker coming through the front entrance would see. So I set out to make it a “hard target” — a place that would appear difficult to attack — to deter an intruder. The classroom was big, with doors on opposite ends. I wrestled with the idea of enlisting the help of my maturest students in securing such a large space, ultimately deciding that I would take only volunteers from my upper-class classroom aides. I pondered how to construct impromptu blockades to delay or confuse an attacker. My helpers and I moved the cart of class iPads to where it could be easily pushed in front of the door — an ideal barricade. Still, the large windows extending the length of the room, once a pleasing feature, now looked only like a gaping vulnerability. We covered the windows in butcher block paper to obstruct the view from outside. "
"The Learning Network runs challenges for teenagers all year long, but when we announce a new one, it’s always with trepidation. Will it be too hard? Have we been clear enough about what we’re looking for? Will anyone out there actually take the time to do it? Well, in the case of the challenge we announced in December — to connect something you’re studying in school with the world today — we needn’t have worried. Over 1,200 students suggested interesting thematic links between recent Times articles and literary, historical and scientific texts and topics like “Their Eyes Were Watching God,” “Walden,” the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Chandrasekhar Limit and the California gold rush. Some texts came up so often that, if you’re a teacher currently working with any of them, you could do worse than to search this post to find the many and varied ways students see their resonance. “Brave New World,” “Fahrenheit 451,” “The Prince,” “1984,” ""Othello” and “Macbeth” are in that category. Certain issues in the news also appeared in all kinds of contexts. The #MeToo movement reminded students of literature like “Jane Eyre” and “The Handmaid’s Tale,” but one student also thought Newton’s first two laws of motion applied, while another saw an analogy to the rock cycle in geology. Participants discovered that fake news is old news, with clear parallels in the plots of “The Crucible” and “The Great Gatsby.” President Trump was compared to literary characters including Macbeth and Grendel, and his policies were invoked in examining topics as varied as “The Scarlet Letter” and the Indian Removal Act. Below, in alphabetical order, is a list of winners, runners-up and honorable mentions, including full essays by our top eight winners. All told, the list represents the work of 50 students, more than we usually call out in our contests. But not only were there simply that many ideas we wanted to honor, we also think the variety and originality of the choices speak for themselves: Any future student who wonders what school-assigned reading has to do with “the real world” only has to look at this list to see how easy it is to answer that question.

"WASHINGTON — Margaret Brennan, the senior foreign affairs correspondent for CBS News, will be the next moderator of “Face the Nation,” the network’s prestige Sunday morning public affairs show and one of the most influential venues in American politics. Her new role, announced by CBS on Thursday, makes Ms. Brennan, 37, the only woman currently serving as a solo anchor of a major Sunday political affairs show. She succeeds John Dickerson, who left “Face the Nation” in January after less than three years to replace Charlie Rose on “CBS This Morning.” Along with mainstays like NBC’s “Meet the Press” and ABC’s “This Week,” “Face the Nation” features interviews with prominent lawmakers and White House officials that often make news, and can forge Washington’s political agenda for the week ahead. For decades, the hosts of these shows have primarily been men. “Meet the Press,” which began in 1947, has had only one female moderator, Martha Rountree, its founding host. Lesley Stahl, now of “60 Minutes,” moderated “Face the Nation” from 1983 to 1991. Christiane Amanpour, now of CNN, moderated ABC’s “This Week” from 2010 to 2011. Martha Raddatz of ABC News was named a co-anchor of “This Week” in 2016, although the program’s branding remains focused on the lead host, George Stephanopoulos. Ms. Brennan, whose debut is set for Sunday, joined CBS News in 2012 after a decade in financial journalism, working as an anchor and correspondent at Bloomberg Television and CNBC. She said in an interview on Thursday that she hoped “Face the Nation” would offer a dose of civility in a highly charged political moment. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Thursday that a high-ranking official, who many in the South believe orchestrated a deadly attack in 2010, would lead a delegation to Sunday’s Winter Olympics closing ceremony in the South, another sign the two Koreas are trying to work out a road map toward improving ties. The North’s delegation will be led by Kim Yong-chol, a vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee. The eight-member delegation will start a three-day trip on Sunday that will include attending the closing ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korean officials said. Mr. Kim’s trip follows another recent visit to the South by senior North Korean officials. Earlier this month, Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, attended the Games’ opening ceremony and met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. In that meeting she invited Mr. Moon to a summit meeting in the North on behalf of her brother. Also scheduled to attend Sunday’s closing ceremony is President Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who will lead the American delegation. United States officials said Ms. Trump had no plans to meet anyone representing the North. When visiting South Korea earlier this month to attend the Games’ opening ceremony, Vice President Mike Pence had planned to sit down with Kim Yo-jong in a meeting arranged by South Korea, but the North Koreans backed out at the last minute, according to American officials. The North Koreans’ presence at the closing ceremony raises the possibility of a chance encounter between the North’s delegation and Ms. Trump. Mr. Pence and Ms. Kim sat just feet apart in a V.I.P. box at the opening ceremony but they did not acknowledge one another, their frosty attitudes symbolic of the hostile relations between their countries.

In the crowd was Ivanka Trump taking in her first event of the Olympics with South Korean First Lady Kim Jung-sook. A two-man, two-woman Swiss team out-skied Austria in the final of the Alpine team event.  The new event featured four head-to-head matchups down a short slalom course with a small jump.

A United States team without any of its Alpine stars was eliminated by Britain in the round of 16. The old rivals Norway and Sweden headed into the final shooting segment of the men’s biathlon relay locked in a battle for first.  Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden missed just once. But Emil Svendsen of Norway, whose poor shooting at the end dropped Norway from first to fourth four years ago, missed three times. As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth. One men’s hockey finalist was expected: Russia. One was not: Germany. "

"BEIJING — As China ratchets up pressure on Taiwan, the self-governing island it claims as its territory, the United States is cautiously starting to push back. In recent months, Chinese strategic bombers have been conducting “island encirclement” flights, escorted by fighter jets. The Chinese government has discouraged tourism to Taiwan and imports of goods like fish over the past year and a half, hurting its economy. And China persuaded the island’s most important remaining diplomatic ally, Panama, to switch diplomatic recognition last summer from Taipei to Beijing. Concern about Taiwan’s fate now appears to be building slowly in Washington, even as President Trump continues to seek China’s help on other issues. Through his first year in office, Mr. Trump pressed Beijing to put more pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, with limited success. He has also sought to limit China’s nearly $400 billion trade surplus with the United States, which has nonetheless continued to widen. Against that backdrop, Washington has recently begun moving gradually to reinforce its ties to Taiwan, a vigorous democracy facing an increasingly authoritarian government in Beijing. Bills have been introduced in Congress to promote visits to Taiwan by warships and by civilian officials. A small gathering of defense contractors is planned for May to discuss Taiwan’s production of parts for weapons assembled in the United States. And in June, an American institute that functions as an informal diplomatic channel plans to open an elegant new complex in Taiwan’s capital. "

"As the Trump administration pushed to ban travelers from Yemen from entering the United States, Liz Sanders set about photographing young Yemenis in New York — mostly recent arrivals, driven from their home country by the civil war. She joined them at dinners and parties, a prom and a wedding; she rode with them in the subway and hung out on sidewalks where Yemenis gathered. Sometimes it took her a year or more to persuade someone to allow her to take a portrait. Most refused outright. “It was more cultural conservatism than religious conservatism,” Ms. Sanders said of the people who refused. “Some of the women feel more comfortable here not wearing the hijab, because of all the stereotyping, or because they wanted to get a job. But they don’t want to be seen not wearing it by their families in Yemen or Saudi Arabia.” Rules dictated the work. At a high school prom, girls insisted that their faces not be shown because their dresses were not sufficiently modest; one man did not want his girlfriend photographed at all, so Ms. Sanders settled for shooting the couple’s hands. Others, she said, did not want to be seen casually enjoying themselves in New York while relatives were still struggling for their lives in Yemen. Ms. Sanders, 33, fell in love with Yemen while taking part in an archaeological dig there when she was in her early 20s, and she studied the culture before beginning the photo project, though she did not learn Arabic. “I felt there was an unfair narrative in the U.S. associated with being Muslim and being an immigrant and being Yemeni-American,” she said. “I wanted to try to challenge that.” Her young subjects, she said, were also trying to figure out what it meant to be New Yorkers and Americans, “continuing to ask themselves what to keep of their past, and what to bring into the future. I’m interested in that awkward stage in between, where new identities are being tested out.” "
"WASHINGTON — As the nation faced another crisis, polls clearly reflected what a significant majority of the public thought should be done. A bipartisan move to draft a legislative response finally gained steam after years of stasis. A stunning breakthrough looked to be at hand. The issue was put to the test in a series of votes on the Senate floor. Backers of the bipartisan compromise showed they could get tantalizingly close to the magic threshold of 60 votes, but still came up short at 54 and the entire effort collapsed in failure. That situation aptly describes what occurred last week when the Senate took on immigration. But it also depicts — down to the 54 votes for a leading bipartisan proposal — what happened the last time the Senate voted on major gun control legislation, in 2013, after the  school shooting in Newtown, Conn. It is also a predictable result if significant gun control legislation emerges in Congress in the aftermath of the school massacre in Parkland, Fla. That prospect underscores the parallels between the two politically divisive issues and the difficulties of enacting meaningful legislation even when a majority in Congress and the public agree. The inability to push legislation over the finish line has lawmakers fed up while feeding public discontent with Washington. “I think people in this country today are very frustrated with gridlock on issues that they believe should be resolvable,” said Senator Susan Collins, a leading Republican centrist from Maine. “We are not talking about dealing with North Korea, which is a really tough issue. We are talking about issues that have reasonable, readily available solutions.” So how is it that proposals with such strong support and seeming momentum can be so quickly derailed? "
"SAN JOSE, Calif. — The Census Bureau, charged with counting every person living in the United States in the coming decennial, may never find whoever is living here in this converted garage on the east side of town. The property owner has replaced the garage door with siding, painted it the same beige as the rest of the house, and added a small window and front door. The makeshift remodeling is well camouflaged, but there’s another tell — the sidewalk out front slopes down to the street where there was clearly once a driveway. “There are certain cues we’re looking for,” said Nicholas Almeida, San Jose’s chief service officer. The city knows that thousands of people are living in units like this, technically illegal, with no recognized address. Their hidden households have extra satellite dishes outside, curtains over basement windows, mail slots in garage doors. Setting aside questions of housing code enforcement, San Jose needs the census to find these residents, too, if the city is going to get its full share of the political power and federal resources tied to the national head count. Two years out from the census, cities are scrambling to avert an undercount they fear could be unusually large for reasons both political and practical. Across California, the housing crisis means that even more households are doubling up in existing homes and occupying illegal ones. In Houston, many families remain displaced by Hurricane Harvey. In New York, the city has permitted so much new construction that the Census Bureau — compiling address lists now — may miss thousands of units to be completed between now and 2020. Cities must find all these households before they even get to the second challenge: persuading the people who live in them, many of them immigrants, to participate in the census. "
"Six weeks after Deborah Zwaschka-Blansfield had the lower half of her left leg amputated, she received some news from the nursing home where she was recovering: Her insurance would no longer pay, and it was time to move on. The home wanted to release her to a homeless shelter or pay for a week in a motel. “That is not safe for me,” said Ms. Zwaschka-Blansfield, 59, who cannot walk and had hoped to stay in the home, north of Sacramento, until she could do more things for herself — like getting up if she fell. Her experience is becoming increasingly common among the 1.4 million nursing home residents across the country. Discharges and evictions have been the top-ranking category of grievances brought to state long-term care ombudsman programs, the ombudsman agencies say. While nursing homes can discharge residents for a limited set of reasons, legal advocates say that home operators sometimes interpret those reasons in unjustified ways. Often, it’s because the residents’ more lucrative Medicare coverage is ending, which is what Ms. Zwaschka-Blansfield said happened in her case. Many of the residents, unaware of their rights, leave without a challenge. “The nursing homes, they know the system and they really game it to where they maximize their advantage,” said Tony Chicotel, a lawyer at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, a nonprofit group. Complaints about evictions have caught the attention of federal regulators, who are now seeking ways to step up enforcement of the federal laws that protect residents of the nation’s 15,000 nursing homes.

"This is the text of a lecture delivered at the University of Michigan on Tuesday. The speech was sponsored by Wallace House. I’d like to express my appreciation for Lynette Clemetson and her team at Knight-Wallace for hosting me in Ann Arbor today. It’s a great honor. I think of Knight-Wallace as a citadel of American journalism. And, Lord knows, we need a few citadels, because journalism today is a profession under several sieges. To name a few: There is the economic siege, particularly the collapse of traditional revenue streams, which has undermined the ability of scores of news organizations to remain financially healthy and invest in the kind of in-depth investigative, enterprise, local and foreign reporting this country so desperately needs. There is a cultural siege, as exemplified by the fact that a growing number of Americans seem to think that if something is reported in the so-called mainstream media, it is ipso facto untrue. There’s a technological siege, which not only has changed the way we work, and distribute our work, but has also created a new ecosystem in which it is increasingly difficult to distinguish fact from opinion, clickbait from substance, and real news from fake. Then — need I even mention it? — there is the president of the United States. We are all familiar with the ways in which Donald Trump’s demagogic assault on the press has already normalized presidential mendacity, mainstreamed “alternative facts,” and desensitized millions of Americans to both. I’ll get to him in a moment. "

Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The Trump administration has mostly taken a softer stance toward Wall Street, but on Wednesday, it suggested a regulatory change designed to make life harder for the big banks. The change, proposed by the Treasury Department, is arcane, but in a financial crisis, it could be hugely consequential. What is it? The tweak aims to increase the likelihood that a failing bank would be forced into bankruptcy, rather than into a resolution process overseen by the government. The difference might seem insignificant, especially since the current regulatory procedures for winding down a bank, introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, are stringent and mimic bankruptcy. But the Treasury Department believes that an actual bankruptcy would be preferable. It would make the process of restructuring a failed bank more evenhanded and predictable, according to the Treasury. In turn, investors in the big Wall Street firms, and anyone doing business with them, would become more aware of the losses they could suffer if those firms crashed. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First: What does Mueller know? You should have low expectations for how much new information Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation will still uncover, writes Politico’s Blake Hounshell. No, you should have high expectations, writes Vox’s Matthew Yglesias. A form of flattery. Why are some conservative media figures criticizing survivors of last week’s mass shooting in Florida? Because the students’ activism is powerful and effective, Ana Navarro argues. The students are “not political hacks. Not paid shills. Not indoctrinated. Not character actors,” Navarro writes. “They are young people of character compelled into action by a horrible crime that cost 17 lives.” Medicare for all. A new single-payer health care proposal has just come out, and I think it has a better chance of eventually becoming law — in whole or in part — than Bernie Sanders’s plan. It comes from the Center for American Progress, the influential liberal research group (often known as CAP). The proposal would create a program called Medicare Extra through which any American, regardless of age, could buy health insurance. Before getting into the details, I want to emphasize one political point. A big reason that Democrats have become so focused on single payer — even Democrats who are to the right of Sanders — is the Republican Party’s scorched-earth response to Obamacare. That response has undermined the private-sector expansion of health insurance that was central to Obamacare, as Abby Goodnough just detailed in The Times. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has decided that it needs no new legal authority from Congress to indefinitely keep American military forces deployed in Syria and Iraq, even in territory that has been cleared of Islamic State fighters, according to Pentagon and State Department officials. In a pair of letters, the officials illuminated the Trump administration’s planning for an open-ended mission of forces in Syria beyond the Islamic State fight. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson foreshadowed the plan in a speech last month, saying that troops will stay in Syria to curb Iran and prevent the Syrian government from reconquering rebel-held areas. Though Mr. Tillerson also cited a need to mop up the remnants of the Islamic State and keep from leaving a vacuum in which the group could regenerate, other administration officials put far greater emphasis on the extremists. In the letters, they said that the continued potential threat from the Islamic State provided a legal rationale for the Trump administration to keep American troops deployed there indefinitely. “Just as when we previously removed U.S. forces prematurely, the group will look to exploit any abatement in pressure to regenerate capabilities and reestablish local control of territory,” wrote David Trachtenberg, the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy. About 2,000 American troops are in Syria, where nearly all the territory once held by the Islamic State has now been liberated. Mr. Tillerson deemed the group “substantially, but not completely defeated,” warning that the insurgents remained a threat. Mr. Trachtenberg wrote the letter to Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, who had asked the Trump administration to explain its understanding of its authority to stay on in Syria. The State Department sent him a similar letter, which also argued that international law provided a basis for American forces to remain in Syria — despite the lack of consent from the Syrian government — to protect Iraq and the United States from terrorists.

"WASHINGTON — For years, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been overlooked in Washington. Overshadowed by more politically powerful law enforcement agencies like the F.B.I., the A.T.F. garnered headlines mostly for notorious episodes, including the deadly 1993 siege in Waco, Tex., and the “Fast and Furious” gunwalking scandal more than a decade later. Now, the A.T.F. is on the verge of a crisis. The agency, which has not grown significantly since its founding in 1973, is about to confront a staffing shortage and is set to lose its tobacco and alcohol enforcement authorities. President Trump has yet to nominate a director to oversee the agency, which has been without permanent leadership for eight of the past 12 years. Amid the dearth of leadership and resources, the White House is pushing the A.T.F. to the forefront of its fight against violent crime. In response to the mass shooting at a Florida high school last week, Mr. Trump, who promised to fight violent criminal gangs and illegal guns — two of the A.T.F.’s key missions — announced that he would be relying on the bureau to regulate so-called bump stock accessories. But it is all but politically impossible for Mr. Trump, who counts the powerful gun lobby among his most ardent supporters, to strengthen the A.T.F. The National Rifle Association has long sought to hobble the agency in an effort to curb its ability to regulate guns, which the gun lobby has traditionally opposed. “Most people in law enforcement know why A.T.F. can’t get a director,” said Michael Bouchard, a former agent and the president of the A.T.F. Association, an independent group that supports current and former bureau officials. “It’s not because of the people. It’s because of the politics.” For decades, the N.R.A. has used its sway in Washington to preserve the A.T.F. in its limited capacity. It has aggressively lobbied against nominated directors and pushed Congress to enact restrictions on how the bureau spends money to curtail its ability to regulate firearms and track gun crimes. One funding provision, for example, forbids the A.T.F. from using electronic databases to trace guns to owners. Instead, the agency relies on a warehouse full of paper records. "
"OXON HILL, Md. — The head of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, leveled a searing indictment on Thursday against liberal Democrats, the news media and political opportunists he said were joined together in a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms.” Mr. LaPierre’s remarks, his first since a gunman took the lives of 17 people at a Florida high school last week, seemed aimed at blunting the rising public pressure for stricter gun control. Conservatives, he said, needed to push back even as liberals tried to smear them. “The shameful politicization of tragedy — it’s a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous movement,” he said to a friendly but largely restrained crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “They hate the N.R.A. They hate the Second Amendment. They hate individual freedom.” The solution Mr. LaPierre offered was not to pass new laws but to better enforce the existing background check system and, he said, “harden our schools” with more armed guards. “Evil walks among us,” he added, making a passing reference to “another terrible tragedy” in the Parkland, Fla., school massacre. Mr. LaPierre’s pugnacious appearance appeared to signal a tactical shift for the N.R.A., which had officially remained mostly quiet in the week after the Florida shooting, even as a movement of young people, including survivors of the massacre, made emotional pleas for gun control. The organization typically uses the first few days after an episode of mass gun violence to lie low before it comes out hard in opposition to any new gun control measures. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Those were the words of the father of a student killed last week at a Florida high school as he pressed President Trump to act. “It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it,” he added during a White House visit on Wednesday. Mr. Trump said that arming educators could be a solution to gun violence. Here are 11 dramatic exchanges about gun control on Wednesday. In Florida, Senator Marco Rubio and a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association were repeatedly booed during a nationally televised forum at which they refused to back new gun control measures. And student protesters at the Florida Capitol confronted lawmakers, who responded that gun-related legislation could be introduced by Friday. • Polls show strong  support for action on gun control and immigration. That sentiment is not, however, shared by the Republicans who control the government, our chief Washington correspondent says. "
"WASHINGTON — A comedian has agreed to tell jokes at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Now the question is whether President Trump will show up to hear the punch lines. Michelle Wolf, a stand-up comic and frequent contributor to “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” will be the featured entertainer at the annual gathering on April 28, the association announced on Thursday, taking on one of the most prominent — and perilous — gigs in comedy. Long a high point of the Washington social calendar, the correspondents’ dinner typically offers journalists and presidents a chance to roast one another on live television in a celebrity-packed ballroom. But Mr. Trump, not one to encourage comity with the White House press corps, skipped last year’s proceedings, the first president to do so since Ronald Reagan in 1981. (Mr. Reagan, who had recently survived an assassination attempt, called in from his hospital bed.) And the White House said this week that Mr. Trump had not yet made a decision about this year. Either way, Ms. Wolf, 32, has her work cut out for her. Washington journalists are a notoriously tough crowd; witness the stony silence that met Stephen Colbert after his blistering 2006 monologue about George W. Bush. The comedian Larry Wilmore, who appeared in 2016, prompted controversy when he used a racial slur in his remarks about Barack Obama. The coziness of the event — where reporters hobnob with the politicians they cover — can be awkward, too, leading some journalists to stifle their laughter, lest they be caught on camera appearing too gleeful at the president’s expense.
