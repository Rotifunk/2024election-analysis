"The pornographic film actress Stephanie Clifford sued President Trump’s fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and her own former lawyer on Wednesday, making public a set of text messages discussing efforts to quash the story of her alleged affair with Mr. Trump as it emerged early this year. The suit, filed in California State Court, accused Keith M. Davidson, the Beverly Hills lawyer who represented Ms. Clifford in 2016, of violating attorney-client privilege. It also said he withheld relevant communications from her and her current lawyer, Michael Avenatti. The suit accused Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, of helping and encouraging Mr. Davidson to breach his professional duties of confidentiality and loyalty to his client this year. In 2016, Mr. Cohen paid her $130,000 shortly before the election to keep quiet about the alleged affair. The legal challenge is at least the third that Mr. Avenatti has brought in the last three months on behalf of Ms. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels. The suit intensifies the legal pressures on Mr. Cohen, who has been a subject of Ms. Clifford’s earlier complaints, and brings Mr. Davidson directly into the fray of civil litigation for the first time. In April, Ms. Clifford sued Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump for defamation, and in March, she sued to be released from the nondisclosure agreement. That suit has been delayed as a federal corruption investigation in New York scrutinizes Mr. Cohen and the $130,000. "
"LOS ANGELES — In most elections, the primary is the season for partisanship and appealing to the party’s most ideological voters. Candidates slide to the center — appealing, in theory, to a broader electorate with a more moderate message — as they shift into a general election. But even before most of the votes were counted, two of the candidates running to be the next governor of California — Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican businessman — made clear that they were inclined to stay in their ideological corners. If Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox continue down this road, the election for governor is going to offer as stark an ideological choice as voters are going to find in just about any ballot booth in the country: on health care, taxes, immigration, government spending and President Trump. And it comes at a time when California has become the center of Democratic resistance to Republican policies, and after eight years in which the current governor, Jerry Brown, has struck a decidedly more moderate tone in governing. [Go here for full results from California’s primary.] Celebrating on Tuesday night, Mr. Newsom offered a sweeping view of what he wants California’s government to achieve: guaranteed health care for all, a “Marshall Plan” to build affordable housing and an end to childhood poverty. “I honestly think this is a great opportunity, at scale, in a state as large as ours, to contrast visions,” Mr. Newsom said to reporters Wednesday in San Francisco, his first campaign stop since his primary victory.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trouble in Guangzhou, a crackdown in Pakistan, and a stranded superluxury yacht in Dubai. Here’s what you need to know. • U.S. consulate workers fall ill in China. A crisis over a mysterious ailment sickening American diplomats and their families — first reported in Cuba — is widening. The State Department has evacuated several Americans who fell ill in Guangzhou after hearing strange noises at their apartment complexes, officials said. One of the residences is pictured above. Those stricken have reported headaches, nausea, hearing loss, cognitive issues and other problems. Last month, one worker was reported to have brain trauma. Others are being tested. The new episode has prompted American officials to focus suspicion beyond Cuba, to perhaps China or Russia.

"GUANGZHOU, China — A crisis over a mysterious ailment sickening American diplomats and their families — which began in Cuba and recently appeared in China — has widened as the State Department evacuated at least two more Americans from China on Wednesday. The Americans who were evacuated worked at the American Consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou, and their colleagues and family members are being tested by a State Department medical team, officials said. It is unclear how many of them are exhibiting symptoms, but a State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday evening that “a number of individuals” had been sent to the United States for further testing. For months, American officials have been worried that their diplomats have been subjected to targeted attacks involving odd sounds, leading to symptoms similar to those “following concussion or minor traumatic brain injury,” the State Department says. The cases in China have broadened a medical mystery that started in 2016, when American Embassy employees and their family members began falling ill in Havana. In all, 24 of them were stricken with headaches, nausea, hearing loss, cognitive issues and other symptoms after saying they heard odd sounds. The issue has roiled relations with Cuba, which immediately fell under suspicion, and led the United States to expel Cuban diplomats. But with Americans now exhibiting similar symptoms in Guangzhou, American officials have raised suspicions about whether other countries, perhaps China or Russia, might be to blame. "
"PARIS — Taking aim at so-called fake news, France’s Parliament on Thursday is set to begin debating a tough bill aimed at repressing phony news items, one pushed by President Emmanuel Macron amid criticism that it poses a potential threat to press freedom. The measure would allow judges to block content deemed false during a three-month period preceding an election. Mr. Macron, stung last year by a phony internet-spread story claiming he had an offshore account in the Bahamas, has made fighting “fake news” a priority. His opponent, the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, brought up the Bahamas story during a critical presidential debate. Now, she is attacking the proposed law as a “liberty killer.” Shortly after the new year, Mr. Macron told a press gathering that he would aim to “protect our democracy from these false stories” by cracking down on phony reports. “In an instant,” through thousands of accounts, the president said, “lies created to sully a politician, a personality, a public figure, a journalist can spread throughout the world, in every language.” Under the new law, judges would have 48 hours to decide if “any allegation or imputation” in a news item was “devoid of verifiable elements that would make it credible.” Only items written “in bad faith” could be blocked, and again it would be up to the judge to decide.

"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’ve got hot tips for staying cool, an update about drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and a few words from Republican lawmakers about Scott Pruitt. Air-conditioning may be as American as apple pie. More than 90 percent of United States households now have air-conditioners. But our love of cool indoor spaces is contributing to climate change, as we recently reported. By midcentury, the world may use as much electricity powering its air-conditioners as China currently uses for all activities. In the process, the carbon emissions created by generating all that electricity could double. How can we lower air-conditioning’s climate impact? To find the most efficient air-conditioners, look for Energy Star ratings, said Mina Agarabi, a mechanical engineer and consultant who focuses on the operation and maintenance of mechanical systems. These models may cost a bit more upfront, but we recoup those costs through reduced energy costs over the long term. “But it isn’t just about buying the most efficient unit,” said Ms. Agarabi. “It’s also about sizing it correctly.” "
"— President Trump, speaking at a briefing at FEMA headquarters on Wednesday. The United States has exported energy sources like coal, natural gas, petroleum and electricity for decades, so Mr. Trump is wrong that this is happening for the first time. Asked on Wednesday for clarification, the White House referred to the Energy Information Administration’s latest annual outlook, which projected that the United States would become a net energy exporter by 2022 — meaning that at that point, the country will export more energy than it imports. That’s neither “now” nor the “first time.” Currently, the United States is still a net importer. Additionally, data from the energy statistical agency shows that the United States was a net exporter for several years before 1953.   The White House also cited a March report from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that said the United States became a net exporter of liquefied natural gas in 2017 — the first time since 1957. The United States is and has been a net energy exporter of coal since at least 1949. Conversely, the country has relied on foreign oil imports since the 1950s. "

"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — For Deb Haaland, the New Mexico community activist seeking to make history in her bid to become the first Native American woman elected to Congress, proclaiming defiance to the Trump administration has echoes in the brutal history of the Southwest. “How can we not be outraged by the separation of families?” Ms. Haaland asked in an interview on Wednesday, referring to the government’s intensifying crackdown on undocumented immigrants crossing the border with Mexico. “It’s like we’re reliving the past.” In an explicitly progressive campaign emphasizing her criticism of Mr. Trump on matters ranging from immigration to tribal sovereignty, Ms. Haaland, 57, shook New Mexico’s political establishment by sailing to a primary victory on Tuesday over five Democratic opponents in a district encompassing Albuquerque. Some voters attributed Ms. Haaland’s win, which may position her favorably in the general election against Janice Arnold-Jones, a Republican, to her pioneering effort to frame issues from a Native American perspective in a state long dominated by Anglo and Hispanic politicians. “Deb has been forceful in challenging a president known for his discriminatory remarks about native peoples,” said Cheryl Fairbanks, executive director of the Native American Budget and Policy Institute, a group in Albuquerque seeking to empower indigenous communities. “We’ve endured federal policies aimed at terminating and marginalizing us, so it’s unifying to have someone to speak with such pride of her native background,” Ms. Fairbanks said. “We’re on the cusp of a historic moment if she wins.” "
"WASHINGTON — NASA is working on plans to commercialize the International Space Station, which currently costs up to $4 billion a year to maintain, the agency’s new administrator said on Wednesday. Jim Bridenstine said the agency will consider “a range of options” to make private operation of the space station feasible. “Some of it might be that the I.S.S. wouldn’t exist in its current form,” he said. “But maybe it gets split into a number of different components. Some of it could be de-orbited.” Mr. Bridenstine said no decision has been made, but that President Trump’s budget proposal in February put the agency’s privatization efforts “on steroids.” The administration has proposed eliminating direct federal contributions to the space station by 2025 and allocating $150 million to develop “commercial successors,” including companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Blue Origin, which was started by Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Seven in ten Americans still believe the United States government should remain a world leader in space exploration, despite the growing role of private companies, according to a study published on Wednesday by Pew Research Center.

"We are now going to explain the War of 1812 to you. Why not? We didn’t think we’d find ourselves here, either. But on Wednesday, CNN reported that the 206-year-old war figured prominently in a discussion between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada on May 25. According to CNN’s unnamed sources, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Trudeau, “Didn’t you guys burn down the White House?” The New York Times then confirmed the CNN report, as did The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It’s unclear if the president was trying to make a joke during what was, reportedly, a tense call about his decision to impose steep tariffs on metals imported from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Any lesson on the War of 1812 probably isn’t the most vivid memory people have from their high school history classes, so its details may be fuzzy to many. And with the war suddenly in the news and the butt of jokes on social media, they might fairly wonder: Well, did Canada burn down the White House? No, Canada did not burn down the White House during the War of 1812, which was fought with Britain over maritime rights. What is now Canada was not yet a country in 1812, but rather British colonies. Canada didn’t become a nation until 1867, long after British troops did, in fact, burn down the White House in 1814. The fire gutted the president’s house along with several other crucial structures in Washington, which was still a relatively small town when the seat of government moved there 14 years earlier. “The inferno was so great that the glow in the night sky was seen from 50 miles away,” the White House Historical Association wrote.

"Californians went to the polls on Tuesday in a primary election that was a big deal for the country: How the vote went in several competitive congressional districts was being closely watched as a barometer of the chances Democrats have to take control of Congress in November. National politics aside, there were several other significant issues at stake; here are several takeaways for Californians. Much of the chatter before the primary focused on California’s unusual election system in which the top two vote getters — regardless of party affiliation — moved to the general election in November. Going into Tuesday, many national Democratic leaders worried that they had too many candidates in some crucial congressional races, raising the possibility they would be shut out in some contests — and two Republicans would face off in November. Adding to the debate was the steady erosion of the Republican Party in California — which has slipped to third-party status, with more residents identifying as independents. But, once the results rolled in, the outcome became clear: partisanship still matters, even in California, and most races come November will likely be traditional contests between a Democrat and a Republican. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, will face John Cox, a Republican businessman, in the race for governor, and it looks as if Democrats will not be shut out of any congressional races. “The primary reminded us just how partisan our elections tend to be,” said Mark Baldassare, the chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California. “And how deeply divided our parties are in the types of candidates they choose.” "
"WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers in the House are hurtling toward a collision over immigration, raising the prospect of a divisive and uncomfortably public intraparty fight just five months before November’s midterm elections. And party leaders are running out of time to stop it. In the face of a rebellion from moderate members, who are on the brink of forcing a series of immigration votes over the objections of Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republicans will meet privately on Thursday morning to discuss the issue. “Our members are earnest and sincere in trying to understand each other’s perspectives,” Mr. Ryan told reporters on Wednesday, adding, “I really do believe that there is a sweet spot here.” At the center of their discussions is the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children — known as Dreamers. Here’s a guide to the impending showdown. The approaching collision among Republicans has been long in the making. In September, President Trump moved to rescind an Obama-era program that shielded young undocumented immigrants from deportation, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. He gave Congress six months to take action on the matter. The Senate tried but came up empty, as three different immigration plans failed in the chamber in February. And because the courts have kept DACA alive for now, lawmakers — who thrive on hard deadlines — have felt less urgency to deal with the issue. "
"Shock! Horror! President Trump is actually doing something right. Sadly, Democrats in Congress are responding in a quite Trumpian way: They seem more concerned with undermining him than supporting a peace process with North Korea. They are on the same side as National Security Adviser John Bolton, quietly subverting attempts to pursue peace. While international security is complicated, here’s a rule of thumb: When you find yourself on the same side as Bolton, go back and re-examine your position. Sure, we all wish that Trump treated Justin Trudeau or Angela Merkel with the respect that he now shows Kim Jong-un. Yes, it seems that Trump has been played by Kim. Yet another way of putting it is that Trump is finally investing in the kind of diplomatic engagement that he used to denounce, and that we should all applaud. Trump’s newfound pragmatism is infinitely preferable to the threat of nuclear war that used to hang over all of us, so it’s mystifying to see Democrats carping about any possible North Korea deal. “Any deal that explicitly or implicitly gives North Korea sanctions relief for anything other than the verifiable performance of its obligations to dismantle its nuclear and missile arsenal is a bad deal,” seven Democratic senators, including Chuck Schumer, warned in a letter to Trump this week. The letter also insisted on “anywhere, anytime” inspections of suspected North Korean nuclear sites, as well as those linked to its chemical and biological warfare programs. "
"In a commencement address at the Naval Academy last month, President Trump revisited a familiar theme. He remarked to the graduates: “Winning is such a great feeling, isn’t it? Winning is such a great feeling. Nothing like winning — you got to win.” He later repeated the idea: “Victory, winning, beautiful words, but that is what it is all about.” This focus on victory is not new for Mr. Trump. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised that under his leadership the audience would “get bored with winning.” He predicted that his fans would grow “so sick and tired of winning, you’re going to come to me and go, ‘Please, please, we can’t win anymore,’” and “I’m going to say, ‘I’m sorry but we’re going to keep winning, winning, winning.’” The focus on winning is not incidental. It caters to a very primal need among humans to feel that we’re part of a group whose status is high and protected. This winning “we” is often a divisive concept, turning Americans against their fellow citizens. The story of how American politics has grown ever more focused on partisan victory instead of the greater good of the nation has two major components. First, it is fundamental human nature to want our groups to win. Social psychological research pioneered by the Polish psychologist Henri Tajfel (who survived six years in a Nazi prison camp) worked to determine why groups of people try to destroy each other. Through a series of experiments called the “minimal group paradigm,” Mr. Tajfel tried to locate the weakest level of group identification, the point at which people would not discriminate against an opposing group. To his surprise, he couldn’t find it. No matter how he divided up the subjects in his study (overestimators versus underestimators, Klee-lovers versus Kandinsky-lovers), they had a bias for the group they were in and a bias against the group they weren’t members of. In a money allocation task, participants were given a choice between both groups receiving the maximum amount of money, or the subjects’ in-group receiving less than the maximum, but more than the out-group. People reliably chose group victory. Mr. Tajfel explained this by linking our group status to our individual status. When our group wins, we feel like winners. When our group loses, we feel like losers. And we’re willing to sacrifice real resources for that sense of victory. "
"Food delivery. Sanctuary. Those are often the anchors for the more than half a million undocumented immigrants who live and work in New York City. But an incident at the United States Army base in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, last week has called those foundations into question, and provoked new tension in the city’s battle with federal immigration authorities over protections for immigrants without legal status. Pablo Villavicencio Calderon, 35, an undocumented immigrant, was making a delivery from a brick-oven pizza restaurant in Queens to the Army base next to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on Friday before lunchtime. According to his wife, Sandra Chica, he presented a New York City identification card, as he had done in the past. The card, provided through a program called IDNYC, was supposed to give undocumented immigrants a method of proving their identification when dealing with city agencies, including the schools system and the Police Department, neither of which is allowed to ask about immigration status. But on that day, Ms. Chica said, it was not enough for the military police officer on duty, who said Mr. Villavicencio needed a driver’s license, which he did not have. A background check revealed an open order of deportation from 2010. Military personnel detained him and called Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who took him into custody, an official for the immigration agency said. "
"LOS ANGELES — A federal judge in San Diego on Wednesday refused to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s practice of taking children from immigrants when they arrive at the border to seek asylum, ruling that the “wrenching separation” of families may violate the Constitution’s guarantees of due process. “Such conduct, if true, as it is assumed to be on the present motion, is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Southern District of California wrote in his 25-page opinion. The judge rejected the government’s claim that the practice of family separations — one of the most controversial features of the government’s crackdown on illegal immigration — cannot be challenged on constitutional grounds, though he did dismiss a separate challenge claiming that the practice violates asylum laws. The ruling in the case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, suggests the court would be open to considering a claim that taking children away from parents who are legally trying to seek asylum in the United States constitutes a violation of the family’s rights to due process. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last month that the administration would criminally prosecute everyone who illegally crosses the Southwest border, in what he called a “zero tolerance” policy intended to deter new migrants, mainly from Central America. In most of those cases, children traveling with those immigrants are now taken to separate detention facilities, often hundreds or thousands of miles away. "

Here’s the latest: • France takes aim at “fake news.” France’s Parliament is set to begin debating a bill aimed at repressing phony news items amid criticism that they pose a threat to democracy. The legislation would give judges 48 hours to decide whether to block content they deem false during a three-month period preceding an election. Journalists fear the measure undermines press freedom, while the political opposition views it as a power grab by President Emmanuel Macron, above. “The potential risk in this law is if it winds up in the hands of a government with the wrong motives,” said one Socialist member of Parliament. Meanwhile, European leaders asked the Trump administration to exempt E.U. companies from American sanctions that would be imposed as a result of President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. _____ "
"Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, “got back on his hands and knees and begged” for the United States to revive the Singapore summit meeting after President Trump abruptly scrapped it last month, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Wednesday. The remarks by Mr. Giuliani, apparently intended to portray Mr. Trump as a tough negotiator, may have lobbed a disruptive obstacle into the salvaged meeting less than a week before it is set to happen. The remarks could easily offend officials in North Korea, where a cultlike autocracy exalts Mr. Kim as a deity who cannot be seen as servile and weak. “If the North Koreans needed a reason to cancel the meeting, the Americans just gave it to them,” said Evans J.R. Revere, a former State Department diplomat who specializes in North Korea. Mr. Giuliani made the remarks in Israel during a capital markets conference, where he was explaining the head-spinning sequence of events that led Mr. Trump to cancel and then revive the summit meeting. Mr. Trump abruptly announced the cancellation on May 24 after a North Korean official threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the United States and called Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” for having suggested that Mr. Kim had asked for the meeting under pressure. The North Koreans also were offended by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, who has expressed hostility toward the North and has insisted that it disarm before other issues can be discussed. "
"WASHINGTON — Students, parents and educators urged the federal officials charged with preventing the next school shooting to pour more mental health resources and school support staff into the nation’s elementary and secondary schools — not more guns. The first public forum of the federal commission on school safety, convened by President Trump after the February school shooting in Parkland, Fla., drew dozens of speakers from across the country to the Department of Education on Wednesday. But neither Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the commission’s chairwoman, nor the other three cabinet secretaries appointed to the panel were in attendance. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos told senators that the commission would not wade into the gun control debate, but panel officials said they would follow Mr. Trump’s order to examine age restrictions on some weapons. Alessia Modjarrad, a recent graduate of a Montgomery County, Md., high school, criticized what she called the commission’s “complicit” stance on the role of guns in school safety. “I don’t want to be scared. I don’t want to think that at any moment someone with a gun could walk in and hurt us all,” Ms. Modjarrad said. “Please consider the possibilities that guns are the most important aspect of the purview of this commission.” The speakers’ demands largely echoed the responses that liberal advocacy groups have pointed to since the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School: more anti-violence programs, more mental health resources and better coordination between school and law enforcement officials in trying to identify at-risk students. "
"WASHINGTON — Federal agents arrested nearly 52,000 people at the Southwest border in May, according to data released on Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security, as the number of migrants trying to enter the United States continued to rise. The arrests in May — the third month in a row of increases — follow the Trump administration’s tough stance against illegal immigration, including sending thousands of National Guard troops to the border and a “zero tolerance” policy that seeks to prosecute people who illegally enter the country. The new policy has resulted in hundreds of children being separated from their parents. The new arrest data suggests such measures have not deterred migrants, many of whom undertake the long trek from Central America to escape violent gangs and drug cartels. The Trump administration has used monthly apprehension figures as a barometer for how well its get-tough policies have fared in stopping illegal immigration. But on Wednesday a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security played down the significance of the monthly figures. “No one expects to reverse years of political inaction overnight or in a month,” the spokesman, Tyler Q. Houlton, said in a statement. “It is also clear change will take more than administration action alone.” "
"In Trump’s America people are understandably experiencing news fatigue. There are torrents of it on multiple streams. There is outrage after outrage. It is often overwhelming. That’s the plan, I suspect. Trump is operating on the Doctrine of Inundation. He floods the airwaves until you simply give up because you feel like you’re drowning. And unfortunately, it’s working. A Pew Research Center report released Tuesday found that nearly seven in 10 Americans “feel worn out by the amount of news there is these days.” Fighting this fatigue is the real test of a person’s resolve, including mine. When my enthusiasm for resisting this vile man and his corrupt administration starts to flag, I remember the episode that first revealed to me the darkness at Trump’s core, and I am renewed. On an April night nearly 30 years ago, a young investment banker was beaten and raped when she went for a jog in Central Park. The attack left her in a coma. She happened to be white. Five teenagers arrested for the crime — four black and one of Hispanic descent — went to trial. As this newspaper reported at the time, they were “in what the police said was part of a marauding spree by as many as 30 youths in the northern end of the park” that night. After being questioned for hours, the defendants gave false confessions that conflicted with one another, and those confessions were captured on video. As The New York Times pointed out in 2002: “The defendants in the jogger case were put on camera after they had been in custody, in some cases, for as long as 28 hours.” "
"WASHINGTON — Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, denied on Wednesday that Trump administration policies were driving up health insurance costs, which many experts expect to surge again in 2019. Mr. Azar, testifying before a House committee, vigorously disputed suggestions by Democrats that President Trump had sabotaged Affordable Care Act marketplaces, where millions of people obtain insurance subsidized by the federal government. In the market as it now exists, he said, “there’s no incentive for insurance companies to in any way contain their cost increases” because federal subsidies generally rise along with premiums. “Those prices are going to go up, and, absent statutory change, there’s little we can do to stop that premium increase because the subsidies chase those premiums,” Mr. Azar said. The Congressional Budget Office said the full unsubsidized premium for a benchmark midlevel plan in the marketplaces rose 34 percent this year, on average, and was likely to increase about 15 percent next year. But some insurers have already requested rate increases of more than 30 percent for 2019. Given this dynamic, Mr. Azar said, the Trump administration is trying to “make other options available to people” — less expensive insurance that will be exempt from many coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act. "
"WASHINGTON — A rocky process has plagued President Trump’s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement from the start, as internal divisions and a thinly staffed bureaucracy often left big American companies with much at stake shut out of deliberations, according to internal administration emails. The White House approach has put the future of the 1994 trade pact in doubt and left Canada, Mexico and many of the biggest American companies frustrated and bewildered. Documents show corporations and trade groups — such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, or NAM — struggling to get their voices heard within a supposedly business-friendly administration and sending increasingly panicked emails to the United States trade representative’s office about its approach to rewriting the pact. Throughout last spring and summer, high-level trade negotiators repeatedly canceled meetings with the chamber, instead finally sending a 24-year-old deputy to meet with a delegation that was expected to include representatives from more than 50 of the largest American companies and organizations, including Walmart, U.P.S., the Walt Disney Company, General Electric, General Motors, Caterpillar and Boeing. Last August, ahead of the second round of Nafta negotiations in Mexico, an official at the United States Council for International Business pleaded for “an urgent meeting with you and your team before you head to Mexico for Round 2.” “I cannot emphasize enough the degree of concern in the business community based on the press reports we have seen of major changes in U.S. policy,” the official, Shaun Donnelly, wrote. A trade official set up a meeting for the next week. "
"PHILADELPHIA — After spending 24 hours in the center of a culture war, the Philadelphia Eagles shrugged off a white-hot controversy with earnest platitudes and easygoing humor. They spoke of diversity and activism, of team unity and the weather. And the team’s most prominent political figure declined to speak at all, choosing instead to let a series of handwritten poster boards do the talking. It was a stark contrast with his team’s and the N.F.L.’s very talkative antagonist, the President of the United States. This was a little more than one day after a planned White House celebration for the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory imploded into canceled plans and recriminations, with the Eagles reportedly planning to send only a few players and the White House press secretary accusing the team of “a political stunt.” Now it was time for an off-season practice (an “OTA,” or Organized Team Activity, in N.F.L.-speak) and the relief that came with returning to comparatively mundane subjects like blocking, tackling and catching footballs. “Glad to see so many people for an O.T.A. practice,” head coach Doug Pederson joked at a news conference at the Eagles’ practice complex near Lincoln Financial Field. Others were more direct and expansive. “We’ve come together as a team, the decisions that were made were made, and at the end of the day, for me it wasn’t a decision,” said Eagles defensive end Chris Long. Last season, Long expressed support for teammates who raised their arms during the playing of the national anthem and also donated his million-dollar base salary to educational initiatives. He said that he had not planned to attend the traditional White House celebration for the Super Bowl victor well before it was canceled. "
"BUENOS AIRES — A decision by Argentina’s national soccer team to cancel a World Cup warm-up match against Israel after protests by Palestinian activists has set off hand-wringing and recrimination here in a nation obsessed with the sport and geopolitics. Argentina’s soccer federation canceled the game on Tuesday and confirmed it on Wednesday, weeks after Israel had moved it from the coastal city of Haifa to Jerusalem, a city that is a focal point in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The change in location of the game ignited protests from Palestinian activists, who displayed bloodstained shirts at a demonstration in Barcelona, where Argentina is practicing for the World Cup beginning June 14. Both Israeli officials and officials with the Argentine Football Association said threats had been made against Lionel Messi, the star of Argentina’s national team, and other members of the team. “My responsibility as the president of the A.F.A. is to work for the safety of my people, which is why I made this decision,” the associations’s president, Claudio Tapia, said in a short statement to the news media in Barcelona. Changing the location of the game, a move pushed by Israel’s sports minister, Miri Regev, “turned a sporting event that had economic ends into a political issue and it became about supporting the state of Israel,” said Angela Lerena, an Argentine sports journalist. “Somebody at some point decided it could be a good propaganda opportunity.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had called Argentine President Mauricio Macri of Argentina on Tuesday in an attempt to get the game back on.

"What do the primary results from California, New Jersey and places in between bode for November? For the Times opinion columnists Frank Bruni and Ross Douthat, they mean plenty — and yet nothing definitive. Their discussion follows: Frank Bruni: Ross, although Americans less politically engaged than you and I probably wondered at that potent breeze, accompanied by a happy whistling sound, that emanated from California and blew eastward all the way to the Potomac, we recognized it instantly for what it was: an epic Democratic sigh of relief. Based on incomplete returns from the Tuesday primaries there, the party’s hopes for retaking control of the House after November are alive! Its candidates in the California districts that it’s striving to flip from red to blue did not get shut out of the general election by the state’s “top two” system, in which two Republicans could have been graduated to the next, decisive phase. Ross Douthat: True, the Democrats avoided calamity, and election handicappers gained, well, more ambiguity, it appears. Our colleague Nate Cohn spent Tuesday explaining that if the Democrats closed in on 50 percent of the vote in California’s key primaries — the districts held by Republican representatives and won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 — they would be on the pace they need to have a House-taking wave; if they consistently fell below 45 percent the wave would be receding. The provisional totals? 49, 37, 47, 44, 44, 46, 48. That looks like a gray zone to me, with the House very much in play, but the Democrats’ chances of taking it by no means as great as they would like. Bruni: This midterm election is refusing to hew to one clear pattern. Just a few weeks ago, in Omaha, a candidate of the left beat a more established Democrat in a fiercely contested primary, pretty much dooming the party in the general election, and there was ample talk of the main energy in the party being on the left. Tuesday’s results suggest otherwise, not just in California but in New Jersey, where the Democrats who won their primaries and will now compete in November are ones backed for the most part by the Democratic establishment — whatever that is. They’re well within the party’s mainstream. And of course Senator Dianne Feinstein prevailed handily in her California primary. So much for the Bernie Sanders insurgency. Douthat: I think generally there’s a lot more division between different Democratic factions on social media than there is in actual electoral politics. Our colleague David Leonhardt has written about how even in hard-fought primaries, like the one for governor in Georgia, the competing Democratic messages aren’t that far apart. And moderate incumbents like Feinstein and Montana’s Jon Tester won their primaries easily; indeed, it’s hard to think of a major Democratic incumbent who’s faced a sustained grass-roots challenge. Sure, Bob Menendez did surprisingly poorly in New Jersey — but he won, scandals and all. This is not a Democratic Party in the throes of its own Tea Party moment. It looks more unified, not less, than in 2016. "
"LONDON — Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has struck a conciliatory tone in the wake of a data-privacy scandal. That was not the case on Wednesday for the former chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm at the center of the controversy. Alexander Nix, who led Cambridge Analytica until it suspended him in March, defiantly shot back at accusations from British lawmakers that he or his company engaged in unethical business practices, abused information pulled from the social network or played a role in the British vote to leave the European Union. In a contentious hearing before Parliament’s media committee, Mr. Nix said Cambridge Analytica did at one point have data on millions of Facebook users. The data was harvested from the social network without the users’ consent. But, he said, Cambridge Analytica didn’t find the information useful and deleted it after a request from Facebook. His comments contradicted evidence presented by a former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, who has said the data was central to Cambridge Analytica’s political consulting work for Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Wylie has also suggested that Cambridge Analytica did advising work for the Brexit vote. Mr. Nix criticized Mr. Wylie as a “bitter and jealous” former employee bent on sabotaging the company in order to start a rival business. “I’m sitting here and being subjected to frankly ridiculous accusations based on the most tenuous connections that simply aren’t supported by evidence,” Mr. Nix said when denying that Cambridge Analytica had worked for campaigns in favor of leaving the European Union.

"LOS ANGELES — Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, took a major step Tuesday in his bid to become California’s next governor, capturing one of two spots on the November ballot as the state moved closer to the end of the era of Gov. Jerry Brown. John Cox, a Republican businessman backed by President Trump, captured the other spot, setting up what is — at best — a very long-shot bid for Mr. Cox in a decidedly Democratic state where Mr. Trump lost by nearly four million votes. Mr. Cox’s showing represented a major tactical victory for national Republicans as they seek to protect seven Republican-held congressional seats in California that Democrats are targeting as they try to recapture the House. Republican leaders, including Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader who comes from central California, had feared that having no Republicans running for a high-profile statewide office would diminish turnout among party voters in the fall. Importantly, Democrats seemed poised to avoid the disaster they feared in House races: Being shut out of the November balloting under the state’s so-called “top-two’’ primary system, in which only the top two finishers advance to the general election. But many of the districts had crowded primaries and in some of them votes were still being counted early Wednesday morning. The most-watched races here were seven congressional districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 and that are now held by Republicans. Democrats are aiming to capture those seats in November, a linchpin of their strategy to take back control of the House. "
"“The Fosters” comes to an end and pivots toward its spinoff series. Samantha Bee returns to the air. THE FOSTERS 8 p.m. on Freeform. This earnest family drama has drawn rave reviews over five seasons for its twisting family relationships, deft handling of difficult topics like trauma and assault, and honest and frequent depictions of same-sex sex. The show wraps up its three-night finale on Wednesday, in which the family gathers in the Turks and Caicos Islands for Brandon’s wedding. But don’t shed too many tears, since the episode will also be a springboard for the spinoff series on Freeform, which stars Cierra Ramirez (Mariana) and Maia Mitchell (Callie) making a new life for themselves in Los Angeles. CMT MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on CMT. A Fort Worth native, Kelly Clarkson started her career in full-throated pop-rock before dipping into country music in duets with Reba McEntire and Jason Aldean. She performs at this awards show in Nashville — in which fans choose the winners — singing her rendition of “American Woman,” the theme song of the new Paramount series of the same name. Mr. Aldean will also perform, along with Blake Shelton, Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line. Presenters include Johnny Knoxville, Chrissy Metz and Lindsey Vonn. THE PERFECT STORM (2000) 10:05 p.m. on AMC. You can watch Shailene Woodley frantically fight a storm in “Adrift,” in theaters now — or stay home and watch Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney enact a similar scenario. They play crew members on a fishing boat that finds itself in the middle of three converging storms.

Samantha Bee is at her most entertaining and convincing when she attacks those in power with unapologetic, blistering rage. But last week she was forced to backpedal after using a vulgar four-letter word to refer to Ivanka Trump; the incident has been at the center of countless debates and think pieces. After apologizing on Twitter, Ms. Bee will reportedly address the controversy at the top of her talk show — before undoubtedly reigniting her fury on other subjects. "
"Jordan Roth has put away his Prada suits. He had them in black, blue and gray, and they felt reassuring when he took over a small Broadway theater empire — a billionaire’s son facing more than a little skepticism about his readiness for an old-school job. Nine years later, at 42, he has become Broadway’s singular showman, pushing the boundaries of what it means — and, yes, what it looks like — to be a theater tycoon. In a famously flop-prone industry, he is wrapping up his best season ever — successfully luring not only Bruce Springsteen but also Disney (“Frozen”) and Tina Fey (“Mean Girls”) to his theaters, joining the long-running hits “The Book of Mormon” and “Kinky Boots.” He has three Tony Awards as a producer, and this weekend he is vying for a fourth, for a starry revival of “Angels in America.” As his confidence has grown, so has his appetite for provocative self-expression. He has become a red carpet magnet, thanks to his luxuriant locks and penchant for avant-garde couture. And he is producing and hosting a biting series of web videos that take aim at the coarsening of American culture and its association with President Trump. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump has made a trademark of upending many of the diplomatic traditions that have defined American foreign policy for decades, angering a host of longtime allies. Now, a growing number of his ambassadors are doing the same. This week, Richard Grenell, the newly installed United States ambassador in Berlin, outraged some in Germany when he told Breitbart London that he wanted to “empower other conservatives throughout Europe,” a direct political threat to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition. Germany’s Foreign Ministry asked for a clarification. Last week, David M. Friedman, the ambassador to Israel, told an Israeli newspaper, “There’s no question Republicans support Israel more than Democrats,” making an explicitly partisan argument that is generally forbidden among ambassadors. And earlier this year, Peter Hoekstra, the ambassador to the Netherlands, refused to respond to a room full of Dutch journalists who asked him to clarify false statements he had made in 2015 that politicians and cars had been burned by Muslims in the country. He has apologized. There is nothing new about ambassadors making unfortunate remarks. But the growing list of top envoys who have provoked controversy even in posts of close allies, where diplomatic duties largely include party-giving and anodyne cheerleading, has been unusual — and, for the Trump administration, potentially perilous. The administration is using its envoys, “even in our closest allies, to advance a nationalist and very aggressive agenda rather than maintain cordial relations,” said Nancy McEldowney, who had helped to train ambassadors for their posts as the former director of the Foreign Service Institute.

"LONDON — With a spa, a swimming pool, two heliports and room for 18 guests, the Luna is more like a floating luxury villa than a yacht. A crew of 50 keep all nine decks in pristine shape. The lifeboats cost $4 million apiece. Gleaming engines propel the vessel at a maximum speed of 22 knots. But for now, the Luna isn’t moving. It sits in a dry dock in Dubai, the most fought-over prize in what has been called Britain’s most expensive divorce. In December 2016, a High Court judge ordered Farkhad Akhmedov, a Russian billionaire who has owned a home in England since the ’90s, to pay the equivalent of $646 million to his ex-wife, Tatiana Akhmedova. He refused, arguing that the couple had been divorced in Russia more than a decade ago. Unconvinced and unable to enforce his ruling, the judge in April ordered Mr. Akhmedov to hand over the yacht, valued at roughly $500 million, to his ex-wife. It has since been impounded by authorities in Dubai, where it had turned up for maintenance. For more than a decade, Russian oligarchs have been parking their families and some chunk of their net worth in England. A deal was implied: The oligarchs got a haven from the pitiless realities of Putin-era Russia, and Britain got an influx of very rich people. Now some oligarchs are learning that life here has hazards of its own. That goes even for nonresidents like Mr. Akhmedov, who never became a British citizen. Eager to keep British tax collectors away from his money, he limited the number of days he stayed in England to a maximum of 180 a year. (More recently, the number was reduced to 90 days.) "
"The night that ended far differently started out normal. It was Thursday at Mekelburg’s, a busy Brooklyn grocery with a cafe and bar in the back and picnic tables on the patio, with locals tucking into sandwiches and sipping craft beers. Everything changed at 7 p.m., when someone noticed a news story online. Word spread through the place like a rotten odor. Customers scanned their phones, looked up and signaled for the check. “By 8:15, we were completely empty,” said Alicia Guevara, who owns Mekelburg’s with her husband, Daniel Mekelburg. Slowly, she pieced together what had happened. HuffPost had just published a profile of a prolific Twitter firebrand from New York, a woman who frequently attacks Islam — one post warned that “500K Muslims will Invade Europe this Summer” — under the user name @AmyMek. The story revealed her full name, Amy Mekelburg, offered details about her family and mentioned a brother who “runs a popular restaurant and craft beer bar in Brooklyn that also bears the family name.” The backlash to the story was instantaneous and widespread, rattling even veterans of the high-volume, high-vitriol, endless shouting match that plays out on the fringes of ideological dividing lines in this country.

Stephen Colbert pressed former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday to explain why he had reacted defensively to questions on NBC’s “Today” show about his affair in the late 1990s with Monica Lewinsky, then a White House intern. In the interview, which aired Monday, Clinton had told Craig Melvin of NBC that he would not have changed his response to the scandal in light of the #MeToo movement. Clinton, who was appearing on “The Late Show” to promote the new novel he wrote with James Patterson, admitted that the “Today” interview “wasn’t my finest hour.” But then he doubled down on much of what he’d said. “I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, to the American people. I meant it then, I meant it now,” Clinton said. “I’ve had to live with the consequences every day since. And I still believe this #MeToo movement is long overdue, necessary, and should be supported.” Yet Colbert kept at him, pointedly asking whether Clinton understood why journalists and #MeToo activists might be interested in reinvestigating his conduct.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor of California and former mayor of San Francisco, captured one of two spots on the November ballot for governor. He will face John Cox, a Republican businessman backed by President Trump, in a state that Mr. Trump lost by nearly four million votes in 2016. New Jersey could prove as crucial as California in the contest for the House in November. Democratic leaders are hoping to flip as many as four of the five Republican-held districts in the state, and a former Navy pilot and a pro-gun state senator are among those who secured nominations. • Eight states held primaries on Tuesday, and results are still coming in. Follow live updates here. • One possible upshot of any deal that President Trump might strike with Kim Jong-un on June 12 in Singapore: more trade between North Korea and China. On a trip to the countries’ border, our Beijing bureau chief saw a shadow economy of cash couriers, short-term workers and gray-market traders that has persisted despite years of sanctions against North Korea. She also found excitement about the opportunities that the easing of sanctions could bring. Separately, Mexico hit the U.S. on Tuesday with tariffs on around $3 billion of American pork, steel, cheese and other goods. The move, a response to the Trump administration’s steel and aluminum levies, came as Washington suggested it wanted separate trade agreements with Mexico and Canada, rather than tweaks to the North American Free Trade Agreement. • And President Vladimir Putin of Russia is seeking to capitalize on widespread European disillusionment with Mr. Trump by getting the European Union to abandon economic sanctions on his country.

"His confirmation as ambassador to Germany took a while, but when Richard Grenell arrived in Berlin in May he wasted no time riling up his new hosts. On his first day on the job, he tweeted that German companies doing business in Iran should “wind down operations immediately” because President Trump had decided to unilaterally withdraw from the painstakingly negotiated nuclear deal with Iran. Germans were not amused by an ambassador telling them what to do, but that hardly deterred our man in Berlin. What he did next was to give an outrageous and insulting interview over the weekend to Breitbart, summarized thus by the alt-right mouthpiece: “Trumpian U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell has expressed great excitement over the wave of conservatism in Europe, saying he wants to ‘empower’ leaders of the movement.” Mr. Trump was no doubt highly pleased by his envoy, a former United Nations spokesman, Mitt Romney campaign aide and Fox News contributor, whose confirmation was long held up by congressional critics over his history of provocative tweets, including several derogatory of the appearance of prominent women. But ambassadors do not represent a president; they represent a state, and they are not supposed to go around “empowering” nationalist movements or far-right ideologies in other countries. The Germans were furious. The new ambassador is behaving “not like a diplomat, but like a far-right colonial officer,” fumed Martin Schulz, the former European Parliament president. In true Trumpian fashion, Mr. Grenell insisted he had been misinterpreted. “Don’t put words in my mouth,” he tweeted. “The idea that I’d endorse candidates/parties is ridiculous. I stand by my comments that we are experiencing an awakening from the silent majority — those who reject the elites & their bubble. Led by Trump.” "

More from Rochelle Toplensky of the FT: The issue with Android As the FT notes, this penalty could have big ramifications for Google. Its Android operating system dominated smartphone market worldwide because Google gave it away for free. But Ms. Vestager has been looking into whether the Silicon Valley behemoth improperly forced phone makers to favor services like Chrome and Google search, as well as stopping others from developing competing operating systems using the open-source parts of Android. The bigger picture Google has been in the sights of the E.U. for some time. Last year, Ms. Vestager’s commission levied a record $2.7 billion fine over the company’s shopping comparison service.

"The battle for control of Congress was front and center on Tuesday night, with races taking shape in several intensely contested House seats in California and New Jersey. But there were revealing elections in the Midwest and the South, too, underscoring President Trump’s power in the Republican Party and the different ways Democrats hope to loosen his hold on red-state America. Here are some of our takeaways: National Democrats spent over $7 million in an effort to ensure they had a candidate reach the general election in three House districts in California held by Republicans. Their decision to not take their chances in the state’s “top two” system — in which the top finishers in nonpartisan, open primaries face each other in November — appears to have been a wise investment. The party’s intervention in the districts held by Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Ed Royce and Darrell Issa, all Republicans, paid off: they angered some of their own activists but were virtually certain to advance candidates in each of the three districts, including their preferred picks against Mr. Rohrabacher and in Mr. Royce’s seat. And the Democrats also got a bit of a lesson about the risks of not intervening, in the race for the seat held by Representative Jeff Denham. The Democrat Josh Harder got little outside help and appeared poised to barely edge out a little-known Republican challenger because the other five Democrats split more than 30 percent of the vote. It did not come cheap, but if Democrats secure a narrow House majority in November they will have done so in part because they decided to aggressively compete in June.

"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has temporarily halted relieving the debt of some student borrowers who were defrauded by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, after a federal judge found her department misused earnings data to calculate loan forgiveness. In response to a court order last week, the Education Department said that it would grant a temporary postponement of loan payments for Corinthian students in lieu of federal debt-relief claims. It also said it would stop collection payments for four students who sued the department over its new formula for determining how much debt they would have to repay. The halt came after Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of Federal District Court in San Francisco found that the department had violated the Privacy Act by sharing student borrower information, such as Social Security numbers and birth dates, with the Social Security Administration to obtain earnings data. The judge ordered the Education Department to end the practice and its collection of Corinthian student debts. In December, Ms. DeVos announced a new system to manage the thousands of students who filed so-called borrower-defense claims after several for-profit colleges began imploding in scandal in 2015, leaving students saddled with debt and tarnished degrees. The department began dividing borrowers according to a tiered system of debt relief, based on whether they had gone on to find gainful employment. Judge Kim’s ruling resulted from a class-action lawsuit filed by the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and the group Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, which challenged Ms. DeVos’s partial-relief system shortly after it was announced. They argued that the new policy was arbitrary, capricious and illegal. While the plaintiffs cheered the judge’s order, they maintained that the department has already illegally granted only partial relief to thousands of students and has left thousands more in limbo. Another hearing is scheduled for next week to determine whether the department will be required to grant full relief to all students. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. There has been rising anxiety among Democrats in recent weeks — and rising optimism among Republicans — about the midterm elections in November. Last night’s primaries in several states should cause everyone to take a deep breath. The Democrats had a good night: • We still don’t have the full picture, but the trends in voter turnout continue to look strong for Democrats. (The partisan breakdown in primary turnout is a meaningful predictor of general-election results.) In three New Jersey House districts that Democrats are hoping to flip, for example, Democrats cast between 52 percent and 54 percent of primary votes last night. “Should be careful about reading too much into it,” G. Elliott Morris of The Economist said on Twitter, “but those numbers should make Democrats feel good about November.” Democratic turnout was also strong in Iowa. And as analysts dig into the California results today, I’ll be watching for what they find out about turnout. Nate Cohn of The Times has a good explainer of California’s importance here. • Democrats appear to have avoided a disaster scenario in California. They were not locked out of the general election in any congressional district, based on the latest vote counts. The lockout scenario was possible because California has moved to a “top two” primary system. It no longer has party primaries; all candidates instead run in a single primary. In some districts, so many Democrats were running that it seemed possible that Republicans could finish in the top two spots, even if both received only around 20 percent of the vote. "
"A prominent far-right leader who dismissed the Nazi era as mere bird poop on Germany’s 1,000-year history was swimming in a lake near his house one evening recently, when a man on the shore grabbed his clothes. The thief’s parting words: “Nazis don’t need bathing fun!” By the time the far-right politician, Alexander Gauland, a co-leader of the Alternative for Germany party, known as AfD, made it out of the water, the man had made off with the bundle and someone had already called the police. The episode unleashed plenty of schadenfreude, and some criticism, on social media. Images of a dripping Mr. Gauland being escorted back to his house while wearing only a colorful pair of patterned swimming shorts spread rapidly, and a hashtag was born: #bathingfun. Mr. Gauland told the Märkische Allgemeine, a local newspaper based in his hometown, Potsdam, which first reported the theft on Tuesday, “My belongings were stolen by someone as I was in the water, and other swimmers called the police without asking me.” It was the second time in less than a week that Mr. Gauland, 77, had made the national news. Over the weekend, while addressing a gathering of his party’s youth movement in the eastern state of Thuringia, he made that comment about the Nazi era, which drew widespread condemnation as belittling the Holocaust. After the bathing episode, which happened last week but was reported only recently, social media users had a field day. “1,000 years of dignity in one image,” read one post on Twitter. “Creative way to resist the far right in Germany,” read another.

Seven songs, less than 24 minutes and no shortage of emotional baggage — welcome to “Ye.” The new album by Kanye West, released on Friday, was bound to be polarizing, given the rocky few weeks in the life of the rapper. (Declaring a kinship with Donald J. Trump’s “dragon energy” was only the beginning.) And yet upon its landing — first via scenic live stream from Wyoming and then through more traditional channels — the album still managed to shock with its immediacy, its rough edges, its moments of serenity and its lack of concrete answers. Always a proud and determined provocateur, the rapper-slash-producer-slash-designer “whipsaws between grandiosity and anxiety” on his eighth solo LP, Jon Pareles wrote in his review, “though Mr. West’s self-regard easily prevails.” Political content, it turns out, is all but absent, while family drama is at the forefront. To parse the flashes of vulnerability amid the ego, this week’s Popcast attempts to close-read not just the music, but the celebrity circus around it, which could not help but affect the album’s reception.

"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan contradicted President Trump’s assertions of a broad conspiracy by federal law enforcement on Wednesday, joining other lawmakers in saying that the F.B.I. did nothing wrong by using a confidential informant to contact members of the Trump campaign as it investigated its ties to Russia. And he said that Mr. Trump should not try to pardon himself, despite the president’s assertion two days earlier that he has the power to take such a step. “I don’t know the technical answer to that question, but I think obviously the answer is he shouldn’t,” Mr. Ryan told reporters. “And no one is above the law.” Mr. Ryan’s warning was the latest indication that the president is beginning to face trouble on Capitol Hill, where members of his own party are showing small signs of resistance. From international trade and China to immigration and the conduct of his cabinet, serious dissent from at least some Republicans is beginning to boil over. At the forefront is an effort by Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania to try to attach legislation to a must-pass defense policy bill that would require Mr. Trump to petition Congress for approval to impose national security tariffs, like those the White House has imposed on steel and aluminum produced in Canada, Mexico and Europe. More than a half-dozen Republican senators have signed on to the amendment, and a small group of Republicans decamped Wednesday to the White House to try to navigate tensions with a protectionist president who has drastically departed from his party’s traditional embrace of free markets.

"SAN FRANCISCO — In this deeply liberal California city, frustration over crises around housing and homelessness is bringing some on the left a little further right. At an upscale sushi restaurant, a few dozen members of the San Francisco Republican Party gathered on Tuesday night to watch the election results. Most did not want to talk about state or national politics, they wanted to keep it local. The group largely supported the Republican candidate for governor, John H. Cox, whom President Trump had endorsed and who won a place on the ballot along with Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and a former San Francisco mayor. But among the longtime Republicans were some newcomers, drawn to the right over frustration with the city’s trifecta of very tangible crises: a large homeless population, record housing costs and a high rate of property crime. “We’re the most beautiful city no one ever wants to come back to,” said Anna Coles, 36, a real estate agent who has lived in the city for 12 years. Ms. Coles has seen a surprising resurgence of conservative politics this year on Nextdoor, a website that creates private neighborhood-specific social networks. “I mean, I see people post these long diatribes about the petty crime and homelessness,” Ms. Coles said. “Folks are realizing they can’t vote along party lines anymore.” "
"BRUSSELS — In a letter to senior Trump administration officials, European foreign and finance leaders this week tacitly acknowledged that their efforts to preserve the West’s nuclear deal with Iran were failing. In the letter, sent on Monday to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the European leaders cited “security interests” in requesting that companies in Europe be granted an exemption from United States sanctions that would be imposed as a result of President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the pact. “In their current state, U.S. secondary sanctions could prevent the European Union from continuing meaningful sanctions relief to Iran,” said the letter, signed by the finance and foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany, all signatories to the 2015 accord with Tehran, and by Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign-policy chief, who oversaw the negotiations. Without that sanctions relief, Iran has threatened to pull out of the deal. That “would further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous,” the ministers argue, asserting that the deal was “the best means through which we can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran,” and that there appeared to be “no credible alternatives at this time.” The letter was reported on Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal and was then obtained by The New York Times. The plea is considered unlikely to produce the relief the Europeans want, since the Trump administration’s stated intention is to pressure Tehran into agreeing to an entirely new set of negotiations that would encompass its ballistic missile program and its support for hard-line regimes and militias throughout the Middle East.

"PHILADELPHIA — This is a metro area of diverse factions, from the South Philadelphia union Democrats to blue-blood Main Line Republicans. We argue about everything. What we never disagree on is religion. Because all Philadelphians practice the same faith. We all worship the N.F.L. champion Eagles. So when President Trump rescinded his Rose Garden invitation to the team this week and took verbal shots at our favorite sons, Eagles fans of all political divisions had the same response. We pulled on our Super Bowl LII ball caps, watched the “Philly Special” highlight video one more time and ran outside for a quick neighborhood “E-A-G-L-E-S” chant. We know better. Because we know what this group of players is about. The president labeled the Eagles unpatriotic because they do not conform to his view of the national anthem. His press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, accused the team of pulling “a political stunt” because many players declined the White House invitation. “The vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans,” she said. Hardly. Since the start of the 2017 season, this group of young men has done nothing but embrace its fans, its community and oh, by the way, the Vince Lombardi Trophy. No one feels abandoned. I’ve covered sports in Philadelphia for more than three decades. Never have I seen a group of players more dedicated to one another, their fans and the city in which they play: Safety Malcolm Jenkins, perhaps the most visible leader in the players’ protest against racial injustice, spends his time off riding along with police officers, visiting prisons and meeting with public defenders and lawmakers. He headed the players’ coalition that prodded owners last December to commit up to $89 million to help grass-roots organizations battle injustice. "
"WASHINGTON — After spending nearly a month out of the public eye, Melania Trump emerged from the White House on Wednesday, putting an end to at least a few of the theories — some her husband has repeated to his 52 million Twitter followers — that blossomed like swampland ragweed during her time in seclusion. Dressed in a trench coat and heels, the first lady accompanied President Trump to the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to attend a briefing on the coming hurricane season. Sitting nearly still, Mrs. Trump cut a totemic figure alongside Mr. Trump as they sat around a conference table at the agency’s headquarters. The president, reading from a notecard, introduced “our great first lady” to several members of his cabinet, Vice President Mike Pence and an assembled group of reporters. “She went through a little rough patch, but she’s doing great,” Mr. Trump said, patting his wife on the hand. “The people love you. Thank you, honey.” Mrs. Trump spent five days at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in May to treat what her aides called a benign kidney condition, and had not appeared in public since before entering the hospital. On Twitter Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump bitterly complained about the speculation by the public and some journalists about her absence. But in attacking what he said were several conspiracy theories the news media had generated about his wife’s absence, he ended up repeating the kind of unfounded rumors about his wife that would normally attract legal action from him and his notoriously litigious family.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump commuted the sentence on Wednesday of a 63-year-old woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug conviction after her case was brought to his attention by the reality television star Kim Kardashian West. Although short of a full pardon, the decision will free Alice Marie Johnson, who has been locked up in federal prison in Alabama since 1996 on charges related to cocaine distribution and money laundering. Ms. Kardashian West, who learned of the case through a video that went viral on social media, visited Mr. Trump at the White House last week to lobby on Ms. Johnson’s behalf. “While this administration will always be very tough on crime, it believes that those who have paid their debt to society and worked hard to better themselves while in prison deserve a second chance,” the White House said in a statement announcing the commutation. Ms. Kardashian West celebrated the decision on Twitter. “BEST NEWS EVER!!!!” she wrote. In an emailed statement, she thanked Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for showing mercy to Ms. Johnson. “Her commutation and forthcoming release is inspirational and gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of a second chance,” Ms. Kardashian West said. The president’s intervention was contrary to the policies his own Justice Department has enacted since he took office. Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year ordered federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible charges and sentences against criminal defendants, reversing President Barack Obama’s efforts to ease penalties in nonviolent drug cases. The arguments advanced on Ms. Johnson’s behalf were essentially the same that were made for thousands of other nonviolent drug convicts whose petitions for presidential clemency have been languishing at the Justice Department without action. While Mr. Obama pardoned 212 people and commuted the sentences of 1,715 prisoners, including 568 serving life sentences, Mr. Trump has acted mainly on a few high-profile cases brought to him by associates and allies.

"SEOUL, South Korea — He ordered his uncle executed and half brother assassinated. He spent millions developing and testing a hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles as his people suffered severe food shortages. He exchanged threats of nuclear annihilation with President Trump, calling the American leader a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” That was last year’s image. In more recent months, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has achieved one of the most striking transformations in modern diplomacy. The man described by critics as a murderous dictator and nuclear lunatic has held hands and had heart-to-heart talks with South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who has encouraged and abetted Mr. Kim’s makeover. Mr. Kim has enticed South Korea and the United States into negotiations by dangling the possibility of denuclearizing his country. His popularity has surged in polls in South Korea as he prepares to become the first North Korean leader to meet a sitting American president. With a dazzle of diplomatic initiatives in the run-up to his historic June 12 summit meeting with Mr. Trump in Singapore, Mr. Kim has effectively redefined himself. Some South Koreans now see him as more reliable than Mr. Trump despite the decades-long alliance between their country and the United States. Mr. Kim’s enhanced standing among South Koreans was crystallized by recent images of him walking in the woods with Mr. Moon, and on a beach with President Xi Jinping of China discussing North Korea’s nuclear program.

"WASHINGTON — Democrats enhanced their prospects for winning control of the House with Tuesday’s coast-to-coast primary results, skirting potential calamity in California and lining up likely gains in New Jersey and possible victories in Iowa and New Mexico. The Democratic Party had feared disaster in California, where a quirky “jungle primary” gives the November ballot to the top two finishers, regardless of party. But Democratic contenders there leveraged financial and strategic help from the national party to weather the winnowing primary, and ensure that they will field candidates in multiple districts that they will most likely need if they are to win control in November. “Even though Democrats had to spend a few million dollars, crisis averted,” said Nathan Gonzales, a veteran House race handicapper and the editor of the Inside Elections newsletter. Republicans avoided their own worst-case scenario as well, securing a spot in the California governor’s race, which should help bring G.O.P. voters to the polls this fall to vote for their party’s House candidates. Republicans missed a slot on the ballot to challenge Senator Dianne Feinstein’s re-election bid, but a shutout in both California’s Senate race and its contest for governor could have severely depressed conservative turnout. Republican voters also chose strong candidates in Southern California for the showdown in November. The Democrats had more on the line, and more to celebrate. They will be able to mount challenges in places where the party feared being shut out, including open seats near San Diego and Los Angeles and districts represented by Republican incumbents in Orange County, Los Angeles County and around Modesto. Between California and New Jersey, Democrats will contend for at least 10 Republican-held seats, nearly half of the 23 they need for control. While California was the focal point of Tuesday’s voting, New Jersey was one of a handful of other states where the battle for the House was also joined, including Iowa and New Mexico. "
"BRUSSELS — This week leaders from the G-7 countries will meet in Canada to discuss some of the key problems facing the world today. The agenda of the conference is guided by themes like gender equality, preparing for jobs of the future and foreign threats to our democracies. But there is no hiding that our talks will be held in the specific political context of President Trump’s recent decisions and the reactions they have provoked on both sides of the Atlantic. By which I mean the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, and the new tariffs on steel and aluminum, including the way they were imposed and the arguments used to justify them. To me, an incurable pro-American European fanatically devoted to the idea of trans-Atlantic cooperation, these decisions are unfortunate and worrying. The crucial question today is whether these decisions are only incidental changes to current American policy (to which, of course, every president is entitled) or the beginning of a new strategic trend. Simply put: Are they merely seasonal turbulences or rather the first symptoms of the breakup of the Western political community, which the G-7 represents and informally leads? It’s inevitable that this will be on everyone’s mind at the conference, given the signals that Washington may not be interested in reconfirming our shared commitment to the rules-based international order as one of the main aims of our group. This is no laughing matter. The alternative to order is disorder. When I hosted Vice President Mike Pence and, subsequently, President Trump in Brussels last year, I expressed my belief that it is in the West’s interest to maintain a rules-based international order in which brute force and egoism do not determine everything. That rules-based order can be enforced only by a common, mutually supportive and decisive policy of the whole Western community. For millions of people worldwide, the West’s predictability and stability guarantee or, at the very least, offer hope that chaos, violence and arrogance will not triumph. Whoever wants to demolish this order must know that we will stay united in its defense. I will make this case to the other participants of the G-7 conference. After all, our community cannot be blown apart by aluminum tariffs. The essence of cooperation within the G-7 is the de facto protection of the free world against those who disrespect our shared fundamental values: freedom and dignity of the individual, equal rights for people and nations, and fair rules. This is what led us to exclude Russia from our group after its attack on Ukraine. The effectiveness of our action has always been directly proportional to our solidarity. It will be worth bearing this in mind when we meet in Canada and discuss foreign threats to our democracies. But even more important will be the spirit of our debate and, I hope, our shared belief that only united are we capable of protecting the free world. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Welcome to a special (and sleep-deprived!) edition of California Today. The nation’s eyes were on our state Tuesday, and for good reason. California may be the most important battleground for Democrats in their drive to claim a majority in Congress. But Democrats have been nervous because of California’s “top two” election system, which they have worried might shut them out from the November ballot in some pivotal races. As of early this morning, California was living up to its reputation for being notoriously slow at vote counting, and a lot remains to be seen. Still, here’s a look at what we know so far: • Our reporters put together this story, which rounds up everything that happened on Tuesday. At the top of the ticket, Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, captured one of two spots on the November ballot. The other went to John Cox, a Republican business executive. That left Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a Democrat and former Los Angeles mayor, out of the mix. • Mr. Cox’s showing represented a major tactical victory for national Republicans as they seek to protect seven seats in California that Democrats are targeting. If Democrats win each of those seats, the gains would amount to nearly a third of the 23 seats they need over all to flip the House. • We’ve been compiling live results here. (And the votes are still coming in.) • And here is our live briefing that will catch you up to speed if you haven’t been paying much attention to all this primary hubbub. "
"WASHINGTON — Two top aides resigned Wednesday from the Environmental Protection Agency as its administrator, Scott Pruitt, faced mounting allegations of misusing his authority, including by seeking a Chick-fil-A fast-food franchise for his wife. Millan Hupp, Mr. Pruitt’s scheduler, and Sarah Greenwalt, a senior counsel to the administrator, have come under scrutiny in recent weeks in connection with Mr. Pruitt’s spending and ethics concerns. Before joining the agency, both Ms. Hupp and Ms. Greenwalt worked for Mr. Pruitt in Oklahoma, where he served as attorney general. Both aides later received substantial raises at the E.P.A., bypassing the usual White House procedures. Mr. Pruitt told Congress he neither knew about nor approved of the raises, and he told lawmakers he reversed the raises when he learned about them. The departures come as Mr. Pruitt faces fresh questions about his management decisions. On Monday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, which is conducting one of 12 investigations into his spending and ties to lobbyists, released a partial transcript of an interview with Ms. Hupp showing that Mr. Pruitt asked her to do personal errands for him, including apartment hunting and asking the Trump International Hotel if Mr. Pruitt could purchase a used mattress. Emails obtained under public records laws also showed that Mr. Pruitt had asked Sydney Hupp, Ms. Hupp’s sister and the administrator’s former scheduler, to facilitate a meeting with the chief executive of Chick-fil-A regarding a “potential business opportunity.” That turned out to be a possible franchise for Mr. Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn. In an interview with the Nexstar Media Group on Wednesday Mr. Pruitt defended the effort, which was first reported by The Washington Post. He also praised the Chick-fil-A chain. "
"Of course Donald Trump is corrupt. Everyone with any sense knew he would be, although the scale of his personal profiteering, the strong likelihood that his family’s financial interests have distorted U.S. foreign and national security policy, have startled even the cynics. And, of course, the example set by the grifter in chief has infected his whole administration. But what’s really striking to me is not so much the extent of corruption among Trump officials as its pettiness. And that pettiness itself tells you a lot about the kind of people now running America. Corrupt cabinet members used to look like Albert Fall, Warren Harding’s secretary of the interior, who was at the center of the Teapot Dome scandal. Fall used his office to secure sweetheart leasing deals for two oil companies, and in return received more than $400,000 in bribes — well over $5 million in today’s prices. That’s the kind of corruption you can understand and sort of respect. Corrupt Trump officials, by contrast, look like Tom Price, who managed to lose his job as secretary of health and human services by taking too many private planes at public expense; Ryan Zinke, who holds Fall’s old job at Interior and has a problem similar to Price’s but with helicopters and a general habit of using public funds to pay for private travel; Ben Carson of Housing and Urban Development, with his $31,000 dining set; and Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who likes taking military jets, sometimes on what appear to be private vacations. And then there’s the prince of perks: Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose list of petty grifts includes everything from customized fountain pens, to telling an aide to procure a used mattress, to an attempt to use his office to secure a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. One thing that immediately strikes me about these stories is that all these officials are failing the marshmallow test — the famous if controversial psychological experiment in which children are told they can get two marshmallows if they can wait a few minutes before eating the one in front of them.

"SEOUL, South Korea — Satellite imagery indicates that North Korea is razing some facilities used for testing one of its most dangerous missiles after its leader, Kim Jong-un, announced a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, according to an analysis released this week. A “key missile test stand” that was used for testing missile ejections from canisters was demolished at a test site near Kusong in North Korea’s northwest, Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., an expert on the country’s weapons systems, said in a report published Wednesday on the website 38 North. The Kusong test site was being closely monitored by missile experts because North Korea launched its first solid-fuel midrange ballistic missile, known as Pukguksong-2, from there in February last year. Besides its intercontinental ballistic missiles, solid-fuel missiles have been among the most worrisome additions to North Korea’s growing arsenal of ballistic missiles. They can be launched faster and are easier to transport and hide, making them more suitable for surprise attacks. Work to raze the missile test stand and nearby support structures began in the second week of May and appeared nearly complete in satellite imagery taken on May 19, Mr. Bermudez said. He said the stand was the only known facility in North Korea used for land-based, canister-launched ballistic missile ejection tests, which are critical for developing the solid-propellant Pukguksong-2 or longer-range systems. Militaries use canisters to “cold launch” missiles, ejecting them high into the air before their fuel ignites. The North’s Pukguksong series are cold launch missiles. "
"Few political donors are as influential, yet little known, as Liz and Dick Uihlein. The Midwestern couple has joined the upper pantheon of Republican donors alongside names like Koch, Mercer and Adelson. They have spent roughly $26 million on the current election cycle, supporting more than 60 congressional candidates, working outside the party establishment to advance a combative, hard-right conservatism, from Washington to the smallest town. Mr. Uihlein (pronounced YOU-line), a scion of one of the founders of Schlitz beer, underwrites firebrand anti-establishment candidates who typically defend broad access to assault weapons and assail transgender rights. He has also bankrolled partisan newspapers and backed Roy Moore in Alabama even after he was accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls. Mrs. Uihlein is the hands-on president of Uline, the packing supply giant the couple founded together nearly four decades ago. Her own views emerge in dispatches she sends out in the company catalog: about her devotion to Fox News, her love for Hall & Oates — they once performed at Uline — and her disdain for marijuana. “Have the politicians gone mad?” she once wrote about the legalization of the drug. “It’s bad news.” Perhaps nothing illustrates the couple’s determination to set the agenda more than their efforts in the Wisconsin town of Manitowish Waters. They have spent millions remaking the small community and buying up much of its downtown. In 2016, shortly before Mrs. Uihlein joined the Trump campaign as a major fund-raiser, she threatened to divert $300,000 in planned donations if the town didn’t move a boat ramp that was near a pavilion she had built. “I find this delay unnecessary and unacceptable,” she wrote to a local official, in an email with the subject line, “The Derailment of What is Best for Manitowish Waters.” “I need an answer now,” she added. “I am done waiting.” Married for 51 years, both in their 70s, the Uihleins rarely grant interviews. But in a statement responding to questions provided by The Times, the couple said,“We care about our community and our country and choose to personally support candidates that share our policy beliefs.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump will skip most of the second day of a summit meeting with allies this weekend, the White House said late Thursday, as he engaged in a contentious war of words over trade on the eve of a gathering that will underscore his isolation from the leaders of the world’s largest economies. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced that Mr. Trump will leave Canada at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, well before scheduled sessions on climate change, clean energy and oceans. He will attend an early-morning session on “women’s empowerment,” but he will be gone before any joint statement is issued by the other leaders. Earlier Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada lashed out at Mr. Trump for imposing tariffs on their steel and aluminum industries. They called it an illegal economic assault on their countries that is unanimously opposed by the other leaders of the Group of 7 who will gather Friday in a sleepy village in Quebec for their annual summit meeting. “The American President may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a 6 country agreement if need be,” Mr. Macron said Thursday in an especially acerbic tweet. “Because these 6 countries represent values, they represent an economic market which has the weight of history behind it and which is now a true international force.” Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference with Mr. Macron that “we are going to defend our industries and our workers” and “show the U.S. president that his unacceptable actions are hurting his own citizens.” Mr. Trump responded with his trademark Twitter bluntness a few hours later, signaling that he has no intention of relenting on his aggressive trade demands and cares little about the diplomatic niceties that usually constrain public disagreements between the leaders of friendly nations.

"WASHINGTON — A White House economic analysis of President Trump’s trade agenda has concluded that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will hurt economic growth in the United States, according to several people familiar with the research. The findings from the White House Council of Economic Advisers have been circulated only internally and not publicly released, as is often the case with the council’s work, making the exact economic projections unknown. But the determination comes as top White House officials continue to insist publicly that Mr. Trump’s trade approach will be “massively good for the U.S. economy.” The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, an economist who came to the administration from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, dodged questions at a White House briefing on Tuesday about whether tariffs would hurt an economy that has accelerated during Mr. Trump’s tenure. Asked whether the administration’s economists had modeled the impact that a trade war with China would have on the United States economy, Mr. Hassett said Mr. Trump was a great negotiator who would persuade other countries to open their markets to American products. “If you model a future where everybody else reduces their trade barriers to ours, then that’s massively good for the global economy and massively good for the U.S. economy,” Mr. Hassett said. But the immediate effect of the administration’s trade agenda has been the opposite, as other nations retaliate against the United States with their own tariffs. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, after heavy lobbying by the chemical industry, is scaling back the way the federal government determines health and safety risks associated with the most dangerous chemicals on the market, documents from the Environmental Protection Agency show. Under a law passed by Congress during the final year of the Obama administration, the E.P.A. was required for the first time to evaluate hundreds of potentially toxic chemicals and determine if they should face new restrictions, or even be removed from the market. The chemicals include many in everyday use, such as dry-cleaning solvents, paint strippers and substances used in health and beauty products like shampoos and cosmetics. But as it moves forward reviewing the first batch of 10 chemicals, the E.P.A. has in most cases decided to exclude from its calculations any potential exposure caused by the substances’ presence in the air, the ground or water, according to more than 1,500 pages of documents released last week by the agency. Instead, the agency will focus on possible harm caused by direct contact with a chemical in the workplace or elsewhere. The approach means that the improper disposal of chemicals — leading to the contamination of drinking water, for instance — will often not be a factor in deciding whether to restrict or ban them. The approach is a big victory for the chemical industry, which has repeatedly pressed the E.P.A. to narrow the scope of its risk evaluations. Nancy B. Beck, the Trump administration’s appointee to help oversee the E.P.A.’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups. A spokesman for the E.P.A. said that the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and other laws already provided the agency with the authority to regulate chemicals found in the air, rivers and drinking water, so there was no need to revisit them under the 2016 law, which updated the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.

"To the Editor: Re “How to Repair the National Marriage” (column, June 5): I find it insulting that David Brooks likens our political crisis to a bad marriage while our democracy unravels. These are not two political parties seeking to be understood by each other. This is not a dispute that can be resolved by good manners. The Republican Party does not want to recommit to a bipartisan ideal; Republicans are quite content to ignore President Trump’s outrageous behavior and to sacrifice the integrity of our democratic institutions to plow through their agenda. How can Mr. Brooks waste his intellect on this useless metaphor? Why is he not outraged? BEVERLY WOYTOWICH, BROOKLYN "
"For all his bluster about trade wars, President Trump seems willing to push China only so far: Witness the deal on Thursday to grant Chinese telecom giant ZTE a reprieve from harsh American penalties. The reason is likely to lead straight to Iowa soybean and corn farmers like Benjamin Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt’s forebears have farmed the same land outside Iowa City for nearly 150 years. He and his father together till about 2,500 acres of the fertile prairie that stretches from Ohio through Nebraska. When I reached him last week, he was on his tractor, spreading fertilizer on this year’s corn crop. Apart from the weather, hardly any issue looms larger for farmers than the prospect of retaliatory tariffs against American agriculture products. China has threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans and has already sharply curtailed purchases from the United States. This week Mexico imposed a 20 percent tariff on pork. The European Union and Canada have said they, too, will slap tariffs on a variety of American agricultural products. “China is our most important export market for soybeans,” Mr. Schmidt said. “When your most important customer hits you with tariffs, there are going to be serious ramifications. My first reaction was this is going to hit us pretty hard.” Grant Kimberley, who with his father farms 4,000 acres near Maxwell, Iowa, and is director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association, was even more emphatic: “We want to sell to China, Mexico, whoever. We should be part of the solution, which is bringing down the trade imbalance.” American farmers may be dwindling in absolute numbers, but they wield outsize influence in the raging war between protectionists and free traders in the Trump White House. That’s because of both the importance of their occupation to the balance of trade — United States agricultural exports have averaged nearly $140 billion a year since 2010 — and their geographical concentration in states that were critical to Mr. Trump’s 2016 electoral majority.

"To the Editor: I have been reading with an increasingly heavy heart news articles about the Trump administration’s separation of children from their parents at the border. But I was stopped cold by a quote in Nicholas Kristof’s column “ ‘My Babies Started Crying’ as ICE Took Them Away” (May 31): “White House Chief of Staff John Kelly hails family separation as a ‘tough deterrent’ and shrugs that ‘the children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever.’ ” “Or whatever” — that most dismissive phrase! So, it has come to this: We have weaponized the callous traumatization of children in the name of the promised immigration reform. Children have become acceptable collateral damage in a policy war. Are there no parents in this administration? Are there no parents in the Border Patrol? Are there no Trump supporters who are parents? How can anyone who has children justify this? ANITA MORAN, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: Reacting to the separation of immigrant children from their parents at our border, it is important to emphasize the subject of the lifelong trauma suffered by these children. The Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, with the National Foster Youth Institute, was recently host to more than a hundred former foster youths in Washington. We heard directly from participants who were separated from their parents at a young age. "
"PARIS — In a book just published, “The World As It Is,” Barack Obama’s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, tells of a tear in Angela Merkel’s eye as she bade farewell to the departing American president for the final time in Berlin on Nov. 17, 2016. Nine days earlier, the election of his successor, Donald J. Trump, had shaken the world. Nowhere had the tremor been felt deeper than in Europe; the German chancellor told Mr. Obama that she saw it as her duty to run for a fourth term because of Mr. Trump. “She’s all alone,” Mr. Obama noted. Someone had to take on the mantle and defend the liberal international order. Chancellor Merkel ran, barely won and spent the next six months negotiating a governing coalition. In the meantime, in France, Emmanuel Macron won a stunning victory against his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen. Last month, as President Macron was about to fly to St. Petersburg to meet President Vladimir V. Putin, I asked a Russian diplomat how the French head of state would be perceived in Russia. “As the leader of the Western world,” he replied. Having apparently given up on an American administration they have learned not to trust because of its leader’s unpredictability and the checks, balances and investigations that limit him, the Russians are putting their scorn of Europeans on hold in hopes of finding someone more reliable to talk to. That the “Western world” still exists in the eyes of the Russians is certainly reassuring, since the very existence of the West is now being questioned within the trans-Atlantic community. When the leaders of the G-7 countries (United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Japan) gather in Quebec on Friday for their annual meeting, it will be no love feast. Already having shrunk from G-8 after Russia was excluded following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the group was described last week as the “G-6+1” by Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, as he and other European ministers were angrily confronting the American Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, over President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But don’t bet on the “G-6” to spearhead a united assault to defend the free world. Italy is now also led by populists and Britain is absorbed in deep soul-searching as it severs its links with the European Union. At a security summit on Asia last week, Singapore’s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, declined to call Britain “a European power.” “I don’t know what you are now,” he added, perplexed. Welcome to the world of 2018, when we celebrate the centenary of the end of World War I and indulge in nostalgic reminiscence of the popular upheavals of 1968, 50 years ago, while our current international order is in disarray. This may well end up as the year of the awakening of Europe. We will have one man to thank for opening our eyes: Donald J. Trump. "
"In the spring of 2010, Christopher Steele, a former British spy with a shock of graying hair and a quiet, understated manner, received some alarming news: Vladimir Putin, a lifelong ice hockey fan, had taken a sudden interest in soccer. This was years before Mr. Steele compiled his now famous dossier on Donald Trump, with its references to clandestine meetings in Prague and, of course, “the pee tape.” In 2010, Mr. Steele, regarded among those who knew him as a serious and levelheaded MI6 officer, had only recently retired and opened his private intelligence firm in London. He might have reasonably expected to be embarking on an uneventful, if lucrative, second career. But the story of what happened next would profoundly affect his and countless others’ lives, foreshadowing the Trump investigation and the shadowy role Russia plays in the modern world. Among Mr. Steele’s first clients was a group of wealthy individuals and corporations supporting England’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup. The tournament hadn’t been held in England since 1966, and the country’s soccer-mad populace was desperate to do so again. England invented the modern-day game in the 19th century and, at the outset of the 21st, believed it was uniquely poised to host, with dozens of world-class stadiums, hotels, highways and airports ready. The British government chipped in £2.1 million of the bid’s more than £17 million total cost, and international celebrities including Prince William, David Beckham and David Cameron, then the prime minister, promoted the effort. Mr. Steele had been hired, in large part, because of his expertise in Russia, one of six countries vying for the right to host the tournament. In the early 1990s, he had worked undercover in Moscow, and he maintained extensive contacts in Russian government and business circles. His mandate in the spring of 2010 was to find out anything he could about the competing bid. He was no stranger to Russia’s playbook. When it came to pursuing national objectives, the country had few if any compunctions about employing whatever means — collusive, corrupting, scandalous — might be necessary. And on its face, it was clear the Russian bid was going to need a lot of help. In stark contrast to England, Russia appeared profoundly unqualified to host a monthlong tournament expected to draw well over three million spectators. For starters, Russia didn’t have a great soccer tradition; its team hadn’t even qualified to play in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, thanks to an embarrassing loss to Slovenia. More important, it didn’t have adequate stadiums or other infrastructure, and since it was already going to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, there were serious questions about how it could afford to build what was required.  The International Federation of Association Football, or FIFA, the Swiss-based nonprofit that runs the World Cup and oversees world soccer, ultimately rated Russia’s bid riskiest for operational considerations among other contestants for the 2018 tournament. To most observers, Russia didn’t seem like a serious threat to England’s hopes, but Mr. Steele’s confidential sources told a very different story. Mr. Putin, then serving a four-year term as prime minister, saw hosting the World Cup as a vital way to project his country’s power, and his own, around the world. He was determined, sources said, to win the bid at any cost. "
"TRENTON — New Jersey moved one step closer on Thursday to making it easier for gamblers to be separated from their money. The State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting, paving the way for casinos and racetracks to take wages and providing the state with a new source of revenue. It is likely a matter of days now before cash can start changing hands at casinos in Atlantic City and at Monmouth Park Racetrack near the Jersey Shore and perhaps take advantage of the global interest in the World Cup, which begins next week, or the National Basketball Association finals. The last remaining hurdle is the signature of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, who supports sports betting but has not said publicly when he would sign the bill into law. The bill’s passage represents a capstone to the more than six-year effort to bring sports betting to New Jersey and helps spur interest in and provide a financial boost to the struggling casino and horse racing industries. Last month, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited commercial sports betting in most states. Although Delaware beat New Jersey in opening the betting window, allowing gambling to begin Tuesday, New Jersey is the first state to officially make wagering legal in a state where it had been prohibited since the Supreme Court’s decision. Delaware had been grandfathered in for select betting options. "
"Forget policy. Forget ideology. Forget hating Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi. From Indiana to Arizona to Ohio, the name of the game for Republican candidates this primary cycle has been to flaunt their Trump love. And woe unto anyone deemed insufficiently smitten. This week’s primary elections underscored the striking degree to which President Trump has transformed the Republican Party from a political organization into a cult of personality. By contrast, Democrats show signs of taking a more pluralistic approach, fielding candidates who are willing and even eager to break with their national leaders — the House minority leader, Ms. Pelosi, in particular. For Republicans tempted by Trump apostasy, Tuesday’s clearest cautionary tale was that of Representative Martha Roby, an Alabama Republican. Two years ago, Ms. Roby was considered a real comer. But then she got all squeamish about the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Mr. Trump shared some of his more pungent dating tips, and she called on him to leave the race. Unfortunately for Ms. Roby, her district ultimately went for Mr. Trump by 32 percentage points. And although she has been a loyal Trump supporter ever since his win, many voters back home are still sore about her brief heresy. Throughout this primary season, Ms. Roby’s Republican opponents were quick to bring up her 2016 comments, and come Tuesday, the congresswoman failed to win the nomination outright. She’s now facing a runoff next month against former Representative Bobby Bright, who ran ads accusing her of having “turned her back on President Trump when he needed her the most.” (Mr. Bright is the party-switching former Democrat from whom Ms. Roby wrested her House seat in 2010.) On the opposite end of the Trump-impact spectrum is John Cox, a Republican businessman running for governor of California. With registered Republicans down to 25 percent of the Golden State electorate (putting them slightly behind independent voters), the party is as likely to capture the governorship this year as Jeff Sessions is to be the next head of the American Civil Liberties Union. Nonetheless, Republicans needed a candidate at the top of the ticket to increase turnout for all the down-ballot House seats they’re fighting over. With the state’s wacky primary system, in which the top two vote-getters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation, that was hardly a given. (A longtime senator, Dianne Feinstein, will be facing a fellow Democrat.) But late in the race, Mr. Trump came out strongly for Mr. Cox, tweeting his praises, energizing the troops and propelling him to a solid second place behind Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor. It is, of course, not unusual for presidents to have political coattails — and for the party wandering in the wilderness to show greater openness to new ideas and new kinds of candidates. The Democratic approach may be more a function of default (or desperation) than design, but Ms. Pelosi still deserves props for not seeking to kneecap candidates, like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, who have said they would not support her as speaker. With a bit of luck, genuine ferment and debate among Democratic candidates and officeholders over the right direction on issues like trade and immigration might result in at least one party oriented around a set of ideas.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump asserted Thursday that his decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal had already curbed Iran’s aggressive behavior, and he predicted that his hard-nosed tactics would also result in a successful nuclear negotiation with North Korea. Iran, he said, was no longer as adventurous in Syria and Yemen, and had relaxed its ambitions to extend its influence all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. “Iran is not the same country that it was a few months ago,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference, five days before he was scheduled to meet in Singapore with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. “They’re a much, much different group of leaders,” he concluded. Mr. Trump cited no evidence to support his contention. Iran remains firmly under the control of its theocratic government, it continues to support proxy forces across the Middle East, and it just announced plans to increase its capacity to enrich uranium after Mr. Trump’s withdrawal. Still, the president said his willingness to walk away from the Iran deal would set the right tone for his negotiations with Mr. Kim over North Korea’s nuclear program. Mr. Trump pointed out that he had already walked away from the Singapore meeting once — a decision he reversed after 24 hours when the Kim government issued a conciliatory response. “I hope it won’t be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong-un wants to do something,” Mr. Trump said, standing in the Rose Garden alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “I believe we’re going to have a terrific success or a modified success.” Depending on the degree of success, the president said, he could foresee inviting Mr. Kim to a follow-up meeting at the White House. And he left open the possibility of signing a peace declaration that would formally end the Korean War after nearly seven decades of military hostilities. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A chilly G7, a $1 billion ZTE resolution and an Australian connection to the Triple Crown contender. Here’s what you need to know. • Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited the White House, in what amounted to a last-ditch effort to stiffen President Trump’s spine before his talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on Tuesday. For his part, Mr. Trump said his willingness to walk away from the Iran deal had set him up for success with Mr. Kim. He also appeared dismissive of the kind of full-bore preparation common to summit meetings. “This isn’t a question of preparation,” he said. “It’s a question of whether people want it to happen.” North Korea appears to be getting ready: Satellite imagery reported this week indicates that the country is demolishing some facilities used for testing one of its most dangerous missiles.

"To the Editor: Re “A Fiery Affront, Back in 1814, but You Can’t Blame Canada” (news article, June 7), about the report of President Trump’s mistaken suggestion that Canada burned down the White House two centuries ago: It was good of you to supply readers with a brief refresher course about the War of 1812, as Mr. Trump is surely not the only American to be a tad fuzzy about the details — or even, let’s be honest, the basics. With Independence Day less than a month off, now would not be a bad time to point out that Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture,” a perennially boisterous highlight of the Boston Pops’s nationally broadcast Fourth of July concert, not only has nothing to do with the aforementioned dispute, it also has nothing to do with America. The work commemorates Russia’s defense against Napoleon’s invading Grande Armée in 1812. Why does the Boston Pops perform a Russian-themed composition on America’s Independence Day? Because although our homegrown composers — Ives, Sousa, Copland, Gershwin, Ruggles, Bernstein — wrote an abundance of rousing patriotic music, they all forgot to include live cannon fire in the arrangements.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook has been fighting for months the perception that it did not do enough to protect people’s privacy. On Thursday, the company said it had again failed to keep the information of millions of users private. As many as 14 million Facebook users who thought they were creating private posts last month that only a small group of friends could see were, in fact, making public posts that anyone could view. Facebook blamed a software bug for the problem. The company did not say how it had found the bug, or how it knew the problem was limited to 14 million people. In a statement, Facebook said the bug affected users from May 18 to May 22, while the company was testing a new feature. By May 27, the company had changed the affected posts from a public setting back to a private one. “We’d like to apologize for this mistake,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, said in a statement. “We have fixed this issue, and starting today we are letting everyone affected know and are asking them to review any posts they made during that time.” In the last few months, Facebook executives have repeatedly been forced to apologize to users for failing to protect their privacy.

"Almost one week after Kanye West released his eighth studio album, “Ye,” we wonder what to do with artists who displease us. Going back to 2004, we take a closer look at Kanye, the artist, who questioned the role of higher education, called out former president George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina on live television, and publicly grieved over the untimely death of his mother. We also examine Kanye, the problem, and try to understand how the same person who seemed to champion black solidarity in the early 2000s is now calling slavery a choice and aligning himself with President Trump. From “The College Dropout” to “808s & Heartbreak” to “Yeezus” to “Ye,” we’ve kept listening to Kanye, but we ask ourselves: what will make us stop?

"You can see the gig economy everywhere but in the statistics. For years, economists, pundits and policymakers have grappled with the rise of Uber, the growth of temporary work and the fissuring of the relationship between companies and their workers. Optimists cheered the flexibility offered by the freelance life. Pessimists fretted about the disappearance of traditional jobs, with the benefits and legal protections they provided. That debate has played out largely in the absence of solid data. But on Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its first in-depth look at nontraditional work since 2005, and came to a startling conclusion: The old-fashioned job remains king. Roughly 10 percent of American workers in 2017 were employed in some form of what the government calls “alternative work arrangements,” a broad category including Uber drivers, freelance writers and people employed through temporary-help agencies — essentially anyone whose main source of work comes outside a traditional employment relationship. Far from a boom in gig work, that represents a slight decline from 2005, when about 11 percent of workers fell into those categories. “I think everybody’s narrative got blown up,” said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Mr. Strain and other experts cautioned that the data released on Thursday did not signal the American workplace had remained static over the past decade. The government’s numbers, by design, do not include people who do gig or freelance work in addition to traditional jobs, and they may not fully capture income-generating activities that people might not consider “work,” like renting out a home on Airbnb. Separate data released by the Federal Reserve this month found that nearly a third of adults engaged in some form of gig work, either as a primary job or to supplement other sources of income. Private-sector surveys have reached similar conclusions. "

"HONG KONG — Two House Republicans have questioned a prominent American environmental group, contending that by praising China’s efforts to reduce pollution while criticizing American shortcomings it could be working as an agent of Chinese influence. A June 5 letter from two leading Republicans on the House Committee on Natural Resources to the nonprofit environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, requested documents on its relationship with the Chinese government and answers to questions on whether it should register as a foreign agent. The N.R.D.C., which was founded in 1970 and now has about 2.4 million members, has fought efforts to scale back environmental protections in the United States, suing the Trump administration about once every 10 days, according to N.R.D.C. officials. The group has also worked for years in China to improve the country’s air quality and reduce carbon emissions. The letter, from Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, and Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican and chairman of the panel’s subcommittee on oversight and investigations, suggested the difference between the group’s aggressive stance in the United States and a more moderate tone in China meant it was serving Beijing’s interests. The letter was addressed to Rhea Suh, the N.R.D.C.’s president. “The committee is concerned about the N.R.D.C.’s role in aiding China’s perception management efforts with respect to pollution control and its international standing on environmental issues in ways that may be detrimental to the United States,” the letter said. At a time when foreign influence in American politics, particularly from Russia, is a subject of widespread national debate, the lawmakers’ attack on the N.R.D.C. could expose the group to criticism for differences in its approaches to working in China and the United States.

"WASHINGTON — An American citizen detained by the military in Iraq as a suspected Islamic State member will be released back into Syria, the Trump administration has told a judge — a plan that his lawyers called “a death warrant.” The move would avoid a fight in court over the high-stakes question of whether the government has the legal authority to put Islamic State suspects in indefinite wartime detention as enemy combatants. If a judge were to rule against the government on that question in the detention case, it would jeopardize the underpinnings of the entire war effort against the Islamic State. But lawyers for the man, whose name has not been made public, vowed to fight the planned transfer in court. The plan was the latest twist in a habeas corpus case that has raised novel legal issues about the rights of individual Americans and the government’s wartime powers. The American Civil Liberties Union planned to file an emergency request for a temporary restraining order against the military on Thursday, said Jonathan Hafetz, an A.C.L.U. lawyer who is the lead attorney for the man. In its filing late Wednesday disclosing the government’s Syria release plan, the Justice Department said the military intended to release the man in an unidentified Syrian city after at least 72 hours had passed. The Pentagon, it said, had decided that releasing the man in Syria would be consistent with traditional military practice and with the department’s obligations under the law of war. It had given the man two options — release “either in a town or outside an internally displaced person camp” — but the man had balked at both, so the Pentagon picked the town option for him. "
"ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications giant that was on the brink of collapse after being hit with tough penalties by the Trump administration, has become a linchpin of trade relations between the United States and China. On Thursday, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the administration had reached a deal to lift restrictions imposed on ZTE after it was found to have violated American sanctions related to doing business with countries like Iran and North Korea. ZTE’s fate has been at the center of a broader dispute between China and the United States, and the deal announced on Thursday could inflame a battle with Congress over national security interests. Here’s what you need to know. Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment, known as ZTE, makes cheap smartphones that are mostly sold in developing countries, though it also sells them in the United States. But ZTE is one of two Chinese companies — Huawei is the other — that sell equipment for cellular networks. It has about 75,000 employees and says it does business in more than 160 countries. That makes it an important geopolitical pawn for Beijing, both as an innovator and as a builder of state-funded projects overseas. If China wants to improve ties with a government in the developing world, it often offers loans that can be used to set a ZTE-powered cellular network. Longer term, China hopes that companies like ZTE will become powerhouses that can help the country wean itself from a reliance on American tech firms, which Beijing views as security threats because of the possibility that they could help Washington spy. Tech supply chains are so intertwined these days that just about every product that ZTE makes has some American components or software in it — think microchips, modems and Google’s Android operating system. So if ZTE sells a smartphone to North Korea, it might also be selling a Qualcomm chip inside that phone. That’s illegal under American sanctions that prohibit the sale of United States tech to embargoed countries. "
"For several months, President Trump has been vandalizing the global economy and subverting the rules of international trade with his wrecking ball of tariff indiscretions. Finally, someone in Congress is doing something to stop this menace. Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced legislation on Wednesday that takes back some of the authority President Trump has been abusing under the guise of protecting national security. Mr. Corker, who is retiring, attracted six Republican co-sponsors for the bill, which would amend the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to require the president to get approval from Congress for any tariffs proposed on national security grounds. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he would not allow the legislation to come to the floor as a stand-alone bill. House Speaker Paul Ryan seems similarly uninterested in a bill likely to be vetoed by Mr. Trump. “You would have to pass a law that he would want to sign into law,” Mr. Ryan said. “You can do the math on that.” Why don’t the president’s trade transgressions elicit meaningful resistance from party leadership? His trade views are disdainful of freedom and informed by economic fallacies, yet Republican leaders have watched quietly from the sidelines as Mr. Trump misappropriates his authorities to disrupt global supply chains, inflict pain on American trade partners, generate enormous amounts of domestic collateral damage and make the United States an international scofflaw. The United States Constitution vests authority in Congress to collect duties and to “regulate commerce with foreign nations.” But over the course of the 20th century, Congress delegated some of its authority to the president. In most cases, the statutes giving the executive branch the authority to raise tariffs require that certain conditions be met and that any actions taken be subject to limitations, as well as judicial review. President Trump has found a way to weaponize these statutes to advance his “America First” agenda. Since taking office, he has initiated six investigations under three highly contentious laws. Five of those investigations — on steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panel components and Chinese technology products — have led to the president imposing or announcing tariffs on imports of more than 1,500 products valued at about $100 billion. A new investigation of whether imports of automobiles and parts constitute a national security threat could raise the value of sanctioned imports to $400 billion. Factoring in the likelihood of retaliation against American exporters, about 20 percent of total goods trade could find itself in the cross hairs by year’s end. "
"WASHINGTON — Hoping to defuse a Republican rebellion, Speaker Paul D. Ryan promised Thursday that House Republicans would draft compromise legislation on immigration, setting up a showdown on one of the thorniest political issues just as the midterm campaign comes into focus. Conservative Republicans loath to loosen immigration rules remained at odds with moderates pressing to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, as Mr. Ryan and his fellow leaders in the House labored to reach an accord. And the deadline for an agreement could come within days. Moderate Republican lawmakers need only three more signatures on a petition to force a series of immigration votes over the speaker’s objections, including at least two that would focus on those young immigrants, known as Dreamers. Because of the arcane rules for such “discharge petitions,” those lawmakers face a Tuesday cutoff to gather the 218 names needed to force floor action in late June. “We have a firm deadline of Tuesday,” said Representative Jeff Denham of California, a leader of the petition drive. “Tuesday we will hit 218.” After a lengthy meeting with his conference to discuss immigration, Mr. Ryan stressed that pursuing a compromise bill would be a better course than forcing the issue through a petition. “The next step is to start putting pen to paper so we can get legislation to the floor,” Mr. Ryan told reporters after the meeting. He argued that if rank-and-file lawmakers were to go ahead with forcing immigration votes, the resulting measure would not become law. "
"The scenes in the political ads play out in almost the same order: A heartbreaking story about someone who can’t seem to stop taking drugs. A grim statistic about opioids. And then a somber pitch from a candidate promising solutions. More and more, politicians in competitive races are using emotional pleas about opioid abuse to woo voters. In states like Wisconsin, where hundreds of people are dying of opioid overdoses every year, candidates are talking about drugs in stump speeches, on Facebook and in ads. The opioid fight has become a shared talking point for Democrats and Republicans, who discuss the crisis using startlingly similar language and often vote together to pass bills. On Thursday, President Trump’s administration announced a series of public service announcements that aim to warn young adults about the dangers of opioid abuse. In one ad, a young woman says she intentionally crashed her car to get more opioids; in another, a man recounts breaking his arm to get another prescription. The videos all include the line, “Opioid dependence can happen after just five days.” Historically, Republicans have taken a law enforcement-first approach to drug crises, while Democrats have focused on treatment and prevention. Some sharp partisan divisions still exist over the best approach to the opioid crisis, including on Mr. Trump’s call for the death penalty for drug dealers and a wall along the border with Mexico to keep drugs out of the country. And some Democrats have moved to spend more on treatment, including a bill in Congress that calls for spending $100 million on opioid resources each year. "
"OTTAWA — Doug Ford, a brash populist and a brother of former Mayor Rob Ford of Toronto, will become the next premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, after leading his party to a decisive victory in elections on Thursday. Just 21 minutes after most polls closed, both the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and CTV News declared that Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party would gain a majority of seats in Ontario’s next provincial legislature. Mr. Ford, who declared victory in a speech to supporters Thursday night, has led the party and been involved in provincial politics for only a few weeks. A populist who campaigned on pledges to reduce the size of government and cut taxes — and bring back $1-a-bottle beer — he represents a significant change for Ontario, which has been under the control of the Liberal Party for almost 15 years. “My friends, help is here,” Mr. Ford told the crowd in Toronto. “Tonight we have sent a clear message to the world: Ontario is open for business.” As his supporters shouted “jobs, jobs, jobs,” Mr. Ford added: “Together we made history, we have taken back Ontario. We have delivered a government that is for the people.” The Conservatives began the race looking like they would easily sweep into power. But during the campaign their support eroded significantly in favor of the New Democratic Party, which started in third place. "

I crossed the line, I regret it, and I do apologize for that.” But then Bee (who had issued a shortened apology a week earlier via Twitter) pushed back hard against conservative male pundits who had helped turn her comments into a flash point. “Many men were also offended by my use of the word. I do not care,” she said. “I should’ve known that a potty-mouthed insult would be inherently more interesting to them than a juvenile immigration policy.” (Bee devoted the next section of her show to the detention facilities where the Trump administration is now housing immigrant children separated from their parents by Border Patrol agents.)

"KABUL, Afghanistan — President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan declared a brief, unilateral cease-fire with the Taliban on Thursday, a strategic gamble seen as a trust-building measure to encourage the militant group to conduct peace talks even as the war grows deadlier. The cease-fire, which Mr. Ghani said would go into effect for eight days starting next week to coincide with one of the holiest periods on the Muslim calendar, comes months after his government presented an extensive peace offer to the Taliban. But just what the cease-fire could mean for the prospect of peace talks was unclear, with the resurgent Taliban dictating the reality on the battlefield and, as a result, any moves toward peace. “This cease-fire is an opportunity for the Taliban to reflect that their violent campaign is not winning them hearts and minds but further alienating the Afghan people from their cause,” Mr. Ghani said in his announcement. Officials said the cease-fire applied only to the Taliban and their brutal arm, the Haqqani network, which is behind some of the deadliest attacks. Operations against the Islamic State, remnants of Al Qaeda and other regional terrorist groups will continue. The United Nations and representatives of European countries in Afghanistan welcomed the news of the cease-fire. Still, many diplomats said privately that they were caught off guard by the announcement, and senior Afghan officials struggled to explain the sudden move. "
"According to Alan Krueger and Eric Posner, in their tough minded — and much-needed — “Proposal for Protecting Low-Income Workers From Monopsony and Collusion,” the ideal labor market is one in which “workers can move freely to seek the most desirable opportunities for which they are qualified.” If only. As Adam Cobb, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, put it in an email conversation: The trend in recent years has been an inexorable shift of bargaining power to employers at the expense of employees. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in the case of Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, which challenges the right of public employee unions in 22 states to collect dues from nonmembers who benefit from a union agreement that covers the cost of collective bargaining and contract compliance. If the court rules against organized labor as expected, it will inflict punishing financial hardship on the affected unions and will threaten the viability of many locals. Worker power has already suffered death by a thousand cuts, some political, others judicial and regulatory; some at the hands of a changing domestic workplace, others stemming from relentless global forces. Corporate America recognized these trends early on and capitalized on them ruthlessly. Labor organizations were ill equipped to do so and have been on the defensive for the past four decades. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Both Democrats and Republicans saw reason for hope after the primaries on Tuesday. Here’s our full report on the voting, as well as five takeaways. The Democrats, who had more on the line, increased their prospects of winning control of the House this fall by securing ballot spots in multiple California districts. The party had feared being shut out of some races because of the state’s quirky primary system. • For their part, the Republicans secured a spot in California’s governor’s race, which is seen as important to voter turnout in November. Read more about that race, which will offer a stark ideological choice between John Cox, a Republican businessman endorsed by President Trump, and Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor who has promised a “Marshall Plan” for the state. • There are signs of Republican resistance on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, Mr. Ryan, the House speaker, joined other lawmakers in dismissing President Trump’s claims that the Justice Department had placed a spy in his campaign. He also said that Mr. Trump should not to try to pardon himself. Mr. Trump is facing dissent from members of his own party over a range of issues, particularly trade. He has drastically departed from the traditional Republican embrace of free markets. • Also on Wednesday, Mr. Trump commuted the sentence of a 63-year-old woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug conviction after her case was brought to his attention by the celebrity Kim Kardashian West.

"Those of us who were afraid that the Supreme Court would use the Masterpiece Cakeshop case to issue a license to discriminate against gay people in the name of religion breathed a sigh of relief on Monday. The court’s insistence that the dignity and equality of gay individuals “must be given great weight and respect by the courts” made clear that no such general license will be forthcoming as long as the majority opinion’s author, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, remains on the bench. “As long as” is an important qualification, of course; the retirement intentions of Justice Kennedy, who turns 82 next month and is the court’s longest-serving current member, are the subject of increasingly frantic speculation. I’d like to offer an additional qualification, one that hasn’t received sufficient attention amid all the parsing of the court’s odd and unexpected 7-to-2 decision. My concern is with the implications of the court’s unfounded conclusion that Colorado officials expressed such deep “hostility” to religion as to have inflicted an injury of constitutional dimension on a baker who claimed that his religious view against same-sex marriage prevented him from making a celebratory cake for a gay couple. As many have noted, the path the court took toward ruling for the baker clearly reflected a compromise among justices with very different views. The court dealt with the profound issues of free expression and freedom of religion that the case seemed to present (whether it really presented them is a separate question) by avoiding them; as Prof. Michael Dorf of Cornell Law School wrote of the opinion, “At best, it is a masterpiece of ducking the hard questions.” So it was the search for an off-ramp that led the court to its obsessive focus on statements about religion made by two of the seven members of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission at two hearings in 2014 on the gay couple’s discrimination complaint against the baker. (Colorado law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by “public accommodations,” a category that includes most businesses.) At the first hearing, a commissioner observed that “if a businessman wants to do business in the state and he’s got an issue with the law’s impacting his personal belief system, he needs to look at being able to compromise.” At the second, a commissioner observed that religion “has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history” and proceeded to label religion “one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to — to use their religion to hurt others.” Following these hearings, the commission found that the baker’s refusal to serve his customers was an act of discrimination that violated state law. That decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals which, Justice Kennedy noted with disapproval, “did not mention those comments, much less express concern with their content.” Neither, he added, did the state itself disavow the comments in its presentation to the Supreme Court — a point Justice Kennedy had made when the case was argued six months ago. “For these reasons, the court cannot avoid the conclusion that these statements cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the commission’s adjudication,” Justice Kennedy wrote, adding that the commission “was neither tolerant nor respectful” of the baker’s religious beliefs. This “hostility” toward religion, the court held, violated the baker’s First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. "

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. American politics today is rife with cynicism. Many Americans don’t vote. Others do, while lamenting polarization in Congress and distrusting the two major political parties. I understand the cynicism. The situation in Washington is worse than any I expected to see in my lifetime, as I wrote earlier this week. But the truth is that our national cynicism is a big part of the problem — and that individual citizens, working together, have a significant amount of power to change things. It’s already happened several times in the last decade or so. A grass-roots movement propelled a first-term senator from Illinois, a man who was virtually unknown five years earlier, to the presidency. A very different movement, known as the Tea Party, then became an effective opposition to that president. Most recently, the so-called Trump resistance has helped save health insurance for millions of Americans — and has helped create a surge of voter turnout in recent elections. We’re living in a funny time: Americans are both disgusted by and obsessed with politics. If there is any silver lining to the Trump presidency, it’s the new spirit of political engagement that many Americans feel. In response to that new spirit, my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick and I have put together a guide to help people get more involved in politics. It offers advice on grass-roots organizing, donating money, voting and even running for office. (For now, the guide is available only to Times subscribers, though it will likely be opened to all readers later this year.) "
"SANTIAGO, Chile — Throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, people have lost confidence in elections and politicians. And just as voters are questioning the democratic process, the traditional watchdogs of electoral integrity — multilateral groups like the United Nations and the Organization of American States and others — are being undermined by governments throughout the hemisphere on both sides of the ideological spectrum. The twin pressures of declining trust in elections and support for those who guarantee voting integrity create a problem: Who is left to credibly judge what may be controversial elections in the coming months in two of the region’s biggest countries, Mexico and Brazil? Over the past 30 years, election observer groups have helped establish internationally respected standards for free and fair elections, protected voters’ rights in those elections and defused political upheaval when sore losers have tried to steal elections or contested results. This happened in the Dominican Republic in 1994, Peru in 2000, Mexico in 2006 and Ecuador in 2017. The power of neutral observers to defend free elections rests on a commitment from a government holding an election to the idea that these organizations have the right and authority to determine whether the voting was fair. That commitment is under assault. In November of last year, the Trump administration rushed to embrace the contested re-election of President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras, an American ally, even after observers from the European Union and the Organization of American States raised concerns about the integrity of the vote counting. And last month, when President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela invited the United Nations to observe presidential elections, it was widely viewed as a farce. The election was denounced by the European Union and 14 countries in the hemisphere as a sham, rigged to re-elect Mr. Maduro. Knowing that election monitors would not have independence, the United Nations stayed away. "

Rachel Levine, age 17 I don’t really know what a mortgage is, or how to do my taxes, but I do know what the derivative of y=2(3x2-4x)2 is. I don’t know a thing about stocks, or what my social security number means, but I do know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. I don’t know what a credit score is, or how to balance a checkbook, but I can do a geometric proof for you. In five months, I will be heading off to college and living without my parents’ care for the first time in seventeen years, and I have never felt so unprepared. Academically, I have no woes. It is the thought of living on my own, in the grown-up world, that troubles me. Society has become so focused on academics, test scores and GPA, that no school wants to spend time teaching kids about buying a house, or paying off loans. Because of this, I am going off to college with little to no knowledge about everyday skills. "
"When he landed in Michigan in late May, all the weary little boy carried was a trash bag stuffed with dirty clothes from his dayslong trek across Mexico, and two small pieces of paper — one a stick-figure drawing of his family from Honduras, the other a sketch of his father, who had been arrested and led away after they arrived at the United States border in El Paso. An American government escort handed over the 5-year-old child, identified on his travel documents as José, to the American woman whose family was entrusted with caring for him. He refused to take her hand. He did not cry. He was silent on the ride “home.” The first few nights, he cried himself to sleep. Then it turned into “just moaning and moaning,” said Janice, his foster mother. He recently slept through the night for the first time, though he still insists on tucking the family pictures under his pillow. José’s separation from his father is part of the Trump administration’s latest and most widely debated border enforcement policy. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the government would criminally prosecute everyone who crosses the border illegally, a directive that is already leading to the breakup of hundreds of migrant families and channeling children into shelters and foster homes across the country. The goal, according to administration officials, is to discourage Central American families from making the perilous journey to the United States’ southwest border, where they have been arriving in swelling numbers this year to claim asylum. In just the first two weeks under President Trump’s new policy, 638 parents who arrived with 658 children had been prosecuted, administration officials told Congress. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) As Gavin Newsom and John Cox gathered on election night with supporters of their campaigns for governor in San Francisco and San Diego, another man loomed over the celebrations: President Trump. The president endorsed Mr. Cox last month, and despite Mr. Trump’s lackluster popularity in California, the Cox campaign has overwhelmingly embraced the association. “We put a businessman in the White House, let’s put a businessman in the governor’s mansion,” Mr. Cox said triumphantly on Tuesday night, shortly after he secured enough votes in the primary to earn a place on the general election ballot in November. Mr. Trump’s endorsement tweet was even pasted to the bottom of news releases sent by the campaign. Mr. Cox has not only rejected the negative attacks on the White House by California Democrats, but has also sought to flip those critiques back onto liberals by emphasizing high taxes and high rates of poverty and homelessness in the state. “It wasn’t Donald Trump that made California the highest-taxed state in the country; it was Gavin Newsom and the Democrats,” he said. Mr. Newsom, for his part, has already shown his desire to frame the contest as a referendum on Mr. Trump’s agenda, and has painted Mr. Cox as a surrogate for the president. "
"For 10 years, Ralph Peters regularly appeared on Fox News to offer military analysis and insight as one of the cable network’s reliably conservative commenters. But he quit in March in disgust. Mr. Peters, who announced his departure in a blistering farewell note to his colleagues, followed up on Wednesday with another searing attack, saying that the network was “doing a great, grave disservice to our country.” The retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army spoke on CNN in his first television interview since his departure. “With the rise of Donald Trump, Fox did become a destructive propaganda machine,” Mr. Peters said. “And I don’t do propaganda for anyone.” For the decade he worked there, Mr. Peters said he believed that Fox News was a necessary and legitimate conservative bulwark in the news media and an outlet for libertarian opinions. But under President Trump, the network shifted rightward, he said. Its popular prime time hosts, particularly Sean Hannity, started to echo Mr. Trump’s debunked theories of a “deep state” undermining his administration. They joined the president in steadily attacking the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and other democratic institutions, Mr. Peters said. “I suspect Sean Hannity really believes it,” he said. “The others are smarter. They know what they’re doing. It’s bewildering to me. I mean, I wanted to just cry out and say: ‘How can you do this? How can you lie to our country?’” On Thursday morning, Alisyn Camerota, a former Fox News anchor who now works at CNN, said that Mr. Peters’s remarks mirrored her own experience at the network. “I too was upset about the blurring of the lines between propaganda and journalism,” Ms. Camerota said after a clip of his remarks was played. “I don’t know whether the viewers know the difference between the prime time hosts and the great reporters there.” Fox News said Thursday that it stood by its statement from when Mr. Peters departed in March. “Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he’s choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention,” the network said then. “We are extremely proud of our top-rated prime time hosts and all of our opinion programing.” Fox News and Mr. Trump enjoy a symbiotic relationship. He is a loyal viewer of its morning program “Fox & Friends,” often tweeting about what the hosts discuss and sometimes calling in for lengthy interviews. At night, a lineup of opinion shows offers a friendly space for Trump supporters. The friendliest might be “Hannity,” whose host is also an influential Trump confidant. Mr. Hannity, as well as reporters and anchors from the network’s news division, are traveling to Singapore for Mr. Trump’s June 12 summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “Hannity” will be broadcast live for three nights in Singapore, the network said.

"What books do journalists like to read? Books about journalists, of course! It doesn’t hurt when those books — and their subjects — are as interesting as the two we feature this week: “Reporter,” a memoir by the legendary investigative journalist Seymour M. Hersh, and “Flash,” Christopher Bonanos’s biography of the larger-than-life tabloid photographer Weegee. You’ll also find some good escapist reading here, including a perfect thriller (“Our Kind of Cruelty”), a topical and unsettling graphic novel (“Sabrina”) and the latest horror tale from a modern master (“The Outsider,” by Stephen King). It’s beginning to feel a lot like summer. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books REPORTER: A Memoir, by Seymour M. Hersh. (Knopf, $27.95.) Hersh won a Pulitzer in 1970, at 33, for his freelance expose on the massacre by American troops at My Lai village during the Vietnam War. He was soon hired by The New York Times, where he uncovered C.I.A. domestic spying and the secret bombing of Cambodia, among other things. Later in his career, he reported for The New Yorker on the torture of prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. “For Hersh’s subjects, becoming an object of his interest is like having the Red Baron on your tail,” our critic Dwight Garner writes in his review of this expansive memoir. “So many of journalism’s old war dogs have left or are leaving us, and there’s a sense that we won’t get many more memoirs like this one. If this book’s pilot light isn’t fully lit, it still puts a big career across.” FLASH: The Making of Weegee the Famous, by Christopher Bonanos. (Holt, $32.) The photographer Arthur Fellig, better known as Weegee, lugged his enormous Speed Graphic camera around the nighttime streets of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s, cultivating a persona as stark and as memorable as his tabloid pictures. He was the wisecracking tummler in the rumpled suit, always on the lookout for a car crash or a dead gangster. With “Flash,” Bonanos (the city editor of New York magazine and the author of an earlier book about Polaroid) has “finally supplied us with the biography Weegee deserves: sympathetic and comprehensive, a scrupulous account with just the right touch of irreverence,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. This is a portrait that “takes the photographer seriously without letting him and his self-mythologizing off the hook.” THE OUTSIDER, by Stephen King. (Scribner, $30.) When police officers arrest a small-town English teacher and Little League coach for murder, the case looks watertight. But this isn’t a police procedural, it’s a Stephen King novel; so nothing, of course, is what it seems. “Monsters of one kind or another are what the man does best, and ‘The Outsider’ delivers a good one,” Victor LaValle writes in his review. “King is an industry,” he adds, but “he isn’t writing mere imitations of himself. More than 50 novels published, and he’s still adding new influences to his work. I can think of a great many literary writers who are far lazier about their range of inspirations and interests.” OUR KIND OF CRUELTY, by Araminta Hall. (MCD/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) In this searing, chilling sliver of perfection about a toxic relationship, the man is the psychopath — or is it all a game, with the tacit support of his complicit ex-girlfriend? “We grow uneasy, wondering if in fact all we’re reading is a portrait of entwined madness and male entitlement,” Charles Finch writes in his review. “That doubt lingers all the way through the stunning final pages of ‘Our Kind of Cruelty,’ which may well turn out to be the year’s best thriller.” "
"One hundred years ago, Congress passed one of the earliest and most consequential conservation laws, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Its language was, and remains, clear and straightforward: Unless an individual has a valid hunting permit, “it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means, or in any manner” to “hunt, take, capture [or] kill” migratory birds. Until now, that is. Power lines, communication towers, wind turbines, oil spills and poison and pesticide applications kill tens of millions of birds a year, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Many are protected by the act, and their deaths, though unintentional, could be considered violations. Those responsible can be held strictly liable, meaning they are culpable, even if the deaths weren’t intended. This standard is meant to encourage companies to find ways to minimize threats to the 1,000-plus bird species protected by the law, and the relatively few enforcement actions have been limited to the most egregious violations. Now, however, as part of the Trump administration’s drive to remove “unnecessary” regulatory “burdens” on the energy industry, the Interior Department has advanced an alternative interpretation of the law that absolves companies from engaging in foreseeable and preventable activities that kill birds. The department’s political appointees argue that the law only triggers penalties when individuals or companies are trying to kill migratory birds. The implications of the Interior Department’s new position on bird killings are troubling, because building owners, oil and wind energy companies and others will no longer have any legal incentive to reduce or eliminate bird deaths caused by their operations. If this view holds, companies like Exxon or BP would no longer bear any responsibility for bird deaths from oil spills like the thousands that occurred in the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon disasters. Nor, as is now playing out in South Dakota, would a pest control operator need to pay any heed to the fact that poisoning prairie dogs will also kill burrowing owls — migratory birds that also inconveniently occupy prairie dog burrows. The Trump administration had to work hard to pull off such a radical reinterpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The legal opinion takes more than 40 pages to twist the law’s clear language outlawing bird killings resulting from “any means whatever” and occurring “at any time or in any manner” into a contrived new standard that only penalizes bird killings when “the actor [is] engaged in an activity the object of which was to render an animal subject to human control.” "
"LOS ANGELES — James Van Der Beek may be best known for playing the title character in “Dawson’s Creek,” a 1990s teen drama fueled by adolescent angst and Sperry boat shoes, and maybe an ugly crying face GIF that spawned a thousand memes.   But on a recent Monday, all he wanted to do was fight. “Let’s get into it!” said Mr. Van Der Beek, 41, who was at 87Eleven, a stunt and choreography studio near the Los Angeles International Airport.    Wearing a black Under Armour hoodie with matching shorts and compression tights, he was trying to master a fight sequence for an action TV show he is developing. The scene had him fending off multiple assailants, so it involved complex choreography. It’s not the only new project on Mr. Van Der Beek’s IMDB page. He had just returned from New York, where he spent the better part of the spring shooting “Pose,” Ryan Murphy’s new show about the 1980s vogueing scene.   Mr. Van Der Beek plays a character named Matt Bromley, the swaggering right-hand man of Donald J. Trump, who personifies the era’s embrace of wealth and greed. "
"LA MALBAIE, Quebec — Ever since Rosaire Tremblay bought a candy-cane-colored house overlooking the St. Lawrence River two years ago, tourists have trampled on his land to photograph the spectacular view, gawk at the beluga whales or reach the imposing Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu hotel, perched on a nearby cliff. Then came the fence. Canada is hosting world leaders, including President Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France, starting Friday at a two-day Group of 7 summit meeting in this picture-perfect resort town. The leaders are to discuss, among other things, job creation, gender equality and climate change. Mr. Tremblay’s house is the only home in town in a high-security “red zone” near Le Manoir Richelieu, where the world leaders will stay. Suddenly, his modest red and white home is protected by a nearly two-mile-long steel security fence affixed with lights and cameras, making it among the most secure and impenetrable fortresses in the country. Now, Mr. Tremblay, 63, a jovial retired factory owner and avid consumer of political news, has to pass through security checks to get to his own house. And the fancy hotel is off limits, so the best he can hope for is to spot his favorite leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as she flies overhead by helicopter. But Mr. Tremblay is good-humored about the hassle. Like many residents here, he hopes the summit meeting’s global exposure will restore some glamour to this sleepy village of 9,000 in the Charlevoix region, which once attracted Hollywood stars but has since seen tough times. “I am hoping the leaders will at least help put Charlevoix on the map,” he said. A senior official involved in the selection process said the choice of where to hold the meeting came down to, among other places, Charlevoix and Kelowna, British Columbia, but that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada had chosen Charlevoix because of its secure location and natural beauty.

"Seven nations are getting together to discuss gender equality with a leader who once bragged about grabbing women’s genitals, pluralism and tolerance with politicians who have promised to turn away refugees, and economic cooperation with a country severing ties with its neighbors. What could go wrong? Welcome to the Group of 7 Summit in Charlevoix, Quebec, a gathering of the leaders of seven countries that once dominated the world economy, but now struggle with the forces of globalization they helped to unleash. Expectations are low that the summit meeting on Friday and Saturday will produce much more than photo ops of Quebec scenery. It is likely to highlight a decline in the effectiveness of organizations designed to resolve international conflicts, like the World Trade Organization or the United Nations. “Multilateralism is in crisis,” said Dennis Snower, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Kiel, Germany. “We have a number of international organizations that are either stalemated or their representation is not fit for the present day.” The members of the Group of 7 — the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — once stood together against communism. But now they are often in conflict with each other and struggling to prove their relevance amid China’s growing power. The agenda put together by Canada, this year’s host, would not have provoked much controversy a few years ago. Women’s empowerment. Climate change. Adapting to the changing nature of work. "
"Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan who was fired by President Trump, has registered as a Democratic voter in New York for the first time in more than a decade amid speculation that he might run for attorney general. Mr. Bharara’s registration in Westchester County occurred during the window for candidates to gather signatures to qualify for the Democratic primary in September. A candidate needs thousands of signatures across half the congressional districts by mid-July — meaning time is short for Mr. Bharara to jump in. Mr. Bharara did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Democratic primary for attorney general is already crowded. It includes Letitia James, the New York City public advocate, who was nominated at the state party convention; Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of the Hudson Valley; Zephyr Teachout, a law professor and former candidate for governor; and Leecia Eve, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. They are running to replace Eric Schneiderman, who resigned suddenly last month after multiple women accused him of physical abuse. Barbara D. Underwood, who was chosen last month to replace Mr. Schneiderman, has said she would not seek election in November. Mr. Bharara, who has become an outspoken commentator since Mr. Trump fired him last year, has built a liberal following. He addressed the idea of running for attorney general last month on his podcast. “I think politics is not really for me, but it’s an important job, it’s an important time so we’ll see,” said Mr. Bharara, who is also a former aide to the Senate minority leader, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. Before he registered as a Democrat, the Reform Party in New York had hoped to recruit Mr. Bharara onto its ticket, endorsing him prospectively at a party gathering last month. But party officials could not reach Mr. Bharara to accept their spot on the ballot. “No luck reaching him,” Curtis Sliwa, the Reform Party chairman, said in an email. Mr. Bharara was not a registered voter during his roughly eight years as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, a period in which he aggressively prosecuted political corruption, indicting the top two lawmakers in Albany, one Democrat and one Republican, and a top aide to Mr. Cuomo. If remaining unregistered kept him at arm’s length from electoral politics, it also means he did not cast a ballot in the 2016 presidential campaign, an issue opponents could raise in a Democratic primary. Records show Mr. Bharara was previously registered as a Democrat in Maryland and in New York. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump handed the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE a lifeline on Thursday, agreeing to lift tough American sanctions over the objections of Republican lawmakers, his defense advisers and some of his own economic officials. The deal will help defuse tensions with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who personally asked Mr. Trump to intervene to save ZTE and whom the president has relied on to help pave the way for next week’s summit meeting with the North Korean leader. The Commerce Department said that ZTE had agreed to pay a $1 billion fine, replace its board and senior leadership, and allow the United States to more closely inspect the company by effectively having a handpicked compliance team embedded inside the firm. The United States would then lift a seven-year ban that prevented the company from buying American products and was quickly driving it out of business. [Read more about ZTE.] But the settlement has inflamed lawmakers, including top Republicans, who objected to helping a Chinese company that broke American law and has been accused of posing a national security threat. It also puts the United States in an awkward position as it punishes allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union with stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum, and insists that countries in Europe and elsewhere abide by American sanctions on Iran. In 2016, the United States found the Chinese company guilty of violating American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. In April, the government said ZTE had failed to take the necessary actions to rectify the issue, and had lied about its efforts, prompting the Commerce Department to implement the ban. Defense officials have also repeatedly expressed concern about the risk that ZTE’s equipment could pose to national security. Lawmakers moved swiftly to try to scuttle the agreement on Thursday as a bipartisan group of senators introduced an amendment that would automatically reinstate ZTE’s ban on purchasing American products until the president certified to Congress that the company had met certain conditions.
