"WASHINGTON — President Trump urged senators this month to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most Americans have health insurance and use the proceeds to slash the top tax rate paid by the richest Americans, a suggestion that pitted his priorities against his daughter and Republican senators intent on helping the middle class. In the end, the president accepted only a partial victory. He got the repeal of the health law’s individual mandate, but gave up on an income tax rate cut that would have directly benefited him personally. Instead, Ivanka Trump and her allies in the Senate prevailed in their push to include an expanded child tax credit. “This was certainly an uphill battle, especially given that it is not an issue that is as widely understood,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a leading advocate of the expanded child tax credit. “We didn’t necessarily have the sense that the president was opposed to it. I still don’t have that sense. I think if he had been, things would have worked out differently than they did.” Two White House officials pushed back against the notion that Ms. Trump had split with her father. They said middle-income tax relief was one of the president’s priorities and that Ms. Trump worked in lock step with the administration on all aspects of tax reform. But the fight is actually continuing. Later this week, Mr. Lee and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, will take on another top priority of the president’s, cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The senators plan to offer an amendment that would cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, instead of 20 percent, and use the proceeds to help families with little or no income tax liabilities benefit from the expanded child credit and to allow the child credit to rise with inflation. A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, wasted no time declaring the president’s opposition on Wednesday. "
"Rem Koolhaas, the architect whose ties to urbanism run so deep that his firm is even called the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, has shifted his focus to the countryside. His recent research obsession will be the subject of “Countryside: Future of the World,” an exhibition planned for the Guggenheim Museum’s spiral rotunda in fall 2019, the museum announced on Wednesday. The exhibition — organized by Troy Conrad Therrien in his most ambitious project since he was hired as the Guggenheim’s first curator for architecture and digital initiatives three years ago — will explore how the world’s rural landscapes have been altered by technology, migration and climate change. In an interview, Mr. Koolhaas said that there are obviously architectural and cultural reasons to consider the countryside (which he defined as “anything that is not the city”), but in the wake of Brexit and President Trump’s election, “there’s also a political reason to look at it.” “We know now the political consequences of ignoring the countryside,” he added. Mr. Therrien said the many headlines in the past year about the role small-town America played in the election have made interest in the countryside “roar back to life,” which, he added “raises the stakes for the exhibition and puts pressure on us to remain nimble” while the show is in development. The idea first struck Mr. Koolhaas several years ago when he noticed that a Swiss village he visits annually had lost much of its original population while drastically expanding to accommodate tourists who built houses they rarely inhabited. And, he said, a local farmer he thought had come from a rich tradition was in fact a dissatisfied nuclear scientist from Frankfurt. Mr. Koolhaas — along with AMO, the research arm of OMA, and his students at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design — began to look into roughly 15 to 20 areas around the world that, he said, “together describe comprehensively what is going on” with changes to rural environments on every continent. In Russia, for example, agriculture has migrated northward as permafrost melts, Mr. Koolhaas said, while farming communities have become increasingly isolated by hundreds of airport closures around the country. And in the United States, the California-Nevada border near Reno has been turned into “Silicon Valley’s back of house.” “You could say it’s not a city, yet,” Mr. Koolhaas said, although “the scale of development is definitely kind of urban. But it is a new kind of urban, because it will be inhabited by machines and by robots, and few people.” Mr. Koolhaas observed that more than half of the typical magazine covers on newsstands in cities showed images related to the countryside. “It’s there and part of our subconscious,” he said, adding that rural images also work their way into a faux-rustic aesthetic of urban coffee houses, hotels and shops. “It’s a very ironic situation,” Mr. Koolhaas said, “that we are at the same time ignoring yet profoundly influenced and infiltrated by the semiotics of the countryside.” "
"For some pop stars, a holiday album is an opportunity to perfect the classics. But for others, it’s a chance to dismantle them or make new ones. This year, those left-field Christmas sounds include Gypsy jazz, Atlanta rap, club-pop and Renaissance Faire. Here, the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times select notable releases, familiar and odd. It’s surprising how well antiseptic zeal and pep age. The boy band 98° hasn’t put out an album of note in 17 years, and yet this holiday release — its second, after “This Christmas,” from 1999 — is appealing and welcome. The foursome sometimes stumbles on the more religiously oriented material (“Mary, Did You Know?”). But little gestures — a heaving take on Joni Mitchell’s “River,” the harmless beatbox backdrop on “Let It Snow” or the silky R&B harmonies on “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” — land like sprinkling snow. JON CARAMANICA Nearly half a century ago, Herb Alpert and his easy-listening squad, the Tijuana Brass, scored a success with “The Christmas Album.” His first holiday record since that 1968 release includes one original (“The Christmas Wish”) and a reprise from the earlier album (his trumpet version of “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring”), along with gauzy, Mantovani-string-soaked takes on typical Christmas fare. Still, Mr. Alpert knows a vast amount of music, and he feeds energy into these songs: the Afro-Caribbean funk feel on “Santa Baby,” or the surging swing of “Winter Wonderland.” Then there’s his trumpet playing, which he still does spryly at the age of 82, with its dusty allure intact.

"ST. CHARLES, Mo. — President Trump rallied support on Wednesday for his tax plan in a Missouri county where the unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, a fitting backdrop for a speech in which he bragged about the health of the economy while contending that a major tax cut was crucial to economic growth. Republicans have juggled those twin claims in pitching their tax bill, which was introduced at the beginning of November and remains on course to reach Mr. Trump’s desk next month. They insist that the plan will deliver an immediate stimulus and encourage long-term investment. “These massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel” for the American economy, particularly for small businesses on Main Street, Mr. Trump said in a speech here. But some economists question whether rocket fuel is needed at this point in the economic recovery and say that too much stimulus could ultimately backfire. The economy is strengthening and unemployment is at its lowest point in 16 years. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, above the maximum sustainable level of output estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Mr. Trump played up that report in a long riff, saying that the growth rate would have been “4 percent, maybe over 4 percent” if not for late summer hurricanes. “We are hitting numbers that nobody thought possible, certainly not in this time” in office, he said, adding, “This is all done without the tax cuts.” "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • North Korea’s latest launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile reached a new height, demonstrating that the full continental U.S. lies in reach — though not necessarily that the North could deliver a nuclear warhead. The North’s statement after Wednesday’s launch — that it had “finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force” — raised the possibility that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, might feel empowered enough to enter talks for concessions. Part of our Op-Ed team that visited North Korea recently put together this video, offering a rare glimpse inside the secretive nation. And our Interpreter column presents seven critical truths about North Korea. _____ • “It is wrong for the president to have done this.” That was the office of Theresa May, the British prime minister, after President Trump retweeted video posts from an ultranationalist British party leader supposedly portraying Muslims committing acts of violence. "
"Two of the Republican senators who have stepped forward to block the party’s dash toward a tax overhaul say they are withholding their support to stick up for Main Street. Big corporations, they argue, are being given preferential treatment compared with smaller businesses that are organized differently and known as pass-throughs. The David-and-Goliath story that the senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, are spinning would be compelling — except that it is wrong. Pass-throughs have a lower total tax burden than corporations do. That advantage exists now and remains in both the House and Senate versions of the tax bill. If corporations are “the haves,” then pass-throughs are the “have-mores.” “I honestly don’t know what he’s talking about,” Alan J. Auerbach, a tax expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said of Mr. Johnson’s complaints. “Tax rates are going down a lot. It’s businesses versus everybody else.” Businesses are taxed in different ways. Corporations and their investors are subject to two layers of taxation. First, a corporate rate on profits is paid directly by the company. Under current law, the top rate is 35 percent. Then, when the business pays returns to its investors, they pay tax on the money they’ve earned when they file in April. That income — dividends and capital gains — is taxed at a top rate of 23.8 percent. (Generally, if your income is less than $200,000, the rate is 20 percent.) "
"Susan Collins and some other senators who had hinted they might oppose the Republican tax bill giveaway to the super rich are changing their tune. Apparently, President Trump assured them over lunch that he’s going to fix the bill. Are they actually that clueless? Or do they merely think the rest of us are? One of the few certainties in these uncertain times is that no one can rely on anything Trump says. But these senators believe him now? The only other option is that they know Trump’s pledges to “fix” the tax bill are insincere and they are conning their constituents and the rest of America. Neither possibility is appetizing, but that’s where we are after Trump met with Republican senators to talk about the tax bill. Participants told reporters that Trump was paying attention and seemed to understand the details. Think about that. It’s news when this president seems to grasp an even slightly complicated idea. After the meeting, Trump announced that the bill will “have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive — the largest in the history of our country — tax cut.” Another false assurance. It was never going be the biggest tax cut in history, and the only “very, very massive” reductions are going to corporations and extremely wealthy individuals, like Trump. "
"Oy vey, it’s awards season again. Could there be a worse time for Hollywood to celebrate itself? It was around this time last year — i.e., a more innocent time — that the fair people of Tinseltown began using acceptance speeches to shake their manicured fists at Donald J. Trump. There was Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes, tearing into Trumpian cruelty, and, amid furor over the Muslim travel ban, David Harbour of “Stranger Things” vowing at the Screen Actors Guild Awards to “repel bullies” and “hunt monsters.” Sitting in the cheering audiences on both occasions was Harvey Weinstein, months away from being accused of being a rapacious predator. As Hollywood has bitterly learned, it is a whole lot easier to preach when the monster is not one of your own. Even if more players from the entertainment world hadn’t been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment, the gravity of the accusations leveled at Mr. Weinstein — who has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex — would still have injected a stink into the awards season this year. Mr. Weinstein may have been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but he has left lasting marks on the Oscars race. He elevated and made a blood sport out of campaigning. Guild and ancillary awards matter more now in part because of him: He fought bareknuckled for every prize. Though his power had sharply waned from his heyday, which lasted from the ’90s through the aughts, Mr. Weinstein’s outsized presence and shameless politicking were awards-season staples. His reputation for being a bully endured, but he was also beheld as a grandstanding lion in winter, one who prompted eye rolls and the perennial question, “What will Harvey pull this year?” Despite being financially weakened, Mr. Weinstein delivered, audaciously. He arranged for Philomena Lee, who was forced by Irish nuns to give up her son for adoption, to meet the pope in the final weeks of the awards campaign for the 2013 film about her. "
"It is a continuing astonishment to many a sensible adult that anyone who survived adolescence takes Ayn Rand seriously. Yet admirers of this creator of fat, hyperventilating novels, which extolled “the virtue of selfishness” and the capitalist superhero, have filled conservative power lists for decades. Those said to take counsel these days from her feverish portraits of egomaniacs at the top include Paul Ryan; Ron and Rand Paul; and the current president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. You may be surprised to learn that this roster has come to include the daring Tony-winning director Ivo van Hove, a creator of productions that might well provoke cries of puritanical censure from the Senate floor. Yet on the evidence of his adaptation of Rand’s breakthrough novel, “The Fountainhead” (1943), which opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Tuesday night, she has seldom had a better advocate. Not, I hasten to add, for her ferocious vision of free-market fundamentalism, which has so enchanted right-leaning politicians and economists. No, what this production from Mr. van Hove’s Toneelgroep Amsterdam captures with such alarming verve is the sheer pulp appeal of what is essentially one really sick soap opera. Designed by Jan Versweyveld, Mr. van Hove’s longtime partner in carefully calibrated excess, this four-hour glorification of an American architectural genius at odds with a culture of mediocrity has been given a sweep, heft and hysteria usually associated with productions of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle. Granted, Rand’s prose, both purple and leaden, doesn’t have the resistance-proof momentum of Wagner’s music. This is especially true when you’re hearing her (many, many) words spoken in Dutch, as adapted by Koen Tachelet, and then translated into projected English supertitles. "
"In late August, a crowd of thousands — primarily leftists and liberals — cascaded down Martin Luther King Jr. Way in Berkeley, Calif. They were marching on a spattering of right-wingers, Trump supporters and Nazis who were gathering under the mission to say “no to Marxism in America.” At the front of the march were about 100 people dressed in head-to-toe black. According to many people present, this was the largest so-called black bloc they’d seen. This medley of black-clad anarchists, anti-fascists (known as “antifa” activists) and their fellow travelers was a response to the previous week’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. There, protests ended with 19 injured and 32-year-old Heather Heyer killed when James Fields, an admirer of Hitler who demonstrated with white supremacists, drove his car into a crowd. This mass of solid black descending upon the park in Berkeley, hunting for fascists, was an intimidating aesthetic. That’s by design. “Cops wear camouflage when they arrest people in city drug raids,” said Ben, a Bay Area activist. “But they’re in a city. It doesn’t help them, but it makes them look more intimidating.” Ben says he has participated in protests since 2000, including Bush/Gore, Occupy Oakland and Black Lives Matter. (The Times agreed to use only his first name because of the threat of harassment, online or otherwise, by activists.) “A group of people all dressed in black can be intimidating,” he said. Is that intimidation the motive or just a benefit? Do black bloc practitioners dress up because, as many progressives wonder, they want to commit crimes? What do they get out of “masking up”? Where does uniform merge with tactic? "
"People who can’t stand U2’s earnest, heal-the-world side may want to turn elsewhere right now. The word “love,” unironic and high-minded, recurs all over “Songs of Experience,” the band’s long-gestating sequel to its 2014 album, “Songs of Innocence.” Where “Songs of Innocence” was full of youthful biographical specifics, both euphoric and grim, from the group’s lead singer and main lyricist, Bono, “Songs of Experience” has an adult’s broader, more general perspective. It favors lessons and archetypes, not stories. Like “Songs of Innocence,” the new album employed multiple producers, and U2 has clearly pondered every nanosecond of sound, whether polishing its reverberations or administering calibrated amounts of distortion. It’s not an album that courts new fans by radically changing U2’s style; instead, it reaffirms the sound that has been filling arenas and stadiums for decades. The album is also a return to the standard commercial market. Apple made “Songs of Innocence” a giveaway that suddenly appeared in the iTunes libraries of both fans and non-fans worldwide. Many greeted it as a corporate intrusion rather than a gift, generating a backlash that threatened to eclipse the album’s worthy songs. “Songs of Experience,” U2’s 14th studio album, is having a more conventional release. Bono has described “Songs of Experience” as a collection of letters to family, fans and America: messages and advisories from a globally minded public figure. And for most of the album, U2 sets out to counter the anger, despair and cynicism of 2017 with insistent optimism. That’s a temptation to preach, and some songs are unabashed homilies. Bookending the album (before a bonus track) are songs titled “Love Is All We Have Left” and “Love Is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way.” The opener is a celestial benediction over tremulous strings, declaring, “Nothing to stop this being the best day ever,” while the finale is a grand crescendo of a march, an arena anthem declaring, “When you think you’re done, you’ve just begun.” "
"Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. SAN FRANCISCO — How can policymakers, entrepreneurs and technologists fight climate change in the face of political headwinds? Gov. Jerry Brown of California is likely to address that question on Wednesday when he headlines ClimateTECH, a new conference from The New York Times, in a conversation with the Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman. On Thursday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, the billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, and the executive director of Project Drawdown, Paul Hawken, will continue the conversation, leading a lineup of policymakers and technology leaders to discuss solutions to global warming. When and where: Governor Brown will speak at 7:40 p.m. Pacific time (10:40 p.m. Eastern time) at the City View at Metreon in San Francisco. How to watch: The conversation will be streamed live on The Times’s home page, YouTube page and Facebook page. The following day’s panels will be posted online here. What to know: The Trump administration just attended two weeks of intense negotiations in Bonn, Germany, on the Paris agreement — the global accord on climate change that President Trump has vowed to abandon. Governor Brown was there too, along with a coalition of other governors, mayors and business leaders with an unequivocal message: that they are still in the Paris agreement even if the federal government backs out. Now comes the tough part: figuring out what that means in practical terms. Many states and cities have pledged to reduce emissions in an effort to meet the Paris agreement goals. The America’s Pledge movement is notable. It’s also incomplete. What will it take to get the biggest fossil-fuel dependent states on board? Beyond that, the world also needs an “energy miracle,” as the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has asserted. That’s where some of the world’s top innovators and entrepreneurs come in. Astro Teller, the “Captain of Moonshots” at X, the research and development arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, will talk with Mr. Friedman about the challenges and opportunities of seeking big technology solutions to big problems. Katie Benner, a Times technology reporter, will talk to Geisha J. Williams, the president and chief executive of PG&E Corp., about the utility’s ambitious goal of generating half its power from renewable energy by 2030. I’ll be sitting down with Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress, and Simon Irish, chief executive of Terrestrial Energy, to talk about the role of nuclear energy. And Keith Bradsher, The Times’s Shanghai bureau chief, will take the conversation global in a talk with Li Junfeng, a central architect of China’s renewable energy policy. Governor Brown is likely to remind the crowd that addressing climate change won’t be easy. “Decarbonizing the economy is like climbing Mount Everest,” he told me in Bonn. “It’s like going from pagan Rome to Christian Europe, and we don’t have 700 years to do it. It’s a transformation.” "
"WASHINGTON — After firing an intercontinental ballistic missile higher than ever before, North Korea this week said it had mastered nuclear-strike capability and become a full-fledged nuclear state. That claim was immediately met with skepticism, not least in the White House. But by showing that its missiles can reach Washington — even if there is doubt that North Korea can deliver a nuclear warhead there — Pyongyang took yet another step toward that goal. Its latest test raised a question the United States and its allies seem likely to have to answer sooner or later: Is it time to accept that North Korea will never give up its nuclear arms, and try to reach a deal to stop its arsenal from growing further? China and Russia have been pushing for an agreement that would freeze Pyongyang’s nuclear program, in exchange for a suspension of joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. The United States rejects the idea; officials said the administration would stick to its strategy of marshaling international pressure on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to give up his nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, President Trump vowed to impose “additional major sanctions” on the North, though he got ahead of his bureaucracy by saying on Twitter that they would be announced that day. White House officials said the Treasury Department was still drafting the measures. Mr. Trump, who had reacted cautiously to news of the launch, also returned to name-calling, labeling Mr. Kim “Little Rocket Man” and a “sick puppy” in an unscripted aside during a speech on Wednesday about tax cuts in St. Charles, Mo. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council convened Wednesday evening, the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, called on China to stop providing North Korea with crude oil, threatening unilateral action if Beijing continued to resist that drastic step. "
"It’s weird to think that one year ago today Barack Obama was still the president. Michelle Obama was decorating the White House with happy snowmen and gingerbread dogs instead of transforming the East Colonnade into a hell-bound gullet of witch fingers, apparently our new tradition, and the president of the United States somehow made it through the entire week without insulting a single 90-year-old Native American war hero. Many of us were angry and terrified but still energized about things like vote audits and faithless electors. We hoped the system might have a fail-safe to protect us from our worst selves — a flash-frozen grown-up to defrost in case of emergencies. Now, a year wiser and few thousand older, in too many ways we are still waiting. It hasn’t clicked with the necessary urgency that we are the grown-ups. We are still frozen. Every year, Dictionary.com chooses one word, “a symbol of the year’s most meaningful events and lookup trends,” to be the Word of the Year. The past few picks seem to follow a chilling but logical evolution. In 2015 the Word of the Year was broad and neutral — “identity” — issues of racial and gender injustice having finally come closer to becoming national priorities and weathered a ghastly but predictable (and still developing) backlash. Two thousand fifteen was a difficult year, but it was a year of progress. By the end of 2016, as Trumpism seized the wheel, our national conversation on identity sharpened to a sinister specificity: that year’s word was “xenophobia.” Two thousand sixteen was a year of us versus them, of villains making their plans clear, of straight, white, Christian identity politics moving to supplant everyone else. This year, the Word of the Year zooms out, implicating millions of us. The word is “complicit.” Two thousand seventeen is a year of reckoning. Searches for the definition of “complicit” spiked in May, Dictionary.com tells us, when Ivanka Trump was asked to respond to accusations of complicity on “CBS This Morning.” This is one of my favorite Trump-family anecdotes, if one can be said to have a “favorite” venomous snake biting your child on the face: “If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact,” Ivanka said, “then I’m complicit.” "
"To the Editor: In “Net Neutrality Facing Full Repeal in F.C.C. Plan” (news article, Nov. 21), we learn that in a speech in April the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Ajit Pai, speaking of the creation of net neutrality, claimed that “we decided to abandon successful policies solely because of hypothetical harms.” Net neutrality gives a level playing field for content providers and allows consumers to select any content from the web. Contrary to Mr. Pai’s claim, the harms are not hypothetical. In early 2014, before the current net neutrality rules were adopted, Comcast slowed data from Netflix to a crawl. Netflix paid Comcast and the problem was resolved. But suppose Netflix were unwilling or unable to pay Comcast. Theoretically the consumer who wanted Netflix could select a different internet service provider, but in reality there is often no or very little choice of I.S.P.s. Under the current rules, Comcast could not slow data based on the content provider. Without net neutrality, I.S.P.s become gatekeepers of which content gets to their customers. This could leave many small businesses without the ability to reach their customers and many customers without choices. Furthermore, I.S.P. owners could decide to block content from a political party that did not align with their political views. Gatekeepers have a great deal of power, and without regulation can abuse that power. Mr. Pai’s refusal to acknowledge this is very dangerous for both the economy and our democracy. ETHAN ANNIS, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: Re “F.C.C. Releases Plan to Repeal Net Neutrality” (front page, Nov. 22): On the expected demise of net neutrality, as with the removal of so many rights and privileges, the authorities responsible for these losses present them as giving more people more choices: Ajit Pai is removing net neutrality “so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them.” Similarly, repealing the Affordable Care Act will provide consumers with more choices; expanding charter schools will give parents more choices about where to educate their children.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A Navy veteran, expectant father and nuclear engineering graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley would see his taxes increase by $4,247. Another graduate student at Berkeley, a mother of two who is studying jurisprudence and social policy, would see her federal taxes increase by $1,647. These are the some of the numbers that Kathy Shield, a graduate student at Berkeley, has crunched to highlight the repeal of an obscure deduction in the tax bill passed earlier this month by the House of Representatives. Many universities waive tuition for graduate students in exchange for research or teaching duties. The House bill contains a provision that, if included in a final tax bill, would remove a deduction on the waived tuition. Ms. Shield, who studies nuclear engineering, and Vetri Velan, who studies particle physics, have teamed up to draw attention to the tax bill provision. They have produced a rudimentary online calculator that students can use to calculate how their taxes will change. Mr. Velan wrote a widely circulated memo, explaining the tax provision. "
"WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Wednesday that the country’s economic expansion had broadened and strengthened, and that she expected the growth to continue. Ms. Yellen’s upbeat assessment, delivered to the Joint Economic Committee, is likely to reinforce expectations the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-December. It could also sharpen questions about Republican plans for a major tax cut aimed at stimulating faster growth. “Economic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in the year,” she told the Congressional committee. “Moreover, the economic expansion is increasingly broad, based across sectors as well as across much of the global economy.” The hearing may have been Ms. Yellen’s last appearance before Congress in her current role. Her four-year term as the Fed chairwoman ends in early February, and she has said that she plans to leave as soon as her successor is sworn in. President Trump has nominated Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, to serve as the its next chairman. Ms. Yellen was careful to say that the economy could be doing better. She noted that the pace of economic growth remained slow by historical standards. The two major determinants of growth, the number of workers and the productivity of the average worker, are rising slowly. “ Congress might consider policies that encourage business investment and capital formation, improve the nation’s infrastructure, raise the quality of our educational system, and support innovation and the adoption of new technologies,” she said.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The Republican senators who aren’t yet committed to voting for the tax bill have a huge amount of leverage. They are not using it. Instead, they mostly seem to be folding — accepting vague promises from President Trump (who doesn’t exactly have a good record of keeping his word) and Mitch McConnell. That was Tuesday’s theme on Capitol Hill. Susan Collins, who has said she is worried about the damage the bill will do to health care, no longer seems to be insisting on any legislation to reduce the damage. Bob Corker, who has said he is worried about the deficit, is backing away from his promise to vote against any bill that adds “one penny” to the deficit. Jeff Flake, James Lankford and Jerry Moran, three other senators who have been talking about the deficit, have also shown little sign of backing up their words. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump touched off another racially charged furor on Wednesday by sharing videos from a fringe British ultranationalist group purportedly showing Muslims committing acts of violence, a move that was swiftly condemned by Britain’s prime minister as well as politicians across the spectrum. The videos Mr. Trump retweeted were titled: “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” “Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!” and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death!” But the assailant in one of them was not a “Muslim migrant” and the other two showed four-year-old events with no explanation. No modern American president has promoted inflammatory content of this sort from an extremist organization. Mr. Trump’s two most recent predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both made a point of avoiding public messages that were likely to be seen as anti-Muslim and could exacerbate racial and religious animosities, arguing that the war against terrorism was not a war against Islam. But Mr. Trump has shown little such restraint, targeting Muslims with a broad brush, including when he claimed on the campaign trail last year that “Islam hates us” and when he called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims coming to the United States. Since taking office, he has sought to block visitors from select Muslim-majority nations and engaged in a long-distance feud with the Muslim mayor of London, whom he branded weak on terrorism. The messages came at a time when Mr. Trump has been lashing out at an array of perceived adversaries, including the National Football League, CNN, NBC and Democratic leaders. He referred to a senator as “Pocahontas” this week in front of Navajo veterans he was honoring. In a meandering speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Wednesday, Mr. Trump labeled North Korea’s leader a “sick puppy,” asserted that welfare recipients lived better than some people with jobs, noted that his wealthy friends “love their children” and insisted that he did not like some bankers even though he was making their job “easy for them.” Mr. Trump’s unbridled talk of Muslim violence thrilled some conservative supporters who see him as a truthteller breaking from the shackles of political correctness, but it alarmed mainstream political leaders in the United States and Britain, who deemed it reckless and counterproductive.

"The fast-moving national reckoning over sexual harassment in the workplace toppled another television news star on Wednesday when NBC fired Matt Lauer, the co-host of its most profitable franchise, “Today,” after an allegation of inappropriate sexual behavior with a subordinate. The downfall of Mr. Lauer, a presence in American living rooms for more than 20 years, adds to a head-spinning string of prominent firings over sexual harassment and abuse allegations. NBC News said it had decided to dismiss its star morning anchor after a woman met with network executives on Monday to describe her interactions with him. “While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he’s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,” Andrew Lack, the NBC News chairman, wrote in a memo to staff. On Wednesday, NBC received at least two more complaints related to Mr. Lauer, according to a person briefed on the network’s handling of the matter. One complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her. She provided her account to The New York Times but declined to let her name be used. She told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse. She said that she felt helpless because she didn’t want to lose her job, and that she didn’t report the encounter at the time because she felt ashamed. On Thursday, Mr. Lauer issued an apology, expressing “sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused.” News of Mr. Lauer’s sudden downfall shook the television world, where he had established himself as one of the most powerful men in his industry. Even President Trump — who himself has denied multiple allegations of sexual misconduct — weighed in, seizing on Mr. Lauer’s firing to denounce NBC News’s coverage and call for other senior figures at NBC News to be ousted.

"• Late Wednesday afternoon, the Senate voted along party lines, 52-48, to begin debate on the tax plan. • The spotlight now turns to the floor debate, which is limited to 20 hours. • President Trump gave a speech in Missouri touting his tax plan. • Some Republicans now say a “trigger” mechanism under discussion should require automatic spending cuts, not tax increases. • Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah want to expand the child tax credit and proposed a corporate tax rate of 22 percent, not 20 percent as in Senate bill. • Republicans are now discussing allowing pass-through owners to deduct 20 percent of business income, up from 17.4 percent.

"Over the past few decades, some of the largest companies in the United States made a big bet: By stashing hundreds of billions of dollars of profits offshore, they could slash their taxes and bolster their profits. It would take a generation to see if the strategy would fully pay off, because the law allowed companies only to defer the taxes on overseas earnings, not to permanently avoid them. Would they ever be able to bring the profits back to the United States without incurring huge tax bills? Some 20 years after the tax-avoiding technique became widespread, it is poised to pay off in a big way. The Republican tax bills making their way through the House and Senate would allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates. In a tax-overhaul package that would provide the greatest benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations, the so-called repatriation provision stands out. It would give companies a permanent tax break of about half a trillion dollars, rewarding the likes of Google, Apple, Pfizer and General Electric. Corporate America claims that about $3 trillion in profits were generated in places like Bermuda, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg. The tax breaks for bringing home such offshore profits “confirm the central tenet of tax planning that a tax deferred is a tax avoided,” said David Miller, a tax lawyer at Proskauer Rose. “For decades, U.S. multinationals have shifted profits abroad and deferred their taxes on them. If either of the tax bills pass, they will be rewarded for doing so.” To be sure, the legislation erects some potential guardrails against future efforts to shift profits offshore. It would establish a minimum tax abroad on certain types of income — at least 10 percent for the first several years in the Senate version — thus raising the tax bills for many companies on their foreign profits. And regulators in Europe and elsewhere abroad have accelerated their efforts to crack down on such profit shifting out of their countries. "
"How does President Trump continue to pass for an economic populist even as his policies and appointees are those of an economic royalist? The Republican tax plans he supports are a prime example: They favor corporations and upper-bracket individuals and rely on the long-discredited “trickle down” theory to offer benefits to workers. Mr. Trump’s key economic posts have gone to Wall Street veterans. Most recently, he nominated Jerome Powell — a partner from 1997 to 2005 in the Carlyle Group, one of the largest private equity firms — to be chairman of the Federal Reserve. The president’s other top economic officials are either investment bankers or private equity managers. Gary Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both came from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, is another prominent private equity operator. In 2002, Mr. Ross bought several steel factories that had been closed; he reopened them after persuading the steelworkers union to take major cuts. When he cashed out three years later, he made 14 times his original investment of $90 million. According to the economists Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, “his three-year investment netted him $4.5 billion — just equal to what retirees lost in their health and pension plans.” This is an administration run by and for financial engineers. The president’s policies have sought to gut what remains of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation that protects consumers from financial wrongdoing, most recently in his assault on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Despite Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to eliminate the carried-interest loophole — which taxes the fees of private-equity fund managers and other investment managers at low capital gains rates instead of at higher income tax rates — the House and Senate plans leave it intact.

"I opened the door of a business called True’s. It was a pharmacy run by a conservative Republican, a man who eventually served as the speaker of the House in the Maine State Legislature. It occurred to me, as I walked in, that the store might well refuse to fill my prescription, given my condition. And I wondered whether the pharmacy’s actions would be legal if, indeed, the pharmacist argued that helping a person like me went against his beliefs. After all, there’s a long history of people using religious liberty as reason to justify their refusal to provide a public service offered by their business. In 1968, the owner of a barbecue restaurant — Piggie Park, in South Carolina — held that his religious beliefs gave him the right to withhold service from African-Americans. The owner, Maurice Bessinger, argued that the Civil Rights Act violated his freedom of religion, because “his religious beliefs compel him to oppose any integration of the races whatever.” More recently, a pediatrician rejected Krista and Jamie Contreras’s child as a patient in Roseville, Mich., in 2014. The doctor, saying she had given the matter “much prayer,” decided that she couldn’t provide health care to their baby because they are lesbians. On Tuesday, in a case supported by the Trump administration and a group called Alliance Defending Freedom, a broad right to discriminate on the basis of faith will be argued before the Supreme Court. If you’ve never heard of the Alliance Defending Freedom, the name alone is probably a tip off that freedom is the last thing it’s concerned with defending. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated it a hate group. Yes, we have reached a point in our history where no one is surprised for one moment that in a case being argued before the Supreme Court, the White House is on the same side as a designated hate group. By now maybe you’re familiar with the case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. A baker in Lakewood, Colo., named Jack Phillips refused to make a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins, because their loving legal union violated his Christian beliefs. A series of lower courts has sided with Mr. Craig and Mr. Mullins, but the appeals process has led to the Supreme Court, where it is expected that the swing vote will ultimately rest with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality. "
"Matt Lauer, who was fired by NBC on Wednesday over a sexual harassment allegation, was one of the network’s most high-profile journalists and the face of one of its most valuable programs, “Today,” since the mid-1990s. Mr. Lauer spent 21 years at “Today,” the longest tenure for the show, and was often at the center of rumored tension among other anchors on the program. In his role, he led NBC’s coverage during major news events, including on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, and engaged in memorable interviews, such as his combative questioning of Tom Cruise in 2005. After several years as the news reader on “Today,” Mr. Lauer replaced Bryant Gumbel as the co-anchor on Jan. 6, 1997. His first week was full of jitters and awkwardness, but those five days were the second-best-rated week in the show’s history at the time. Jeff Zucker, then the executive producer of “Today,” called Mr. Lauer “the hunk next door.” He added, “It’s great for us that women are attracted to him. But that wouldn’t work, and Matt wouldn’t succeed, if he couldn’t do the job.” On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Lauer was talking to the writer Richard Hack about a new Howard Hughes biography. The interview stopped, and Mr. Lauer said he had a photograph to show viewers, but after a technical problem, he said he would discuss the breaking news after a commercial break. "
"Yes, the vocabulary in New York Times articles can be challenging, and teachers of English language learners may assume it’s too hard for their students.

"A gaunt man in tan jail clothes took the witness stand Wednesday and began testifying about how he had bribed a Turkish economy minister as part of a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle gold for oil in violation of United States sanctions on Iran. The witness, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, had been charged with conspiring to violate the sanctions and had faced a trial with Mehmet Hakan Atilla, an official with Halkbank, a Turkish state bank that prosecutors say was involved in the scheme. But last month, Mr. Zarrab secretly pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the authorities, a development revealed when Mr. Atilla’s trial opened in Federal District Court in Manhattan this week. As Mr. Zarrab testified against Mr. Atilla, he was asked by a prosecutor why he had decided to help the American authorities. He offered a pragmatic reason. “Cooperation was the fastest way to accept responsibility and to get out of jail at once,” he said. Mr. Zarrab is currently being held at an undisclosed location — in F.B.I. custody and not in a hotel, he told the court. “Are you free to come and go as you please?” the prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked. “Definitely not,” he said.

"For the second week in a row, viewers of a network morning show woke up to a disturbing surprise: Two female hosts reporting, and working publicly through the emotion of, the ouster of their male colleague over allegations of sexual misconduct. On Wednesday morning, it was Savannah Guthrie, joined by Hoda Kotb on the “Today” show, her voice shaking as she announced, “Breaking news overnight: Matt Lauer has been terminated from NBC News.” Last week, it was Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell on “CBS This Morning,” where Charlie Rose was fired. How do we process the news, and the shattering of the morning shows? James Poniewozik and Margaret Lyons, two television critics for The Times, discuss. JAMES PONIEWOZIK As in every case like this, the first, second and thousandth concern should be for the victims. The main lesson is straightforward: You shouldn’t harass or assault your co-workers, whatever your job, and you should be punished if you do. But morning-show host is also a public job. By design, it involves a kind of connection with the home viewer, even if an artificial one. You bring people into your home for years, you feel as if you know them, though of course you don’t. Here, millions of people were suddenly told — twice — that this electronic, faux relationship was over. I can’t recall anything quite like this. MARGARET LYONS I can’t either. Morning TV lives and dies by its perceived intimacy. Of course, I don’t know Matt Lauer … but I don’t not know him either. He’s a celebrity — and much of celebrity culture is that one-way bond. "
"One American prisoner has lost six teeth from malnutrition. Another tried to kill himself. A third, a Briton, is traumatized by the possibility her sentence could be doubled. They are among the foreign nationals incarcerated in Iran on spying or sedition charges, a continuing source of tension in that country’s relations with Western nations, particularly the United States and Britain. Many are Iranians with dual citizenship. Now, the prisoner issue is heating up as President Trump threatens to derail the nuclear agreement with Iran and possibly revive onerous American sanctions. Nearly two years after a group of American captives in Iran was freed when the nuclear accord took effect — in return for the release of a group of Iranians held in the United States — there is speculation that another prisoner exchange may be sought. The Iranians have been dropping hints recently that they are prepared to make a deal, even as the Trump administration increasingly shows its antipathy to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his subordinates. Like the last deal, this one might involve clearing of old debts owed to Iran from the period before its 1979 revolution. Each side, in effect, has prisoners to use as a bargaining chip. The Iranians say at least 14 Iranians have been unfairly imprisoned or prosecuted by the United States or its allies, mostly on what they call specious accusations of sanctions violations. The list includes a friend of Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and a pregnant woman held in Australia who could be extradited to the United States. "
"A longtime outsider in New York State politics has been identified as the link between WikiLeaks and Roger J. Stone Jr., an adviser to Donald J. Trump who appears to have had advance knowledge about hacked emails related to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The outsider, Randy Credico, a comedian who has frequently run for office, posted on Twitter on Tuesday that he had received a subpoena requiring him to appear before the House Intelligence Committee next month. The panel is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016  campaign. Mr. Credico could not be reached on Wednesday for comment. A person familiar with the House efforts said that Mr. Credico had been identified as the intermediary between Mr. Stone and Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. Mr. Credico, who also hosts a radio show, interviewed Mr. Assange on his program in April, and Mr. Stone, who worked with Mr. Credico on efforts to reform New York’s drug laws, has also appeared on the show. On a separate occasion, Mr. Credico traveled to London to interview Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he has been granted asylum against extradition to Sweden to face questioning on allegations that he sexually abused two young women in 2010.

"On Wednesday morning the president of the United States retweeted a series of Islamophobic videos. On Wednesday night a persecuted character in “Mr. Robot” noted: “This country now blames Muslims for everything. There’s no room for us here anymore.” That this episode was produced months before President Trump offered his latest offense to Muslims is yet another example of the show’s uncanny ability to anticipate cultural currents. It also demonstrates that anti-Muslim sentiment is a sadly evergreen theme to explore on TV, and has only gotten more so amid the Trump Administration’s attempted travel bans and other insults and provocations. An Egyptian American who grew up in a Muslim family, Sam Esmail has said his heritage informs his work mostly by helping him relate to outsiders. But xenophobia has become a more prominent theme this season — along with Mr. Esmail’s contempt for the president — culminating in the Dark Army’s brutal scapegoating of Trenton and Mobley as hacker terrorists with Iranian loyalties last week. This week’s exploration of the aftermath, both for Elliot and for Trenton and Mobley’s families, brought the show’s most explicit depiction of the Muslim experience in America. The episode, written by Mr. Esmail, was uncommonly tender and also a little odd (more on that later) as Elliot turned a corner — and perhaps began to synthesize his two halves — with the help of Trenton’s little brother, Mohammed. We’ve heard Trenton discuss him before. Her closeness with her family, along with the fact that she only joined fsociety because American capitalism had victimized her family, made hers the most tragic death we’ve seen on “Mr. Robot.” (For me, anyway.) The boy was perhaps a bit too much the precocious font of guileless wisdom, a favorite trope of filmmakers, and his surprise appearance and cutesy pestering of Elliot also verged on cliché. But he was also endearing. His remarks, in the mosque, about being the only person in his family who could be President pointed up the arbitrariness of one’s place of birth — and all the judgments that are based on that — and reminded us that American citizenship can offer little protection for minority Americans. “If I were president, I would be able to stay here in the house we live in,” he said.

"WASHINGTON — At a Wednesday afternoon rally in Missouri, President Trump played up what he called the “biggest tax cuts in history” and boasted about economic growth “in a nonbraggadocious way.” “In fact, they’re going to say Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator,” he said of his rosy projections, in a speech full of exaggerations and falsehoods. Here’s an assessment. President Ronald Reagan, who enacted a major tax cut in 1981 and lowered tax rates again in 1986, was hardly the last president to have done so. President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W. Bush enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under President Barack Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and Mr. Obama later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012. Mr. Trump insisted that the tax bill is “not good for me” or the wealthy. Referring to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, the president said: “I keep hearing Schumer, ‘This is for the wealthy!’ If it is, my friends don’t know about it.” That is not supported by most analyses of the tax plans being considered in Congress. Under the Senate plan, every income level would receive a tax cut in 2019, but people earning $20,000 to $30,000 annually would face a tax increase the next year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. By 2027, most people making under $75,000 each year would see a tax increase, while those making more would continue to receive a tax cut. Under the House plan, every income group would see tax cuts through 2027, but the richest one-fifth of Americans would receive 56 percent to almost 75 percent of the cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center.

"Has North Korea achieved the nuclear weapons capability it thinks it needs to defend itself against the United States? Its latest and most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile test was undeniably hostile. Yet, paradoxically, it could signal a chance for a new diplomatic opening. There are many reasons to be skeptical of the North and pessimistic about the prospects for solving the crisis over its nuclear program, given the ruthlessness of its leader, Kim Jong-un, President Trump’s bombast and the deep mistrust between the two countries. But with regional tensions and the risk of miscalculation so acute, the United States and others, including China, Russia, South Korea and Japan, need to exhaust all avenues in the search for ways to limit the North Korean program. North Korea says its goal is a missile-delivered nuclear weapon capable of striking the United States. It considers itself a nuclear power, with an arsenal of 20 or more weapons, that its officials say is designed to keep the United States from invading and to force an end to sanctions. Mr. Kim has greatly accelerated the nuclear program. The country’s sixth nuclear test came in September and its third test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday. Some experts doubt whether the Hwasong-15 missile can deliver a nuclear weapon, but it flew higher and longer than previous missiles and was judged capable of hitting Washington. Mr. Kim called the test a “resounding success” and “the accomplishment of the historic cause of the national nuclear program, the cause of building a missile power.” American officials and many experts have assumed North Korea would not enter into serious negotiations until it achieved its nuclear ambitions. Therefore, the reasoning goes, if Mr. Kim is as pleased with the program as his statements suggest, now may be the time for the Trump administration, either directly or through intermediaries, to test again whether there’s a chance for serious dialogue. The situation is, to put it mildly, fragile. Mr. Trump has responded to North Korea’s nuclear progress with threats of military options, tighter sanctions and demands that China increase pressure on the North. North Korea effectively shut down communications, including unofficial contacts, with the United States after Mr. Trump threatened in his September speech to the United Nations to destroy North Korea and launched a personal attack on Mr. Kim. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on CNN, “We’re headed toward a war if things don’t change.” After the latest test, Mr. Trump called Mr. Kim a “sick puppy” and promised tighter sanctions but generally was more temperate than usual. Also encouraging was Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s assurance that “diplomatic options remain viable and open,” although he added a crucial caveat: “for now.” If there is any hope of easing the tension and avoiding serious confrontation, each side will have to make a move toward the other.

"Matt Lauer, of NBC News, played the easygoing dad you could rely on — fun-loving but serious enough when he had to be. Garrison Keillor, of public radio, was your quirky uncle, quick to spin a yarn, tell a corny joke or even break into a song that, if you paid close attention, just might have a lesson in it. Charlie Rose, of CBS, PBS and Bloomberg News, was the urbane, inquisitive host whose Manhattan sophistication was grounded by a humble North Carolina upbringing. And Bill O’Reilly, of Fox News — what can you say? To half the block, he was the neighborhood bully. But if you were with him, you swore by him. He was looking out for you and he had your back — as he reminded you every night. These media luminaries were just right for the archetypal parts they inhabited for so many years — roles that not only made them big names in broadcasting but also took them to the forefront of the national political discussion. One by one, they have fallen to a range of allegations of sexual misconduct against them — the latest coming against Mr. Lauer and Mr. Keillor on Wednesday. And their sudden loss of stature is stripping away their television personae and swiftly ripping down the edifice of the old television news patriarchy in the process. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, met this month with investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, and answered questions about a meeting with a Russian ambassador during the presidential transition, according to a person briefed on the investigation. The questions focused on a meeting in December between Mr. Kushner, the ambassador and Michael T. Flynn, who at the time was the president’s incoming national security adviser, the person said on Wednesday. Prosecutors also asked Mr. Kushner about other interactions between Mr. Flynn and the Russian government, the person briefed on the investigation said. Mr. Flynn was fired in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations during the transition with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was then the Russian ambassador to the United States. Reached for comment on Wednesday night, Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, said, “Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so.” The special counsel’s interview of Mr. Kushner was first reported by CNN. Mr. Mueller is investigating whether anyone around Mr. Trump worked with Russian officials to try to influence the presidential election. His prosecutors have interviewed many White House officials. The White House has said that Mr. Trump expects everyone to cooperate. The interview does not mean Mr. Kushner is a particular focus of the investigation. Defense lawyers typically do not allow such interviews if they believe that their clients are the target of an investigation. The interview with Mr. Kushner would have been important to Mr. Mueller, who is building a case against Mr. Flynn. A grand jury in Washington has subpoenaed documents and testimony from those around Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors are investigating his business deals, his foreign lobbying and whether he lied on government forms. Mr. Flynn recently cut ties with Mr. Trump’s legal team, a sign that he was considering cooperating with the government. The December meeting at Trump Tower was intended to “establish a line of communication” between the new administration and the Russian government, the White House has said. Mr. Flynn was the presidential transition team’s primary interlocutor with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Kushner coordinated the transition team’s foreign contacts. At that meeting, the men discussed establishing a secret communications channel between the Trump team and Moscow to discuss strategy in Syria and other policy issues. The idea was to have Mr. Flynn speak with a senior military official in Moscow, but the channel was never set up. The special counsel’s interview of Mr. Kushner lasted less than an hour and did not touch on the range of topics Mr. Mueller is investigating. That leaves open the possibility that Mr. Kushner could be interviewed again. Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer, has said that Mr. Flynn has no information to provide prosecutors that can hurt the president. And Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers have sought to play down news of Mr. Flynn’s potential cooperation. "
"President Trump on Wednesday nominated Marvin Goodfriend, a leading critic of the Federal Reserve’s actions since the 2008 financial crisis, to serve on the Fed’s board of governors. The choice of Mr. Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, is a victory for conservatives who want to reshape the Fed’s approach to monetary policy. Mr. Goodfriend has long argued that the Fed should focus on controlling inflation using a minimalist set of tools. The selection comes after Mr. Trump chose a moderate Republican, Jerome H. Powell, as the Fed’s next chairman. There are still three vacancies on the board, and Mr. Trump’s nominees will determine how fast the Fed raises interest rates, and how forcefully it responds to future downturns. Mr. Goodfriend, 67, spent more than 20 years as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, a stronghold of conservative monetary theory, rising to the position of chief monetary policy adviser. He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon. In recent years, he has sharply criticized the Fed’s methods and its goals. As Fed officials sought to revive the economy and drive down unemployment by mounting a large-scale stimulus campaign, Mr. Goodfriend repeatedly cautioned that the Fed was courting higher inflation. In a 2011 interview, he said the Fed should “commit to making low inflation your priority. That will yield the lowest unemployment rate on average over time and the lowest inflation rate.” "
"The United States has filed arguments to the World Trade Organization in a looming dispute over China’s future in the international body, which could shape the global trading system for decades to come. Senior United States officials said on Wednesday that they had filed a brief to the W.T.O. as a third party in a case that China has brought against the European Union. The brief, which will be made public on Thursday, will lay out their legal arguments for why China does not deserve the designation of a “market economy,” a distinction that would entitle it to preferential economic treatment under the W.T.O. The move is likely to ratchet up trade tensions with China, which the White House has called one of the world’s biggest trade offenders. And if China is awarded the designation against the wishes of the United States, it could test the Trump administration’s willingness to remain in the W.T.O., an international body for establishing trade rules and settling disputes that President Trump previously called a “disaster.” China is classified as a nonmarket economy, which allows the United States and other countries to use a special framework under W.T.O. rules to decide whether it is “dumping” its products in other countries by selling them at unfairly low prices. Under this framework, the United States can add an extra duty on some Chinese products to help protect American producers. China maintains that the United States and other W.T.O. members promised to award it the market economy label on Dec. 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of its accession to the W.T.O. But the United States and the European Union have opposed that, claiming that China has failed to hold up its end of the bargain by curtailing the state’s role in the economy. United States officials say the Chinese government’s heavy hand distorts costs and prices in the country and harms competitors abroad. Last December, China challenged both the European Union and the United States at the W.T.O., saying that it was merely protecting its lawful rights. The case with the E.U. is proceeding and could serve as precedent in China’s challenge against the United States, which a W.T.O. panel will consider next. "
"ST. CHARLES, Mo. — President Trump flew to Missouri on Wednesday to talk about tax cuts lifting Main Street and the middle class. But he kept getting sidetracked by repeating unfounded claims that the tax bill poised to pass the Senate would hurt rich people, himself included. “This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me,” Mr. Trump said, in the midst of a frequently meandering 45-minute speech to a festive crowd of 1,000. Then he invoked Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “This is not good for me. Me, it’s not so — I have some very wealthy friends. Not so happy with me, but that’s OK. You know, I keep hearing Schumer: ‘This is for the wealthy.’ Well, if it is, my friends don’t know about it.” Mr. Trump went on to promise to sign the bill, and to vow that, if passed, it would reduce taxes by $2,000 a year for a family of four with a $75,000 annual income. A few moments later, Mr. Trump was back talking about the rich, and about his own taxes going up. “We’re also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage by the wealthy,” Mr. Trump said. “Who are they? I don’t know.” The crowd laughed. “I think my accountants are going crazy right now. It’s all right. Hey look, I’m president. I don’t care. I don’t care anymore.” The crowd cheered. “Some of my wealthy friends care. Me, I don’t care. This is a higher calling. Do we agree?” "
"WASHINGTON — When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis declared on Tuesday that North Korea now had the missile capability to “threaten everywhere in the world, basically,” he hinted at a long-running debate inside the United States government: Can the same strategy that worked against the Soviet Union — mutually assured destruction — also work against a far smaller adversary? The answer is yes, of course it can, if the problem is defined as keeping Pyongyang from unleashing a surprise attack on the continental United States. Or no, it probably can’t, if the problem of containing North Korea is more complex than simply protecting Los Angeles and Washington. And with North Korea, as the past 70 years of bitter experience have repeatedly shown, almost everything is more complex. There is no evidence that Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s current leader, or his father or grandfather, ever contemplated getting into a direct nuclear exchange with the United States. Depending on whose estimates one believes, North Korea has 20 to 60 nuclear weapons; the United States has more than 1,500 currently deployed, and thousands more in storage. It would be, as one senior American military strategist put it a few weeks ago, a case of assisted suicide. But that hardly means nuclear weapons are useless for a 33-year-old leader, who has made clear he has ambitious goals for how he would make use of the power conveyed by a global nuclear reach. If the previous leaders of North Korea were interested mostly in a survival strategy — and saw a small nuclear arsenal as the country’s best guarantee — Mr. Kim appears to have far greater ambitions. South Korea may have all the technology and the money, but the North has a purity of purpose, in Mr. Kim’s mind, that will ultimately give it control of the entire Korean Peninsula. And with it, Mr. Kim believes, will come the respect of far larger powers that have been waiting, for decades, for the North to be swept away by forces of history. "
"As more senators show signs of sacrificing their principles and embracing the Republican tax bill for minor and nebulous concessions, it bears looking more closely at the process that produced this terrible legislation and some of its lesser-known provisions. The Senate tax bill, a 515-page mammoth, was introduced just last week, and the chamber could vote on it as soon as Thursday. This is not how lawmakers are supposed to pass enormous pieces of legislation. It took several years to put together the last serious tax bill, passed in 1986. Congress and the Reagan administration worked across party lines, produced numerous drafts, held many hearings and struck countless compromises. This time it’s not about true reform but about speed and bowling over the opposition in hopes of claiming a partisan victory. The country ought to be dismayed by the way senators like Bob Corker, Susan Collins and Ron Johnson appear to be backing away from their principled objections based on half-measures promised by President Trump and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that will not address its big flaws. This rush to the Senate floor has been orchestrated by Mr. McConnell, following the same playbook he used in the failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The longer people have to study the details, the less likely the bill is to pass. People should know by now about the big stuff: the giant permanent corporate tax-rate cut, the small and temporary tax cuts for the middle class, the repeal of the A.C.A.’s individual mandate and the $1.4 trillion added to the federal deficit over 10 years. But other provisions are not as well understood and deserve to be called out. Here are three. PICKPOCKETING THE MIDDLE CLASS: Like the House tax bill, the Senate measure would change how the government adjusts tax brackets and other tax provisions for inflation, replacing the Consumer Price Index with the Chained Consumer Price Index, which tends to increase at a slower rate. While most taxpayers would not notice an immediate impact, the effects would compound over time as more low- and middle-income families are pushed into higher tax brackets, and as working families receive less help through benefits like the earned-income tax credit. Over the next decade, changing the inflation measure would mean that families would lose $134 billion by paying more in taxes and receiving fewer benefits than they would under current law, according to Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. The increase will be even bigger in future years: $31.5 billion in 2027 alone. "
"Three N.F.L. players who have been kneeling during the national anthem have questioned a tentative plan negotiated this week by the N.F.L. to donate millions of dollars to groups that aid African-American communities, calling it an effort by the league to get them to stop their protests. Two of the players, Eric Reid of the San Francisco 49ers and Michael Thomas of the Miami Dolphins, said the proposal had been put together without their consent by the N.F.L. and the two leaders of the so-called Players Coalition: Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles and former wide receiver Anquan Boldin. In an interview Wednesday night, Reid accused the league of trying to donate money to get the players to end their protests during the national anthem, which have put the league in the cross hairs of the president and fans who have accused the league and players of being unpatriotic. “It’s apparent the N.F.L. is trying to buy an end to the protests,” Reid said. Reid and Thomas, who have been kneeling during the anthem to protest social injustice and police brutality, said on Twitter that they had left that coalition, a group of players that has worked to support social justice causes, because Jenkins and Boldin “can no longer speak on our behalf as we don’t believe the coalition’s beliefs are in our best interests as a whole.” Reid, who last year began kneeling during the anthem with his former teammate Colin Kaepernick, said on Tuesday, “At no point did I say the donations were contingent on me ending my protest.” Commissioner Roger Goodell, Reid added, “is trying to buy our silence.” "

"If there was a message in North Korea’s launch of a new missile capable of reaching anywhere in the United States, it was that America’s strategy toward that country is failing — and that war may be looming. The American public is far too complacent about the possibility of a war with North Korea, one that could be incomparably bloodier than any U.S. war in my lifetime. One assessment suggests that one million people could die on the first day. “If we have to go to war to stop this, we will,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told CNN after the latest missile test. “We’re headed toward a war if things don’t change.” President Trump himself has said he stands ready to “totally destroy” North Korea. His national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, says Trump “is willing to do anything necessary” to prevent North Korea from threatening the U.S. with nuclear weapons — which is precisely what Kim Jong-un did. One lesson from history: When a president and his advisers say they’re considering a war, take them seriously. The international security experts I’ve consulted offer estimates of the risk of war from 15 percent to more than 50 percent. That should be staggering. "
"WASHINGTON — Members of Congress confronted Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, on Wednesday over an F.B.I. intelligence report that said that black extremists were targeting law enforcement because of police abuses in minority communities. Mr. Wray met with the Congressional Black Caucus for about 90 minutes on Capitol Hill to discuss its members’ concerns about the report, which grouped together blacks who have espoused violent ideologies, some of whom went on to attack the police, under the term the “Black Identity Extremist” movement. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Wray struggled to defend the report’s analysis and could not identify a single black identity extremist group. “He was asked to publicly clarify that there is no scintilla of evidence, as far as we can tell, to provide an example of the black identity extremist movement or any groups that fall in that category,” Mr. Jeffries said. “That clarification should be made publicly, it seems to many of us, and not privately behind closed doors.” Mr. Jeffries said that Mr. Wray would consider the request. In the report, the F.B.I.’s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit said that violence directed at law enforcement increased after a grand jury did not indict a white police officer who fatally shot in 2014 Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man, in Ferguson, Mo. Citing six attacks, the report said that those responsible committed assault over “perceived racism and injustice” and that some in the movement wanted to establish a sovereign, autonomous black homeland in the United States. Elected leaders, legal experts and civil rights activists said that labeling a so-called movement as black identity extremists was ambiguous and meant to chill free speech. They said the bureau’s analysis, earlier reported by Foreign Policy, harked back to the F.B.I. spying illegally on blacks during the civil rights movement and other groups suspected of being subversive.

"House Speaker Paul D. Ryan scratched plans for a fund-raiser on Wednesday that was to benefit the re-election campaign of Representative Lee M. Zeldin after Mr. Zeldin, a Republican from Long Island, voted against the sweeping tax overhaul that cleared the House this month. Several people familiar with the planning for the fund-raiser said the cancellation was designed to punish Mr. Zeldin, who not only voted against the bill but was outspoken about one aspect: the elimination of the federal deduction for state and local taxes, which particularly impacts high-tax states like New York. “The campaign can confirm, but has no further comment,” Mr. Zeldin’s campaign said in a statement in response to questions from The New York Times. The fund-raising lunch event still occurred on Wednesday, but the proceeds now went to Mr. Ryan’s political operation and the National Republican Congressional Committee, rather than Mr. Zeldin’s campaign. “Speaker Ryan attended an event today with longtime friends and supporters to raise money for the N.R.C.C. and congressional Republicans,” said Kevin Seifert, executive director of Team Ryan, the speaker’s political shop. Mr. Zeldin was one of five New York Republicans to vote against the tax bill, and among the most vocal. “I just have too many constituents who are going to see their taxes go up,” Mr. Zeldin said the day of the vote. “You’re taking more money from a place like New York in order to pay for deeper tax cuts elsewhere.” Next month, Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist for President Trump and a longtime critic of Mr. Ryan, is scheduled to headline a fund-raiser for Mr. Zeldin. Arthur Schwartz, a co-host of the December fund-raiser, and a friend of Mr. Bannon’s, said Mr. Bannon had agreed to attend after Mr. Ryan canceled on Mr. Zeldin. “It wasn’t a coincidence,” Mr. Schwartz said. “After the speaker pulled out, Steve stepped in to help protect our majority in the House.” "
"Early Wednesday morning, President Trump set off international outrage when he shared a series of videos depicting Muslims in a negative light. The videos, taken in three countries at three different times, all have one thing in common: They all purport to show violence carried out by Muslims and offer no clear explanation of what is happening in front of the camera. But a closer look at the clips, first tweeted out by Jayda Fransen of the fringe nationalist group Britain First and then retweeted by Mr. Trump, reveals more, including that one video misrepresents the facts of what the viewer is seeing, while the other two lack context about what is happening. Here is a breakdown of what we know about the videos. The first video was of a teenager attacking another boy, and was presented in the tweet as footage of a “Muslim migrant” attacking a Dutch boy. But according to local officials, both boys are Dutch, and neither is a migrant. The clip was taken in May in Monnickendam, a small town in the North Holland province of the Netherlands. It shows a teenager punching and kicking a boy holding a crutch. The public prosecutor’s office in the province said the aggressor was a 16-year-old who was “born and raised in the Netherlands.” He was arrested after the video came to light, officials said. "
"Even his co-hosts did not know until 4 a.m. on Wednesday, just hours before the official announcement, that Matt Lauer had been fired after a serious allegation of sexual misconduct. That was when the NBC News president, Noah Oppenheim, called two of his “Today” show anchors, Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb. They would be broadcasting live to millions of viewers in three hours — and Mr. Lauer would not be joining them. Senior executives at NBC News made the decision to fire Mr. Lauer, the face of “Today” for two decades, late Tuesday night. At 6:49 a.m., 11 minutes before airtime, Andrew Lack, the news division’s chairman, sent a memo to the staff. In the note, he referred to “a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer.” Mr. Lack added that there was “reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.” During a morning call with NBC News staff members, Mr. Lack said a reason for Mr. Lauer’s firing had to do with Mr. Lauer’s behavior toward a subordinate. For NBC News, Mr. Lauer’s ignominious exit represents another setback in an already difficult period. And it has plunged morning television, a genre that depends on maintaining a mood of homey continuity, deeper into upheaval. "

"While a House Republican proposal to tax the tuition waivers of graduate students may not be among the highest-profile Trump-era assaults on people of color, it represents a serious threat to racial equality. If included in the final tax plan, it would disproportionately harm nonwhite graduate students and be disastrous for the already dismal diversity of academia, putting an additional roadblock between people of color and the ivory tower and depriving all of us of their desperately needed intellectual contributions. If graduate students were to be taxed on free tuition valued at tens of thousands of dollars, the bulk of their small stipends would have to go to pay tuition tax, rendering doctoral education inaccessible for all but the independently wealthy. Though the Senate tax plan thankfully does not appear to include a proposal of this kind, the House plan to tax graduate students like me — not just on the modest stipends we receive in exchange for being the backbone of university teaching workforces, but also on the free tuition we receive — would be ruinous. It is obscene that Republican members of Congress are even considering shifting a tax burden off the likes of Donald Trump and his heirs and onto overworked, underpaid and sometimes even homeless graduate students. The effects of this tax would be overly felt by students of color, who already face too many barriers to entering the American academy. The result: Academia would become whiter and less inclusive than it already is. And what it already is, frankly, is shameful. “On average, 75 out of every 100 full-time faculty members at four-year colleges are white,” The Chronicle of Higher Education found last year after evaluating 400,000 professors at 1,500 colleges, adding that just “five are black, and even fewer are Hispanic.” (This disparity grows only worse when you look at tenured faculty members: 79 percent are white, and only 4 percent are black.) Such a racially monolithic faculty is woefully underprepared to teach a future student population, given that most United States newborn babies are now nonwhite, and there are already some freshman classes, such as at Harvard, that are majority nonwhite. A tuition tax would also worsen the many problems that have long kept university faculties from being diverse. It’s no surprise, given that the median wealth of white families is 12 times the wealth of black (and that the average wealth gap between white and black families appears to be growing), that white scholars have long had a significant advantage in overcoming the profoundly expensive costs of obtaining doctorates and entering academia. The effects of this racial inequality are felt generationally. The New York Times has reported that professors and lecturers have parents who are professors and lecturers at a rate of five times the rest of the population. "
"WASHINGTON — Alex M. Azar II, President Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, said Wednesday that he would try to reduce the burden of high drug costs, but he largely absolved drug companies from blame, placing the responsibility on a system that encourages price increases on medicines. Mr. Azar sailed through the first of two hearings on his nomination without making major missteps. But he did not appear to dispel the doubts of Democrats who distrust him because of his experience as a top executive at a major drug maker, Eli Lilly and Company, for 10 years. Democrats said that Mr. Azar had enriched himself in going from government to private industry and was potentially tainted by his work in the sector. One Republican, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, joined that chorus. “You’ve got some convincing to make me believe that you’re going to represent the American people and not Big Pharma,” he told Mr. Azar. Mr. Azar’s first confirmation hearing came two months after Tom Price resigned as health secretary in the face of multiple federal inquiries into his use of private and government planes for travel. Mr. Azar has ample policy experience, including a stint as deputy health secretary under President George W. Bush. But he would assume control of the Department of Health and Human Services at a sensitive time. HealthCare.gov and the Affordable Care Act are in the middle of the first open-enrollment period of the Trump era, and Mr. Azar’s background in the pharmaceutical industry is raising questions about the president’s campaign promise to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, by allowing the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and possibly permitting the importation of medicine from Canada.

"In an election year marked by lackluster campaigning and low turnout, one group of New York City voters came to the polls in droves: those seeking to lodge the futile and time-honored protest of writing in a candidate for mayor. The number of such votes soared in 2017 to 5,343, according to certified results from the city’s Board of Elections released on Wednesday, a figure that surpassed previous recent mayoral elections by a wide margin. Four years ago, 1,792 ballots were cast for write-in candidates; in 2009 and 2005, the number was under 300. That precipitous increase came despite only a modest rise of about 6 percent in the number of votes cast earlier this month compared with four years ago, and a lower number of ballots than the two elections before that. The board certified 1,148,664 votes in the 2017 contest, which Mayor Bill de Blasio won with 66 percent of those cast. The winner of the write-in contest of discontent was his predecessor, the former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who received nearly 1,000 ballots bearing some variation of his name. Others included Preet Bharara, the former federal prosecutor (38 votes); Aaron Judge, the Yankees rookie slugger (10); and Jesus Christ (3). Neither John Lennon nor any other Beatle, living or otherwise, garnered a vote. The 2016 presidential election was revisited, with Hillary Clinton (240) topping Bernie Sanders (29) and President Trump (22). "
"LONDON — She organized “Christian patrols,” marched with crosses through heavily Muslim neighborhoods and accosted veiled women to rail against Islam. She was barred from entering any mosque in England. She has been arrested several times, most recently this month, on charges of making threats and abusive remarks. Still, Jayda Fransen, the 31-year-old deputy leader of Britain First, a fringe group that insists that white Christian civilization is under threat from Muslims, had received relatively little attention. That changed on Wednesday, when Britain First got unexpected publicity from President Trump, who recirculated three sometimes misleading videos Ms. Fransen had posted on Twitter that purported to show Muslims engaged in violence. Hours later, Ms. Fransen took to Twitter to thank him. “You’ve shed light on my plight here in Britain, in that I am facing prison for giving a speech in which I criticized Islam,” she wrote. “This is evidence that Britain has become Sharia-compliant,” she added, referring to Islamic law. Mr. Trump’s tweets drew a rare rebuke from a staunch ally, as Britain’s prime minister and British lawmakers from across the spectrum said that he had given a platform to a hate group, one so extreme that it has been shunned even by other far-right organizations, and has attracted the notice of law enforcement. Matthew J. Goodwin, a scholar at Chatham House who studies far-right politics in Britain, said that Britain First was “not really a populist right movement but basically a neo-Nazi one.” "
"The tax plan has been marketed by President Trump and Republican leaders as a straightforward if enormous rebate for the masses, a $1.5 trillion package of cuts to spur hiring and economic growth. But as the bill has been rushed through Congress with scant debate, its far broader ramifications have come into focus, revealing a catchall legislative creation that could reshape major areas of American life, from education to health care. Some of this re-engineering is straight out of the traditional Republican playbook. Corporate taxes, along with those on wealthy Americans, would be slashed on the presumption that when people in penthouses get relief, the benefits flow down to basement tenements. Some measures are barely connected to the realm of taxation, such as the lifting of a 1954 ban on political activism by churches and the conferring of a new legal right for fetuses in the House bill — both on the wish list of the evangelical right. With a potentially far-reaching dimension, elements in both the House and Senate bills could constrain the ability of states and local governments to levy their own taxes, pressuring them to limit spending on health care, education, public transportation and social services. In their longstanding battle to shrink government, Republicans have found in the tax bill a vehicle to broaden the fight beyond Washington. The result is a behemoth piece of legislation that could widen American economic inequality while diminishing the power of local communities to marshal relief for vulnerable people — especially in high-tax states like California and New York, which, not coincidentally, tend to vote Democratic. All of this is taking shape at such extraordinary velocity, absent the usual analyses and hearings, that even the most savvy Washington lobbyist cannot be fully certain of the implications. "

ne of the first things I noticed about Australia was the intensity of its competitive spirit. From sports to politics to multiplication tables, Australians jump into contests with gusto and smiles. So how about a “commitment to journalism” contest, versus Canada? Let me explain. When The New York Times accelerated its global expansion about a year ago, our bosses decided to focus on English-speaking countries where we already had growing audiences — chief among them, Canada and Australia. They are, of course, very different places. Surfing and ice hockey are not compatible pastimes. But both countries do share a Commonwealth history, and something new from The Times in the form of expanded coverage — and weekly newsletters. Yes, folks, the Australia Letter has a counterpart: the Canada Letter, written by my colleague Ian Austen. It’s good, in a Northern Hemisphere kind of way; more straight vodka, less gin and tonic. But anyway, here’s the challenge: Can we add more new subscribers to this newsletter than Ian can add to his Canada Letter? "
"WASHINGTON — Gun rights legislation that would allow concealed-carry permit holders from one state to legally carry their guns to any other state passed a key House panel along party lines on Wednesday and appeared to be headed for a vote on the floor of the House. The measure is the first gun-related legislation to move in Congress since two of the most deadly mass shootings in United States history, in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas, and would hand a long-sought victory to gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association. Representative Richard Hudson, Republican of North Carolina and the bill’s original sponsor, called the measure “a simple, common sense solution” and “one of the most important pro-Second Amendment measures in Congress.” Democrats on the committee, along with gun control advocates and big city law enforcement officials, put up fierce opposition, warning that the bill would have disastrous effects on public safety in states and cities with more restrictive concealed carry laws. The bill, they said, tramples the rights of states to determine their own laws, but a series of amendments offered by Democrats to halt it failed. “Essentially, we are telling states who are responsible in the requirements that they place on their concealed-carry permits that that doesn’t matter anymore,” said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California. The measure, which has been co-sponsored by 210 Republicans and three Democrats, was expected to win passage in the Republican-controlled House as soon as next week. But its fate in the Senate is far less certain. Republicans control only a narrow majority in that chamber, where any legislation would need to pick up Democratic votes. "
"Idris Elba’s Jamaica-set directorial debut, as well as a documentary on the women’s rights lawyer Gloria Allred and an examination of President Trump’s election entirely through Russian propaganda will be among more than 100 movies shown at the next Sundance Film Festival in January. The selections were announced Wednesday and include films from 29 countries; 100 of the 110 features will be world premieres. “We don’t ever really look for anything going into it,” John Cooper, the festival’s director, said. “We wait to be shown for sure.” Climate change is again an important theme, as it was at the last edition of Sundance. Grouped under the New Climate label will be films like “Anote’s Ark,” a documentary by Matthieu Rytz about a coral island in the Pacific Ocean that may wholly disappear within decades. There is also an emphasis on work by and about women. “RBG” looks at Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice and pop culture icon; “Jane Fonda in Five Acts” explores the actress’s life of activism and filmmaking; and “Bad Reputation” features the rocker Joan Jett. “These aren’t just biopics,” Mr. Cooper said. “These are studies of struggles and artistic freedom they took for themselves. I think that’s kind of a theme that we saw. How these people came into our lives really and why.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Sets Off Furor in Sharing Extremist Videos” (front page, Nov. 30): The Republican leaders of Congress are trying to sneak passage of their tax reform legislation as fast as they can before we find out how problematic it is. And here to help them is President Trump, yet again, trying to create a major distraction. Time after time the media bites at his smoke and mirrors and exhausts every possible meaning out of his ridiculous tweets instead of devoting precious time explaining to the public the serious consequences of this tax bill. Mr. Trump is a genius in the art of propaganda and media manipulation. What I cannot understand is why the media can’t see through his manipulation and instead focus on what he doesn’t want us to see.

"Turning Point: Prototypes for a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States are unveiled. September brought great sadness, frustration and anger when the president of the United States, Donald Trump, called on Congress to phase out DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that assured the future of around 800,000 children from all over the world who are living in the United States, protecting them from deportation. Making up nearly 80 percent of that figure, Mexicans will be disproportionately affected by an end to the program. Latinos, particularly Mexicans, have been the main targets of President Trump’s constant racial attacks. According to Mr. Trump, we are guilty of all sorts of criminal acts. We have been called rapists, drug traffickers and thieves who steal American jobs. He has demanded that we pay for a wall to be built between our two nations that would prevent us from entering the United States. Many of these DACA recipients arrived as babies or toddlers and know no other home, yet they still acknowledge their birthplace and cherish their mother nation, adopting proud hybrid identities. Every country has its own Dreamers, as these young immigrants are known. As they grow up, study, build businesses and exchange ideas, they help fortify a globalized world where cultures mix. "
"President Trump likes to argue that the tax-reform legislation hurtling through Congress this week will protect low- and middle-income households, “not the wealthy and well connected.” He puts himself forward as Exhibit A. “This is going to cost me a fortune,” he said on Wednesday in Missouri. “This is not good for me.” So surely at least a few of the most egregious loopholes that benefit Mr. Trump and real estate developers like him will be closed. Not in the slightest. In fact, the proposals seem almost tailor-made to enrich the president and people like him. “Commercial real estate came out essentially unscathed,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative advocacy group. Real estate developers “didn’t lose anything they care about,” and they got even more breaks, like a shorter depreciation schedule in the Senate tax bill, Mr. Holtz-Eakin pointed out. Mr. Trump still has not released his tax returns, so it’s impossible to know to what extent he would personally benefit from the legislation. But there’s little doubt that he would. "
"MALTA’S CENTER UNTIL the 16th century, the golden-walled city of Mdina, sits on a hill with a view over its thick ramparts and across scrubby plains to Valletta, the current capital, and the glittering sea. My family and I had arrived there — having flown in from London the night before — by public bus from the busy terminal outside Valletta’s gates, along with a few taciturn locals bearing bouquets of flowers, presumably heading to Sunday lunch with relatives in the adjacent modern town of Rabat, and a gaggle of chatty Italians, keen, like ourselves, to visit the so-called “silent city.” And indeed, on this July afternoon, as the black-clad priest and his caretaker padlocked the vast doors of St. Paul’s Cathedral, passed us with their heads bowed and scurried away into the tiny city’s sun-washed maze, the streets were silent except for us, the tourists. The occasional decorated horse clopped by, pulling British or Italians upon a painted cart. Our own footsteps echoed in the silent canyons between cloistered monasteries, convents and private houses, until we rounded a corner into a square near the Carmelite Priory and were suddenly surrounded by young visitors buying trinkets and postcards, taking photographs, swigging, in the heat, from sweating plastic water bottles. A block farther on, all was quiet again. This small, perfect town felt as if I’d dreamed it, a hermetic Mediterranean fantasy, a curious and singular combination of Arab influence and profound Catholicism, the stretching vista of sandy earth and olive trees descending to the impeccable azure sea, punctuated by an occasional British red postbox. All my life I’d wanted to visit Malta. My interest stemmed in part from family lore: My French grandfather’s grandfather was a Maltese immigrant to French Algeria, born in 1820 in Rabat, just outside Mdina’s walls; our name, Messud, is a distortion of Mifsud, to this day common in Malta. (I recently, and surprisingly, encountered the name in relation to the Mueller investigation: It was Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese national, who had allegedly offered to put the Trump campaign foreign policy adviser in contact with the Kremlin.) Then, too, I’d been intrigued by the few details passed on to me along with my ancestor’s birth certificate: details of the island’s particular, rich history from prehistoric times to the present. My interest was inevitably writerly: My ancestors crisscrossed the Mediterranean from France, Italy and Spain to Algeria and back to France, thence to Beirut, from Salonica to Istanbul to Morocco. Malta sits like a jewel in the middle of that storied sea, 100 miles south of Sicily and 240 miles northeast of Tunisia. We started with Mdina because in Malta, on Sundays, most of the shops are still closed, and we’d been warned by our hotel that Valletta would be dozy. Religion and history are Mdina’s raison d’être, however, and the museums were open. In addition to visiting churches, we stopped at the Palazzo Falson, the former home of a prosperous local artist and collector named Olof Frederick Gollcher (whose Swedish ancestry made him no less passionately Maltese). Here, we could glimpse what lay behind Mdina’s millennium-old walled streets: the elegantly proportioned rooms of a typical townhouse, of course; but also the haven of its essential leafy courtyard, shaded from the midday sun and further calmed by its gently trickling fountain. The museum cafe was closed for renovations, and we ended up instead buying burgers from a stand outside the city walls, beyond the stately but unpeopled Howard Gardens (fashioned from the city’s former moat) in a municipal park of a kind familiar to me from my childhood in Sydney, Australia: It’s a British convention, the manicured open space with a green kiosk selling snacks and a separate structure housing well-kept public loos. Along its rim stood a row of Victorian-era terraced houses, looking for all the world as though they were in Margate or Brighton, each villa bearing a nameplate like “Winchester” or “Windward-ho.” If I hadn’t already known that Malta belonged to Britain for over 150 years, I would have deduced it then — we could only have been in a former British colony. BUT MALTA IS by no means trapped in its past. Named one of the two European Capitals of Culture for 2018, Valletta has been exhilaratingly revitalized by the architect Renzo Piano’s 2015 reconstruction and re-envisioning of its city gate, parliament building and opera house (badly bombed in World War II). The tourists on the city’s streets and at the island’s beautiful beaches — around 2 million visitors a year — are notably young: The nation is progressive on LGBTQ rights, has a lively party reputation and is justly famous for its scuba diving. In the past few years, it has become a trendy, readily accessible, less overrun alternative to Ibiza or Crete, and one where almost everyone speaks English. But the island has been in the news for darker reasons, too, most recently on Oct. 16, when the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was assassinated near her home by a car bomb. She had been investigating government corruption in her home country, and in recent years had focused her attention on the infamous Panama Papers, drawing links to those surrounding Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat.

"WASHINGTON — The National Academy of Sciences called Thursday for sweeping changes in the pricing, sale and promotion of prescription drugs to make lifesaving treatments more affordable without discouraging the development of new medicines. The federal government should negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, the academy said, an idea pushed by Democrats for years, embraced by President Trump during the 2016 campaign, but opposed by congressional Republicans. The government, it said, should also deny tax deductions for drug advertising aimed at consumers and set annual limits on out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. “Consumer access to effective and affordable medicines is an imperative for public health, social equity and economic development,” a panel of 17 experts said in a report issued by the academy. “However, this imperative is not being adequately served by the biopharmaceutical sector today.” “The federal government,” it said, “should consolidate and apply its purchasing power to directly negotiate prices with the producers and suppliers of medicines.” Specifically, it said, Congress should allow Medicare to negotiate prices with drugmakers and should amend the Medicaid law to make it easier for states to deny coverage of certain drugs when less costly medicines provide “similar clinical benefit.” The need for change is urgent, the panel said, because more than half of all people in the United States routinely use prescription drugs, and 15 percent regularly take five or more drugs. The report does not endorse price controls, saying they could erode incentives for the development of valuable new drugs. But the panel recommended many other steps to promote competition and make drugs more affordable. The government, it said, should take steps to prevent “common industry practices that delay the entry of lower-cost generic drugs into the market.” "
"LONDON — Donald Trump’s state visit to Britain should be canceled without delay. The withdrawal of the invitation extended to the president in January by Prime Minister Theresa May would indeed be a diplomatic embarrassment and — given Mr. Trump’s vindictive temperament — would be unlikely to go unpunished. Such a decision is never easy to take. But it must be taken. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump retweeted a series of anti-Muslim videos posted by Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, an ultranationalist group so far to the right that it is repudiated by nearly every sector of British politics and society. It is hard to exaggerate how disgusted Britons are by the president’s recent behavior on Twitter. The prime minister responded on Thursday, saying, “I’m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do.” Before her, Sajid Javid, the communities secretary and a Muslim, wrote on Twitter: “So POTUS has endorsed the views of a vile, hate-filled racist organization that hates me and people like me. He is wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing.” Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, called the retweets “abhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society.” It is worth bearing in mind that Ms. Fransen — who celebrated the attention delivered by the American president — is facing charges of religiously aggravated harassment. At least one of the original videos, captioned “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!,” is completely inauthentic. The others are of dubious provenance at best. What is so shocking is that Mr. Trump, who has more than 43 million Twitter followers, should so casually proliferate content tweeted by an organization that actively subverts the social cohesion of a country that is, at least notionally, America’s closest ally. Those in Britain who follow the president’s unfiltered outpourings on social media have learned to expect an aggressive stream of consciousness. But this insult, delivered in so cavalier a fashion, is of a different order. "
" America’s cars run partly on fuels derived from corn and soy. That’s because of a decade-old federal mandate beloved by Midwestern farmers but opposed by an unusual coalition of oil refiners and environmentalists. On Thursday, the Trump administration sided with the farmers and announced that it would stick closely to the current rules and quotas for fuel: Refineries must blend about 20 billion gallons of biofuel — much of it ethanol made from corn — into the nation’s gasoline supply, a level largely unchanged from last year. The decision is a rare setback for the oil industry under a presidency that has filled its ranks with fossil fuel advocates and embarked on a rollback of rules aimed at reducing the industry’s regulatory obligations. A number of environmental and health groups oppose the mandate, citing emerging research showing that ethanol is no cleaner than gasoline. “Biofuels are not helping us environmentally,” said Jonathan Lewis, senior counsel at the Clean Air Task Force. “So the question is: What’s the value of the standard other than as a price support for agriculture?” "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate Republican tax bill, which had appeared to be cruising to victory, suffered a setback late on Thursday as lawmakers were forced to contemplate significant changes, including future tax increases, to help pay for the legislation. The bill had gained momentum in the morning when it picked up a key swing vote. But it came to a grinding, if temporary, halt, as senators scrambled in the early evening to find ways to raise several hundred billion dollars after some members objected to moving forward without a plan to safeguard against ballooning the deficit. Lawmakers are now considering alternatives, including reinstating the alternative minimum tax on some corporations and wealthy individuals, and raising the corporate rate above 20 percent after some number of years. A final vote on the bill is expected on Friday after a series of amendments are considered. The push to raise money came after an analysis by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation found that the tax cuts would not pay for themselves by generating enough revenue through economic growth to offset the tax cuts, as Republicans have claimed, but would instead add $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next 10 years. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, had already been on the fence over deficit concerns, and he insisted on Thursday evening that the Senate leadership find a way to mitigate the cost of the bill, lawmakers said. “Senator Corker has been pretty clear he doesn’t want any deficit spending,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The top U.S. diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, could be on the way out. The Trump administration has marginalized and bypassed the State Department, even as Mr. Tillerson has pushed out droves of career diplomats. Now, senior White House officials tell our reporters that the president plans to replace Mr. Tillerson with his C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, possibly before the end of the year. Other countries appear to be maneuvering rapidly in the meantime. Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi is visiting China, which is drawing her country closer as much of the rest of the world turns away over the Rohingya crisis. And Russia is further extending its profile in the Middle East with a move toward using Egyptian air bases and airspace. _____ • Photographs from North Korea are providing valuable clues about the powerful new missile it launched Wednesday, the Hwasong-15. Analysts say it appears to have two engines for its first booster stage, giving it greater range. Washington is revisiting a long-simmering debate: Could the Cold War strategy that worked against the Soviet Union — mutually assured destruction — also work against North Korea? "
"The drive by Senate Republicans to repeal the requirement that most Americans have health insurance is not only likely to discourage people from signing up for coverage during the current enrollment period, but also could result in higher premiums. If repeal is approved, people could opt out of buying policies because they would no longer face a tax penalty and millions could go uninsured. With the Affordable Care Act already weakened by the Trump administration, big drops in enrollment would deal yet another body blow to the law and wreak more havoc in the individual insurance market. Many consumers would likely to turn to the cheap, short-term policies that already skirt provisions of the law and may not cover pre-existing conditions or basic medical needs. “If you get rid of the mandate, you open the floodgates,” said Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. These plans — sometimes sold by brokers using tactics rife with fraud — were only supposed to last for three months. But President Trump recently signed an executive order that loosened regulations to allow such coverage to be extended up to a year. The proposed repeal of the individual mandate is part of the Senate Republicans’ tax package, and a vote on the legislation is expected this week. Without a mandate, the cost of coverage could increase by double digits on top of already high premiums as healthy people left the market and sick people needing costly care stayed in it. While repeal supporters argue that people would benefit by having the choice to buy less expensive plans, state regulators have been cracking down on rogue agents who have misled customers about what such inexpensive plans cover or more important don’t.

"Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey personally ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in an oil-for-gold scheme that violated United States sanctions on Iran, according to testimony on Thursday by a Turkish-Iranian gold trader in a federal trial in Manhattan. The gold trader, Reza Zarrab, who helped orchestrate the billion-dollar scheme, recently pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade the sanctions and has become a witness for American prosecutors. On Thursday, Mr. Zarrab testified that in 2012, a senior Turkish official told him that Mr. Erdogan — now Turkey’s president, at the time its prime minister — and a second official, the treasury minister, had given orders for the banks “to start doing this trade.” Mr. Zarrab’s testimony marked the first time Mr. Erdogan has been implicated in the alleged sanctions busting, which first surfaced when the Turkish police uncovered the activity in 2013 — only to have their investigation quashed by Mr. Erdogan’s government. Mr. Erdogan has consistently condemned the American investigation into the scheme, raising the matter repeatedly with American officials, including President Trump in September. On Thursday, before Mr. Zarrab, 34, told his story to jurors in Federal District Court in New York, Mr. Erdogan said, “We did not breach the sanctions.” “Whatever the verdict is, we did the right thing,” he said at a closed meeting with his deputies, Turkish state media reported. “We have never made commitments to the U.S. on our energy ties with Iran.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Longtime Face of NBC’s ‘Today’ Is Fired as Complaints Multiply” (front page, Nov. 30): I would like to respond to the heartfelt question of Matt Lauer’s co-host, Savannah Guthrie: “How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly?” The fact is, we are all fallible and capable of some pretty bad behavior. If the bad behavior is big enough or public enough, it can easily come to define the totality of the wrongdoer. But we’re all more than our worst moments. The tendency to continue caring for someone in spite of wrongdoing is part of the experience of being fully human. That said, the part of our humanity that seeks justice requires that the wrongdoer be held fully accountable. As we move through this wrenching period, sorting through the contradictory feelings that arise is both very difficult and very necessary. ANITA MORAN, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: NBC must do some real soul-searching about how it has dealt with reports of sexual harassment by some of its male stars, not only Matt Lauer, host of “Today,” but before that, Donald Trump as host of “The Apprentice,” if some reports are to be believed. It’s not a stretch to suggest that if Mr. Trump were still in that job following Mr. Lauer’s ouster, he, too, would have been fired. None of this is to suggest that NBC is the only media giant to put financial considerations before moral ones — see Charlie Rose at CBS and PBS, and Kevin Spacey at Netflix. But it is a sobering reminder that even the so-called keepers of the flame are far from perfect and need some serious minding themselves, perhaps now more than ever. "
"WASHINGTON — An American citizen who has been held in military custody in Iraq for 11 weeks refused to talk to F.B.I. interrogators without a lawyer after he was warned of his Miranda rights to remain silent and have a lawyer present, the Justice Department told a federal judge on Thursday. “The individual stated he understood his rights, and said he was willing to talk to the agents but also stated that since he was in a new phase, he felt he should have an attorney present,” the department said in a court filing Thursday afternoon. “The agents explained that due to his current situation, it was unknown when he would be able to have an attorney, and the individual stated that it was O.K. and that he is a patient man.” The filing came in response to an order by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia, after a contentious hearing earlier on Thursday during which she warned that the Trump administration seemed to be claiming “unchecked power that is, quite frankly, frightening.” The case centers on an American who was captured by a Syrian militia in mid-September, apparently fighting for the Islamic State, and turned over to American military forces. Although the International Committee for the Red Cross has visited the detainee twice, the government has kept secret even the most basic facts about him, including his name. But a senior administration official has told The New York Times that the detainee was born in the United States to foreign parents and raised in an unidentified Middle Eastern country. The official also said that after being interrogated for intelligence purposes, the detainee was read the Miranda warning and had not talked since then. But Judge Chutkan said on Thursday that she did not want to rely on news reports and wanted the government to disclose such information. "
"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Gov. Jerry Brown of California understands why climate change is so politically polarizing. But he still thinks Democrats know best. “Republicans have to change or they have to get out of the way,” Governor Brown, a Democrat, told entrepreneurs, activists and policymakers here in San Francisco on Wednesday night as part of ClimateTECH, a conference from The New York Times. Governor Brown’s comment came in response to a question from the Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, who asked how the coalition of blue states that pledged their commitment to the Paris agreement after President Trump’s rejection of the pact might attract Republicans. (You can see the full video here.) Governor Brown, who has been in politics since the 1960s, offered his analysis of how climate change had become mired in partisanship. “Dealing with climate change takes very assertive governmental action,” he said. “You can’t just say, ‘I hope the market will work it out.’ You do need policy, you need leadership, you need rules.” In other words, regulation: something anathema to Republican orthodoxy. Yet rather than talking about ways to reach across the aisle on climate change or offering clear ideas on how to work with fossil fuel-heavy red states on reducing emissions, Governor Brown said Republicans had sole responsibility for shifting positions. “It might be easier to remove them from office than it will be to convert them,” he said.

"On Thursday morning, The New York Times revealed that Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has been lying for months about Republican tax plans. Mnuchin has repeatedly claimed the existence of a Treasury report that — unlike every independent, nonpartisan assessment — found that these plans would pay for themselves, increasing growth and hence revenues so much that the deficit wouldn’t rise. But there is no such report, and never has been; Treasury staffers weren’t even asked to study the issue. Also on Thursday, John McCain — who has delivered sanctimonious lectures on the importance of “regular order” in the Senate — declared his support for the G.O.P. tax bill. Remember, Senate leaders rushed this bill to the floor without holding any hearings or soliciting expert testimony (and tax policy is an area where you really, really need to hear from experts, lawyers and accountants even more than economists). In fact, at the time McCain declared his support, some key provisions were still secret, so they could be presented for a vote with no time for debate. McCain declared that he had made his decision after “careful consideration.” Careful consideration of what? He didn’t even wait for an analysis of the bill’s economic impact by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s own scorekeeper — the only official assessment, since the Trump administration was, as I said, lying when it claimed to have its own analysis. Later that day the joint committee delivered its predictable verdict: Like all other reasonable studies, its review found that the Senate bill would do little for U.S. economic growth, while directly hurting tens of millions of middle-class Americans, blowing up the deficit, lavishing benefits on the wealthy and opening up new frontiers for tax avoidance. But thanks to the moral collapse of McCain and other supposedly principled Republicans, at the time this column was filed the bill nonetheless seemed on track to clear the Senate. But aren’t politicians always cynical? Not to this degree. For one thing, there’s no precedent for this frantic rush to pass major legislation before anyone can figure out what’s in it or what it does. By way of comparison, the Affordable Care Act went through months of hearings before it was brought to the Senate floor; the full Senate then debated the bill for 25 straight days. And there’s a world of difference between normal political spin — yes, all politicians try to emphasize the good aspects of their policies — and the outright lies that have marked every aspect of the selling of this thing.

"[Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] Whenever he leaves Foggy Bottom, Rex Tillerson will be remembered as one of the most consequential secretaries of state in recent history — but for all the wrong reasons. Mr. Tillerson, who has clashed with President Trump and may be fired soon, has presided over the hollowing out of the State Department. The exodus of senior and rising Foreign Service officers will debilitate American diplomacy for a generation. It’s hard to imagine doing more damage to an institution and less good for America’s standing in the world in such a short period of time. Meanwhile, Mr. Tillerson’s sound instincts on the substance of foreign policy were routinely undermined by Mr. Trump and his incontinent Twitter feed. Mr. Tillerson’s obsession with downsizing our diplomacy has colored his time at the State Department. Instead of defending the department against the White House’s proposed 30 percent budget cut, he embraced it. Fortunately, Congress stopped — for now — the gutting of our diplomatic, democracy and development programs. Mr. Tillerson imposed a hiring freeze, canceled programs to diversify the department’s personnel, left empty dozens of the most senior positions requiring Senate confirmation and encouraged officers to leave by dangling $25,000 buyouts. Equally damaging, Mr. Tillerson’s insular management style alienated or marginalized many of the department’s most experienced hands. He and the small team around him seemed to view foreign policy professionals as the enemy — a “deep state” opposed to Mr. Trump’s agenda. In this they were profoundly wrong. Over the past 25 years, I’ve worked closely with hundreds of Foreign Service officers and civil servants through Democratic and Republican administrations. To a person, they take pride in checking their personal beliefs at the department’s door and working for the success of whatever administration they serve. I could not tell you the political affiliation of any of the officers with whom I served. But instead of looping them in, Mr. Tillerson’s seventh floor locked them out of policy deliberations. The result was to deny Mr. Tillerson the intellectual capital he needed to succeed when policy was debated around the White House Situation Room table. And the department found itself grievously short-handed of the assistant secretaries and ambassadors who actually implement policy around the world. "
"CARACAS, Venezuela — Masked government agents stormed the homes of two former top officials of Venezuela’s state oil company and arrested them on Thursday, a move that the prosecutor heralded as a blow against corruption but that others saw as a political purge to strengthen the country’s president. The accused men, Nelson Martínez and Eulogio del Pino, are the highest-level officials detained in a string of arrests that have shaken the country’s troubled oil giant, Petróleos de Venezuela, and its United States refiner, Citgo. More than 50 people so far have been detained in a widening net of charges from corruption to sabotage. Mr. Martínez, a former oil minister who led the oil company until this week, was detained early Thursday and charged with seeking debt refinancing contracts without getting government approval, said Tarek William Saab, the Venezuelan attorney general. Mr. Del Pino, Mr. Martínez’s predecessor, was arrested on a list of charges that included falsifying production figures and sabotage that resulted in millions of dollars in lost revenues, Mr. Saab said. Mr. Saab described the two men as running “a cartel” that he said “bit by bit was delivering blows to the oil industry and causing national damage.” In a video posted on Mr. Del Pino’s Twitter account and apparently recorded before his arrest, he said he had been the victim of an unjustified attack.

"WASHINGTON — The first time Donald J. Trump met Senator Tom Cotton, in summer 2015, the two commiserated over their shared hatred of the nuclear deal that President Barack Obama had just struck with Iran. Mr. Trump, at the time a presidential candidate who knew little about national security, thanked Mr. Cotton, an Ivy League-educated Iraq war veteran and then a first-year senator, for his staunch opposition to the agreement. Mr. Cotton, who described the encounter in a recent interview, had written an unusual letter to Iran’s mullahs, signed by 46 Republican colleagues, warning that Congress might reverse the nuclear accord or a new president might rip it up; Mr. Trump was campaigning on doing just that. Now Mr. Cotton, 40, is Mr. Trump’s favorite to lead the C.I.A. as part of a quietly conceived plan to elevate the current director, Mike Pompeo, to replace Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state who has lost favor with the president and his closest advisers. Should the plan hold and he be confirmed for the post, Mr. Cotton, the youngest member of the Senate, would also be the youngest person ever to lead the nation’s premier intelligence agency. Serving as C.I.A. director would seal his reputation as a young man in a hurry in Washington, underlined by his lack of experience relevant to the job. It is unclear how leaving the Senate would affect Mr. Cotton’s outsize political ambition, widely believed to include an eventual run for president. But choosing Mr. Cotton as C.I.A. director would be the latest in a string of appointments by Mr. Trump that reflect his preference for loyalists who are unapologetic about couching their hawkish stances on national security issues in sharply partisan terms. Last year, Mr. Cotton defended Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to bring back waterboarding, telling CNN that “waterboarding is not torture,” and labeling it as a “tough call” for experienced intelligence officials who might decide it is warranted. In 2006, Mr. Cotton wrote an open letter accusing three New York Times journalists of treason for exposing a secret American program to track the financing of terrorist networks. "
"To the Editor: I am the editor of “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.” We represent a much larger number of concerned mental health professionals who have come forward to warn against the president’s psychological instability and the dangers it poses. We now number in the thousands. We are currently witnessing more than his usual state of instability — in fact, a pattern of decompensation: increasing loss of touch with reality, marked signs of volatility and unpredictable behavior, and an attraction to violence as a means of coping. These characteristics place our country and the world at extreme risk of danger. Ordinarily, we carry out a routine process for treating people who are dangerous: containment, removal from access to weapons and an urgent evaluation. We have been unable to do so because of Mr. Trump’s status as president. But the power of the presidency and the type of arsenal he has access to should raise greater alarm, not less. We urge the public and the lawmakers of this country to push for an urgent evaluation of the president, for which we are in the process of developing a separate but independent expert panel, capable of meeting and carrying out all medical standards of care.

"LONDON — One member of Parliament called him a “fascist.” Another described him as “stupid.” A third wondered aloud whether President Trump was “racist, incompetent or unthinking — or all three.” The stream of criticism that began after Mr. Trump shared anti-Muslim videos from a far-right British group on Wednesday morning turned into a gusher on Thursday, after he rebuked Prime Minister Theresa May in a nighttime tweet, telling her: “Don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.” Mr. Trump’s one-two punch managed to generate rare unanimity in a Britain that is deeply divided over the contentious process of leaving the European Union. For one day at least, political rivals redirected the ire they normally aim at one another to focus on Mr. Trump. Criticism came from ideological opposites like Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London and a Muslim with whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly feuded on Twitter, and Nigel Farage, the euroskeptic provocateur who traveled across the Atlantic to campaign for Mr. Trump last year. (“Put your hands up, say ‘I got this wrong,’ and, frankly, try to move on,” Mr. Farage advised Mr. Trump.) Meeting in Parliament, lawmakers were unanimous in saying Mr. Trump, by giving a platform to the fringe group Britain First, had gone too far. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. A few weeks ago, I read a short new book by the legal scholar Cass Sunstein titled, simply, “Impeachment.” The book doesn’t mention President Trump once. Sunstein started writing it, he told me, partly because he was alarmed by what he considered reckless talk of impeachment during Trump’s first weeks on the job, before he had started doing much. Sunstein’s goal was to lay out a legal and historical framework for thinking about impeachment, independent of any specific president. I’ve been thinking about the topic a lot since finishing the book, and I want to recommend both Sunstein’s book and a Vox piece published this morning by Ezra Klein. To be clear, I think it would be a mistake for Democrats to put much energy into impeachment right now, because it’s not going to happen: Republicans control Congress and show no interest. But I also think it would be a mistake for Americans — regardless of party — to be in denial about the governing crisis our country is facing. Let’s admit it: Trump is behaving in ways that call for serious talk of impeachment. If you read Sunstein’s careful history of impeachment — of when the founders believed it was appropriate and necessary — I expect you will come to the same conclusion. Trump disdains the rule of law (as I detailed in this column), and he lies constantly. Multiple high-level Republicans, including some who work in the administration, consider him unfit for the presidency. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House has developed a plan to force out Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, whose relationship with President Trump has been strained, and replace him with Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, perhaps within the next several weeks, senior administration officials said on Thursday. Mr. Pompeo would probably be succeeded at the C.I.A. by Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and key ally of the president on national security matters, according to the White House plan. Mr. Cotton has signaled that he would accept the job if offered, said the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations before decisions are announced. Mr. Trump has not signed off on the plan developed by John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, officials said, but the president is said to have soured on Mr. Tillerson and is ready to make a change at the State Department. Mr. Trump spoke harshly about Mr. Tillerson in front of White House aides as recently as Thursday but did not seem ready yet to replace him, according to one person close to the president. For all his public combativeness and his “you’re fired” reputation from reality television, Mr. Trump is often reluctant to dismiss advisers. The disclosure of Mr. Kelly’s transition plan may have been a way to nudge him into making a decision, according to that person. It may also have been meant as a not-too-subtle message to Mr. Tillerson that it is time to go. The ouster of Mr. Tillerson would end a turbulent reign at the State Department for the former Exxon Mobil chief executive, who has been largely marginalized over the last year. Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson have been at odds over a host of major issues, including the Iran nuclear deal, the confrontation with North Korea and a clash between Arab allies. The secretary was reported to have privately called Mr. Trump a “moron” and the president publicly criticized Mr. Tillerson for “wasting his time” with a diplomatic outreach to North Korea. Replacing him with Mr. Pompeo could presage a dramatic change. While many veteran diplomats have expressed disappointment in Mr. Tillerson for the way he has run the State Department, they see him as a pragmatic figure in the Situation Room. Mr. Pompeo, a former congressman from the Tea Party wing of the party, would be more hawkish on Iran, North Korea and other key issues. "

"SEOUL, South Korea — The intercontinental ballistic missile North Korea launched this week was a new type of missile bigger and more powerful than any the country had tested before, South Korean officials said on Thursday. Photos from the North’s official Korean Central News Agency are providing valuable clues about the capabilities of the missile, named the Hwasong-15. North Korea said it carried a “super-large heavy warhead which is capable of striking the whole mainland of the U.S.” North Korea’s Hwasong series represents the most successful and formidable part of its ballistic missile arsenal, and photographs of the test suggested improvements over the Hwasong-14, a missile first tested over the summer that showed the country’s capacity to strike the continental United States. “We believe this is a new type of missile,” said Roh Jae-cheon, a spokesman for the South Korean military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. “It looks clearly different from the Hwasong-14 in the external looks of its nose cone, the linkage between its first and second stages, and its overall size.” South Korean officials said the launch suggested that North Korea’s missile program was advancing faster than previously believed. Private analysts agreed that the Hwasong-15 looked bigger and more powerful than the Hwasong-14. "

There I would lose myself in the mania of small details—finding where the Jawas slept on their Sandcrawler; examining the luggage compartments of an X-Wing—until my dumb brain finally gave up to sleep. Currently I have the new Penguin Classics collection of Richard Matheson short stories, some zines of very funny essays by the comedian April Richardson that I got in the mail, and the newly reissued crime novel “Breakout,” featuring the great, emotionless thief, Parker, which is also what I’m reading on my phone. What’s the last great book you read? “We Were Eight Years in Power,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates. I don’t think anyone who more thoughtfully and fearlessly reminds us that America was never really great for everyone, and that the only way forward is forward. Whether challenging the reader to question our own self-serving myths, or chiding me on Twitter to get over myself and just read Marvel’s “Secret Wars,” Coates’s breadth of knowledge, taste, talent, anger, decency, curiosity, and humor makes me work harder to be better every day. On y va. What influences your decisions about which books to read? Word of mouth, reviews, a trusted friend? Fate typically. I pick things up a libraries and bookstores, used and new. I turn them over in my hands, and if they speak to me, I bring them home and let them sit on the counter for a while and mock me. And finally I say, you win, and I read them. The Big Chicken Barn in Ellsworth, Me., serendipitously provides an old Stephen King paperback every summer. That’s how I found “Cujo” a couple of years ago, which I probably would never have sought out on purpose, and more shame me. It is one of the most achingly sad and subtly constructed novels I’ve read. What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? In “The Green Ripper,” by John D. MacDonald, his rangy, soulful, nondetective detective Travis McGee offers a long inner monologue about how six hours of brisk walking a week is all the exercise a middle-aged male body requires and, frankly, can tolerate. I took it as both an indictment and a relief. Which classic novel did you recently read for the first time? I am poorly read in the classic classics. I’m not proud, but it’s just that my eye always turns first to the dollar bin of paperbacks, the ephemeral, forgotten and weird. But per the above, “The Green Ripper” is one of a classic crime series my mom always loved but I had never gotten to until now. I was amazed by it. McGee is a likeable, noble, sardonic houseboat-dwelling dilettante in all his books, but the horror he endures (and by necessity, causes) in this one was as powerful as any “literary” novel I’ve read. More people should read the classics of genre fiction before they plow into their old high school syllabus. "
"One of the longest stock-market booms in history continued its gravity-defying ascent Thursday, with investors cheering the prospect of deep corporate tax cuts and the rollback of government regulations under President Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average eclipsed yet another milestone, closing Thursday above 24,000 for the first time. And the Standard & Poor’s 500 index logged its 13th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history. Stock markets have been going up, more or less without interruption, since March 2009, the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis. This eight-and-a-half-year bull market is now the second-longest in history, behind only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000. Investors are embracing Mr. Trump’s pro-corporate presidency, marked by the promise of lower taxes, the installation of former industry executives in key government agencies, and the repeal or relaxation of rules and regulations that have made it hard for some big businesses to expand without fear of interference from Washington. Indeed, the view is taking hold that Mr. Trump, in so aggressively promoting policies aimed to stoke the economy and financial markets, has unleashed animal spirits — largely absent under President Barack Obama — that are now reflected in ever rising consumer confidence indicators and a willingness to embrace risk in the stock market. “It comes down to psychology, and the psychology today is that everything is awesome,” said Charlie Bilello, a stock market historian at Pension Partners. “Jobs have grown for 85 straight months, you have growth in corporate earnings, and you have tax cuts.” "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Returning from an extended Thanksgiving weekend, Stephen Colbert began “The Late Show” on Wednesday by introducing himself as “one of the few men still allowed on television.” He went on to detail the allegations of sexual misconduct that have been lodged against Matt Lauer, who was fired from NBC’s “Today” show on Wednesday. President Trump tweeted a response to the Lauer scandal, but Mr. Colbert said he had no right to talk, since more than a dozen women have accused Mr. Trump of sexual harassment or assault. Trevor Noah pointed to one particularly bizarre detail that has emerged about Mr. Lauer’s office. Seth Meyers took a moment to address an issue that late-night hosts have not spent much time discussing: the Federal Communications Commission’s plan to scrap net neutrality. "
"President Trump has single-handedly done more to undermine the basic tenets of American democracy than any foreign agent or foreign propaganda campaign could. “Trump is a political weapon of mass self-destruction for American democracy — for its norms, for its morality, for sheer human decency,” Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at Brookings, wrote by email: For the moment, let’s put aside the conclusion of “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections,” the F.B.I., C.I.A. and N.S.A. joint report that was released in January, which said that: This determination, disputed by Trump and others, pales in comparison to the ruinous record of Trump’s 10 months in office. First and foremost, Trump has gravely damaged the premises and procedures that undergird American democracy. Partisan polarization, which helped give rise to Trump in the first place, is getting worse as discord intensifies with every slur and insult Trump hurls. On Oct. 5, the Pew Research Center reported that partisan conflict on fundamental political values In the introduction to their forthcoming book, “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, political scientists at Harvard, write: Their attempt at reassurance is not comforting: In an email, Levitsky argued that “it is important that we understand that the U.S. has largely been doing these things to itself,” before adding, “obviously we should investigate Russian meddling to the fullest, but to blame Putin for the mess we are in today would be ridiculous. We Americans created this mess.” Along similar lines, Ryan Enos, who is also a political scientist at Harvard, suggested that the question of Russian involvement in the election is a secondary issue: In addition, Enos noted, Trump has not only taken a hammer to the code of behavior underpinning democracy at home, he has simultaneously diminished the international stature of the United States — and arguably accelerated the rise of this country’s major competitor, China.

"If you want to understand the ways in which Donald Trump’s presidency is systematically corrupting the American mind, I have a book recommendation for you. It’s about Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The book is Peter Pomerantsev’s “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible.” It was published in 2014, and it brilliantly tells the story of the (Soviet-born) British author’s sojourn as a producer for Russian TV. As the title suggests, at its heart it’s the tale of the substitution of reality with “reality,” of factual truth with interpretive possibility. That’s also the central task of Donald Trump’s presidency. We were reminded of this again this week, on news that Trump is backing away from his public admission last year that he said what he said on the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Then there was his appalling insinuation Wednesday that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough might have killed an office intern in 2001. And his hallucinatory tweet last week in which he claimed to turn down an approach from Time magazine to make him Person of the Year for the second time in a row. Before that it was his multiple attacks against his attorney general. Or his tweeting of a video pastiche in which he physically assaults CNN. Or his voter fraud claims. Or the ones about the size of his inaugural crowds. All this has given rise to the suggestion that Trump is mentally unwell. That’s the charitable interpretation. But the president also gives signs that he is perfectly well, can communicate relatively coherently when he wants to do so, and knows exactly what he is tweeting (and subtweeting), and to what effect. This is where Pomerantsev is so instructive. In one of his book’s early scenes, he relates a professional homily from a man he identifies as prominent Russian TV presenter. “We all know there will be no real politics” in Putin’s Russia, the man says at a staff conference. "
"WASHINGTON — In pitching the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said repeatedly that the plan will pay for itself through a surge of economic growth and that over 100 people in Treasury are “working around the clock on running scenarios for us.” Mr. Mnuchin has promised that Treasury will release its analysis in full. Yet, as the full Senate prepares to vote on a sweeping tax rewrite, the administration has yet to produce the type of economic analysis that it is citing as a reason to pass the tax cut. Those inside Treasury’s Office of Tax Policy, which Mr. Mnuchin has credited with running the models, say they have been largely shut out of the process and are not working on the type of detailed analysis that he has mentioned. An economist at the Office of Tax Analysis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his job, said Treasury had not released a “dynamic” analysis showing that the tax plan would be paid for with economic growth because one did not exist. Instead of conducting full analyses of tax proposals, staff members have been running numbers on individual provisions or policy ideas, like lowering the tax rate on so-called pass-through businesses and figuring out how many family farms would benefit from the repeal of the estate tax. Activity has picked up more recently as Treasury has sought to provide technical assistance to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office for their estimates. A Treasury official said that there was not sufficient time to produce a full analysis with growth and revenue estimates of the final bill, which the Senate Finance Committee passed before Thanksgiving. The official pointed to a letter sent this week to Mr. Mnuchin by nine top conservative economists detailing how the Republican tax bills could bolster economic growth, saying that reflected the findings of its own economic models. On Thursday, the Treasury’s inspector general said it was opening an inquiry into the department’s analysis of the tax plan. The inquiry was in response to a request from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who called for the inspector general to investigate political meddling in the tax policy office after The New York Times reported on the lack of a Treasury analysis.

"Good morning on this cooling Thursday. The thousands of revelers who packed into Rockefeller Center last night for the annual Christmas tree lighting brought to mind another holiday tradition here in the city: massive crowds. ’Tis the season for long lines, cramped sidewalks and sardined subway cars. But hordes of tourists are no reason to miss out on the cheer. Seeking a less congested holidays, we spoke to owners and employees of popular attractions for advice on how to best avoid the masses. Macy’s Santa. For the first time ever, St. Nick is taking reservations. You can hold a spot in line from 30 minutes to five days ahead of time. Santa’s little helpers can still accommodate walk-ins, but visit Monday through Thursday for the shortest lines, said Susan Tercero, Macy’s vice president of branded entertainment. And if you can, dash over soon. “The closer we get to Christmas, the busier Santa gets,” she said. Ice Skating. The Rink at Rockefeller Center is typically packed during the holidays, said Carol Olsen, director of the skating rink. Expect to wait up to 90 minutes for your chance on the ice. The only reliably crowd-free moments, she said, are between 8:30 and 10 a.m., when you can still expect 50 to 75 people skating alongside you. For less crowded rinks, try weekday mornings or evenings at The Rink at Bryant Park in Midtown, LeFrak Center at Lakeside in Prospect Park, or The Rink at Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan. Holiday Windows. The creative directors behind retail holiday windows are split on the least trafficked times to go: at sunrise or after sunset. “It’s quiet and darker at sunrise,” said Richard Moore of Tiffany’s. “Early morning allows you to spend a few minutes alone to take it all in.” But Matthew Mazzucca of Barneys New York prefers visiting in the evening, before 7 p.m. “There is time to hear the custom audio composition,” he said, “and it’s still dark so the light levels are perfect.” Museums. If you’re planning on visiting one of the big four museums (the Met, MoMA, the Whitney and the American Museum of Natural History), plan on going before the doors open, or during the extended hours on Friday or Saturday. When visiting the Met, enter at the 81st Street entrance, where there are fewer people and the line is faster, said Annie Bailis, the museum’s senior manager of media relations. And here’s a tip: Instead of squeezing next to your neighbors at the next holiday tree lighting, the Met has tree lighting ceremonies with Christmas music every day. "

"• The Senate will not vote on its tax bill tonight. It will convene at 10 a.m. Friday to continue the debate on taxes. • Republicans are considering raising some taxes down the road to help offset the cost of their tax bill after the Senate parliamentarian rejected the idea of a trigger that would have automatically increased taxes if economic growth fell short of projections. • Congress’s bipartisan tax referee said that economic growth induced by the tax cut would only offset $458 billion of its cost over the next decade. The analysis put the bill’s total price at $1 trillion, contradicting the Republican argument that the measure would essentially pay for itself. • Earlier in the day, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had been undecided about the bill, said he would vote yes, but Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she remained undecided. • Though Republicans sound optimistic, party leaders still do not have firm commitments from enough senators to ensure the bill will pass.

"Good Thursday. Here are some stories we are watching: • Aspen Institute has a new leader. • The Bitcoin rocket has wobbled. Is a crash coming? • T. Boone Pickens begins to step back from public life. Want this in your own email inbox each morning? Here’s the sign-up. Blue Apron co-founder Matt Salzberg is stepping down as chief executive and being replaced with Chief Financial Officer Brad Dickerson. Mr. Salzberg will become executive chairman, Blue Apron said. Shares of Blue Apron have struggled since it went public in June. The company priced its initial public offering at $10, 40 percent below its target. Since then, the stock has tumbled 70 percent to $2.99. Blue Apron has faced increased competition from Amazon and rival meal-kit delivery start-ups. Amazon’s announcement on June 16 that it would purchase Whole Foods Market weighed heavily on the offering. Since then, the company has done little to assuage investors. It has reported losing customers for two straight quarters and has laid off hundreds of employees. The Dow Jones Industrial Average smashed through 24,000 on Thursday. Increased optimism that the Senate will pass the Republican tax bill pushed the index up more than 300 points to close at 24,273 today. The rally extends a record run for the blue-chip index this year. The Dow has gained 21 percent this year. "
"LONDON — Egypt, in what appeared to be a snub to the Trump administration, has reached a preliminary agreement to allow Russian military jets to use its airspace and bases, both sides said Thursday. If finalized, the agreement would give Russia its deepest presence in Egypt since 1973, when Cairo expelled the military of the Soviet Union and instead became Washington’s closest Arab ally. The United States has provided Egypt more than $70 billion in aid in the four decades since, at a rate of more than $1.3 billion a year in recent years. The cost is often justified in part by the argument that it secures the use of Egypt’s airspace and bases for the American military. Egyptian and American analysts called the preliminary deal the latest sign of the waning influence of the United States as President Trump has diminished its military and diplomatic footprint in the region and the world. “Power abhors a vacuum and when the United States pulls back we can’t be under the impression that the world is going to stand by and wait for us,” said Matthew Spence, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy under the Obama administration, which faced similar criticism for its policy toward the region. “The danger, and the reality, is that other countries will take advantage of the opportunity presented when America chooses to pull back.” In practical terms, the presence of Russian jets in Egypt would raise concerns about the operational security of American military personnel and require coordinating with American military planes in the same airspace.

"Where is the line between culturally appropriate dress and cultural appropriation? It was hard to look at Ivanka Trump’s wardrobe during her India trip this week and not ask the question. After all, from her opening mother-of-pearl embroidered jacket to her final kurta dress, she swerved from her usual pencil skirts and high heels to make her clothes part of the content of her communications. And there were many: two and a half days, six looks, all excitedly chronicled by local style watchers. Indeed, Ms. Trump, in Hyderabad, the capital of the southern Indian state of Telangana, to lead the United States delegation to the eighth annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit, had begun making headlines with fashion even before she arrived. Critics pointed out what they called the hypocrisy of Ivanka Trump (the individual) in making a speech on the importance of female empowerment and equality, when Ivanka Trump (the company) is believed to employ low-wage workers in countries such as … India. Ms. Trump did not address the issue during her various speeches and panels, but she did use dress in a notable way. Unlike her stepmother, Melania Trump, who seemed uninterested in leveraging fashion for political capital during her tour through Asia with President Trump, Ivanka Trump seemed to have embraced the idea wholeheartedly. If, at least at the beginning, a little one-dimensionally. On Monday evening, for example, she made her initial appearance in a Tory Burch “Sylvia” jacket: a black style covered in mother-of-pearl embroidery that called to mind Indian prints and architecture. As it happens, Hyderabad is historically known as “the city of pearls.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Keith Bradsher, our senior writer for Asia economics and business. China’s push to become a major player in electric cars is already shaking up the global auto industry. California’s governor is hoping it will also give the state an advantage in its continuing showdown with Detroit over battery-powered vehicles. Gov. Jerry Brown said on Wednesday evening at an event in San Francisco that China’s electric-car effort would help California withstand demands from American automakers that the state ease back on its effort to put more clean-burning vehicles on the road. California mandates that manufacturers sell a small but growing percentage of electric cars or plug-in hybrid vehicles, which run on both gasoline and electricity. Detroit says the mandate is technologically infeasible. “Even now, some of the automobile companies are trying to come out and say ‘Gee, the standards in a few years will be too tough,’” Governor Brown said. “‘Will you let us off the hook?’” But speaking at the The New York Times’s Climate Tech conference, Governor Brown said China’s push puts pressure on Detroit’s automakers to more quickly embrace electric cars or be overwhelmed by the competition. “We have an ace card called China” in the dispute, he said. China imposed in September a complex formula that compels automakers to sell more electric cars starting in 2019 or be banned from selling gasoline-powered cars. In response, global automakers are moving to expand sharply their electric car production and sales. "
"Donald Trump is completely unfit to be president of the United States. That is not an ideological expression. That is an expression of the shock of mounting evidence that he is intellectually deficient, temperamentally unsound and morally bankrupt. Just this week, he has once again underscored the degree to which he is openly hostile to people of color — I call that racism and bigotry — and demonstrated his lack of impulse control to conceal his contempt even when doing so would be to his benefit. On Monday, Trump defiled a White House ceremony to honor Navajo veterans of World War II (a meeting already defiled because it was held before a portrait of Andrew “Trail of Tears” Jackson) by using a racial slur, pejoratively referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.” These men deserved better, and if Trump were thinking more about them and less about himself — as almost any other American president would have been — he wouldn’t have dragged their moment down into his muck. But this is what happens when you “let Trump be Trump”: He shows up as the bestial creature that he is. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that unnamed advisers told the paper that Trump has also resurrected the racist lie of his political vivification: the question of Barack Obama’s birthplace, and by implication, his legitimacy as America’s first black president, or put another way, its only nonwhite president. According to The Times: “In recent months, they say, Mr. Trump has used closed-door conversations to question the authenticity of President Barack Obama’s birth certificate.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The tax overhaul that has moved through Congress with scant debate includes measures that are straight from the Republican playbook. It would also affect issues barely connected to taxation, such as Medicare, education and granting rights to “unborn children.” The plan’s guiding philosophy is trickle-down economics, whose benefits have historically been monopolized by the wealthy, our correspondents write. Pay for most American workers has been stagnant since the mid-1970s. On Wednesday, President Trump said the $1.5 trillion package of cuts was aimed at the middle class and would not help wealthy people like him. (We assessed some of his claims.) • Significant changes were still being discussed in the Senate, which is on track for a final vote this week. Our live briefing has the latest. • The White House has developed a plan to force out Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose relationship with President Trump has been strained, senior administration officials said today.
