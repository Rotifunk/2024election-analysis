"WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans seeking to get some momentum for their efforts to overhaul the tax code before the August recess are expected to share some results of their months of deliberations this week, aides said on Wednesday. Talks between the top tax negotiators in the House, Senate, White House and Treasury Department have been taking place feverishly as Republican leaders work to develop a unified plan they can introduce in September. The principles that they agree upon, which could be announced Thursday or Friday, are not expected to offer much clarity on many of the most contentious debates that have been weighing on congressional leaders and the White House economic team as they try to bridge their differences. But the release will signal that important progress is being made on President Trump’s top legislative priority. The so-called “big six”— Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the speaker of the House; Kevin Brady of Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman; Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader; Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Senate Finance Committee chairman; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Gary D. Cohn, the National Economic Council director — huddled again on Wednesday evening. Tax lobbyists will be watching closely for a number of important points: the top corporate and individual tax rates, taxation of small “pass through” businesses, deductibility of interest expenses and the controversial border adjustment tax proposal that would tax imports and let exports go untaxed. The announcement that is expected this week, which was reported earlier by Politico, could offer the clearest signal yet that all participants have agreed to abandon or drastically scale back the border tax idea. It has prompted a fierce backlash from retailers and energy companies since it was unveiled last summer, and even many House Republicans have expressed deep reservations.

"WASHINGTON — When President Trump was a candidate, he pledged his support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people immediately after the mass shooting last summer at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. “They have been through something that nobody could ever experience,” Mr. Trump said at an event in Manchester, N.H., on June 13, 2016, delivering a hastily drafted speech that was originally intended to be about Hillary Clinton. “Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the L.G.B.T. community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?” he said. “I will tell you who the better friend is, and someday I believe that will be proven out, big-league.” Such proof did not come on Wednesday. But the president’s words were repeated with anger and frustration by a number of gay rights advocates who were angered by Mr. Trump’s abrupt decision to bar transgender people from any military job. “We’re seeing the president’s true colors,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “This is who he is.” The new ban, which Mr. Trump announced on Twitter, startling some of his aides, was at odds with the speech he gave in New Hampshire. The day before, in Orlando, Omar Mateen, a security guard, had killed 49 people and wounded 58 in the name of the Islamic State. That Mr. Mateen was a Muslim and had targeted gay and lesbian clubgoers sent shock waves through two American minority communities that have been marginalized in the United States.

"WASHINGTON — For a week, some of President Trump’s top aides have tried to talk him down from his public campaign against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It was exposing tensions within the administration, stirring consternation with the conservative base and setting off a revolt among Senate Republicans incensed over the treatment of a former colleague. Among those urging Mr. Trump to spare Mr. Sessions have been Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist; and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, according to officials who asked not to be named describing internal deliberations. For the White House, the attacks on the attorney general have touched off a serious problem on Capitol Hill when it did not need any other headaches. Senate Republicans who almost never link arms in unison against a president from their party formed a cordon around Mr. Sessions, making it clear that they neither concurred with nor would tolerate Mr. Trump’s repeated threats to the attorney general’s tenure. Senate leaders made clear they would block Mr. Trump from replacing Mr. Sessions if he tried to do so during the coming recess. “I would hope the public discussion of that would end immediately,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who said he delivered the message directly to the White House. Those sentiments were echoed publicly by at least a dozen Republican senators, including their top two leaders, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and John Cornyn of Texas. Mr. Sessions’s removal, Mr. Cornyn said, would be “incredibly disruptive.” By Wednesday afternoon, just hours after the president’s latest broadside against the attorney general, several officials said they thought the storm had passed: Mr. Trump would let Mr. Sessions stay in office, at least for now. If he were going to fire the attorney general, they said, he would have already done so. But his anger was deep, they added, and nothing was certain when it came to the volatile president. Sharing the president’s frustration have been people in his family, some of whom have come under scrutiny in the Russia investigation.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump abruptly announced a ban on transgender people serving in the military on Wednesday, blindsiding his defense secretary and Republican congressional leaders with a snap decision that reversed a year-old policy reviled by social conservatives. Mr. Trump made the declaration on Twitter, saying that American forces could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender service members. He said he had consulted generals and military experts, but Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, was given only a day’s notice about the decision. Mr. Trump elected to announce the ban in order to resolve a quietly brewing fight on Capitol Hill over whether taxpayer money should pay for gender transition and hormone therapy for transgender service members. The dispute had threatened to kill a $790 billion defense and security spending package scheduled for a vote this week. But rather than addressing that narrow issue, Mr. Trump opted to upend the entire policy on transgender service members. His decision was announced with such haste that the White House could not answer basic inquiries about how it would be carried out, including what would happen to openly transgender people on active duty. Of eight defense officials interviewed, none could say. “That’s something that the Department of Defense and the White House will have to work together as implementation takes place and is done so lawfully,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said.

"LONDON — Scrambling to combat a growing air pollution crisis, Britain announced on Wednesday that sales of new diesel and gas cars would reach the end of the road by 2040, the latest step in Europe’s battle against the damaging environmental impact of the internal combustion engine. Britain’s plans match a similar pledge made this month by France, and are part of a growing global push to curb emissions and fight climate change by promoting electric cars. Carmakers are also adjusting, with Volvo notably saying recently that it would phase out the internal combustion engine in coming years and BMW deciding to build an electric version of its popular Mini car in Britain. But the shift to electric vehicles will be a gradual one, and the target set by Britain is less ambitious than efforts elsewhere. President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord has also dented optimism. Britain’s new clean air strategy, published on Wednesday, calls for sales of new gas and diesel cars and vans to end by 2040. The government will also make more than 200 million pounds, or $260 million, available for local governments to take short-term action, such as retrofitting buses, to reduce air pollution. “It is important that we all gear up for a significant change which deals not just with the problems to health caused by emissions but the broader problems caused in terms of accelerating climate change,” Michael Gove, the country’s environment secretary, said in an interview with the BBC. “We can’t carry on with diesel and petrol cars, not just because of the health problems that they cause, but also because the emissions that they cause would mean that we would accelerate climate change.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/business/energy-environment/uk-diesel-petrol-emissions.html?searchResultPosition=97
"Good morning on this gorgeous Wednesday. If you haven’t recently stumbled upon a wedding party or two in our parks or streets, we’d be surprised. Wedding season is in full bloom. From whimsical cobblestone streets to romantic gardens to gritty alleyways, New York offers a romantic backdrop for any style of wedding photographs. We turned to Rangefinder Magazine, a publication dedicated to the world of professional wedding images, to find a few New York-based photographers to give advice. What are some of the best places in the city to take wedding or engagement photos? For a classic New York scene, the photographers suggested trying Grace Court Alley and Hunts Lane in Brooklyn Heights; the blocks where Barrow, Bedford and Commerce Streets meet in the West Village; or Freeman Alley by the Bowery. For a grittier feel, Cortlandt Alley in Chinatown (think “back alley in a superhero movie”) and Sackett Street near the Gowanus Canal were among the favorites. Where should engaged couples and newlyweds avoid? The answer among the photographers interviewed was unanimous: the High Line.

"Starboard Value has already taken on Yahoo and Macy’s. Its next target: comScore, the media measurement company. The hedge fund has amassed a 4.9 percent stake in comScore, and has now sued to force it to schedule an annual meeting, something the company has failed to do for two years. ComScore has suffered financial troubles: Last year, it had to conduct an investigation into its financial statements. The inquiry led to the resignation of several executives and the company’s delisting from the Nasdaq stock market. The company hasn’t held an annual meeting since July 21, 2015. But it has appointed several directors since then without calling an election, meaning that eight of its 12 board members were not approved by investors. Starboard, which is led by Jeffrey Smith, has become a prominent activist in recent years. It accomplished the rare feat of ousting an entire board (at Darden, the owner of Olive Garden) and helped prod Yahoo into selling its core internet operations. Worth noting: 91 activist campaigns have called for a potential sale of a company so far this year, according to Reuters, more than double the number this time last year.

"WASHINGTON — Lisa Murkowski had heard enough. As President Trump pressed her and her fellow Senate Republicans last week to fall in line behind a repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the interest of party loyalty and protecting the Republican brand, she felt compelled to speak up. “With all due respect, Mr. President,” she said, according to some of the people at the private White House lunch, “I didn’t come here to represent the Republican Party. I am representing my constituents and the state of Alaska.” Mr. Trump did not appreciate the pushback. Ms. Murkowski was one of just two members of her party to vote against a critical procedural step on Tuesday. Afterward, Mr. Trump voiced his displeasure on Twitter: “Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday,” he wrote Wednesday morning. “Too bad!” But it may be that it’s too bad for Mr. Trump, because he picked on someone unlikely to be rattled by his attack or by accusations that she deserted her fellow Republicans. Ms. Murkowski already survived a political near-death experience in 2010 when she lost a primary race to a Tea Party challenger and was essentially abandoned by the Republican Party. She won a stunning victory in a rare write-in campaign — and “Murkowski” is not all that easy to write in — returning to Washington still a Republican, but one with a well-defined independent streak and a reputation of fierce advocacy for her remote and sometimes overlooked state.

"SAN LUIS, Colo. — Each morning as the sun curves over Main Street in this isolated desert town, Felix Romero takes the worn wooden steps from his upstairs apartment to his downstairs grocery. He flips open the lock on a scratched blue door, turns on the lights and begins to sweep, just as his family has done since 1857. But R&R Market — the oldest business in Colorado, built by descendants of Spanish conquistadors in the oldest town in the state — is in danger, at the edge of closing just as rural groceries from Maine to California face similar threats to their existence. “If that little store closes, it’s going to be catastrophic,” said Bob Rael, director of the economic development council in Costilla County, where San Luis is the seat. “Reality is going to set in. Who let this happen?” Across the country, mom-and-pop markets are among the most endangered of small-town businesses, with competition from corporations and the hurdles of timeworn infrastructure pricing owners out. In Minnesota, 14 percent of nonmetropolitan groceries have closed since 2000. In Kansas, more than 20 percent of rural markets have disappeared in the past decade. Iowa lost half of its groceries between 1995 and 2005. The phenomenon is a “crisis” that is turning America’s breadbaskets into food deserts, said David E. Procter, a Kansas State University professor whose work has focused on rural food access, erasing a bedrock of local economies just as rural communities face a host of other problems.

"What the hell does Michael Moore want now? Is it not enough that for nearly 30 years, this cinematic provocateur has used his movies to harangue us about gun control, the George W. Bush administration, single-payer health care and his myriad other bleeding-heart causes?

Now Mr. Moore, this willfully disheveled, 63-year-old hybrid of Noam Chomsky and P. T. Barnum, expects theatergoers to pay Broadway ticket prices to watch him in a one-man show, “The Terms of My Surrender.” After his previous documentaries, books and television shows, does he have anything left to say, and does he really believe it will make a difference? “I am not going to take up people’s time or this valuable space to lecture people,” Mr. Moore said, sitting in the orchestra level of the Belasco Theater. “I’m not coming to this stage every night to conduct a political rally.” Instead, he said, he wants to tell stories that will make audiences feel better about this fractured nation, in a show from which they will emerge rejuvenated after a monthslong period of feeling beaten down. “This is not a kumbaya piece of theater,” he said. “I’m not looking for everyone to hold hands. I want people to leave with a sense that they’ve been moved in a profound way.” In some ways, his timing couldn’t be better. His show arrives amid a period of liberal soul searching, when any vaguely oppositional voice, whether a left-leaning columnist or late-night host, has gotten a second wind in the Trump era.

"Over the past decade, California has passed a sweeping set of climate laws to test a contentious theory: that it’s possible to cut greenhouse gas emissions far beyond what any other state has done and still enjoy robust economic growth. Now that theory faces its biggest test yet. Last August, the State Legislature set a goal of slashing emissions more than 40 percent below today’s levels by 2030, a far deeper cut than President Barack Obama proposed for the entire United States and deeper than most other countries have contemplated. So how will California pull this off? On Tuesday, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a new law expanding the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is expected to play a big role. But cutting greenhouse gases this deeply will involve more than cap and trade. The state plans to rethink every corner of its economy, from urban planning to dairy farms. No one knows yet if it can succeed. “You can think of California as a giant laboratory” for climate action, said Severin Borenstein of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. If California prevails, it could provide a model for other policy makers, even as President Trump scales back the federal government’s efforts on climate change. The state may also develop new technologies that the rest of the world can use to cut emissions. And if California falters, or if the experiment proves too costly? “Other states and countries will be watching that, too,” Mr. Borenstein said.

"WASHINGTON — David J. Apol, named by President Trump last week as the new head of the Office of Government Ethics, has repeatedly clashed with colleagues over his career at the agency as he sought to roll back or loosen ethics requirements on federal employees, including those in the White House, three former senior officials at the agency said. Mr. Apol’s former colleagues praised his intelligence and his experience as a federal government ethics lawyer at a half-dozen different agencies, including the White House, over three decades. But the tension has been building for at least a decade, during two stints Mr. Apol served at the Office of Government Ethics, his former colleagues said. Mr. Apol has argued that the agency is often too rigid in interpreting conflict-of-interest laws, they said. As recently as this spring, Mr. Apol had a disagreement with Walter M. Shaub Jr., the departing director, when Mr. Apol suggested that Derek T. Kan, then a general manager at Lyft, the car-sharing service, should not be required to sell his vested stock options in the company before he accepted a job at the Department of Transportation as the head of policy. Mr. Shaub said he overruled Mr. Apol, who has served as general counsel of the agency since 2014, arguing that many policy matters now before the Department of Transportation could affect Lyft’s financial fate — including possible actions related to self-driving cars and the car-sharing industry. “It was so immediately obviously crazy,” Mr. Shaub said. He said Mr. Apol’s general approach to government ethics was “loosey-goosey.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/david-apol-office-of-government-ethics-trump.html?searchResultPosition=107
"I am increasingly distressed by many of the things that the Trump administration is, and is not, doing. The president himself has declared that not paying taxes ‘‘makes him smart,’’ and I do not trust that my federal tax dollars will be put to good use. I want to resist the president, his cronies and their destructive agenda(s) any way I can. Assuming I am willing to bear the legal and financial risks of being audited and caught, would it be ethical for me to redirect some or all of my federal taxes to my state taxes (I trust my governor and state government much more than I trust the president and the federal government) and/or to charitable and political causes that I believe would benefit my fellow citizens? Ben, New York, N.Y. A democratic republic like ours is a shared enterprise, in which we agree to govern ourselves under a system of rules we are all willing to respect. People who have lived under military juntas — as I did when I was young — or through a period of revolutionary anarchy will tell you that the benefits of accepting the results of democratic decision-making are almost always worth the burdens. During every administration, many people are distressed by what the president does. We owe our fellow citizens who accept election results they don’t like the respect of doing the same. That means obeying the laws, even under administrations led by people we may deplore. Exceptions arise when the law that we are considering breaking is not just unwise but seriously immoral. Jim Crow laws (in flagrant violation of the post-Civil War constitutional guarantees) denied African-Americans the 14th Amendment’s promise of ‘‘equal protection of the laws.’’ Any citizen who cared to violate them was, I believe, morally free to do so. Indeed, decent citizens would have felt morally obliged to break them, where obeying them involved harm to others. And they would have been free as well to try to avoid the penalties for doing so. There are also cases in which you may violate laws that are reasonable in order to draw attention to political wrongs, as when civil protesters trespass or ignore regulations on peaceable assembly. When the point of doing so is to express your moral ideas, you have to do so in plain sight, which means you must face the legal consequences. (And you should take care not to undermine the public good, especially by causing harm to others, including the police, when you do so.) This is the classic kind of civil disobedience. The two kinds of exceptions came together during the civil rights era, when Jim Crow laws were defied in public ways. Rosa Parks didn’t merely accept the risk of being caught in the white section of the Montgomery bus; being caught was the point. Your talk of redirecting your taxes is something of a red herring. When you overpay your state taxes, the state sends you a refund. There are legal ways of reducing your federal tax burden — by giving more to charity, say — but only within set limits. What you are proposing, though, is not legal tax avoidance but illegal tax evasion, which you are hoping to get away with. That means your aim is not the public, expressive one of civil disobedience.

"At this point I think it’s fair to say that Donald Trump has gone beyond taunting and demonizing Hillary Clinton to a realm of outright obsession. He’s stalking her. He can’t stop tweeting about her. Can’t stop muttering about her. On Monday he addressed tens of thousands of boy scouts at their Jamboree, and who should pop up in his disjointed thoughts and disheveled words? Clinton. He dinged her, yet again, for having ignored voters in Michigan, which he won. The Jamboree, mind you, was in West Virginia. And it brought together dewy-eyed adolescents, not dyspeptic acolytes of the Heritage Foundation. Most cared more about — I don’t know — camping gear, crafts projects and merit badges than whether the Democratic nominee should have made an additional stop in Grand Rapids and maybe scarfed down a funnel cake in Kalamazoo while she was at it. But Trump doesn’t meet his audiences on their terms. He uses each as a sounding board for his vanities, insecurities, delusions and fixations. Clinton factors mightily into all of these. She’s his psychological dominatrix. He keeps telling us that he’s president and we’re not. Does he know that he’s president and she’s not? Does he realize that most Americans can go a whole day, an entire week — verily, a month! — without picturing her at a rostrum, hearing the melody of her stump speech or repeating, “I’m with her”?

"As Democrats try to unite around their new “Better Deal” agenda, the supposed battle between the “socialist” left and the “corporatist” center seems to have collapsed into a bland but serviceable slogan, with a reasonably progressive economic agenda that both Senators Elizabeth Warren and Charles Schumer can get behind. So much for that overhyped party civil war. But Democrats shouldn’t be trumpeting party unity quite yet. The economic-left-versus-center debate has always been primarily an elite one. Among the Democratic rank-and-file, the more consequential divide is between those willing to trust the existing establishment and those who want entirely new leadership. It’s a divide that Democratic Party leaders ignore at their peril. As part of a report I wrote for the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, I looked at divides between enthusiasts for Senator Bernie Sanders and supporters of Hillary Clinton. For many policy issues I couldn’t find much difference of note, except for a little disagreement over the benefits of foreign trade. Most Democratic voters generally agree on first principles: Economic inequality is a problem; government should do something to help the less advantaged; diversity is a strength. That’s why getting to a shared “Better Deal” agenda was relatively easy. But I did find one area of notable discord between Clinton and Sanders supporters — their degree of disaffection with political institutions. Support for the political system correlated with positive feelings toward Mrs. Clinton, while voters who felt negatively toward the political system tended to feel positively toward Mr. Sanders. Most members of the Democratic Party establishment are pragmatists who made it where they are by working within the system that exists, not the one they wish existed. They often have frustration bordering on contempt for those who lack their hardheaded realism. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/opinion/democrats-divided-new-plan.html?searchResultPosition=110

"WASHINGTON — President Trump attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions yet again on Wednesday, extending a campaign against Mr. Sessions with what has become near-daily insults and criticism, both in private and in public. Mr. Trump has made clear that his frustration with Mr. Sessions, the former Alabama senator who was one of his earliest campaign supporters, stems from the attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and whether Mr. Trump’s associates conspired with Russia. The pattern has fueled suspicion that Mr. Trump is trying to bully Mr. Sessions into resigning — and might fire him if he does not leave voluntarily — in order to clear the way for a replacement who would take control of that investigation. Here is a breakdown of possible legal and procedural paths such a maneuver could take. While most executive branch officials can be fired at will, the special counsel leading the Trump-Russia investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, is protected by Justice Department regulations. They say he can be “removed from office only by the personal action of the attorney general” and only for “good cause,” such as misconduct. Because Mr. Sessions is recused, his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, is the acting attorney general for that inquiry. He appointed and oversees Mr. Mueller. While Mr. Trump also nominated Mr. Rosenstein, a former United States attorney, he has vowed to “defend the integrity” of the investigation, including by refusing to fire Mr. Mueller without good cause. If Mr. Trump were to order Mr. Mueller fired and Mr. Rosenstein refused — and then resigned or was himself fired by Mr. Trump — it could set up a repetition of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, in which Richard M. Nixon’s search for a Justice Department official willing to fire the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal prompted a cascade of resignations. That would increase political risks for Mr. Trump. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/trump-jeff-sessions.html?searchResultPosition=71
"In just a few hours on Tuesday, President Trump made seven misleading statements: about Middle East politics, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon; about veterans affairs reforms, in remarks to “American heroes”; and about jobs and health care, to supporters in Ohio. Here’s an assessment. Hezbollah is a Shiite militant group that the United States has classified as a terrorist organization since 1997. Its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has drawn criticism from Mr. Hariri. But Hezbollah is also a popular political party in Lebanon. The group counts Lebanon’s president, Michel Aoun, as a staunch ally and has been fighting against the Islamic State in neighboring Syria. David Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs, announced in early June that his agency would adopt the Defense Department’s electronic health records system. Negotiations over pricing and how to carry out the change, according to Mr. Shulkin, are expected to last three to six months. “This journey is just beginning for V.A.,” the department said in a June 28 blog post. The United States has added 1.1 million jobs in 2017, but it’s a stretch for the new president to take credit for almost half of them. About 216,000 jobs were added in January, before Mr. Trump took office. The 232,000 jobs estimate for February came three weeks into Mr. Trump’s presidency. Mr. Trump has proposed a $54 billion increase — about a 10 percent rise — in the Pentagon’s budget over last year’s spending. There have been at least 10 larger increases to the base defense budget since the 1977 fiscal year, including four since 2002. Factoring in war spending, there have been 27 years since 1940 in which military spending was as high as or higher than the proposed increase. As a percentage of gross domestic product, there have been roughly 35 years in which military spending matched or surpassed what Mr. Trump is calling for.

"President Trump’s announcement on Twitter Wednesday morning that transgender people would be barred from the United States military “in any capacity” marked a sudden reversal of a policy that had evolved rapidly under the Obama White House. Here is a look at The New York Times’s coverage of the events leading to the lifting of the transgender ban in June 2016, and what has happened since. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said that the military should “continually” review its prohibition on transgender people in the armed forces. “Every qualified American who wants to serve our country should have an opportunity if they fit the qualifications and can do it,” Mr. Hagel said in an interview. At the time, Defense Department guidelines written decades earlier described transgender people as sexual deviants. President Barack Obama, who in 2011 had repealed the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that banned openly gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from serving in the military, had refrained from commenting on transgender people in the armed forces, even as he had been pressured on the issue by activists for L.G.B.T. rights.

"An article in this week’s Sunday Review, “Donald Trump’s Plan to Save Western Civilization” by Stephen Wertheim, a historian at King’s College at the University of Cambridge, argued that in his first six months in office, President Trump has put forward the outlines of a foreign policy doctrine, one focused on the “defense” of “Western civilization.” Professor Wertheim’s article attracted hundreds of comments on nytimes.com and hundreds more on social media. Max Strasser, a staff editor in The New York Times Opinion section, and Professor Wertheim discussed the article and how readers responded to it. Max Strasser: So your article got a lot of criticism in the comments and on social media, huh? Stephen Wertheim: It did. Lots of positive reactions, but lots of critical ones, too. Max: It seems like the No. 1 problem that people had was that you took Trump too seriously. Angie B. summarized a lot of readers’ objections when she wrote that your piece ”presupposes that there is some coherent foreign policy, however misconceived, animating his administration. But there really isn’t.” Why do you think so many people raised this concern? Stephen: Yes, that was the big objection. And because I took Trump seriously, a lot of people (though not Angie B.) read the piece as a defense of Trump — a reaction I didn’t expect. I think that people — at least in the center and on the left — want Trump to be outside of history. They want him cast outside of public life as soon as possible. It’s a continuation from the campaign, a desperate attempt to preserve pre-Trump “normality.” You see it in the “This is not normal” slogan. And yes, much is new and weird and shocking about Trump. I noted in the piece that he may be pathbreaking in retreating from even the rhetoric of promoting democracy and human rights. But we need to take him seriously — especially his administration and supporters. He wouldn’t be president today if he hadn’t tapped into a powerful politics, what I called the “politics of civilization.” In fact, he is dangerous precisely because he makes it hard to take his politics seriously. He inspires a Pavlovian ridicule. But that reflex to ridicule is allowing some people to avoid trying to understand his policies and to avoid developing a real critique of them. It makes them read a sober analysis of Trump as an endorsement! That really concerns me. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/opinion/did-we-take-trump-too-seriously.html?searchResultPosition=89
"MOSCOW — Russian legislators called on Wednesday for “painful” measures against the United States in response to plans for new American sanctions, while the Kremlin focused more on the damage to relations between Washington and Moscow. Apart from demanding a tough response, many in Russia declared dead any hope for improved relations with Washington under a Trump administration, and there were suggestions that European pique over the proposed measures created an opening for an anti-American alliance. Dmitri S. Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, noted that the proposed American law was still a draft. The House and the Senate must reconcile their versions before submitting it for President Trump’s signature. Any substantial response by Mr. Putin would require more study, Mr. Peskov said. Using one of Mr. Trump’s favorite adjectives in describing the law, he said, “In the meantime, it can be said that the news is quite sad with regard to Russia-U.S. relations and prospects for their development.” He added that it was “no less depressing with regard to the international law and international commercial relations.” Similar sentiments emerged from several European capitals. In Paris, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the new sanctions, targeting Iran and North Korea as well as Russia, appeared to contradict international law because of their global reach. There is concern in Europe that the American sanctions could ripple through the energy market because they target companies that contribute to the development, maintenance or modernization of the pipelines exporting Russian energy.

"On a remote pass through Himalayan peaks, China and India, two nuclear-armed nations, have come near the brink of conflict over an unpaved road. It is one of the worst border disputes between the regional rivals in more than 30 years. The road stands on territory at the point where China, India and Bhutan meet. The standoff began last month when Bhutan, a close ally of India, discovered Chinese workers trying to extend the road. India responded by sending troops and equipment to halt the construction. China, the more powerful of the two, angrily denounced the move and demanded that India pull back. Now soldiers from the two powers are squaring off, separated by only a few hundred feet. The conflict shows no sign of abating, and it reflects the swelling ambition — and nationalism — of both countries. Each is governed by a muscular leader eager to bolster his domestic standing while asserting his country’s place on the world stage as the United States recedes from a leading role. Jeff M. Smith, a scholar at the American Foreign Policy Council who studies Indian-Chinese relations, said a negotiated settlement was the likeliest outcome. But asked whether he thought the standoff could spiral into war, he said, “Yes I do — and I don’t say that lightly.” Both sides have taken hard-line positions that make it difficult to back down. “The messaging is eerily similar,” Mr. Smith said, to the countries’ 1962 slide into a war that was also over border disputes. On the surface, the dispute turns on whether the land belongs to China or Bhutan. It is only about 34 square miles, but it is pivotal in the growing competition between China and India over Asia’s future.

"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department imposed financial sanctions on a host of current and former senior Venezuelan officials on Wednesday and threatened to take more stringent action if President Nicolás Maduro proceeds with plans for a constituent assembly on Sunday that critics consider a danger to democracy. Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, ordered assets in the United States frozen for 13 well-connected Venezuelan figures and barred Americans from doing business with them. Among those targeted by the administration were the interior minister and heads of the army, police and national guard, as well as government officials involved in the coming assembly. “As President Trump has made clear, the United States will not ignore the Maduro regime’s ongoing efforts to undermine democracy, freedom and the rule of law,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement. “As our sanctions demonstrate, the United States is standing by the Venezuelan people in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy.” In a conference call with reporters, administration officials urged Mr. Maduro to cancel the Sunday assembly or face tougher actions. Among the possible options could be measures targeting oil sales. “Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential U.S. sanctions,” Mr. Mnuchin added in his statement. The constituent assembly elections planned for the weekend are seen by critics as a way to cement Mr. Maduro’s hold on power by rewriting the constitution and possibly dissolving state institutions. Protests against the government have led to arrests and violence. The administration cited opposition estimates that as many as 15,000 civilians had been wounded in recent protests and over 3,000 arrested, with 431 political prisoners still behind bars. The administration also cited accusations of torture and other human rights abuses by the Venezuelan security services. Among those hit with sanctions on Wednesday were Nestor Luis Reverol Torres, the minister of interior, justice and peace; Carlos Alfredo Perez Ampueda, the national director of the Bolivarian National Police; Sergio Jose Rivero Marcano, commander general of the Bolivarian National Guard; and Jesus Rafael Suarez Chourio, the general commander of the Bolivarian Army. The Treasury took aim at Venezuela’s ombudsman, the head of the presidential commission for the constituent assembly and the president of the National Electoral Council as well. The sanctions also targeted economic figures, including the president of the National Center for Foreign Commerce, which sets the official exchange rate and was described by the Treasury Department as a “significant engine of corruption in Venezuela.” The move won support across the aisle in Washington. “Today’s announcement of sanctions against 13 senior government and military officials is an important step to hold Venezuela’s leaders accountable for their actions,” Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said in a statement. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/world/americas/venezuela-sanctions-treasury.html?searchResultPosition=86

"So far, President Trump has not succeeded in his plans to steal health insurance from tens of millions of people, break up families by deporting millions of would-be Americans, enrich his fellow 1 percenters with new tax breaks and bar immigrants from entering the country because of their religion. But you’ve got to start somewhere, so today he settled for punishing a few thousand patriots who want to serve their country in the military. Cutting off a review by the Pentagon of a 2016 decision to allow transgender men and woman to join the armed forces, Trump announced (on Twitter, of course, because it’s vital to reduce all of his thoughts to short outbursts on social media) that he “will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.” The decision, which prompted congratulatory comments from his supporters on the far right, was camouflaged as a carefully considered effort to ensure the military is at its full fighting potential. Trump said in his tweets that he took this step “after consultation with my generals and military experts.” (Foolishly, I had thought they were still America’s generals, and not the personal minions of the temporary occupant of the Oval Office.) But those very same generals, represented by the secretary of defense, James Mattis, said last month that they would need six more months to study the idea of allowing transgender people to enlist.

They see that you are willing to do the job, and you can do it, and they are fine with that.

Mr. Sessions’s nationalist and extremist conservatism is abhorrent to me, and I should enjoy watching him get pilloried by Mr. Trump — but I don’t. He is the attorney general and deserves at least the respect of his office from the man who appointed him.

"It’s heartening to see that President Trump’s weeklong, passive-aggressive assault on his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has crossed a line even for many of the president’s most stalwart supporters. Rush Limbaugh called Mr. Trump’s behavior “unseemly” on his radio show Monday. Of Mr. Sessions he said, “I hate to see him being treated this way.” Over in the Trump-friendly confines of Fox News, Tucker Carlson said the president’s humiliation of the attorney general was “a useless, self-destructive act,” and Mr. Carlson implored Mr. Trump: “For God’s sake, lay off Jeff Sessions. He’s your friend, one of the very few you have in Washington.” Meanwhile, Republican senators lined up to defend Mr. Sessions and to suggest, ever so gently, that Mr. Trump might want to reconsider his approach. We can’t disagree with any of this, although we’re puzzled by the sense of surprise. Mr. Trump’s debasement of Mr. Sessions — starting with a mind-boggling interview he gave last week to The Times — is in line with everything he’s said and done since he fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director, in May, in an inept attempt to shut down the bureau’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Mr. Trump has been unpredictable in many things, but he has been utterly consistent when it comes to resisting any inquiry, however warranted and public-spirited, into his campaign or his close associates. Mr. Trump’s gratuitous, schoolyard abuse of Mr. Sessions is nonetheless breathtaking.

"Skinny is often read as good today. We like skinny jeans, skinny models and, apparently, skinny health reform. It is likely that the Senate, which has just rejected repeal-and-replace and repeal-without-replace bills, will vote on a “skinny repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. What does this actually mean, and what would it produce? The proposal most often labeled “skinny” would repeal the insurance mandate for individuals and larger employers under the banner of choice and freedom — both standard objectives of conservatives. It also would repeal taxes on medical-device manufacturers and, perhaps, also on insurers, with the goal of reducing the costs that must be reflected in premiums. On the surface, both of those changes seem modest and reasonable. But I can assure Congress, as a former insurance company chief executive, that they would lead to a bloated upscale version of the Medicaid expansion so hated by conservatives. The result would be not only the loss of coverage for millions of people but also an even bigger bill for the government to pick up. You have to look at the dynamics of the insurance market to understand this. To survive, an insurer has to predict the risk of costly claims and to obtain sufficient enrollment to balance customers who need a lot of health care with enrollees who have few or no claims. This works because while an insurer can’t know the timing or severity of illness for an individual, it can estimate the average claims of a group of individuals fairly well. In health care, some individual needs are predictable — young people use less, and those with chronic conditions demand more. The only way to obtain a reasonable average is to have a broad pool, like the employees of a company covered by a group plan. The individual market never had this natural grouping, so premiums varied widely, as did coverage, if it was available at all. The Obamacare individual mandate was intended to produce a representative group and to keep average premiums in bounds.

It starts today in Wisconsin.” The company did not identify exactly where the plant would be built but said it would be in Mr. Ryan’s district in southeastern Wisconsin.

"Last week the White House told a lie. It was a small lie and, given the epic scale of this administration’s mendacity, an inconsequential one. It just happened to be about me. On Thursday I interviewed Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo on a public stage at the Aspen Security Forum. We covered everything from Russian meddling in the U.S. election to the war in Syria and the nuclear deal with Iran. The director also broke some policy ground with a veiled suggestion that the administration might pursue regime change in North Korea. There was one sour moment. Midway through the interview, Pompeo abruptly slammed The New York Times for publishing the name last month of a senior covert C.I.A. officer, calling the disclosure “unconscionable.” The line was met with audience applause. I said, “You’re talking about Phil Agee,” and then repeated the name. Pompeo replied, “I don’t know that name,” and the interview moved on. My startled rejoinder was not a reference to the covert C.I.A. officer unmasked by The Times, but rather a fumbled attempt to refer to the law governing such disclosures. Philip Agee, as Pompeo and everyone in the audience knew, was the infamous C.I.A. officer who went rogue in the 1970s, wrote a tell-all memoir, and publicly identified the names of scores of C.I.A. officers, front companies and foreign agents. His disclosures led Congress in 1982 to pass the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, a.k.a. the “Anti-Agee Act,” which made it a federal crime to reveal the names of covert agents. Agee died in Havana in 2008. If I could have a do-over, I would have recalled the name of the law itself, not the man after whom it was informally named. I might have asked Pompeo why the government didn’t just put the law to the constitutional test by suing The Times. L’esprit de l’escalier: I plead guilty. What I didn’t do is disclose the name of any covert officer — nor would I have, since I disagree with The Times’s decision to publish it.

"LONDON — Scrambling to combat a growing air pollution crisis, Britain announced on Wednesday that sales of new diesel and gas cars would reach the end of the road by 2040, the latest step in Europe’s battle against the damaging environmental impact of the internal combustion engine. Britain’s plans match a similar pledge made this month by France, and are part of a growing global push to curb emissions and fight climate change by promoting electric cars. Carmakers are also adjusting, with Volvo notably saying recently that it would phase out the internal combustion engine in the coming years and BMW deciding to build an electric version of its popular Mini car in Britain. But the shift to electric vehicles will be a gradual one, and the target set by Britain is less ambitious than some of the efforts elsewhere. President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord has also dented optimism. Britain’s new clean air strategy, published on Wednesday, calls for sales of new gas and diesel cars and vans to end by 2040. The government will also make 255 million pounds, or $332 million, available for local governments to take short-term action, such as retrofitting buses, to reduce air pollution. “It is important that we all gear up for a significant change which deals not just with the problems to health caused by emissions, but the broader problems caused in terms of accelerating climate change,” Michael Gove, the country’s environment secretary, told the BBC. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, promised a “green revolution in transport,” adding that the government wanted nearly every car and van on Britain’s roads to have zero emissions by 2050.

"COLORADO SPRINGS — Joining the Navy was one of the best decisions Alec Kerry said she had ever made. The other was coming out as transgender. “The Navy taught me how people can come together and work hard to achieve something bigger than themselves,” said Petty Officer Kerry, 24, who is training to operate nuclear reactors and soon plans to adopt the name Eva. “Strangely enough, I think what the Navy taught us about integrity was what gave me the courage to come out. I had to be honest about who I was with myself and the people I served with.” Like thousands of other transgender veterans and members of the military, she grappled with a mix of anger, sadness and fear on Wednesday after President Trump tweeted that the United States military would no longer “accept or allow” transgender people to serve — a surprise move that came a year after the Obama administration permitted transgender troops to serve openly. Some transgender troops were left to wonder if they would face a quick discharge from the military or if scheduled medical appointments would be canceled. And nearly all expressed dismay at what they saw as a misguided action that could purge the military of untold numbers of highly skilled and dedicated service members, bringing back an era when many troops lived in secrecy and shame. Petty Officer Kerry, who has been taking estrogen for months, said starting to become a woman lifted a cloud that allowed her to perform better at work, but now she is likely to have to stop treatment.

"WASHINGTON — Congress’s push to enact far-reaching sanctions against Russia appeared to overcome a final obstacle on Wednesday after a key Senate Republican backed off concerns about a House bill — passed overwhelmingly one day earlier — that would also punish North Korea. Earlier on Wednesday, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested he had reservations about taking up the House version of a bill that would punish Russia, Iran and North Korea. Last month, the Senate passed its own bill, nearly unanimously, but it was aimed only at Russia and Iran. “We expressed concerns about it,” Mr. Corker said of the addition of North Korea to the House plan, citing a desire for greater Senate input before placing new sanctions on the reclusive country. “They decided to add it. I don’t take affront.” Hours later, Mr. Corker said the Senate would move to approve the House version after all, but demanded that House leaders “expeditiously consider and pass enhancements to the North Korea language, which multiple members of the Senate hope to make in the very near future.” Some hurdles remain. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said it was not yet clear if the Senate would approve and send the bill to President Trump’s desk before lawmakers leave for the August recess. The conflict over North Korea sanctions had been the latest detour in the legislation’s halting journey through the Capitol. As the Trump administration lobbied against a measure that would sharply limit the president’s ability to lift or suspend sanctions against Russia on his own, the bill languished in the House for weeks.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump publicly attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions for a third consecutive day on Wednesday, questioning why Mr. Sessions has not fired the acting director of the F.B.I. over his wife’s political ties to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump has already criticized the deputy F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, who took over the agency when Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the previous director. Mr. McCabe has remained in place while the president’s nominee to run the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, goes through the confirmation process. By adding Mr. McCabe to a growing list of what the president views as Mr. Sessions’s management failures, Mr. Trump spurred more speculation on Wednesday that he was considering firing his attorney general, one of the earliest supporters in Washington of Mr. Trump’s bid for the White House. The new White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, said on CNN on Wednesday that he did not know whether the president wanted a new attorney general. Mr. Trump began his public assault on Mr. Sessions last week in an interview with The New York Times. The president said he never would have appointed Mr. Sessions had he known Mr. Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. In the same interview, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. McCabe had his own conflict of interest. Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, received nearly $500,000 in 2015 for a state Senate run in Virginia from a political action committee affiliated with Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, who is close friends with Hillary and Bill Clinton. Ms. McCabe lost the race. Mr. Trump repeated his suggestion about Mr. McCabe in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Mr. Trump did not raise this concern about Mr. McCabe publicly in May when he interviewed him as a candidate to be the new F.B.I. director.

"On July 16, more than seven million Venezuelans voted in a plebiscite that emphatically rejected President Nicolás Maduro’s plans to convene a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the Constitution. It was a remarkable showing for a D.I.Y. electoral event and included robust, if nervous, turnout in the working-class districts that were once strongholds for Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez. Since the plebiscite, Venezuela’s opposition has taken steps toward establishing a parallel government. This might remain a symbolic initiative. But if the opposition continues down this road, itwill soon be looking for international recognition and funding, and will at least implicitly be asserting the parallel government’s claim to the legitimate monopoly on the use of force. After that itwill seek what every government wants: weapons to defend itself. If it succeeds, Venezuela could plunge into a civil war that will make the current conflict seem like high school fisticuffs. It is hard to blame the opposition for considering the path of parallel government. Almost four months of street protests against Mr. Maduro’s dictatorship have resulted in 100 deaths. Hopes that the Organization of American States could enforce its Democratic Charter have been repeatedly dashed. And the Maduro government, with a Leninist tenacity that sees struggle as the opportunity to consolidate its project, refuses to withdraw its plans. The response of the Trump administration has been to suggest that it is looking to add names to the existing program of United States sanctions, and is considering broader economic sanctions. But such unilateral sanctions will almost certainly make Venezuela’s already dire situation worse. Extending the list of Venezuelan officials who are under United States sanctions will only help the Venezuelan government solidify its inner circle. The seven people put on the sanctions list in 2015 have become indispensable players at the highest levels in the regime, as has Vice President Tareck El Aissami, placed on the list in February. The one high-level official who has broken with the Maduro government, Attorney General Luisa Ortega, has had her actions completely neutralized by a Supreme Court whose core members were added to the list in May. One of the people apparently next to be added is Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López. He has long been considered a potential weak link within the regime and has been treated with some suspicion by Mr. Maduro. If Mr. Padrino is put on the list, the president will be able to count on his loyalty to the very end.

"The Justice Department has filed court papers arguing that a major federal civil rights law does not protect employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation, taking a stand against a decision reached under President Barack Obama. The department’s move to insert itself into a federal case in New York was an unusual example of top officials in Washington intervening in court in what is an important but essentially private dispute between a worker and his boss over gay rights issues. “The sole question here is whether, as a matter of law, Title VII reaches sexual orientation discrimination,” the Justice Department said in a friend-of-the-court brief, citing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination in the workplace based on “race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” “It does not, as has been settled for decades. Any efforts to amend Title VII’s scope should be directed to Congress rather than the courts.” The department filed its brief on Wednesday, the same day President Trump announced on Twitter that transgender people would be banned from serving in the military, raising concerns among civil rights activists that the Trump administration was trying to undermine lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights won under previous administrations. The filing came in a discrimination case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit involving Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor. In 2010, Mr. Zarda was fired by his employer, a Long Island company called Altitude Express. Before taking a female client on a tandem dive, Mr. Zarda told the woman he was gay to assuage any awkwardness that might arise from his being tightly strapped to her during the jump. The woman’s husband complained to the company, which subsequently fired Mr. Zarda. Mr. Zarda then sued Altitude Express, claiming it had violated Title VII. Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department has now stepped into the fray. In its brief, the department noted that every Congress since 1974 has declined to add a sexual-orientation provision to Title VII, despite what it called “notable changes in societal and cultural attitudes.” The brief also said that the federal government, as the largest employer in the country, had a “substantial and unique interest” in the proper interpretation of Title VII.

"HOHENFELS, Germany — My eyes welled with tears of happiness, and I cried as I had never cried before. For 20 years, I fought against who I am. But that day was the closest I ever felt to freedom. It was June 30, 2016, and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter had just announced an end to the United States military’s ban on transgender service. My name is Jennifer Sims. I am a United States Army captain and a transgender woman who has served my country with distinction for more than six years. I am speaking for myself here, not on behalf of the Army or the government, but I suspect my feelings resonate with other transgender service members. Every transgender person has a different story. For me, growing up in Florida and Minnesota, I never felt right as a boy, struggling to conform to what that meant. It was before the internet and smartphones were everywhere, so I never heard the word “transgender” or had any way to look up confidentially what I was feeling. I thought it was simply a phase I was going through. Like many transgender women before they come out, I tried to act as masculine as I could. I played every sport possible, and always tried to be the strongest, fastest boy on the playground. My family has a history of military service, so I told people my dream was to be in the Army. What could be manlier than joining the military? In my sophomore year at Florida Atlantic University, I joined Army R.O.T.C. I also finally began to accept myself, but I didn’t come to the conclusion that I am transgender until 2010, almost a year after I had committed to an Army R.O.T.C. scholarship. My choices were simple, yet complex: serve the nation or serve myself. On the one hand, I no longer felt the need to act supermasculine in my life, and I saw a path forward. On the other, I saw a nation at war and I wanted to help. In the end, I couldn’t resist the call to serve. In 2011, I graduated and accepted my commission as a second lieutenant in the Army. Eight months later, I was in Afghanistan managing communications for an aviation task force in Zabul Province.

"MOBILE, Ala. — Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions, the Queens-born developer and the Alabama lawyer, are finding that similar positions on political issues can mask deep differences on underlying principles. For Mr. Trump, who has excoriated his attorney general on Twitter and reportedly discussed firing him, what matters most is personal loyalty to him, or rather loyalty to whatever he thinks his needs are at any particular moment. For Mr. Sessions, fealty to the law trumps all. For Republicans nationwide, it’s an acid test: side with a mercurial president who demands devotion, or with the attorney general, who insists on probity and the letter of the law. If there’s one thing you need to know about Mr. Sessions, it’s that he reveres the Constitution, as he understands it. He was the author, in his first Senate term, of a law that established a commission to commemorate the 250th birthday of the “father of the Constitution,” James Madison, in 2001, and to use it as an occasion for constitutional and civic education. Mr. Sessions introduced Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist at the birthday gala, and personally convened a symposium of Madisonian scholars that met in conjunction with it. For better or worse, Mr. Sessions sees the world in black-and-white, law-and-order terms — criminals on one side and trustworthy law enforcement on the other. That’s one reason he has re-expanded the use of civil asset forfeiture, drawing intense (and deserved) criticism from across the political spectrum. He takes the same approach with illegal narcotics. This same worldview explains why he so readily recused himself from the Russia investigation; for him, this was a simple procedural question. In Senate testimony he accurately described the effective meaning of the regulation that governed his recusal: “Department employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign adviser.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/opinion/donald-trump-jeff-sessions-alabama.html?searchResultPosition=41
"Cars have become rolling listening posts. They can track phone calls and texts, log queries to websites, record what radio stations you listen to — even tell you when you are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limit. Automakers, local governments, retailers, insurers and tech companies are eager to leverage this information, especially as cars transform from computers on wheels into something more like self-driving shuttles. And they want to tap into even more data, including what your car’s video cameras see as you travel down a street. Who gets what information and for what purposes? Here is a primer. Government rules limit how event data recorders — the black boxes in cars that record information such as speed and seatbelt position in the seconds before, during and after a crash — can be used. But no single law in the United States covers all the data captured by all the other devices in automobiles. Those devices include radar sensors, diagnostic systems, in-dash navigation systems and built-in cellular connections. Newer cars may record a driver’s eye movements, the weight of people in the front seats and whether the driver’s hands are on the wheel. Smartphones connected to the car, and those not connected to the car, can also track your activities, including any texting while driving. There are few rules or laws in the United States that govern what data can be collected and used by companies. (An exception is medical information.) The United States generally does not ensure that companies strip out names or other personal details, or stipulate how such information should be used, for example. Typically, a driver agrees to be tracked and monitored by checking off a box on one of the user agreement forms needed to register a car’s in-dash system or a navigation app. In most cases, the driver must agree to such terms to use an app or service.

"Earlier this month, Energy Secretary Rick Perry spoke by phone for more than 20 minutes with a man he thought was Volodymyr Groysman, the prime minister of Ukraine. They talked about coal exports and sanctions against Russia, the Paris climate accord and a Russian natural gas project. By all accounts, the tone of the conversation was positive. The only problem was that Mr. Perry was not actually talking with the prime minister of Ukraine. Like several other politicians and public figures before him, Mr. Perry, whose department manages the United States’ nuclear program, had been duped by international pranksters. In this case, it was Vladimir Krasnov and Alexei Stolyarov, a pair of comedians known as the Jerky Boys of Russia. It all made for a snicker-worthy story when the audio was posted online. But Mr. Perry was not alone in falling for a high-profile prank call. Here are a few other victims. On Nov. 1, 2008, just a few days before Barack Obama defeated Senator John McCain in the presidential election, Sarah Palin, Mr. McCain’s running mate, received a call from a Canadian comedian posing as President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. Ms. Palin, then the governor of Alaska, spoke at length with the prankster, Marc-Antoine Audette, one half of a pair known as the Masked Avengers. She said that she and Mr. Sarkozy “could have a lot of fun” hunting together, and promised to “be a careful shot” after Mr. Audette brought up then Vice President Dick Cheney’s accidental shooting of a friend in 2006, which happened on a hunting trip. Mr. Audette even got her to weigh in on the appearance of Mr. Sarkozy’s wife, Carla, a former model who he said was “so good in bed.” Ms. Palin responded: “You know, I look forward to working with you and getting to meet you personally, and your beautiful wife.

"With three tweets, the leader of the largest employer in the country just tried to lay off all trans people in the military. Many service members who were just told “we want you” are suddenly being told “go away.” The sudden reversal by the administration, from allowing trans people to serve openly in the military to outright banning us, is a devastating blow to our livelihoods, our basic humanity, our survival. It is also a devastating blow to the entire credibility of the United States military for years to come. This is all painfully familiar. Once upon a time, I was denied the ability to even exist as who I am. I had to hide. I had to be in the closet. I had to lie to people I stood next to. I had to virtually eradicate my own existence from myself. I served as a gay person under “don’t ask, don’t tell,” and also as a trans person under the ban on open transgender service. I came out as trans only during my years working as an analyst in the Army. So, here we are again. After years of advocacy, research, experts’ weighing-in, lives lost, we made progress. And now, again, we are hurtling backward. We are risking our credibility, our legitimacy as a nation and, again, risking the lives of so many people who are listening and watching, and who are already serving. There is a lot of hurt. There is a lot of fear. Trans people even outside the military are terrified about what this means for the rest of us. Terrible discriminatory laws targeting trans people are proposed all across the country, and now the commander in chief of the armed forces is propagating lies about us, dehumanizing us and taking away our health care and employment. What does this mean? Well, for now we don’t exactly know, since it is clear that the president’s tweets were not exactly well thought out. But it could mean that trans people will have to pack up and go home for pretty much no reason other than “you can’t stay here.” For no other reason than, we feel like using you as political pawns today, or we don’t understand you, or you simply are not welcome here.

"WASHINGTON — Transgender people can continue to serve in the military for now, Pentagon leaders said on Thursday, scrambling to clarify the confusion surrounding President Trump’s abrupt announcement a day earlier that transgender people would no longer be accepted or allowed in uniform. In a letter to the military service chiefs, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the policy on who is allowed to serve would not change until the White House sends the Defense Department new rules and the secretary of defense issues new guidelines. “In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,” General Dunford said in the letter. Dana White, the chief Pentagon spokeswoman, said the Defense Department would provide detailed guidance in the “near future” on how Mr. Trump’s tweets will be turned into policy. The open-ended nature of their comments reflected the challenge facing the Pentagon: how to put in place a policy that was announced without a plan to do so. In announcing a reversal of previous policy in three tweets, Mr. Trump upended years of debate at the Pentagon over how to treat men and women in the military who do not identify with the gender that they appeared at birth. Lawmakers and stakeholders in both parties said that making such a sudden announcement without a plan to carry it out demonstrated the folly of Mr. Trump’s attempt to govern by tweet.

"There has been much ado over the past few months about the declarations of fashion designers regarding the current administration, but they are not the only members of the fashion world who have been politicized by the actions of President Trump. The outdoor apparel sector is also stepping into the spotlight. On Thursday thousands of members of the outdoor recreation industry in Salt Lake City for the Outdoor Retailer trade show will “pour out of the Salt Palace and march to the Capitol building in celebration and appreciation of public lands,” in the words of one of the rally’s organizers, Peter Metcalf, the founder and a former chief executive of Black Diamond Equipment. The crowd may not match the hordes that made the Women’s March in January so powerful, but it will be a singular event. That is because it involves not just the specialized brands beloved by outdoor recreation enthusiasts, but also those with names that resonate throughout the general population: REI, the North Face and Adidas Outdoor. Spurred by the actions of Patagonia, a company with a history of vocally tying its morals to its bottom line, they are publicly putting their positions where their polypropylene pants are. “We realized somebody had to start making their voice heard,” said Greg Thomsen, managing director of Adidas Outdoor USA. “In my 40 years in the industry I have never seen the industry galvanized in such a way before.” At issue: an executive order by President Trump in April directing the Department of the Interior to review the status of 27 national monuments created since 1996 and make recommendations to him, possibly rescinding or shrinking the designation of what is now federally protected land.

"A year after transgender Americans secured the right to defend their nation as equals in the military service, President Trump, in one of his crueler series of tweets, declared on Wednesday that he was banishing them from serving. This was obvious pandering to regressive generals and right-wing zealots as well as an effort to shift the focus from his dysfunctional White House. “After consultation with my Generals and military experts,” he announced with Caesarean certitude, “please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” Adding insult to injury, Mr. Trump, who secured a Vietnam draft deferment for bone spurs, said the military “must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory” — as if transgender enlistees would be feeble wimps after volunteering for battle. Transgender troops were quickly defended by Senator John McCain for “serving honorably today,” and by another Republican, Senator Orrin Hatch, who said, “Transgender people are people, and deserve the best we can do for them.” The about-face on a basic human rights issue was not entirely unexpected. Last month, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis delayed for six months the Obama administration’s July 1 deadline for admitting transgender recruits. Mr. Mattis said more review was needed on how they would affect “readiness and lethality” of military forces. Vice President Mike Pence’s staff reportedly worked with conservative House Republicans to try to bar payment for transition surgery and hormone therapy. In his tweets, Mr. Trump contended transgender troops would burden the military with “tremendous medical costs and disruption.” But this is unsubstantiated nonsense. The Obama policy required individuals to “have been stable in their preferred gender” for at least 18 months and to have completed the transition medical treatment they expected to have. Mr. Trump’s rationale is particularly absurd, considering there are estimated to be only about 2,450 transgender troops among 1.3 million active-duty members of the military, according to a RAND Corporation study. A year ago, the military tradition of treating transgender individuals as perverts seemed at an end when the Obama administration made gender identity a protected category in the Pentagon’s equal opportunity policy. The administration also ended the ban on gay recruits, opened all combat roles to women and named the first openly gay Army secretary. How much deeper a retreat might Mr. Trump demand from these enlightened policies? Mr. Mattis, while given high marks as a military leader, was close-mouthed on the transgender issue during his confirmation hearing. A 2016 book he co-edited warned that new social standards imposed by political leaders “are diminishing the combat power of our military.” So what will be the fate of those already in uniform? Will they be hounded from service? That the White House could not even answer such questions on Wednesday demonstrates how thoughtless and cruel this policy is.

"WASHINGTON — The Senate in the early hours of Friday morning rejected a new, scaled-down Republican plan to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, derailing the Republicans’ seven-year campaign to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature health care law and dealing a huge political setback to President Trump. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who just this week returned to the Senate after receiving a diagnosis of brain cancer, cast the decisive vote to defeat the proposal, joining two other Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, in opposing it. The 49-to-51 vote was also a humiliating setback for the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has nurtured his reputation as a master tactician and spent the last three months trying to devise a repeal bill that could win support from members of his caucus. As the clock ticked toward the final vote, which took place around 1:30 a.m., suspense built on the Senate floor. Mr. McCain was engaged in a lengthy, animated conversation with Vice President Mike Pence, who had come to the Capitol prepared to cast the tiebreaking vote for the measure. A few minutes later, when Mr. McCain ambled over to the Democratic side of the chamber, he was embraced by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. A little later Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, put her arm around Mr. McCain.

Expressions of admiration and appreciation from writers and readers alike mingled with the occasional sigh of relief from those whose work she had not viewed favorably — a verdict she never shied away from sharing with readers. “A rave review from Michiko Kakutani has been the equivalent of a badge of honor — it’s the ultimate endorsement for a serious writer,” said Jonathan Karp, the publisher of Simon & Schuster. “She has been greatly respected and greatly feared.” The Times also announced Thursday that Parul Sehgal, a senior editor and columnist at its Book Review, would join Dwight Garner and Jennifer Senior as one of the paper’s book critics. Ms. Kakutani started her career covering cultural news at The Times in 1979 and became a book critic in 1983. She was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 1998.

"News Update: The Senate rejected a scaled-down Republican plan to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act in the early hours of Friday morning. Senator John McCain cast the decisive vote to defeat the proposal. The Senate considers itself an august body of statesmen. But on Thursday it became a theater of the absurd when three top Republicans said they would vote for a health care bill only if House leaders guaranteed that it would not become law. At issue is Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s last-ditch plan to pass a “skinny repeal” of the Affordable Care Act. But “sneaky repeal” is the more honest description, since it is really a means to preserve Republican hopes of more completely destroying the A.C.A., or Obamacare. That’s why the three senators — John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Ron Johnson — demanded the House guarantee it would not accept the bill as written, but instead send it to a conference committee. Without the guarantee, they fear the House could approve it and President Trump would sign it. That would be a terrible outcome. There is nothing skinny about it, because the measure would leave 16 million more people without insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is four-fifths of the 20 million who gained health insurance under the A.C.A.. In addition, people who continue to purchase their own insurance and earn too much money to qualify for federal subsidies could see premiums jump 20 percent if they could buy comprehensive policies at all. Forget the Republican vow to save the country from a “collapsing” Obamacare. If this bill becomes law, it would magnify weaknesses in Obamacare and leave millions of individuals and families worse off.

Trump is subordinating effectiveness to impulse and convenience.” President Trump’s announcement barring transgender people from military service reminds Mr. French of the clumsy rollout of the first version of his “so-called travel ban”: It’s the right policy, but announced and implemented in the wrong way. Mr. French agrees in principle with the ban on transgender service members. Mr. French points out that transgender Americans are “disproportionately likely to suffer from mental illness,” and as such, as a group they would, “collectively degrade military readiness.” However, by confining important conversations of military readiness and culture to a series of tweets, Mr. French argues, the president “sabotages his own policies.” Read more » _____ • Joseph R.

"To the Editor: Re “Senate Soundly Rejects Repeal-Only Health Bill” (front page, July 27): Republican attempts to overturn the Affordable Care Act by flinging irresponsible alternatives that would wreak havoc with the health of millions of citizens have set a new low in legislative responsibility. The outcome of many of these votes was a foregone conclusion. That the Republican leaders are comfortable putting on a show rather than seriously addressing the problems of access to and cost of health care is an embarrassment. Their actions are not worthy of the salaries that they are paid. The shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act can be addressed, and the insurance markets stabilized. The idea of leaching billions of dollars out of Medicaid suggests that one side of the political aisle sees being able to go to a physician or a hospital as a luxury, not a right. We the people object! RAYMOND COLEMAN, POTOMAC, MD. The writer is a doctor. To the Editor: Re “A ‘Yea’ Vote Comes With Words of Reproach” (front page, July 26): Senator John McCain has offered an olive branch to Democrats, possibly to end the extreme partisanship, by putting the health care bill through “regular order”: putting the legislation in the hands of a Senate committee. That committee would be charged with producing a bipartisan health care bill that would then go through the traditional legislative process. Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, should embrace that offer and commit to working together. This is an opportunity for statesmanship by Mr. Schumer in response to Mr. McCain. This could possibly lead to a “win” for the Trump administration, but it could be a win for Americans.

"BRENTWOOD, N.Y. — These days, Evelyn Rodriguez always carries her blue clipboard, jotting down notes when inspiration or anxiety strikes. It has been her constant companion in the 10 months since her 16-year-old daughter, Kayla Cuevas, was killed by members of the transnational MS-13 gang. She plans to carry it with her, too, on Friday, when she meets with President Trump, who is coming to Suffolk Community College in this working-class Long Island town after the recent arrests of MS-13 members for the murders of four young Latino boys. Authorities say that the wave of gang violence resulting in 17 murders in the county since 2016 has been fueled in part by illegal immigration of young people; many of the victims have also been immigrants or the children of immigrants. Some politicians and activists have denounced Mr. Trump’s visit, saying that it will encourage the targeting of undocumented immigrants. But Ms. Rodriguez, a fierce wisp of a woman who grew up in Puerto Rico and the South Bronx, sees an opportunity. “I’m going to break it down for him,” she said. “‘Look, I’m not here to tell you how to do your job; I’m not here to talk about immigration.’” Ms. Rodriguez wholeheartedly agrees with the president that immigrants who are criminals should not be coming into the country, nor should they be allowed to enroll in the local schools. But, she said, the most pressing need is money, a subject she knows Mr. Trump understands. “Stop cutting our funding,” she said. “The more you cut services, the more our kids are going to be out on the street, getting into mischief. We got to do something. We cannot let this continue.” With her pointed, plain manner of speaking from an unassailable platform, Ms. Rodriguez, 49, has channeled her grief to become a relentless advocate for all victims of gang violence, whether undocumented or not.

"Donald Trump may be the two most potent words in Democratic politics, but Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, has spent much of the last six months going out of his way to avoid them. Nearly as soon as Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Cuomo began dancing around invoking the president’s name on the stump, skirting attacks in print and sidestepping reporters’ questions about the president. As the Democratic Party’s watchword in 2017 has become “resist,” Mr. Cuomo, who has garnered attention as a possible presidential candidate in 2020, has instead opted to coexist. “As a general rule, I haven’t found nasty ad hominem attacks on a person whose cooperation is needed to help your state especially helpful,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement to The New York Times. It is something of a curious posture for the leading Democrat in Mr. Trump’s home state, and it stands in sharp contrast with the actions of most Democrats nationally, who are contorting themselves to work Mr. Trump’s name into practically every speech, fund-raising pitch and news release. For a shrewd political tactician who seldom says — or doesn’t say — anything without political purpose, Mr. Cuomo’s positioning has raised questions from allies and opponents alike: Is he a savvy politician playing the long game, or being too clever for his own good?

In late 1997, her second year as a Border Patrol agent, Ms. Provost and her partner, while on bicycle patrol in Douglas, Ariz., were almost run down by a drug smuggler in a pickup truck loaded with cocaine. Later, during a patrol, she was trapped in a ditch with other agents as drug smugglers hurled large stones down on them. The agents held out until reinforcements showed up. Ms. Provost, who was elevated to acting chief of the Border Patrol in April, said they were the scariest moments in a law enforcement career stretching over 20 years. But despite the dangers, the remote locations where she has been stationed, and the fact that she was one of a few women in a male-dominated agency, she said she never considered leaving the agency. “It was the best decision that I ever made,” she said of joining the Border Patrol. Ms. Provost is the first woman to lead the Border Patrol in its 93-year history.

"WASHINGTON — Several former Obama administration officials were on their regular Wednesday morning conference call this week, plotting against Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, when Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said on CNBC that his party should shoot for “the lowest common denominator” on health care. Within moments, the former president’s associates had blasted out Mr. Price’s comments to Capitol Hill and beyond, accusing President Trump and his Republican allies of another “scheme to repeal health care” developed in a “secret back room filled with the most extreme anti-health care voices in their party.” As Senate Republicans make a final, urgent push this week to repeal the law they deride as Obamacare, they face a fierce and sophisticated opposition campaign by scores of former Obama administration officials working overtime to prevent Mr. Trump from gutting the policy they helped create.

"Unable — at least so far — to kill the Affordable Care Act outright, the Trump administration has conducted a sustained war of attrition designed to inflict fatal damage on Obamacare. This war, often operating below the radar, entails the use of a quintessentially conservative strategy, and the cooperation of Congressional Republicans. In a way, it’s pretty simple: You cut the budget, impose debilitating regulations, track the subsequent missteps and then attack the program as a failure. The political opportunism behind the Republicans’ determination to undo legislation that makes federally financed health care more broadly available has deep roots. “Democratic legislation,” the conservative strategist Bill Kristol argued after President Bill Clinton proposed his health care plan in 1993, poses “a serious political threat to the Republican Party.” If enacted, Kristol continued, Sound familiar? The Kristol memo captures the reasoning and the philosophy behind the many covert (and overt) Republican attempts to eviscerate Obamacare. “There’s a clear pattern of the administration trying to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care Act,” Elizabeth Hagan, an associate director at Families USA, a liberal advocacy group, told The Associated Press. “It’s not letting the law fail, it’s making the law fail.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/opinion/health-care-obamacare.html?searchResultPosition=57
"WASHINGTON — When Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House communications director, went on television on Thursday morning to compare himself and his adversary, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, to Cain and Abel, it seemed to encapsulate the fratricidal nature of an administration riven by biblical rivalries. Cain, after all, killed Abel as they vied for God’s favor. As it turned out, that was the cleaned-up version. In a vulgarity-laced telephone call with a New Yorker writer reported on the magazine’s website on Thursday evening, Mr. Scaramucci railed against Mr. Priebus and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, both of whom opposed his hiring last week. He even vowed to get the chief of staff fired. “Reince Priebus — if you want to leak something — he’ll be asked to resign very shortly,” Mr. Scaramucci said. Whether Mr. Scaramucci will turn out to be Cain or Abel, it was clear that his appointment has added another layer of drama and dissent to a White House suffused in it — and revived the perpetual questions about Mr. Priebus’s fate. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary and an ally of Mr. Priebus, resigned in protest when Mr. Scaramucci was hired last week because, he predicted, it would only add more chaos to the team. On that, at least, he seems to have been proved right. But President Trump not only tolerates feuds within his team, he fuels them, playing one courtier off another and leaving them all unsteady. He chooses favorites and casts others aside, but even those decisions seem subject to change at any moody moment. And by several accounts, he personally encouraged Mr. Scaramucci’s jihad against Mr. Priebus, once again subjecting his chief of staff to a ritualistic public lashing even as he considered pushing him out. Left to explain all this was Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the new White House press secretary. “This is a White House that has lots of different perspectives because the president hires the very best people,” she said gamely, before the New Yorker article posted, asserting that a “healthy competition” benefits Mr. Trump. “With that competition, you usually get the best results. The president likes that kind of competition and encourages it.” That kind of competition has exhausted even some of Mr. Trump’s most loyal defenders. But Mr. Trump has openly told people that he has lost faith in Mr. Priebus. He has said he wants “a general” as chief of staff, and has focused on John F. Kelly, the retired four-star Marine now serving as homeland security secretary. Many of his advisers, however, consider that a bad idea.

Mr. Trump said that the military could not be burdened with what he called “the tremendous medical costs” of allowing transgender service members.

"HOUSTON — The United States and Venezuela are on a collision course as President Trump promises to inflict economic pain if President Nicolás Maduro goes through with an election intended to enhance his powers. Mr. Maduro has pledged not to back down from the vote on Sunday, so the only question is whether the collision will be a fender-bender or a thundering crash. The Trump administration’s move on Wednesday to impose sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials and others close to the Maduro regime was relatively modest. But American officials stressed that it was merely a precursor to escalating actions should the vote go forward. The two countries’ economies are tightly intertwined through the oil that Venezuela sells to the United States: It accounts for roughly 10 percent of the oil America imports. And Washington has powerful tools at its disposal, including a complete prohibition on Venezuelan oil. Whatever Mr. Trump decides to do next is likely to echo, from the Venezuelan Treasury to the American gasoline pump. Despite nearly two decades of sour relations with Venezuela, the United States has enormous leverage as one of its most important customers and as one the few countries with refineries capable of processing poor-quality heavy crude.

"CLASS
A Guide Through the American Status System
By Paul Fussell
202 pages. Touchstone Books. $16. The historian and social critic Paul Fussell (1924-2012) wrote so many brisk and pleasurable books, of so many sorts, that singling out one for the purposes of this column is a headache-making task. I’m a Fussell addict. I know others. We addicts like to fight about where this man was most effective. His most thorough critical success was with “The Great War and Modern Memory” (1975), a war book like few others. It was not just about the trenches but also about irony, poetry and wit. You might argue as vigorously for his essay collections, “Thank God for the Atom Bomb” (1988) and “The Boy Scout Handbook and Other Observations” (1982), in which he radiated curmudgeonly intelligence about everything from nude beaches and the Indianapolis 500 to George Orwell’s radical honesty. But then I’ve forgotten “The Anti-Egotist” (1994), his pint-size biography of Kingsley Amis, and “Abroad: British Literary Traveling Between the Wars” (1979). Let’s not forget his autobiography, “Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic” (1996). It spoke of, among other things, his service in the 103rd Infantry Division during World War II, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. Fussell was an enemy of jargon and woolly-headedness of every variety. To read him is to receive a master class in slashing rhetoric. Always serious, he was rarely solemn. His guff detector was as strong as Mark Twain’s or H. L. Mencken’s. The Fussell book that detonates most forcefully, in my mind, at any rate, has always been “Class: A Guide Through the American Status System” (1983). There are few books like it in this country’s literature. Each year there are many volumes, most of them dead to the touch, about social class in America. The authors pace professorially around their subject, dribbling on statistics and polling data. Fussell, on the other hand, plunged into the topic as if he were carving a turkey.

"MOSCOW — Once they were prominent allies in opposing the Kremlin: President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and the former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili. Mr. Saakashvili even went so far as to emigrate to Ukraine to serve as a regional governor under Mr. Poroshenko. But they have now fallen out so badly that on Wednesday, Mr. Poroshenko stripped Mr. Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship, leaving him stateless. The conflict between them centers on Ukraine’s widespread corruption. After the 2014 revolution overthrew a pro-Russian president in Ukraine, Mr. Saakashvili and about a dozen other Georgian officials with experience rooting out corruption moved to Ukraine to join the new government. But before long, Mr. Saakashvili became disillusioned, saying that the country was doing too little to fight corruption. He resigned his post and set up an opposition political movement, and in the process badly soured his relations with Mr. Poroshenko. That culminated in the decree Mr. Poroshenko signed on Wednesday. Mr. Saakashvili responded in a post on his Facebook page, saying that Mr. Poroshenko had “crossed a red line” with the decree, and by failing to address corruption. He said the president was risking stirring another popular uprising in Ukraine. And in the ultimate insult for opponents of the Russian president, Vladimir V.

"In a summer movie landscape with Spider-Man, a simian army waging further battle for the planet and Charlize Theron as a sexy Cold War-era superspy, it says something that one of the most compelling characters is Al Gore. “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,” a follow-up to “An Inconvenient Truth,” Davis Guggenheim’s Oscar-winning documentary from 2006, is a reboot that justifies its existence — and not just because Mr. Gore has fresh news to report on climate change since his previous multimedia presentation played in multiplexes. Now gray-haired and at times sounding angrier in his speeches, Mr. Gore, in “Sequel,” takes on the air of a Shakespearean figure, a man long cast out of power by what he casually refers to as “the Supreme Court decision” (meaning Bush v. Gore) but still making the same arguments that have been hallmarks of his career. If there is a thesis in this new documentary, directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk (“Audrie & Daisy”), it’s that a rise in extreme weather is making the impact of climate change harder to deny. The movie touches on Hurricane Sandy, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the wildfire in Fort McMurray, Canada, and the Zika virus. Mr. Gore visits Greenland and the flooded streets of the Miami area. (He acknowledges a complicated relationship with Florida.) “The dots are seldom connected in the media,” he says at one point, but events like these are symptoms of global warming. As positive developments, he notes the 2015 launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory satellite, and visits a small city in Texas whose Republican mayor has decided that renewable energy makes market sense. “An Inconvenient Sequel” delves deeper into the arcane details of compromise than its predecessor, with scenes of Mr. Gore working to find a middle ground between the needs of developed and developing nations. In a group meeting, Piyush Goyal, India’s power minister, pushes back against Mr. Gore’s desire to replicate in India the expanded use of solar energy in the United States. “I’ll do the same thing after 150 years,” Mr. Goyal replies. During the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, Mr. Gore, who wasn’t an official negotiator, tries to persuade Lyndon Rive, then chief executive of the American company SolarCity, to grant India the rights to a patent on a type of solar technology. (The results aren’t clear from the film; India signed on to the Paris agreement without making a deal with SolarCity and still hasn’t made one.) Mr. Gore likens President Trump’s election to a quip often attributed to Mike Tyson: You always have a plan until you get punched in the face. The movie has been updated since its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January to include Mr. Trump’s announcement of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a decision that probably forecasts another sequel.

But after the Trump administration said on Wednesday that Mr. Brownback, 60, would be nominated to serve as an ambassador at large for international religious freedom, his legacy in Kansas may be a cautionary note that even in a Republican state, there are dangers in governing too far to the right. “He puts the lie to the myth that the default strategy is just to go as conservative as you possibly can in Kansas,” said Chapman Rackaway, a longtime observer of Kansas politics, now at the University of West Georgia. On Thursday, standing beneath a buffalo head mounted on the wall of his office, Mr. Brownback was by turns contemplative, jovial and emotional as he announced that his time as governor would be coming to an end. For about the first five minutes, he listed what he felt were his accomplishments, including a sustainable water plan for western Kansas farmers and the growth of the state’s wind energy industry. Still, the rollback of his signature 2012 tax cuts by the Legislature last month, a stinging rebuke, hung heavy.

"In a court filing on Wednesday, the Justice Department told the federal court of appeals in New York that employers should be free to fire lesbian, gay and bisexual people under federal law. To be clear, the Justice Department isn’t a party to the case, which was brought by the survivors of a deceased sky diving instructor who says he was fired because he was gay. Nor did the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York invite it to weigh in, as it did the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. No, the filing was just a vicious and gratuitous attack on L.G.B.T. Americans. This latest blow to civil rights by the Trump administration comes at a moment of tremendous promise: The Second Circuit appears poised to expand protections for lesbian and gay workers under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the federal law that bars on-the-job discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion. Earlier this year, it agreed to reconsider a pair of its decisions from the 2000s that wrongly concluded that discriminating against people based on their sexual orientation isn’t covered by the statute’s ban on sex discrimination. Coming on the heels of a landmark decision in April from the federal appeals court in Chicago that overruled similar precedent, the news that the Second Circuit would revisit its old conclusions was applauded by the L.G.B.T. community as heralding the end of another barrier to equality. Yet the Justice Department, led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, insists on being an obstacle to such progress.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The health law debate continues on Capitol Hill, where the discourse over the “skinny repeal” descended into disarray. It was a narrow measure to rescind parts of the Affordable Care Act. Four Republicans said they’ll oppose it. On Thursday night, the Senate moved into a “vote-a-rama” — a marathon series of votes on amendments that could last into the wee hours. Follow our coverage live here. This video explains vote-a-rama, and our congressional columnist discussed it on today’s episode of our podcast “The Daily.” Former Obama aides are leading opposition to the repeal, while anxious Americans are watching the debate with dread. “For us, this is not a game,” said one woman whose 2-year-old daughter’s leukemia treatment has been covered by Medicaid.

"Justin Cornett’s story had been a 21st-century economic nightmare. He worked for 13 years on drilling rigs at a crude oil company near his home in Dorton, Ky. Then it halted production, and he was laid off. At 33, with two children and a mortgage, he couldn’t find a stable new job of the kind he had trained for, because all the oil and coal mining companies in the area were shutting down. Then things changed. He found a 16-week retraining program where he learned to program the computer numerical control, or CNC, machines used in advanced manufacturing. He got a job at a Lockheed Martin factory nearby, and it paid even more than his old one. “It was a little bit different, but it was easy for me,” said Mr. Cornett, now 36. “I worked with my hands in the oil fields doing things of that nature, so it was pretty easy to catch on.” If his story’s ending sounds like a fairy tale, that’s because it is for many workers like Mr. Cornett — people without college degrees who work in occupations that are shrinking, with few other local options for the skills they have. “The U.S. faces a serious skills gap,” R. Alexander Acosta, the secretary of labor, said last month when the Trump administration introduced steps to address the challenge. But many of the skills needed to do fading jobs are applicable to growing jobs. A big part of the problem is the labor market does a poor job of matching employers with employees — in hiring, and in educating and retraining them to meet employers’ needs. “To solve this problem, people will need to have more skills, but the generation of skills is more an effect than a cause,” said Byron Auguste, co-founder of Opportunity@Work, a nonprofit for job seekers with nontraditional backgrounds. “It works for half our work force but not for the other half.” A New York Times review of the activities and skills that jobs entail, based on the Labor Department’s O*Net database, shows how much overlap there is between many seemingly dissimilar occupations. Service industry jobs, for example, require social skills and experience working with customers — which also apply to sales and office jobs.

There is no actual health care plan with enough support to pass the Senate. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, knows this. So he is pursuing a cynical, but potentially effective, strategy. He is asking senators to pass a bill largely without substance — the so-called “skinny repeal,” as a Times editorial explains — and vaguely claiming that they can work out their differences later. In this case, later means during the conference when the Senate and House negotiate over the bill’s final version. McConnell’s deputy in the Republican leadership, John Cornyn, acknowledged as much to The Hill yesterday, saying, “All we’re looking at is a way to get to that conference quick”. The House bill, Cornyn said, would then become the “template” to start those negotiations. The problem for McConnell is that delaying the discussion of substantive problems won’t make them go away. The problems include deep, unpopular cuts to Medicaid in the Republican plans, as HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn notes, as well the likelihood that the plans would collapse the private Obamacare insurance markets, as Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation says. And McConnell has no answers to those problems. That’s why no bill yet has enough support to pass. That’s why groups representing doctors, nurses, hospitals, retirees and patients of virtually every disease — diabetes, birth defects, cancer, heart disease, lung disease — have opposed both the House bill and the Senate’s tweaked (and failed) version of it. That’s why a strong majority of Americans opposes the bills, too. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/opinion/skinny-cynicism-on-health-care.html?searchResultPosition=48
"Updated, 8:16 a.m. Good morning on this cloudy Thursday. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority recently released its roughly $800 million plan to fix our beleaguered subway system. Among the proposals: seatless subway cars. That’s right. To accommodate more passengers, subway officials will remove seats from a few trains on certain lines, possibly later this year, starting with a pilot program on the L train between Brooklyn and Manhattan and the shuttle train between Times Square and Grand Central Terminal. The prospect of losing seats encouraged us to visit the New York Transit Museum to understand the evolution of the seats inside New York’s subway, and to sit in them, too. In the early 1900s, wooden armrests lined springy, cushioned seats covered with rattan, a material similar to bamboo. Sitting in the bench-length seat — with its surprising lumbar support — was like sinking into a well-worn rocker, musty smell and all. In 1915, riders were treated to new drop-down cushioned seating, or benches that could be lifted up on crowded trains. By the 1950s, the rattan on many seats was replaced with Velon, a type of plastic fabric, and in terms of comfort, it was mostly downhill from there.

"The Senate on Thursday approved sweeping sanctions against Russia, forcing President Trump to decide whether to accept a tougher line against Moscow or issue a politically explosive veto amid investigations into ties between his presidential campaign and Russian officials. The Senate vote, 98 to 2, followed the passage of a House bill this week to punish Russia, Iran and North Korea for various violations by each of the three American adversaries. In effect, the measure would sharply limit Mr. Trump’s ability to suspend or lift sanctions on Russia — handcuffing a sitting president just six months into his term with the nearly unanimous support of a Republican-led Congress. The Trump administration has opposed the sanctions against Russia, arguing that it needs flexibility to pursue a more collaborative diplomacy with a country that, by American intelligence consensus, interfered in last year’s presidential election. But now the president faces a decision he had hoped to avoid, even though the administration supports sanctions against Iran and North Korea. White House aides have acknowledged privately that a veto would be politically awkward, at best, for Mr. Trump to justify during the continuing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia. Last week, after House and Senate leaders announced an agreement on sanctions, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the incoming White House press secretary, suggested that Mr. Trump would sign the final package. Since then, though, the administration has hedged, saying that Mr. Trump will have to review whatever plan reaches his desk. “The administration supports sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea. We continue to support strong sanctions against those three countries,” Ms. Sanders said on Thursday. “And we’re going to wait and see what that final legislation looks like, and make a decision at that point.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-russia-sanctions-trump.html?searchResultPosition=16
"TEHRAN — Iran successfully launched a missile into space on Thursday, state media reported, two days after the United States House of Representatives approved a bill that would impose additional sanctions against the country, and Russia and North Korea. Such tests of what are essentially carrier rockets are not prohibited under the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and a group of six world powers including the United States. That agreement eased existing economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country’s verifiable promises to restrict its nuclear program to peaceful purposes. President Trump has called the 2015 agreement a “very bad deal” for the United States and a disastrous giveaway to Iran. He suggested during the presidential campaign that he would end the deal. But the other parties to the agreement — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — do not share Mr. Trump’s objections, and a withdrawal by the Trump administration would leave the United States isolated on the issue. The International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations has repeatedly found Iran to be in compliance with the agreement, despite Mr. Trump’s assertions that it is not adhering to “the spirit” of the deal. His administration is now pushing for inspections of suspicious Iranian military sites in an effort to test the strength of the deal, which Iran has repeatedly said it is following. In June, it launched six missiles aimed at what it said were Islamic State terrorists in Syria. Last week, the Trump administration announced new Iran-related sanctions it said were meant to show its toughened stance toward the country despite having grudgingly affirmed its compliance with the nuclear deal. The sanctions, announced jointly by the Justice, State and Treasury departments, designated 18 individuals and entities that the administration said were involved in activities that included missile development, software theft and weapons procurement. “The United States remains deeply concerned about Iran’s malign activities across the Middle East, which undermine regional stability, security, and prosperity,” the announcement said. The move came less than 12 hours after Mr. Trump reluctantly agreed to declare that Iran had honored the 2015 agreement. By law, the president must make such a declaration every 90 days. The missile launched on Thursday is known as a Simorgh, or Phoenix, missile, which experts said was a copy of North Korea’s Unha space-launch rocket. Iran’s national news channel said its missile was capable of placing satellites weighing up to 550 pounds into a 310-mile low earth orbit. Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, said the launch on Thursday was a reaction to the House vote on Tuesday approving the new sanctions. The legislation will now go to the Senate, although it is unclear when the measure will be voted on there. “Iran is boosting its missile capabilities to order to increase the accuracy, preciseness and range,” Mr. Joni said. “Iran will not stop the missile projects.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/world/middleeast/iran-reports-successful-launch-of-missile-as-us-considers-new-sanctions.html?searchResultPosition=30
"Facing an angry backlash from parents and former members, the chief executive of the Boy Scouts of America apologized on Thursday for political remarks made by President Trump at the organization’s National Jamboree this week. In the speech, Mr. Trump crowed over his election victory, attacked the news media and criticized Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama. Michael Surbaugh, the organization’s chief, said in a statement on Thursday that it was “never our intent” for the National Jamboree to become a venue for partisan political attacks. “I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,” he wrote. He added, “We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program.” Speaking to a crowd of some 40,000 scouts, volunteers and others in West Virginia on Monday, Mr. Trump attacked the “fake media” and celebrated his “incredible” election victory. “Do you remember that incredible night with the maps?” he asked the crowd of mostly under-voting-age attendees. “And that map was so red it was unbelievable, and they didn’t know what to say.” Mr. Trump mocked Mrs. Clinton for losing Michigan in the election, and many in the crowd booed her name. He regaled the scouts with stories from a New York cocktail party. And he drew attention to the fact that Mr. Obama declined to attend the National Jamboree during his years in office. (Mr. Obama stayed away from the event over the Boy Scouts ban on gay and transgender scouts and scoutmasters, which has since changed.) At one point, the crowd erupted into chants of “We love Trump!” and booed Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump’s remarks prompted an immediate and scathing backlash against the Boy Scouts, who are suffering from a steep decline in membership and cultural relevance after a yearslong period in which they drew national headlines mainly for their hostility to the prospect of openly gay or transgender members. Brian Alexander, who earned the Eagle rank as a teenager in Ohio, told The Times in an interview this week that he considered Mr. Trump’s remarks on Monday “a disgrace.” “Based on my experience with Scouting, the point is you’re supposed to grow up to be someone not like Donald Trump,” he said. “You’re supposed to grow up to be someone like John McCain or Barack Obama.” In his statement on Thursday, Mr. Surbaugh said the Boy Scouts had invited sitting United States presidents to address the National Jamboree regularly since 1937. Such invitations should not be construed as “an endorsement of any person, party or policies,” he said. “While we live in a challenging time in a country divided along political lines, the focus of Scouting remains the same today as every day,” he wrote. “In a time when differences seem to separate our country, we hope the true spirit of Scouting will empower our next generation of leaders to bring people together to do good in the world.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/boy-scouts-trump-apology.html?searchResultPosition=29
"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday denounced as “illegal” American plans for new sanctions against his country and scorned investigations into the Trump campaign’s relations with Russia as political hysteria. Moscow, Mr. Putin warned, cannot “put up forever with this boorishness.” But, speaking in eastern Finland during a joint news conference with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, Mr. Putin said he would wait until a final text of the new sanctions legislation had been adopted before deciding how to respond. The comments were Mr. Putin’s first public response to a push in Congress to enact stepped-up sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea and to limit President Trump’s ability to overturn the restrictions. Mr. Putin said the sanctions were illegal under international law and violated the rules of the World Trade Organization, which Russia joined in 2012. Last November Moscow’s political elite cheered Mr. Trump’s election victory, expecting that he would quickly reverse sanctions imposed under President Barack Obama, which included the seizure in December of two Russian diplomatic compounds in New York and Maryland. Since then, Moscow’s hopes of a swift warming of ties under Mr. Trump have evaporated amid investigations in Washington into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia before the election.

"WASHINGTON — Randal Quarles, nominated by President Trump to supervise the nation’s largest banks, told senators on Thursday that it was time to reconsider some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Quarles said he supported changes proposed by the Treasury Department, which include relaxing the annual “stress testing” of the largest banks and exempting smaller banks from some kinds of scrutiny. “Regulatory policies enacted since the financial crisis have improved the safety and soundness of the financial system,” Mr. Quarles said. “But as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order.” Mr. Quarles appeared before the Senate Banking Committee, which is considering his nomination as the Federal Reserve’s vice chairman of supervision. The committee also questioned Joseph Otting, Mr. Trump’s nominee for comptroller of the currency. The Fed has wide-ranging responsibility for financial regulation, including oversight of the largest financial companies, like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. The comptroller’s office supervises the banking subsidiaries of those companies. The hearing showcased the basic divide between the two political parties on financial regulation. Republicans argue that the federal government overreacted to the 2008 financial crisis, imposing unnecessary restrictions that are now impeding economic growth. Democrats not only oppose a rollback, but say some areas require stronger rules.

"WASHINGTON — After six months of deliberations and occasional quarreling, the top Republican tax negotiators in Congress and the Trump administration declared on Thursday that they had united behind a set of common principles that would guide them as they rush to complete the first overhaul of the tax code in three decades — and that they would do it by the end of this year. The five-paragraph joint statement in many respects raised more questions than it answered, providing fewer specifics than the previous plans released by House Republicans and President Trump. The lack of detail highlighted the challenge that Republicans face as they try to make difficult trade-offs on legislation that could reshape the entire economy. But the long-awaited sign of progress may help generate momentum behind the Republicans’ agenda as their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act remains unfulfilled and as infighting plagues the White House. The most notable development was the jettisoning of the proposed border adjustment tax on imports. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, had suggested the tax a year ago as a central plank of the plan, arguing that it would accelerate economic growth and protect American manufacturers. But the idea drew the ire of retailers, energy companies and the billionaire Koch brothers, who invested heavily to undermine it. Mr. Trump was cool to it from the beginning, and many Republicans in the House and the Senate began voicing concerns in recent months. To the glee of border tax skeptics, on Thursday the provision officially died. “We are now confident that, without transitioning to a new domestic consumption-based tax system, there is a viable approach for ensuring a level playing field between American and foreign companies and workers, while protecting American jobs and the U.S. tax base,” the negotiators said in the statement, acknowledging that there were too many “unknowns” associated with the idea. The so-called big six — Mr. Ryan; Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman; Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader; Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Senate Finance Committee chairman; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Gary D. Cohn, the National Economic Council director — huddled on Wednesday evening to hash out differences ahead of the August recess.

"To the Editor: Re “Trump Surprises Military With a Transgender Ban” (front page, July 27): On Wednesday, President Trump announced a ban on transgender people serving in the military. This cruel and discriminatory action has consequences far beyond the Pentagon. It lends legitimacy to broader efforts to demean and demoralize transgender Americans. Transgender people, particularly transgender women of color, are murdered at an alarming rate. States like Texas are considering legislation to block transgender people from using the public accommodation of their choice. Transgender young people like those I treat in my psychiatric practice are at risk for committing suicide. The American Psychiatric Association states that being transgender is not an illness; however, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are. Mr. Trump’s focus should be on preventing suicide and treating those conditions among soldiers of all genders, and not on promoting discrimination. JEREMY KIDD, NEW YORK The writer is an addiction psychiatry fellow at Columbia University Medical Center. To the Editor: I’m the proud parent of a transgender man and am writing to protest President Trump’s assertions that transgender people in the military are unacceptable representatives of our country or that they are unfit to serve their country. People who choose sex-change surgery do so out of a conviction that the sex assigned to them at birth is not the one that fits their brains, personalities and inclinations. The procedures are painful and costly. Those who choose to undergo them do so out of personal necessity, not a countercultural whim. Is it possible that Mr. Trump has chosen this time to bar transgender people in the military not only to distract from the problems plaguing his administration, but also to please his gay-bashing and transgender-phobic supporters? JANET SVATOS, GLENVIEW, ILL. To the Editor: President Trump cites “tremendous medical costs” among his reasons for promoting a ban on transgender individuals serving in our military. As a regular provider of transgender health care, I question his math and logic. When one accounts for pregnancy rates and dependents’ medical care, transgender individuals will have far lower overall annual health care costs associated with their active-duty service than their cisgender counterparts. Furthermore, recent literature confirms my observations that in comparison with cisgender patients, transgender patients seeking gender-affirming medical services are much more likely to pursue smoking cessation and other health-promoting behaviors.

"PORTLAND, ORE. — There is a door at Portland State University that doesn’t quite lock, and one afternoon in early April, the rapper Aminé walked up to it and gave it a hopeful tug. It popped open with an easy exhale, and he smiled. A couple of years ago, when he was still a student here studying marketing but plotting a music career, he would sneak into this building, make his way to a nondescript beige room on the second floor, and, in the quiet of night, accompanied by no one, work on his songs. Striving to be a rapper in this city better known for indie rock, roots music and “Portlandia”-level whiteness was “super depressing,” he said. The scene was dead. No one replied to his entreaties to collaborate. He couldn’t afford to pay for a real studio. But there was this unassuming room, where, in the fall of 2015, Aminé recorded onto his laptop the vocals for “Caroline,” the goofy flirtation — “great scenes might be great, but I love your bloopers/and perfect’s for the urgent/Baby, I want forever” — that became a surprise breakout hit last year, and took Aminé from frustrated college student to ascendant hip-hop star signed to a major label, Republic Records. In its video, which has accumulated more than 175 million views on YouTube, Aminé and his friends cavort around the city crammed into the back of a car, or sitting atop it, a high-definition take on low-resolution fun. Aminé (uh-MEE-nay), 23, has a wonderfully liquid face — bugged eyes, wide smile, exaggerated expressions. The glee he telegraphed in the “Caroline” video immediately marked him as a new but not unfamiliar kind of hip-hop outsider, one preoccupied with brightness, melody and light absurdity, an inheritor of Tyler, the Creator’s primary-color exuberance and the earthen emotional presence of the Native Tongues.

But Smith, 30, a contractor with no health or dental insurance, who hadn’t seen a dentist in more than 20 years, was looking forward to an imminent end to the pain and rot in his mouth. “I’ve always worked, since I was 14, but I’ve never had dental insurance,” Smith told me. After his teeth are out, he has a lead on low-cost dentures. “I’d like to have a straight smile,” he said. “I’ve never had one in my life.” All around Smith were uninsured patients receiving free dental or medical care, including dozens of men and women in side-by-side dental chairs in the open air.

"It is no longer sufficient to brand Donald Trump as abnormal, a designation that is surely applicable but that falls significantly short in registering the magnitude of the menace. The standard nomenclature of normal politics must be abandoned. What we are witnessing is nothing less than an assault on the fundamentals of the country itself: on our legacy institutions and our sense of protocol, decency and honesty. In any other circumstance, we might likely write this off as the trite protestations of a man trapped in a toddler’s temperament, full of meltdowns, magical thinking and make believe. But this man’s vindictiveness and mendacity are undergirded by the unequaled power of the American president, and as such he has graduated on the scale of power from toddler to budding tyrant. This threat Trump poses — to our morals, ethics, norms and collective sense of propriety — may be without equal from a domestic source. Everything he is doing is an assault and matters on some level. His desecration of the Boy Scouts’ national jamboree matters. Not only did he turn his appearance before the boys into a political rally in which they booed both former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he seemed to be appealing to their basest instincts. What exactly did Trump mean when he regaled the boys with the story of the real-estate developer William Levitt, who, as Trump put it: “Sold his company for a tremendous amount of money.
