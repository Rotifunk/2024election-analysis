"WASHINGTON — President Trump made clear on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” at Syria at any moment, telegraphing a military operation as he has previously said he would never do. But the real suspense remained — how many missiles, for how long, at what targets and to what end. The strike that Mr. Trump was preparing as retaliation for a suspected chemical attack carries all sorts of perils that worry military planners and diplomats alike. A fresh intervention in one of the most combustible battlegrounds on the planet — one already crawling with Syrian, Russian, Iranian, American, Turkish and Kurdish forces — could easily bring unintended consequences. The more expansive the strike, officials and experts said, the greater the risk of accidental casualties that could deepen the conflict with Russia or Iran. Yet a more restrained operation might not inflict enough damage on the government of President Bashar al-Assad to change his calculations. If Mr. Trump goes beyond missiles and authorizes the use of manned aircraft even from outside Syrian airspace, they face the dangers of a modern air defense system provided by Moscow. And Mr. Trump’s Twitter warning, along with the delay in acting, has given the Syrians as well as their Russian and Iranian allies days to prepare. Two Defense Department officials said the Syrian military had moved some of its key aircraft to a Russian base, assuming the Americans would be reluctant to strike there. Russian commanders have also moved some of their military forces in anticipation of American action. "
"Washington — Although perhaps justified by the tragic events in Syria, President Trump’s last-minute decision to skip the eighth Summit of the Americas, which begins this week in Lima, Peru, was discouraging to his Latin American and Caribbean counterparts. Most probably see it as confirmation of his continuing indifference to the region. His aggressive rhetoric and erratic policies have already roiled inter-American relations and left the hemisphere’s leaders disconcerted. Several White House decisions have been criticized as openly hostile to Latin America, including the ordering of National Guard troops to the Mexican border and the undoing of programs that now shield millions of immigrants from deportation. Particularly unnerving has been the president’s obsession with erecting a wall along the border. Also resented are the Trump administration’s threat to unilaterally rewrite international trade rules, levy protectionist tariffs and possibly scrap the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. Washington’s moves to revive the futile “war on drugs” are unwelcome. So is the renewed hard-line approach to Cuba, reversing much of President Barack Obama’s opening, which was heralded throughout the region and brought Raúl Castro to his first summit meeting three years ago. He is expected in Lima as well. With few encouraging gestures or initiatives from the White House, it is no surprise that Gallup reports only 16 percent of Latin Americans approve of Trump, a fraction of Mr. Obama’s 62 percent first-year approval. Further muddying the waters are the alarms raised by senior United States officials about China’s expanding role in the region, which have stirred unpleasant memories of a long-past era when Washington considered Latin America its “backyard.” Many in the region wonder whether the administration’s new, more hawkish foreign policy team might resurrect the Monroe Doctrine, again giving the United States self-appointed authority to intrude on the region’s sovereignty. "
"WASHINGTON — After two days and more than 10 hours of questioning of Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, there was widespread consensus among lawmakers that social media technology — and its potential for abuse — had far outpaced Washington and that Congress should step in to close the gap. But the agreement largely ended there. For lawmakers, the calculus is tricky: They do not want to infringe on First Amendment rights or hurt Silicon Valley innovation but are also unsure how to regulate this new breed of company, which wields enormous power by collecting vast amounts of private data from billions of consumers. “While Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured,” said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “I think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.” Mr. Zuckerberg, composed but noncommittal about making any sweeping privacy changes, conceded that it was “inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.” The growing calls for regulation — and the two days of congressional hearings — were prompted by revelations that Facebook failed to protect the sensitive data of as many of 87 million users from being harvested, without their explicit permission, by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to the Trump campaign. But lawmakers’ concerns extended beyond that breach to the business of Facebook itself, a free social network that profits by collecting data from its users and selling advertising that is informed by that data. “The American people are concerned about how Facebook protects and profits from its users’ data,” Mr. Walden said. “Does Congress need to clarify whether or not consumers own or have any real power over their online data?” "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — For two days and a night, the computer science student had been huddling with his family in the basement of their apartment building as pro-government forces rained bombs down on their rebel-held Syrian town. After night fell, they heard the whirring of helicopter blades followed by the whistling sounds of objects falling from the sky. Soon, a strange smell wafted down the stairs. “People started shouting in the streets, ‘Chemicals! Chemicals!’” the student, Mohammed al-Hanash, 25, said by phone from Syria. The attack in the Syrian town of Douma on Saturday, which witnesses and medical workers said used chemical weapons, has resonated far beyond the war-scarred community’s destroyed buildings, ratcheting up tensions among world powers and threatening to escalate Syria’s multi-sided civil war. President Trump has vowed to punish not only President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for the attack, but also Syria’s Russian and Iranian allies. On Wednesday, a Russian official said that any American missiles fired at Syria would be shot down, and Mr. Trump responded in a tweet that Russia should “get ready” for missiles that would be “nice and new and ‘smart.’” "
"PHOENIX — In 2016, Wisconsin turned red for Donald Trump but Paul Ryan’s Janesville remained stubbornly blue — so perhaps it is no surprise that the speaker of the House won’t seek re-election. For Republicans, this is an unalloyed good. For his entire career, Mr. Ryan has been the wunderkind who couldn’t deliver. As the No. 2 on the Romney ticket in 2012, he was supposed to add youth, depth and a key that would unlock coveted Midwestern electoral votes. He didn’t do that, either. It required the New Yorker Donald Trump to pick that lock. This didn’t worry Mr. Ryan’s many supporters among the Republican ruling class. Congress, they assured us, was his natural habitat. In 2015, his reputation for policy-oriented nerdiness got him the chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, where he was supposed to reform the nation’s entire fiscal regime with a superhuman knowledge of both the details and the substance of the nation’s finances. He didn’t. Undaunted, Mr. Ryan took the speaker’s chair later that year after playing Hamlet and claiming implausibly that he didn’t want the job and would accept it only if Republicans thrust it upon him. He promised fidelity to the conservative catechism and a return to budget sanity, but he didn’t follow through. His fecklessness led the Tea Party base that had swept him and his colleagues to power to grow even more disenchanted with the Republican congressional leadership. For seven years, the leadership raised countless millions of dollars and won first the House, then the Senate, and finally the presidency, in part by promising to repeal Obamacare. Nothing was more central to Republican identity between 2010 and the rise of President Trump. But when given the chance, Mr. Ryan couldn’t get the House to pass repeal. The bill the House finally sent to the Senate wasn’t a repeal but a dilution. It never became law, either. Likewise, Mr. Ryan, a longtime budget hawk, was incapable of returning the House budget process to regular order. And rather than reducing spending and the deficit, he increased both. Worse, Mr. Ryan is at odds with the president and a majority in his party on immigration and border control. The bill for those contradictions and failures has finally come due. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s fusillade of tweets about Syria, Russia and China this week set a new standard for contradictory and inconsistent positions in Mr. Trump’s approach to war, trade and relations with adversaries. The president promised never to telegraph military action against an enemy, yet all but showcased a coming missile strike on Syria. He threatened Russia and called its relations with the United States worse than during the Cold War, yet blamed the ill will not on Moscow but on the special counsel investigation. He praised President Xi Jinping of China for his “enlightenment” on trade in a highly anticipated speech, but in it Mr. Xi actually offered little to change what Mr. Trump has called decades of predatory practices by Beijing. Mr. Trump might argue, like Ralph Waldo Emerson, that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” But the latest reversals and back flips were so jarring that they left foreign officials more bewildered than usual about Mr. Trump’s next moves. The tweets also appeared divorced from the administration’s policies on Russia, where the United States is expelling diplomats and imposing sanctions on cronies of President Vladimir V. Putin. They are at odds with policy on China, where the United States appears ready to escalate the confrontation over trade. They are at cross-purposes with the latest actions on Syria, where the administration is trying to cobble together a coalition before it unleashes a strike against President Bashar al-Assad for his suspected use of chemical weapons in a Damascus suburb last week. “His administration may have drafted a Russia policy through the interagency process,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia, “but Trump seems completely disconnected from it, like he seems to be on many foreign policies.” "
"CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico — On a sun-scorched prison patio in this sprawling border town, a 23-year-old inmate calmly explained to me how he trafficked hundreds of guns a year from the United States to Mexico. He never bothered paying American citizen straw buyers to purchase the weapons for him, he said. Instead, he would go to one of the many weekend gun shows around Dallas and take advantage of the so-called gun show loophole to buy firearms from private sellers without a background check or proof of citizenship. He would drive back to Mexico with about a dozen guns hidden in refrigerators and stoves in the back of his truck, and sell the weapons in his hometown, a few hours south of the Rio Grande. His most requested weapon, he told me, was the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which he could buy for as little as $500 and sell for five times that. He became richer than he had dreamed, buying a house and new trucks and motorbikes. “At the beginning I felt bad, but you get used to it,” he said. “It’s the way you can have a good time. You sell weapons, you earn money and you have fun.” He got caught only because his cousin informed on him after an argument, he said, and he is now serving a nine-year sentence. Guns from America inundate Mexico, arming the brutal cartels that have drowned this country in blood, destroyed families and driven people from their homes. Over a six-year period, the Justice Department traced more than 74,500 firearms seized from criminals here to the United States, where they were either manufactured or sold on after being imported from other countries. Many more weapons are still in the hands of cartel gunmen who commit dozens of murders every day. A 2013 study by the University of San Diego and the Igarapé Institute estimated that between 2010 and 2012, some 253,000 firearms were purchased to be trafficked over the southern border. The gaps in regulation, like the gun show loophole, make it impossible to know the true numbers. In contrast, in Mexico there is only one legal firearms shop in the entire country, run out of a military base in the capital. Buyers have to apply for permits showing at least six forms of identification, including proof they have no criminal record and a letter from their employer, and the process can take months. "
"When House Speaker Paul D. Ryan announced Wednesday that he would not seek re-election in November, it left Republicans with another open seat to defend in a midterm cycle that has already led to dozens of retirements. But even before Mr. Ryan’s surprise announcement, several candidates had emerged to challenge him in the race for Wisconsin’s First Congressional District, a traditionally conservative area in the southeastern corner of the state. Barack Obama carried the district in 2008, but lost it in 2012. In 2016, Donald J. Trump won it by more than 10 points. The filing deadline to run for the seat is June 1, leaving potential candidates with plenty of time to organize a campaign ahead of the Aug. 14 primaries. Here is a look at some of the candidates already running. _____ Tweeting under the handle @IronStache, Randy Bryce is a mustachioed ironworker, Army veteran and liberal media darling who has appeared frequently on cable news to criticize Mr. Ryan.

"WASHINGTON — The calls were placed quietly to top American diplomats who had resigned in droves over the past year. The message: Mike Pompeo, nominated to become the next secretary of state, wanted them back. Mr. Pompeo, currently the director of the C.I.A., also telephoned Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, the last two Democrats to run the State Department. The gestures — the likes of which Rex W. Tillerson, President Trump’s first secretary of state, bypassed — were similarly well received by career diplomats in the run-up to what is expected to be a contentious confirmation hearing for Mr. Pompeo. On Thursday, Mr. Pompeo’s charm offensive will face its greatest test as he testifies in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has vowed to vote against him in part because of Mr. Pompeo’s past support for enhanced interrogation techniques that have been likened to torture. Democrats have promised to needle a nominee whom critics doubt can rally the Middle East against extremists given what they say is a record of anti-Muslim remarks and ties to anti-Islam groups. In a written opening statement filed with the committee, Mr. Pompeo promised to avoid past missteps with North Korea and said that the president hoped negotiations with European partners would sufficiently toughen the Iran nuclear pact to make it acceptable for him. “If confirmed, it will be an immediate personal priority to work with those partners to see if such a fix is achievable,” he said. Negotiators from Europe have been working with their United States counterparts on such an agreement since Tuesday at the State Department, their fourth such conclave. "
"President Trump has long had ties to the nation’s major media players. But his connections with the country’s largest tabloid publisher, American Media Inc., run deeper than most. A former top executive of Mr. Trump’s casino business sits on A.M.I.’s four-member board of directors, and an adviser joined the media company after the election. The company’s chairman, David J. Pecker, is a close friend of the president’s. And in the Trump era, A.M.I.’s flagship tabloid, The National Enquirer, has taken a decidedly political turn, regularly devoting covers to the president’s triumphs and travails with articles headlined “Trump’s Plan For World Peace!” and “Proof! FBI Plot to Impeach Trump!” Since the early stages of his campaign in 2015, Mr. Trump, his lawyer Michael D. Cohen and Mr. Pecker have strategized about protecting him and lashing out at his political enemies. Now the tabloid company has been drawn into a sweeping federal investigation of Mr. Cohen’s activities, including efforts to head off potentially damaging stories about Mr. Trump during his run for the White House. In one instance, The Enquirer bought but did not publish a story about an alleged extramarital relationship years earlier with the presidential candidate, an unusual decision for a scandal sheet. "
"Tom Ingersoll, a longtime satellite entrepreneur, admits being startled by a call he received last year: A nonprofit foundation wanted to build a satellite and launch it into orbit to help fight climate change. “I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of crazy.’” In February, he signed on as the project’s manager, after having taken a long look at the technologies required. “It’s hard, but we could probably pull it off,” he said. Now the rest of the world can decide for itself. On Wednesday, Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund, announced plans for MethaneSAT, an orbital eye in the sky that could monitor industrial methane leaks all over the planet. Methane remains one of the thorniest climate problems. It is the major component of natural gas, which produces half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned to run electric plants. But when methane leaks, it is a potent greenhouse gas that traps more than 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. By some estimates, human-caused emissions of methane are thought to be responsible for about a quarter of the warming being experienced today. But figuring out where methane emissions are coming from is a major challenge. The colorless, odorless gas has proved difficult to measure at the source of leaks without nearby access to the sites. Early attempts by the Environmental Protection Agency to determine the scope of the problem significantly underestimated emissions. Methane leaks are relatively inexpensive to fix, and stopping leaks allows energy companies to sell more gas. The International Energy Agency has estimated that as much as 50 percent of the 84 million tons of methane emitted by the oil and gas industry every year — from leaky wells and pipes and other causes — “can be mitigated at no net cost, because the value of the captured methane could cover the abatement measures.” "
"BUSINESS DAY An article on Saturday about medical devices made in China that a Trump administration proposal is targeting for a potential 25 percent tariff erroneously included Pfizer among a group of manufacturers that declined to comment on the proposal. Pfizer was not contacted for comment by The New York Times. • An article on Tuesday about privacy and free online content misstated Google’s policy on scanning the content of its Gmail service as a way of directing advertising to specific users.

"Well, Paul Ryan, you’re a free man now — at least, much freer than you were before you announced on Wednesday that you’d be stepping down as House speaker and departing Congress in January. What an opportunity you have to serve the country and to demonstrate, despite all the ground you’ve created for eye-rolling, that you care about something more than short-term partisan advantage. Have you truly been offended, as you suggested in 2016, by the bigotry and bullying of Donald Trump? Would you like to see the White House, and the Republican Party, set a higher standard? Now you have the chance to go far beyond milquetoast observations, like “he could have done better,” your less-than-withering reaction to President Trump’s claim that there were “very fine people” among the white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., who chanted, “Jews will not replace us.” You say you’ve been given assurances that the president doesn’t intend to fire law-enforcement officials who are investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. So you’re clearly worried about that possibility. Why not take steps to ensure your fellow citizens won’t have to suffer the constitutional crisis that a step like that would precipitate? You don’t have to worry anymore about weathering a primary challenger from the far right. You don’t have to truckle before a blast of presidential tweets. You can use your remaining authority and credibility with your colleagues to pass legislation to make it harder for the president to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel, and other officials at the Department of Justice. On your way out the door, on that crucial question, you still have a chance to put yourself on the right side of history. Unfortunately, the reputation you hoped to build for yourself across your nearly 20 years in Congress, as an earnest policy wonk in anguish over the federal deficit, vanished long ago beneath a flood of red ink. You talked a lot about making government more effective and efficient, but actually pushed a conventional hard-line agenda of huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and steep cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and other government programs that benefit low-income and middle-class families. The tax law you rammed through last year will blow up the deficit by more than $1.85 trillion over the next decade. All that debt is part of your legacy. Too late to fix that. "
"WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Board policymakers raised concerns at their March meeting about the prospect of the United States heading into a global trade war, zeroing in on potential harm to American farmers such a clash would cause, according to minutes of the meeting released by the Fed on Wednesday. The officials also expressed uncertainty about how newly enacted tax cuts would affect the economy, partly because the cuts are expected to exacerbate the swelling of federal budget deficits, and because some of the cuts are to expire in the years ahead. Policymakers also expressed unanimous, increased confidence in the strength of the country’s economic recovery, even accounting for trade and tax uncertainties. The minutes of the meeting, on March 20 and 21, provide more detail into the concerns being raised by the farm industry about the potential domestic impact of President Trump’s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum. “Participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook,” the minutes read, “but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retaliation.” Fed policymakers also said at the meeting that they expected the combination of the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump last year and a bipartisan congressional deal this year to increase federal spending to give economic output “a significant boost” in the next few years. However, the minutes reflect officials’ uncertainty about how big that boost might be, and when it might come, because there is little historical precedent for such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low. The minutes also show that policymakers “suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.” "
"That the questioning of Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday by two full Senate committees was considered a triumph for Mr. Zuckerberg — he made $3 billion personally as Facebook stock shot up during his testimony — shouldn’t come as a surprise. This was an unfair fight between a man who knew intimately the project being debated and a lot of people who didn’t. The occasion for his Senate hearing, and his appearance in the House on Wednesday, was a data breach that allowed a British political consulting firm working for the Trump campaign to gain access to 87 million Facebook profiles, but as the questioning unfolded Mr. Zuckerberg behaved as if he were the only competent one in the room. When Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked, “Would you agree that users should be able to access all of their information?” Mr. Zuckerberg seemed confused: “Senator, we have already a ‘download your information’ tool that allows people to see and to take out all of the information that Facebook — that they’ve put into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them. So, yes, I agree with that. We already have that.” Similarly, when Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, asked, “Are you going to go back to work on giving me a greater right to erase my data?” Mr. Zuckerberg again appeared perplexed, saying, “Senator, you can already delete all the data that’s there.” This wasn’t quite the contemptuous Jimmy Fallon character — Nick Burns, Your Company’s Computer Guy — who briefly tries to explain the problem before shouting, “Move!,” and fixing it himself. But then again Mr. Zuckerberg had the benefit of intensive politeness training. Mr. Zuckerberg has been winning these unfair fights going on 15 years now. The idea that he’s the Computer Guy and we are the helpless office workers in his way exemplifies the attitude of Facebook and Silicon Valley more broadly. "
"STARR COUNTY, Tex. — The soldier stood on a cliff above the swift green waters of the Rio Grande, peering into the brush with binoculars, an M-4 carbine rifle at his chest, a 9-millimeter pistol in a holster low on his thigh. The rainstorm was over, but a thick layer of mud lined the bottom of his combat boots. He was one of 250 Texas National Guard troops stationed on the border with Mexico, part of President Trump’s latest plan to stanch the flow of immigrants entering the country illegally. The troops at the observation post chatted very little. They stared into the brush, took a few steps to change their position, then stared some more. Then it happened — one of the soldiers saw a raft in the river. The troops got on their radio and summoned the Border Patrol down below, fulfilling, military officials said, one of the primary missions of the National Guard’s controversial mobilization on the southern border: to observe and report. On Tuesday, the Guard allowed a group of journalists to shadow some of its troops on the border, an early look at the new deployment that follows a surge in illegal crossings into South Texas. The Department of Homeland Security said more than 37,000 people were detained in March. Though the flow of asylum seekers into Texas regularly goes up in the springtime, detentions this year were three times the levels seen in March of last year. “We’re like an extra pair of eyes and ears,” said a Texas National Guard captain, one of several positioned at two observation posts in rural Starr County in the Rio Grande Valley. Like other troops, he had been instructed by his commanders to speak anonymously; many of them live and work on the border, and there are fears that the soldiers could become potential targets for cartel-linked smugglers.

"WASHINGTON — Fifteen months after Republicans took full control of Washington, the man long seen as central to the party’s future is abandoning one of the most powerful jobs in the capital, imperiling the G.O.P. grip on the House and signaling that the political convulsions of the Trump era are taking a grave toll on the right months before Election Day. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s retirement announcement on Wednesday blindsided many House Republican candidates and their campaign leaders who were counting on him to lead them to victory in the November midterm elections. His decision to leave Congress at 48 sent an undeniably pessimistic message to Republicans: that stable, steady leadership is lacking in their deeply divided party as they head into a campaign season defined by the whims of President Trump. And for a White House bracing for a potential Democratic impeachment inquiry, the ominous impact of Mr. Ryan’s retirement was unmistakable. He has made it more difficult to stave off Democrats’ taking control of the House, where Republicans currently hold a 23-seat majority. As many as 50 House Republican seats are at risk in competitive races this year. Private polling indicates that Mr. Trump’s approval rating is well below 40 percent in some of those tossup districts, the sort of low political standing that often dooms candidates of the president’s party. “This is the nightmare scenario,” said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican. “Everybody figured he’d just hang in there till after the election.” "
"Social media lives and dies on engagement. You serve your audiences such provocative content — news, political hot takes, baby pictures — that they keep their eyes on you as long as possible. When Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, showed up in Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, he seemed to be aiming for disengagement. Facing a grilling over data breaches and Facebook’s role in foreign interference in the 2016 election, he was interested in keeping the provocation, and thus the attention, to a minimum. If the byword of platforms like Facebook is “stickiness,” Mr. Zuckerberg’s prepared, bland affect achieved the opposite. He was so unsticky, the questions slid right off him. Washington had been prepared for a showdown since the revelations that tens of millions of users had their data “scraped” by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The major broadcast and cable news networks carried the hearing live. Mr. Zuckerberg took his seat Tuesday facing a sea of snapping cameras, a handy if heavy-handed metaphor for the invasion of privacy. But Mr. Zuckerberg had no interest in providing a show. He was apologetic. He was soft-spoken. Even his clothing was deferential. He ditched his Silicon Valley T-shirts for a suit the color of the Facebook logo banner and a tie the shade of the Like button. He came prepared with stock answers: “Senator, that’s a great question”; “I’ll have my team get back to you.” (That team is going to be busy.) He repeatedly alluded to having begun Facebook in his dorm room at Harvard, framing the company as a bootstrap success story rather than a global supra-state with a population larger than any country’s.

"To the Editor: Your April 11 editorial “The Law Is Coming, Mr. Trump” was brilliant. The problem is nobody cares. Nobody cares how he does business and the kinds of people he surrounds himself with. Nobody cares about his prevarications, his hypocrisy, his misogyny, his illiteracy, his rants and, most of all, his lack of a moral compass. Nobody cares. Not Congress, not the evangelicals who are eager to give him all the mulligans he needs, and certainly not his 40 percent base. The results of the Mueller investigation won’t matter. President Trump will never be impeached, and all of his minions currently under investigation will be pardoned. The only way to contain Mr. Trump until 2020 is to elect a veto-proof Democratic Congress in 2018. Until we can find a new set of leaders equipped with a backbone and a conscience who understand and support the word “compromise,” “fake” government will continue. WILLIAM M. DOYLE, LAKEWOOD, N.J. "
"The F.B.I. agents who raided the office and hotel of President Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, were seeking details on his relationship with the Trump campaign and his efforts to suppress negative information about Mr. Trump, according to three people briefed on the matter. Prosecutors are interested in whether Mr. Cohen, who had no official role in the 2016 campaign, coordinated with it to quash the release of anything detrimental to it and whether that violated campaign finance laws — a new front in the investigation into Mr. Cohen. The warrant executed Monday by the agents was striking in its breadth, according to those people. It demanded documents related to the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Mr. Trump was heard making vulgar comments about women, and to other materials related to secret agreements Mr. Cohen made with women in exchange for them not speaking publicly about sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. The warrant also covered emails and other documents that could reveal Mr. Cohen’s private communications with Mr. Trump during a tense period in the presidential campaign when Mr. Trump confronted the possibility of embarrassing details of his extramarital affairs. And it delved deeply into Mr. Cohen’s past, including documents about Mr. Cohen’s personal and business finances, including his work as a New York taxi fleet manager. The additional details the agents were seeking came a day after it was revealed that the authorities sought documents from Mr. Cohen related to payments made to two women who claim they had affairs with Mr. Trump, Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star known as Stormy Daniels, as well as information on the role of the publisher of The National Enquirer in silencing the women. The investigation is being run by Robert S. Khuzami, whose boss, Geoffrey S. Berman, the interim United States attorney in Manhattan, has recused himself. Mr. Khuzami is a veteran federal prosecutor who spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention in support of President George W. Bush and later led the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration. "
"To the Editor: Re “For G.O.P., Threat of Impeachment May Spur Voters” (front page, April 9): It is particularly disappointing that in the campaign for the November elections, the G.O.P.’s strategy will be the scare tactic of possible impeachment of the president should the Democrats win the House. Have they nothing else to present to the electorate? Like plans and ideas for the real problems and issues facing the country? That the G.O.P. and its supporters will be using words such as “coup” reveals their fear of having genuine and substantive discussions regarding policies and programs. RICHARD ANDRESEN, LOLETA, CALIF. To the Editor: Many Republicans, both right-wing and moderate, are totally disgusted with President Trump and would much prefer the true ideologue, Mike Pence, as their president. I suspect they are kneeling in prayer for impeachment and conviction. They may be so upset that they could hold their noses to vote Democratic and for possible impeachment. Conversely, there are many Democratic voters, especially on the left, who fear a purely ideological right-wing Pence presidency to the point of joining Republicans in opposing impeachment. This would militate against Republican fears of losing their president, and makes the possibility of Democrats taking Congress more probable. Go figure. JOSEPH GIUSTRA, NEW YORK To the Editor: The argument that we need more proof before pressing for impeachment proceedings against President Trump belies the facts. We already have overwhelming evidence that the president has committed impeachable offenses, including obstruction of justice; violations of the anti-corruption provisions of the Constitution (the emoluments clauses); abuse of the pardon power; undermining the freedom of the press; recklessly threatening nuclear war against foreign nations; directing or seeking to direct law enforcement, including the Department of Justice and the F.B.I., to prosecute political adversaries for improper purposes; and giving aid and comfort to white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Whether the president was directly involved in a conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere with the 2016 election remains the subject of Robert Mueller’s investigation. But we do not need to wait for the outcome of that criminal investigation before moving forward with an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives on whether the president has committed crimes against the state: abuse of power and abuse of the public trust. Our Constitution is facing one of its greatest tests. We must rise to defend it, using the power of the impeachment clause to confront the unprecedented corruption of the presidency. That starts with the launch of an impeachment investigation of Mr. Trump. JOHN C. BONIFAZ
BEN T. CLEMENTS The writers are, respectively, the president and chairman of Free Speech for People. To the Editor: The vehicle for removing Donald Trump from office should be an election, not an impeachment. Although the latter may satisfy the emotional needs of some, a defeat at the polls will be definitive, dispositive and, for the vast majority of rational Americans, whether Democrats or Republicans, unarguable.

"To the Editor: Re “Wary Lawmakers Question Facebook’s Founder” (front page, April 11) and “Data Mining Scandal Deals Blow to Clout of Billionaire Donors” (news article, April 11): While Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg deserve the grilling they are getting on the Hill, I find it amazing that Robert and Rebekah Mercer and their control of Cambridge Analytica are not getting the same treatment. There are laws about how much money individuals can donate to candidates. If the Mercers are behind this incredible abuse of information gathering, done solely to sway an election, then why are they not being called on the carpet just as dramatically? Facebook users know full well that letting it all hang out on social media is a risk. Whether they pay attention to the ads that strategically bombard them each day is up to them. However, it only took changing the minds of some 77,000 voters in three states to elect Donald Trump. It might not have been illegal, but bringing people like the Mercers before Congress to explain their motives would be very instructive to the voting public. ARLENE RUBIN, NEW YORK "
"TEHRAN — All this week panicked Iranians have gathered in throngs outside banks and other financial businesses hoping to buy dollars, as the government seeks to head off a collapse in the rial, the national currency. But they have met with nothing but frustration, told there were no dollars or other currencies for them to buy at the official government rate. In an effort to stop the run on foreign exchange, the government has forbidden anyone from holding more than the equivalent of $10,000 in dollars or euros, which account for most of the foreign exchange in Iran. Long on a downward path, the rial plunged this week, losing 35 percent of its value against the dollar and hitting what has been widely described as a record low. The government is seeking to impose an exchange rate of 42,000 to the dollar, but in Tehran’s black-market exchanges this week the going rate was 60,000. When President Hassan Rouhani took office in 2013, the rate was 36,000. In an effort to squelch currency speculation, the government sent riot police into the bazaars on Wednesday, where they arrested several money changers. One senior cleric, Ayatollah Nasser Makarem-Shirazi, said that some money changers ought to be executed to set an example. However, many of those changing money in the bazaars were ordinary people seeking to protect themselves against rising prices and fearful of further declines in the currency. "
"BOAO, China — The International Monetary Fund chief praised his openness. A senior British banker lauded his authoritarian rule. The Philippine president said he loves the man. President Xi Jinping of China took center stage at his country’s annual Boao Forum for Asia this week to the welcoming arms of many in the global elite. He portrayed himself as a champion of free trade and world order, speaking to a group that included Ban Ki-moon, the former secretary general of the United Nations, and Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the World Trade Organization, and his words helped move markets around the world. The forum, held every year on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, has long been a platform for China to portray itself as an economic powerhouse and regional leader. But this year’s meetings took on an elevated role, as a platform for Beijing, a result of a growing trade dispute between China and the United States. It was an opportunity for Mr. Xi to present himself as a foil to President Trump, who has rejected globalization and  focused on an “America First policy,” targeting China, in particular, with a series of protectionist moves. Plaudits from foreign leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, as well as leading figures of the economic and diplomatic world, have helped to cement this image. “I congratulate you, Xi Jinping, for this new life that you have identified, for the openness that you have celebrated and advocated,” Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech, “for the innovation and inclusiveness that you have encouraged.” "
"BRUSSELS — Virtually no one in Europe wants President Trump to plunge headlong into a trade war with China. But nearly everyone thinks that it is time to stand up to China’s closed markets and trade manipulation. The European Union may not like Mr. Trump or the way he is doing things — but that does not mean it dislikes his aims when it comes to trading with China. But Europe would also like the conflict to go away, fearing the bloc will be caught between the United States, its primary market and second-largest supplier, and China, its primary supplier and second-largest market. The way to make that happen, it believes, is challenging China through negotiations within the existing trading system, avoiding a degenerative tit-for-tat battle that could harm Europe’s relatively vibrant economy. “When Trump was elected, a lot of Europeans wondered whether there will be a point where we have to decide between the U.S. and China, and it seems that moment may be now,” said Angela Stanzel, a China expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. “I don’t think Europe will side with China — we have the same problems with China as the Americans do,” she said. “But the E.U. does agree with the Chinese that Trump is doing it the wrong way and has been outspokenly critical about his methods. A trade war between the U.S. and China would really put Europe on the spot.” "
"WASHINGTON — A former American intelligence official who came under intense scrutiny during a stint at the White House last year is returning to government as the national security adviser to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to a person familiar with the decision. The official, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, will play an important role at the Justice Department, advising Mr. Sessions on counterintelligence and counterterrorism. Mr. Cohen-Watnick is known to be hawkish on Russia and China, believing the intelligence community needs to take a more aggressive approach in countering their activities. Both countries conduct wide-ranging espionage in the United States that targets commercial and government secrets. Mr. Sessions is broadly viewed in the Justice Department as lacking expertise in the area. The Justice Department declined to comment. Mr. Cohen-Watnick, 31, served briefly at the start of the Trump administration as the senior director for intelligence for the National Security Council, overseeing covert action and other intelligence programs. He was brought on by Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser. But some former officials criticized Mr. Cohen-Watnick, a former clandestine officer in the Defense Intelligence Agency, as too young for the job, which is usually filled by C.I.A. veterans. Mr. Cohen-Watnick was ousted in August 2017 as part of changes in the White House, one of several appointees of Mr. Flynn who were removed by his replacement, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. National Security Council aides usually draw little public scrutiny, but Mr. Cohen-Watnick was swept up in the tumult of early 2017 when Mr. Trump accused the previous administration, without evidence, of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower. Mr. Trump’s allegations were bolstered by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who said he had evidence that Mr. Trump’s communications were incidentally swept up in surveillance of foreigners by American spy agencies. Mr. Nunes did not divulge the sources of this information, but American officials later told The New York Times that Mr. Cohen-Watnick, at the instruction of two senior White House officials, helped print intelligence reports that later served as Mr. Nunes’s proof. The revelation showed that Mr. Nunes and one of the aides, Michael Ellis, a lawyer in the White House Counsel’s Office, were using intelligence to advance political goals. It also undercut Mr. Nunes’s claims that his information came from whistle-blowers, and revealed that he was eager to aid the Trump administration when he was conducting what was supposed to be an independent investigation of Russian election meddling. Mr. Cohen-Watnick did not provide the intelligence reports to Mr. Nunes. The episode prompted Mr. Nunes to recuse himself from the committee’s inquiry, which devolved into partisan bickering and has effectively ended. "
"MOSCOW — Compared to the sunny, palm-lined offshore tax havens where Russians typically stash their fortunes — think the British Virgin Islands or Cyprus — two chilly, windswept Russian islands would seem to offer little. Yet October Island, a glorified swamp in Russia’s European exclave of Kaliningrad, and Russian Island, a former cow pasture facing the far eastern port of Vladivostok, were highlighted by Moscow this week as potential alternatives. Washington’s imposition of unexpectedly tough sanctions against several leading oligarchs is in many respects a game changer for Russia, with repercussions that are only slowly coming into view. Establishing tax havens within the country was just one reaction by the Kremlin, seemingly caught off guard as aftershocks rippled through currency and financial markets. “Russia has no strategy on how to react to this situation, to these new economic circumstances,” Evgeny Gontmakher, a prominent opposition economist, said. The most immediate effect is being felt by Oleg V. Deripaska and his aluminum giant, Rusal, which has lost about one-third of its value on the Moscow stock exchange. “This is a new stage,” Mr. Gontmakher said. “This is targeting for isolation a very big, export-oriented company. That is very painful.” The ramifications could also be felt by wealthy Russians in London, as Washington warned British banks on Tuesday that they could face severe penalties if they continued dealings with any of 24 Russians named in the sanctions, including seven oligarchs.

"President Trump resembles a Geiger counter: When he emits increasing howls, he is signaling that we’re approaching some radioactive or explosive truth. Trump is said to be near a “meltdown” in his fury at what he describes as “an attack on our country” — by which he means the ongoing criminal investigation of him. It’s a phrase that he has not used about Russia’s interference with our elections, and my guess is that at some point Trump will fire Robert Mueller, directly or indirectly, or curb his investigation. Republicans and Democrats alike are pleading with Trump, begging, for the good of the country: Don’t go there. This is larger than Trump. It is a struggle for the idea of equality before the law. In a narrow sense, firing Mueller might be good for Democrats in November. A Quinnipiac poll this month found that Americans by a 69-percent-to-13-percent majority oppose the firing of Mueller. Even Republicans say by more than a two-to-one ratio that Trump shouldn’t fire Mueller. [While I have you here, I wanted to remind you that you can sign up for my twice-weekly newsletter here.] It may be that Republicans in Congress would get over their indignation, form a protective circle and try to move on, for that’s what has happened every time Trump has committed some new outrage. So I’m not so sure that “it would be suicide” to fire Mueller, as Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, suggested. But even if it wouldn’t quite be suicide, it would be immensely damaging to the entire country. "
"JANESVILLE, Wis. — Not everybody in this quiet, blue-collar city cares much for Paul D. Ryan. But he is undoubtedly of this place, a product of Janesville schools, first elected to Congress from here at only 28 years old. As speaker of the House, he is known as one of the most powerful people in American politics — and also the resident of the red brick Georgian over on St. Lawrence Avenue. So on Wednesday, when Mr. Ryan abruptly announced that he would not run for re-election, people in Janesville said they were stunned that the man once seen as a strong presidential contender appeared to be cutting short his political career. In a place that over decades had seen the universe of manufacturing upended and the working class battered by the loss of well-paying jobs, Mr. Ryan, 48, had seemed a rare constant. Then again, reasoned both Democrats and Republicans in Janesville, who could blame him? Disappointed by the daily chaos in Washington, unnerved by a volatile and emotional president and weary of constant battles within splintering political parties, residents of Mr. Ryan’s district said they understood why he was ready to give up his seat in Congress and retreat to Janesville, the southeastern Wisconsin community where he grew up, where his family still lives and which he has represented for nearly 20 years. “Nobody can do a good job on their own,” said Mel Stankewitcz, 69, a plumber who said he had voted for Mr. Ryan. “I don’t think anyone in Washington is doing what they’re supposed to be doing. They just yell at each other.” Mr. Ryan’s surprise announcement comes in a year of wild and unpredictable political races in Wisconsin, and instantly sent the election in the state’s First Congressional District into turmoil. Republicans set off on a furious scramble for a candidate to replace Mr. Ryan on the ticket in a district that could conceivably swing to Democrats. "
"The Trump administration has always seen Obamacare as an abominable roadblock to the less regulated insurance market it prefers. Last year, it tried to knock it down and failed. Now, it’s building a set of detours. More customers who want to avoid buying health insurance can now find a way out of the law’s individual-mandate penalty, which will disappear completely next year. Those who want skimpy plans not covering maternity care or bills exceeding a set annual amount may soon have that option in many states — provided they don’t have pre-existing conditions. The downside: Many who do want Obamacare-style coverage are going to have to pay more. Obamacare’s many rules about insurance — meant to make coverage accessible to Americans regardless of their health status, and comprehensive enough to cover their needs — still exist. Obamacare plans will still have to cover a basic set of health benefits and accept customers who have a history of illness. But, through a series of regulatory maneuvers, the Trump administration is making the insurance market governed by those rules increasingly optional. Alongside the Obamacare market it couldn’t destroy, it is helping to build a second market, free of many rules, and more like the market that Obamacare replaced. On Monday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces, unveiled a series of policies that Seema Verma, the agency’s administrator, made clear were aimed at working around the health law’s requirements. “Americans shouldn’t be punished by its failure to provide choices,” she said, referring to the Affordable Care Act. “Until the law changes, we won’t stand idly by as Americans suffer.” Rules and other guidance released Monday provide some ways out. People who live in a county where only one insurer offers Obamacare-compliant health plans now can get an exemption to the law’s individual mandate penalties right away. (They’ll go away for everyone next year under legislation passed as part of the tax overhaul.) The administration is allowing older plans that predated Obamacare and that don’t follow all its rules to stick around another year. It’s also allowing health plans to cover a slightly less robust set of benefits, although those changes are mostly marginal. "
"Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg — or perhaps more accurately, members of his staff —  are going to be very busy getting through a stack of homework.   Over two days of congressional hearings this week in which Mr. Zuckerberg was barraged with questions by lawmakers over data privacy, election interference and more, the 33-year-old billionaire was often not able to provide an immediate answer. His standard response in those situations, a variation of “my team will get back to you,” was repeated so often it became an internet meme. Here are all the things that Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to getting back to Congress on. Yes, it’s a long list. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Mr. Grassley on whether his team finds any new examples in which user data was improperly transferred to a third party in breach of Facebook’s terms of service. He also said he would get back to Mr. Grassley on how many outside developers his team has audited to make sure they are following Facebook’s rules. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would follow up with Ms. Feinstein on the exact number of fake accounts Facebook has removed from the social network. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Ms. Cantwell on whether Facebook employees ever worked with Cambridge Analytica to help the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. "
"WASHINGTON — Paul D. Ryan took the helm of the House two and a half years ago, not because he wanted it, but because he was seen as the only lawmaker who could keep Republicans from devouring themselves. They had shut down the government, nearly precipitated a debt crisis and toppled a speaker, John A. Boehner. Mr. Ryan announced his departure on Wednesday with the gaps in the party as evident as ever, but drawn along new fault lines, with nativists and populists following the lead of President Trump, pitted against what remains of Mr. Ryan’s brand of traditional conservatism. The speaker, who once dreamed of a more inclusive party, open to black, Latino and immigrant voters enticed by a youthful, optimistic vision, was being left behind. “I think he’s tired,” said Newt Gingrich, who was driven from his own speakership in 1998. “It’s a combination of dealing with 240 House Republicans, the United States Senate and President Trump. That trio was about enough.” Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker in more than 100 years when he took the job in 2015, and he has managed to maintain an uneasy peace within his fractious conference, an achievement unto itself. He will leave Congress in January satisfied that he fulfilled a career-long dream: passage of a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s tax laws. "
"First, federal authorities seized the classified advertising website Backpage.com last week. Then, a 93-count indictment was unsealed, charging several of its top officials with facilitating prostitution and revealing details about victims including minors as young as 14. Now, President Trump has signed new anti-sex-trafficking legislation into law on Wednesday. The law, which passed Congress with near unanimous bipartisan support, will give prosecutors stronger tools to go after similar sites in the future and suspend liability protections for internet companies for the content on their sites. “You have endured what no person on earth should have to endure,” Mr. Trump said to victims of sex trafficking and their families who attended the signing ceremony in the Oval Office. Before it was shut down, Backpage featured ads like one titled “Get freaky Tuesday,” according to the indictment. There were graphic descriptions of women of different ages and racial backgrounds. The grand jury charged that many of the ads also depicted children who were victims of sex trafficking. The federal investigation into Backpage was long in the works before the legislation passed Congress last month. Craigslist removed its personal ads section shortly after the final vote. The new law will also let state law enforcement officials to pursue sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content, and will allow victims to sue such sites for damages. “This isn’t just about Backpage. There are hundreds of others in this space, this online marketplace,” said Representative Ann Wagner, Republican of Missouri, who sponsored the bill in the House. “To see the impact without this legislation being signed into law yet, in terms of going after these cesspools of crime, is absolutely amazing.” "
"I live in one of those old towns that was not built for cars. Its Main Street is narrow, hedged in with historic stone houses and walls. As commuter traffic has intensified over the past several years, it’s become increasingly dangerous to walk along Main Street. The mayor of my tiny Virginia town has worked incessantly to fix this, by fostering walkability and traffic-calming measures since he ran for town council in the 1990s. I’m determined to help him: I want to walk with my daughter to the playground or the farmer’s market without fearing for her safety. Our mayor is liberal. He drives around town with an Obama ’08 bumper sticker on his car. I am a conservative, pro-life Christian; in 2016, I voted for Evan McMullin for president. But our partisan political differences mean nothing when it comes to caring for this town and making it better. Here at the local level, our interests intertwine: They are practical, achievable, even apolitical. This is localism, a bottom-up, practically oriented way of looking at today’s biggest policy dilemmas. Instead of always or only seeking to fix municipal issues through national policy, localism suggests that communities can and should find solutions to their own particular problems, within their own particular contexts. The best walkability solutions for Washington, D.C., may not work in my town. Urban revitalization efforts in Detroit will need to look different than those efforts employed in rural Iowa. If we’re to find hope and unity for our politics in this fractured era, localism may be the perfect place to start. It hands ownership and power back to those who are most likely to feel hollowed out and powerless in the face of federal stasis. As the Brookings Institution fellows Bruce Katz and Jeremy Nowak write in their new book “The New Localism,” this approach empowers postindustrial cities and dying towns to fix their problems from within, without federal bureaucracy or funds.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Air disaster in Algeria, tough questions for Mark Zuckerberg and a love letter for Chairman Mao. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump, using Twitter posts as geopolitical broadsides, promised that missiles would be fired at Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack and said relations between the U.S. and Russia were worse than ever. Mr. Trump also warned that the Kremlin should not partner with Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, calling him a “Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” Mr. Trump’s early morning tweets were a remarkable instance of telegraphing American strategy. He’s being taken seriously: There were signs that Syria was moving crucial aircraft to a Russian base for protection, and Iran said it would support Mr. Assad in case of foreign aggression. _____ • Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House and a star Republican, will not seek re-election. The announcement blindsided many Republicans and imperils the party’s grip on the House. Republicans had expected Mr. Ryan to help them win midterm elections in November. His decision to leave Congress at 48 sent an undeniably pessimistic message to his party. "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to vote in the coming weeks on bipartisan legislation introduced Wednesday that would allow special counsels like Robert S. Mueller III to appeal their firing to a panel of judges and possibly be reinstated. The committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, was seeking expedited consideration of the bill that would have allowed for a vote as soon as next week. That pace was slowed somewhat by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, his Democratic counterpart, who said the committee needed another week to review an amendment Mr. Grassley planned to offer. The chairman’s request came as many Republicans continue to say that no legislative action is necessary, despite continuing threats from President Trump against Mr. Mueller and senior Justice Department officials. Republican leaders have steadfastly maintained that Mr. Trump knows the consequences of firing Mr. Mueller too well to do so. But Republicans are under pressure to shift their stance. Even if the legislation never passes Congress, a bipartisan committee vote would send a signal to Mr. Trump and push Republican leaders to respond. The compromise bill, written by Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans, and Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both Democrats, would enact a statute codifying an existing Justice Department regulation that says a special counsel may be fired only by the attorney general, and only for good cause, like misconduct. The bill also creates a 10-day window within which a special counsel can seek judicial review of the firing. If it is determined that the special counsel was not, in fact, fired for good cause, then he would be reinstated. In the interim, it would ensure that the special counsel’s staff and investigative materials are preserved. "

"When Scott Pruitt wanted to refashion the Environmental Protection Agency’s “challenge coin” — a type of souvenir medallion with military origins that has become a status symbol among civilians — he proposed an unusual design: Make it bigger, and delete the E.P.A. logo. Mr. Pruitt instead wanted the coin to feature some combination of symbols more reflective of himself and the Trump administration. Among the possibilities: a buffalo, to evoke Mr. Pruitt’s home state, Oklahoma, and a Bible verse to reflect his faith. Other ideas included using the Great Seal of the United States — a design similar to the presidential seal — and putting Mr. Pruitt’s name around the rim in large letters, according to Ronald Slotkin, a career E.P.A. employee who retired this year, and two people familiar with the proposals who asked to remain anonymous because they said they feared retribution. Many agencies have challenge coins to hand out as gifts to employees or guests. The name comes from a military tradition of carrying a coin stamped with an insignia to prove one’s affiliation, if challenged. Mr. Pruitt’s numismatic preferences, laid out last year during his first few months at the agency, raised concerns among senior agency officials, according to Mr. Slotkin and the others. Over the course of several months of discussions, they said, staff members expressed worries that his proposals would cost too much, and that dropping the agency’s seal — a stylized flower — would be a breach of protocol. They urged Mr. Pruitt to consider more modest designs and to drop his objection to the seal. Mr. Slotkin said the proposals appeared to refashion the coin into a keepsake embodying Mr. Pruitt, as opposed to the E.P.A. "
"WASHINGTON — Mick Mulvaney, interim director of the consumer protection agency created during the Obama administration, said on Wednesday he is committed to “enforcing the law” as Democrats questioned his fitness, commitment and legal right to run a bureau he once vowed to kill. Late last year, President Trump gave Mr. Mulvaney, the White House budget director, the additional job of running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans would like to neutralize, if not eliminate. Mr. Mulvaney, who recently called on Congress to cripple the agency and who scrapped a planned action against a payday lender accused of abusive practices shortly after taking the helm, insisted on Wednesday that “we are still going after the bad actors.” He said he had authorized the agency’s lawyers to proceed with “25 cases” initiated by his predecessor Richard Cordray, a Democrat currently running for governor of Ohio. “I have not burned the place down,” said Mr. Mulvaney, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina who vigorously opposed the creation of the bureau, which he once referred to as a “sick, sad joke.” Mr. Mulvaney told members of the House Financial Services Committee that the bureau had reclaimed about $92.6 million from lenders who engaged in abusive or fraudulent practices, though he acknowledged the remittances came from actions begun by Mr. Cordray, who recovered about $12 billion from financial institutions during his tenure. He also said he has not initiated any new enforcement actions or lawsuits since taking the job in November. He said he is “operating in a more restrained way” that included factoring in the impact of the agency’s investigations on the financial health of businesses, a view he has also encouraged the bureau’s employees to adopt.

"When Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi, a 53-year-old Republican man, delivered his State of the State address in 2014, he said, “On this unfortunate anniversary of Roe v. Wade, my goal is to end abortion in Mississippi.” Last month, Bryant signed into law the Gestational Age Act, which bans abortion after 15 weeks (when the fetus is about four inches long and, according to the pregnancy resource “What to Expect,” “the eyes are moving from the sides of the head to the front of the face”) “except in medical emergency and in cases of severe fetal abnormality,” making no exception for rape or incest. A judge has temporarily blocked the law, citing its “dubious constitutionality.” Incidentally, in exchange for his public service, Bryant earns a taxpayer-funded salary of $122,160 a year. People in Bryant’s income bracket who find themselves needing or wanting an abortion after 15 weeks might not think it overly burdensome to travel out of state for medical care. As long as Roe v. Wade stays intact, people of means in any state will have the option to terminate a wanted but tragically nonviable pregnancy safely, will be able to reclaim dominion over their bodies after a rape, will retain access to the full scope of health care, will be free to decide what’s best for their futures. But the median household income in Mississippi, as of 2016, was $40,528. Those without money do not deserve to be less free. Conventional understanding of pro-choice politics tends to fixate on Roe v. Wade as the center of the fight for abortion rights. But though Roe faces genuine peril down the road if the Trump administration gets another Supreme Court appointment, state-level restrictions that aim to shut down abortion clinics are chipping away at the rights of millions of Americans this second. Legality doesn’t mean much without access. If abortion and reproductive health care are important to you, this is your fight. Six states currently have only one abortion care provider. In five of those states — Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming — independent abortion care providers (clinics that are not hospitals, private physicians’ offices or national organizations like Planned Parenthood) operate the only clinic available. In four others — Arkansas, Oklahoma, Georgia and Nevada — independent clinics are the only facilities providing surgical abortions. “Without independent providers, abortion access in these four states would be limited to medication abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy,” said Nikki Madsen, executive director of the Abortion Care Network. According to Abortion Care Network data, nearly 30 percent of independent clinics closed between 2012 and 2017. A pending lawsuit will decide whether Kentucky can shut down its single clinic and become the first state in the nation with no clinics at all. West Virginia’s only clinic is under similar attack from its Legislature. Each time a clinic closes, patients in that region are displaced, sometimes forced to travel hundreds of miles for care — an endeavor that might require missing work (and losing wages) on top of the cost of food, gas, lodging, child care and potentially the procedure itself.

"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has proposed a redesign of the agency’s commemorative coin, an adaptation of longstanding “challenge coins” exchanged among American troops. From a military drinking tradition to civilian government agencies, here is how the coins have evolved and proliferated. Military commanders often give pocket-size medallions, called challenge coins, to service members as a mark of camaraderie. A commander’s unique coin — often copper, bronze or nickel — carries symbols and mottos denoting the unit or office. Coins are usually circular, but also can be pentagons, spades or even dog tags to be worn around the neck. Throughout their service, military members use the coins to prove their allegiance when challenged. High-ranking officers and retirees often display a collection of coins in their offices alongside uniform patches and ribbons as a symbol of pride. “In the military, the coins have always been purely about morale and commitment,” said Tracy English, a historian at the Air Force’s 37th Training Wing at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas. “If you walk into a high-ranking service member’s office with a big magnet, chances are you will die.” Challenge coins were never officially sanctioned, so the history behind the tradition is widely debated among military historians.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is pushing to reach a deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement by the beginning of May. But the timeline could be complicated by its refusal to budge from contentious proposals aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the United States. The administration has not significantly softened its position on rules that automakers would need to meet to qualify for zero tariffs under Nafta, according to a summary of the American proposal reviewed by The New York Times. While the administration has removed a requirement about the percentage of a car that must be made in the United States, it has added other rules that North American automakers say could be costly and complicated to meet. The proposal is throwing a wrinkle into recently revived talks with Canada and Mexico, which had begun to show signs of movement after months of stalled negotiations. But after high-level talks concluded last week, officials on both sides see the administration’s goal of announcing a deal in principle as early as this week as too ambitious. Some in the administration had been pushing for an announcement to coincide with the president’s trip to Peru this weekend to attend the Summit of the Americas, where President Trump was expected to appear alongside leaders from Canada and Mexico. On Tuesday, the White House announced that the president was canceling his trip to focus on the escalating conflict in Syria. Now, negotiators say they are pushing to conclude the agreement by May. Trump administration officials are eager to conclude negotiations quickly, largely because they must secure a deal by May to meet all of the necessary deadlines to have their revised Nafta agreement approved by the current Republican-controlled Congress. Some trade advisers say the possibility of Democrats retaking the majority in the House in November’s midterm elections could put congressional approval of Mr. Trump’s Nafta deal at risk, given that many Democrats oppose Nafta.

Mr. Trump also warned, in reference to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, that the Kremlin should not be allied with a “Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” Here’s what we know about the apparent attack, which took place near Damascus. Above, the aftermath of an explosion this week in Idlib City. Separately, we learned more about Monday’s raid on the office of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. The F.B.I. was seeking all records related to the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape — and any evidence that the lawyer suppressed damaging reports, according to people briefed on the matter. ____ 2. Four years ago this month, dozens of Nigerian schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram. The world responded: #BringBackOurGirls. "
"The latest salvo in the seven-year war in Syria, an apparent chemical attack in the suburb of Douma at dusk on Saturday, has presented a new challenge to a Trump administration that has vowed to strongly respond. But much is still unclear or unconfirmed about the attack, including what action the United States will take and what impact it will have on relationships with allies and adversaries. Syrian government forces prevent access to Douma for journalists, aid workers and investigators. Here’s a brief look at what we know so far, and what remains to be seen as of Wednesday. • About 500 people in Douma, a suburb of Damascus, had symptoms consistent with a chemical attack: burning eyes, breathing problems and white foam coming from their mouths and nostrils, according to several independent medical and rescue groups. • Residents said they heard objects falling from the sky, followed by a strange smell that witnesses said resembled chlorine. • About 70 people died while sheltering in basements, the World Health Organization said. Of them, 43 had signs of being exposed to “highly toxic chemicals.” • Videos circulated by antigovernment activists showed graphic images of families sprawled out in their homes, dead from apparent suffocation. A stream of victims rushed into clinics on Saturday, according to medical and rescue groups. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s advisers insist that the economics profession is solidly behind the administration’s threat to impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. Many top economists say, no, they’re not. Across the ideological spectrum, trade experts and former top economic advisers to presidents say Mr. Trump is right to highlight issues on which China is widely viewed as an offender, such as intellectual-property theft and access to its domestic market. But many of those experts say Mr. Trump’s planned tariffs would backfire — by raising costs to American businesses and consumers, and by inviting retaliation against American exporters. They say he would better serve his purposes by enlisting international allies in a pressure campaign against Beijing. “Many economists have said, yeah, there’s some legitimate issues here,” said Laura D. Tyson, an economist at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. “I haven’t seen any who have said the appropriate response is a series of tariffs on a bunch of goods, most of which don’t have any real link to the underlying issue.” Ms. Tyson and many other economists say it was mistake last year when Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Proponents of that agreement say it would have unified a dozen countries against the Chinese on trade issues. “I don’t think the way the administration is going about it is a particularly strategic one,” said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose research suggests that opening trade with China cost the United States two million jobs in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “The first way to go about it should have been to sign TPP, which was set up as a bulwark against China.” Mr. Trump has long railed against Chinese trade practices, and he has long criticized previous presidents for their approach to the issue. This year, he has pushed aggressively on the issue. He levied tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that were largely viewed as a shot at Chinese oversupply of those metals. Then he proposed as much as $150 billion in tariffs on other imports from China. "
"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’ll have a quick E.P.A. update for you, we’ll look at a surprising contribution to climate science from the 19th century, and we’ll bring you up to speed on newly released Shell documents. In last week’s newsletter we summed up why Scott Pruitt, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, was under fire. (It’s a lot to absorb: ethics scandals over travel, housing, security and staff moves.) Despite the imbroglio, Mr. Pruitt, who has been on a roll in rolling back Obama-era regulations, ostensibly remains in favor with President Trump. A few updates since last week: As our planet warms up, the seasons are shifting in many parts of the world. Spring often arrives earlier, autumn often comes later. And not all species are adjusting their own seasonal habits at the same rate. Some flowers are now blooming before their pollinators emerge. Some birds are arriving at their breeding grounds after the insects they normally feast on have peaked. When different species fall out of sync like this, scientists call it a phenological mismatch. And, as Livia Albeck-Ripka and I reported last week, researchers have already found a few troubling examples where mismatches are having negative consequences for birds and animals, from the pied flycatcher in Europe to the caribou in western Greenland.

"Because we work in newspapers, and are as susceptible to buzzy jargon as the next person, we sometimes refer to “the mix” when we try to explain how we make our assignments or schedule our reviews each week. It’s an amorphous term, redolent of Chex cereal or disco floors or cocktail bars, and not easy to define in the context of books journalism. But this week’s recommended titles offer a perfect illustration of the concept: On the surface, these eight books have little in common, but taken together they add up to a broad snapshot of life today. One novel looks at gun culture; another explores how feminism has changed over the years. There’s the memoir of a woman raised among survivalists, and a look at the Syrian civil war, and a deep investigative dive into the 2016 presidential election and possible Russian interference. Less topical, but still fascinating, is Yunte Huang’s thorough history of the 19th-century conjoined twins Chang and Eng. Finally, because sometimes all you want is an original mind or a great escapist plot, we’ve also found a surreal story collection and a retro thriller and introduced them into the — well, you know. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books INSEPARABLE: The Original Siamese Twins and Their Rendezvous With American History, by Yunte Huang. (Liveright, $28.95.) Yunte Huang’s new book recounts the extraordinary 19th-century lives of Chang and Eng Bunker, the original “Siamese twins.” The brothers went from the humiliations of showcased servitude all across America to a life of Southern comfort in small-town North Carolina, fathering at least 21 children between them and at one point owning as many as 32 slaves. Our critic Jennifer Szalai calls “Inseparable” a “contemplative yet engrossing” history. THE FEMALE PERSUASION, by Meg Wolitzer. (Riverhead, $28.) Of all the political threads that permeate Wolitzer’s 12th novel, the most interesting is the challenge of intergenerational feminism. The book “is speaking to the larger issue of ambition: who has it, what curtails it and what it means to reframe it,” Lena Dunham writes in the Book Review. “But when all is said and done, Wolitzer is an infinitely capable creator of human identities that are as real as the type on this page, and her love of her characters shines more brightly than any agenda.” AETHERIAL WORLDS: Stories, by Tatyana Tolstaya. Translated by Anya Migdal. (Knopf, $25.95.) Tolstaya’s remarkable short stories are all about people haunted by their flashing glimpses of shadow worlds — moments of pure transcendence when the dull plastic coating of reality peels back to reveal something vastly more precious underneath. “Tolstaya is doubly haunted by the past, both by its lostness and by its stubborn refusal to go away,” Lev Grossman writes in his review. “She is blessed, and cursed, with the mystic’s gift of seeing the shades of the departed.” RUSSIAN ROULETTE: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, by Michael Isikoff and David Corn. (Twelve, $30.) Two veterans of Washington political journalism provide a thorough and riveting account of the 2016 election that casts an unfavorable light on both the Democratic and Republican campaigns. This is a book without heroes. Reviewing it, Steven Lee Myers of The Times calls the book “a granular, source-on-the-wall election diary” that is “sure to infuriate readers on both sides of what should be the most urgent question facing the nation today: the vulnerability of our democratic institutions to Russian manipulation.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A trade deal turnaround, the state of threats against Syria and how the sweet potato colonized the world. Here’s what you need to know: • A stunning U-turn. President Trump asked his advisers to look into rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multicountry trade deal that he long and loudly denounced. Mr. Trump withdrew from the trade pact within days of assuming office, but now he’s trying to find ways to protect export-focused American farmers and ranchers, the direct target of China’s aggressive response to his new tariffs. Economists across the political spectrum, meanwhile, say Mr. Trump is right to highlight concerns about trade with China. But many say he would do better to enlist international allies to help pressure Beijing. And China’s leaders have been seeking out experts to gain a better understanding of how to respond to Mr. Trump’s combative trade agenda. _____ "
"After a chemical attack in Syria on Saturday that killed dozens and is suspected to have been launched by the Assad government, President Trump is warning that the United States may strike back. These books will get you up to speed on the seven-year war and highlight those most affected: the country’s people. THE SYRIAN REBELLION
By Fouad Ajami
240 pp. Hoover Institution Press. (2012) In this book, the Middle East scholar Ajami provides crucial historical context for the uprisings in 2011, which precipitated the present war in Syria. Ajami predicted that the country’s complicated history would prove difficult to reconcile. Syria is a religiously and ethnically diverse country composed primarily of Sunni Arabs and a sizable Christian minority, but since the 1970s, it has been ruled by the Assad family, who are members of a Shiite sect called Alawites that make up 12 percent of the population. Hafez al-Assad established a brutal regime from the onset of his reign, and a pivotal moment occurred in 1982, when he squashed an Islamic insurgency in the city of Hama, killing an estimated 30,000 people. When he died in 2000, his son, Bashar, inherited the throne. Bashar’s regime has been no less repressive and much more decadent; his military has killed so many people that the United Nations has had to stop counting. Our reviewer called Ajami’s an “elegant and edifying book, written on the fly, by an observer who retains an almost loving intimacy with his subject.” NO TURNING BACK

"TRENTON — New Jersey significantly altered the future of its energy sector on Thursday, passing two bills that set ambitious goals for expanding renewable power and curtailing greenhouse gases in the state. The bills, which require power companies in New Jersey to generate 50 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and subsidize existing nuclear power plants, mark one of the biggest new policy steps that any state has taken toward cutting greenhouse gases since President Trump was elected. The central piece of legislation, Assembly Bill 3723, sets the renewable energy goal and anchors much of the growth in wind and solar energy, aiming to hit 35 percent renewables by 2025 and eventually 50 percent by 2030. That goal would pull New Jersey in line with some of the leading states on the issue, like New York and California. The bill was passed in tandem with a $300 million annual subsidy to the state’s remaining nuclear power plants, which provide the state with roughly 40 percent of its electricity. Public Service Enterprise Group and Exelon, the utility companies that operate the power plants, say the subsidies are necessary to keep the power plants operational and open. The bills passed by a wide margin in both the Assembly and Senate. Since Mr. Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, 14 Democratic and Republican governors have announced that they would continue to uphold the accord and push forward with their own efforts to reduce emissions. But, to date, new progress has been slow. States like California and New York already had progressive clean-energy policies that were well underway before Mr. Trump took office. And few states have managed to significantly step up policy action; efforts to put a price on carbon failed to pass through legislatures in Washington and Oregon this year. "
"‘The Circus’
When to watch: Sunday, 8 p.m., Showtime
Add it to your Watchlist The first two seasons of “The Circus” are about politics and the news industry — in the first season, amid the suffocation and frustration of the campaign trail, and in the second, amid the stress and tumult of the Trump administration’s first 100 days. The third season kicks off this weekend with a new co-host, Alex Wagner, who has taken over for the disgraced Mark Halperin. Too bad everything is so chill and peaceful and standardized now, and there’s nothing left for “The Circus” to cover. ‘Jane the Virgin’
When to watch: Friday, 9 p.m., the CW
Add it to your Watchlist No other show on TV can cram so many moments of real joy and deep sorrow into one episode, but that’s one of the many things that make “Jane” such a special show. (Also on that list: beautiful performances and inventive narrative formats.) In this penultimate episode of the season, Xiomara (Andrea Navedo) is undergoing chemotherapy and enduring excruciating physical pain alongside the fear and helplessness of being sick. But the episode isn’t torturous — instead, it’s a reminder that love, support, human decency and the occasional pot brownie can make even the hardest times a little easier. ‘Money Heist’
When to watch: Now, on Netflix
Add it to your Watchlist Formerly known as “La Casa de Papel,” this limited Spanish series (in Spanish with subtitles, or dubbed) has been renamed “Money Heist” for American audiences, and fair enough: It’s about a heist at the Royal Mint of Spain. A scarily brilliant mastermind who calls himself the Professor assembles a group of highly capable thieves and plans an elaborate siege designed to take place over several days, which includes essential tasks for the dozens of hostages and a vow that no one will be hurt. At 22 episodes across two seasons, it is too drawn out, but even so, it’s often as tense and exciting as early-era “Lost.” If you want a thriller with visual panache — like freaky Dalí masks — try this.

"What do boys in America think about being boys today? What do they imagine is expected of them? Whom do they look up to, and how are they navigating the transition from being boys to becoming men? In a 2018 Times opinion essay “The Boys Are Not All Right,” the comedian and author Michael Ian Black writes: In this unit, we explore some of the questions Mr. Black, and others, raise, and suggest ways to deconstruct definitions of masculinity as they manifest in our society and our lives.

"To the Editor: Re “The Tragedy of James Comey” (column, April 9): David Leonhardt gets James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in ways many Americans don’t. I never thought for a minute that Mr. Comey sought to change the outcome of the presidential election, the balance of power in the Senate and the philosophical leaning of the Supreme Court. I also have no doubt the aw-shucks Jimmy Stewart impersonator did all three — not out of partisanship or venality, but out of an unspeakably arrogant naïveté and self-absorption. Hillary Clinton’s poll numbers plummeted after Mr. Comey’s October surprise, which left her campaign virtually defenseless as F.B.I. agents reviewed her email messages. Mr. Comey’s Shakespearean-scale blunder put a sword in Mrs. Clinton’s back and led to the election of a dangerous, corrupt buffoon. Regardless of his intentions, his hubris has done our nation more lasting harm than words can capture. DAVID A. SCOTT, COLUMBUS, OHIO To the Editor: David Leonhardt fashions a fairy tale dressed up as a Greek tragedy when claiming that James Comey acted out of “hubris” in an effort to “protect his own fearless image” by speaking “truth to power” when he went public with the reasons for not charging Hillary Clinton. The motivations he attributes to Mr. Comey are utterly misplaced. I’ve known Jim Comey for over 32 years since we were law clerks together. Jim doesn’t have an arrogant bone in his body and would never put any thought of himself above his duty. As for speaking the truth, that is Jim’s nature. If the powerful happen to be in the room, they’ll hear the truth, too. The tragedy in Washington is that there are too few men and women in power who share Jim Comey’s character.

"HANNIBAL, Mo. — Josh Hawley, Missouri’s attorney general, took the stage in this historic Mississippi River town one evening last week, the picture of what the Republican Party wanted for the coming fight to unseat Senator Claire McCaskill this November: young, telegenic and smart. Six years ago, Ms. McCaskill won re-election by intervening in the Republican primary to boost the weakest of her potential Republican opponents, Todd Akin, and then making him the poster boy for his party’s problems with women. This time, it appeared she would have no such luck. That is, until Mr. Hawley and Republicans here were forced to contend with a lurid sex scandal involving the state’s Republican governor. That extramarital relationship has brought accusations of threats of blackmail, a felony indictment and a bipartisan investigation by the state legislature that produced on Wednesday a vivid report of a violent and coercive affair. Mr. Hawley moved quickly to distance himself from the governor, calling the evidence released by a special legislative committee “shocking, substantial and corroborated.” In a statement, he said the report detailed offenses that were “certainly impeachable” and called on the governor, Eric Greitens, to resign immediately. Mr. Greitens hunkered down on Thursday but continued to hemorrhage support. Missouri Republicans, including the majority leader of the State Senate and at least one prominent Republican donor, said it was time for him to quit. Three state senators even implored President Trump to intervene, despite the president’s own problems with sexual misconduct accusations. Meanwhile in court, lawyers for the governor argued that the criminal indictment against him should be thrown out because of prosecutorial misconduct. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, in a sharp reversal, told a gathering of farm-state lawmakers and governors on Thursday morning that the United States was looking into rejoining a multicountry trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal he pulled out of days after assuming the presidency. Mr. Trump’s reconsideration of an agreement he once denounced as a “rape of our country” caught even his closest advisers by surprise and came as his administration faces stiff pushback from Republican lawmakers, farmers and other businesses concerned that the president’s threat of tariffs and other trade barriers will hurt them economically. Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, said in an interview on Thursday with The New York Times that the request to revisit the deal was somewhat spontaneous. “This whole trade thing has exploded,” Mr. Kudlow said. “There’s no deadline. We’ll pull a team together, but we haven’t even done — I mean, it just happened a couple hours ago.” Mr. Trump’s decision to throw out the Trans-Pacific Partnership and his pledge to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement were bedrock promises of his populist campaign, which centered heavily on unfair trade practices that he said had robbed American manufacturers and workers. As he often does, the president started to change gears after hearing complaints from important constituents — in this case, Republican lawmakers who said farmers and other businesses in their states would suffer from his trade approach since they send many of their products abroad. Then late Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to shift gears again, saying in a Twitter post at 11:15 p.m. that he would consider re-entering the agreement only if it were “substantially better” than the deal offered to President Barack Obama. “We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP,” he wrote, “and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!” "
"The speaker of the House’s institutional responsibilities date to the founding of our country, but the modern speakership is focused largely on its political roles: protecting the House majority and advancing the party’s policy goals. Success in one dimension — as Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision to retire reflects — does not always translate into success in the other. In the context of protecting Republican control, there’s little reason to think that Mr. Ryan would be a liability to Republicans’ prospects of holding a majority. A February Politico/Morning Consult poll put Mr. Ryan’s national favorability at an anemic 36 percent, but he has not been used — at least to this point — as a high-profile symbolic figure in Democrats’ campaigns to retake the House of Representatives. An analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project of roughly 300,000 House and Senate campaign ads aired since January 2017 indicates that unfavorable mentions of Mr. Ryan (1.9 percent of airings) were much less common than negative depictions of President Trump (6 percent) and the minority leader, Nancy Pelosi (9.9 percent). The biggest factors affecting what happens in November, according to political science research, are not things like the speaker of the House but so-called fundamentals, like presidential approval, the state of the economy and the number of seats the majority party is defending. And the president’s party is almost always likely to take a beating; in only three midterm elections since 1934 has the party controlling the White House gained seats. Mr. Ryan’s retirement is not likely to break these trends. So let’s assume Mr. Ryan isn’t an exceptional Republican political liability. What about on policy? We can assess his record by looking at what bills the speaker decided to consider in the House. For that, there are two dynamics to assess: One involves keeping things off the agenda that could split the party, even if they could pass the House with votes chipped in from the other party. As Dennis Hastert, a former speaker, put it, “The job of the speaker is not to expedite legislation that runs counter to the wishes of the majority of the majority.” The second dynamic entails advancing policies favored by his party. As speaker, Mr. Ryan has proved successful at the first. Take, for example, the recent stalemate on immigration. At various points over the past several months, the speaker has kept several immigration proposals — endorsed by both more and less conservative wings of his caucus — off the House floor, protecting some members from purple or blue districts from potentially difficult votes while also avoiding pushback from his most conservative bloc for advancing a more moderate bill.

"LONDON — Airlines are avoiding Syrian airspace as the United States and other Western powers consider their response to a suspected chemical attack near Damascus last weekend. The European Aviation Safety Agency, a European Union organization, issued an alert on Tuesday, prompting a number of airlines to steer away from the country’s airspace. “Due to the possible launch of airstrikes into Syria,” the agency said, “due consideration needs to be taken when planning flight operations.” The alert cited the possible use of air-to-ground and cruise missiles and the likely disruption of radio navigation equipment. The agency’s alert was transmitted by a system called Eurocontrol, which acts as the air traffic controller for the Continent. A spokesman for Eurocontrol said Thursday that the warning was not mandatory. “The notification was more of advice to the airlines, rather than instructions,” said the spokesman, who in line with agency protocol declined to be identified. Many airlines decided not to take any chances. On Thursday, the sky over Syria was largely empty of commercial aircraft, creating a conspicuous hole in the otherwise busy airspace of the Middle East. Air France and easyJet have rerouted flights, Reuters reported, and a spokeswoman for Lufthansa said that all airlines in the German group “have been avoiding part of the airspace referred to in the warning, including Syria, for some time now.” British Airways declined to comment. Federal Aviation Administration rules already prohibited American airlines from flying over Syria, but carriers outside Europe also reacted to the Eurocontrol warning. Kuwait Airways announced on Twitter on Thursday that it would not operate any flights to Beirut and would avoid the airspace around Lebanon, which includes Syria. Middle East Airlines, the Lebanese flag carrier, issued a statement on Wednesday announcing the rescheduling of some of its flights until Friday evening. “Due to the recent security situation between U.S. and Syria, and as a precautionary measure,” the airline said, “Middle East Airlines will be modifying the routing of some of its flights, which will affect their departure times.” The Eurocontrol spokesman said such alerts were not uncommon. For example, he said, “a few years ago, there was a warning about Russia firing missiles from naval assets in the Caspian Sea.” The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014 was a grim reminder of the risks to commercial jets flying into conflict zones. The Boeing 777 plane, which had been bound for Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, from Amsterdam, was hit by a surface-to-air missile, and all 298 people onboard were killed. An international team of prosecutors concluded that a surface-to-air missile system used to shoot down the jetliner came from Russian territory and was returned to Russia afterward. Investigators also faulted the Ukrainian government for having failed to close the airspace over the battle zone to civil aviation. "
"To the Editor: Re “The Failures of Anti-Trumpism” (column, April 10): David Brooks is right that those who want to resist President Trump should ignore his tweet-fueled personal drama and “focus instead on the social problems that gave rise to Trumpism.” But Mr. Brooks is wrong to focus on changing the minds of confirmed Trump-supporting Republicans as a measure of success. A growing majority of Democrats, moderate Republicans and independents opposes Mr. Trump and his policies. The key to success is to unify and motivate this coalition to win the midterm elections. True believers in Mr. Trump who get their news only from Fox and their marching orders from white supremacists or the alt-right cannot be converted by argument. The forces of democracy and the rule of law must come together in a big tent to win in November to preserve our Republic, and there is no use wasting time seeking to convert the willfully blind. ERIC W. ORTS, PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: There are roughly three groups of Trump voters. The first are the people who always vote Republican. This is regrettable but normal. There are always people who vote party first. The second are people who could “never vote for Hillary.” This too is regrettable but normal. The third group are the people who voted for Mr. Trump because they felt that he 1) heard their complaints; 2) offered simple solutions to their problems; and 3) didn’t make them feel put down. Take a 50-year-old laid-off mill worker. Democrats tell him 1) his job was horrible because it polluted and is not sustainable and 2) he has to go back to school, learn a new job and start all over at the bottom of the ladder. "
"BENGHAZI, Libya — Pulverized buildings daubed with the names of fallen fighters line the ghostly seafront in Benghazi, Libya’s second largest city. Land mines and booby-trapped bodies are scattered across the rubble. At night, men huddle over bonfires piled with broken furniture. This picture of devastation is what victory looks like for Gen. Khalifa Hifter, the military strongman whose forces routed the last Islamist militias from Benghazi in December. After three years of grinding combat, and with the help of foreign allies, General Hifter now controls most of eastern Libya and has become the most powerful if polarizing figure in a fractured landscape. Now, as he aims to consolidate and expand his power, he is looking to woo the Trump administration. In December, he hired a firm of Washington lobbyists to burnish his image as a potential future leader of his country, and to counter critics who denounce him as a crude warlord. He has already allowed the C.I.A. to establish a base in Benghazi — a low-key American return to the city after Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was killed there in 2012 — and a handful of American Special Forces operators are present at an air base near the city, American officials said. The nomination of the C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state could further align General Hifter with the United States. Mr. Pompeo, whose confirmation hearing took place Thursday, and Mr. Hifter, a onetime C.I.A. asset, are avowedly hostile to all forms of political Islam. But General Hifter’s ascent has been called into question with news that the 75-year-old commander had been airlifted to a hospital in Paris, where French news media reported that he was being treated for a stroke. After initial denials, his aides privately conceded on Thursday that he had undergone emergency medical treatment. But they offered no specifics about his condition or his whereabouts. "
"WASHINGTON — A former Secret Service agent, with a background investigating the Gambino crime family, is serving as the chief of security for Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and has helped build an unusual and costly protective apparatus around him. The agent, Pasquale Perrotta, has clashed — at least once physically — with top E.P.A. officials who challenged Mr. Pruitt’s spending, and has steered at least one E.P.A. security contract to a business associate, according to interviews with current and former senior agency officials. Officially, Mr. Perrotta leads Mr. Pruitt’s protective detail, but he plays a far larger role at the E.P.A., offering security justifications for management, personnel and spending decisions, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly and feared retribution. Mr. Perrotta’s outsize influence has placed him at the center of inquiries by the E.P.A. inspector general’s office into excessive spending and possible violations of contracting rules by Mr. Pruitt’s administration, according to the senior officials. When Mr. Pruitt and his team became convinced that his office might have been bugged by environmentalists or disgruntled career employees, Mr. Perrotta recommended that a sweep for surveillance devices be conducted by a company owned by Edwin Steinmetz, who is listed as a vice president at a security firm Mr. Perrotta operates on the side, the senior officials said. Mr. Perrotta also used agency funds to hire Italy-based private security guards to protect Mr. Pruitt during a trip to Italy, they said. A scathing six-page letter, sent Thursday to Mr. Pruitt by a group of Democratic lawmakers, criticized Mr. Pruitt’s lodging and security choices on that trip. While in Italy, Mr. Pruitt “refused to stay at hotels recommended by the U.S. Embassy, although the recommended hotel had law enforcement and other U.S. resources on site,” according to the letter, in which the lawmakers ask Mr. Pruitt to turn over documents related to the claims. Instead, Mr. Pruitt chose to stay “at more expensive hotels with fewer standard security resources,” while bringing along his own security team “at taxpayer expense.” "
"A HIGHER LOYALTY
Truth, Lies, and Leadership
By James Comey
290 pages. Flatiron Books. $29.99. In his absorbing new book, “A Higher Loyalty,” the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey calls the Trump presidency a “forest fire” that is doing serious damage to the country’s norms and traditions. “This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,” Comey writes. “His leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty.” Decades before he led the F.B.I.’s investigation into whether members of Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, Comey was a career prosecutor who helped dismantle the Gambino crime family; and he doesn’t hesitate in these pages to draw a direct analogy between the Mafia bosses he helped pack off to prison years ago and the current occupant of the Oval Office. A February 2017 meeting in the White House with Trump and then chief of staff Reince Priebus left Comey recalling his days as a federal prosecutor facing off against the Mob: “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.” An earlier visit to Trump Tower in January made Comey think about the New York Mafia social clubs he knew as a Manhattan prosecutor in the 1980s and 1990s — “The Ravenite. The Palma Boys. Café Giardino.” The central themes that Comey returns to throughout this impassioned book are the toxic consequences of lying; and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty to an individual over truth and the rule of law. Dishonesty, he writes, was central “to the entire enterprise of organized crime on both sides of the Atlantic,” and so, too, were bullying, peer pressure and groupthink — repellent traits shared by Trump and company, he suggests, and now infecting our culture.

Comey: By the Book] “We are experiencing a dangerous time in our country,” Comey writes, “with a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded.” "
"Federal officials added new urgency on Thursday to the hunt for a drug kingpin convicted of orchestrating the 1985 death of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, announcing that the fugitive had been added to the F.B.I.’s 10 most wanted list. The notorious kingpin, Rafael Caro Quintero, who rose to prominence as a marijuana and cocaine trafficker in the 1980s, has evaded the authorities since he was released on a legal technicality from a Mexican prison in 2013. Mr. Caro Quintero was serving a 40-year sentence for the kidnapping, torture and murder of Enrique Camarena, known as Kiki, who was working undercover in Mexico as a D.E.A. agent. The announcement on Thursday put new pressure on the Mexican authorities in a case that has long been a source of friction. Tensions between the two countries are already high, as President Trump has incorrectly called Mexico the “most dangerous country in the world,” and has pointed to its problems with violence as justification for his proposed border wall. The move also comes as the United States and Mexico struggle to contain a cartel-fueled drug trade streaming across the southwestern border. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis took pains to walk back President Trump’s threat of an imminent strike against the Assad regime in Syria. Speaking before the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Mattis said that retaliation for a suspected chemical weapons attack on Douma had to be balanced against the threat of a wider war between Russia, Iran and the West. British and French officials were also discussing military options. We interviewed survivors of that attack and reviewed videos and flight records to verify what occurred. “It was a scene that you don’t want anyone to have to see,” said one man who heard people run into the street, yelling: “Chemicals! Chemicals!” At least 43 people were killed. ____ 2. In a stunning U-turn, President Trump asked his advisers to look into rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal he withdrew from within days of taking office. "
"The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, privately fumed on Thursday that his own staff had been leaking confidential information “to make me look bad,” hours after a federal appeals court questioned whether he could legally run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau while simultaneously heading the budget office. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit expressed support for the president’s legal right to appoint an interim director of the consumer agency. But two of the three jurists — Patricia A. Millett and Judith W. Rogers, both Democratic appointees — raised doubts about Mr. Mulvaney’s dual roles, citing the legal provision that created the bureau. The legal question surrounding Mr. Mulvaney’s appointment stems from a case brought by Leandra English, a former top consumer bureau official who was installed late last year as acting director by the agency’s departing director, Richard Cordray. President Trump bypassed Ms. English and instead installed Mr. Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director, to run both agencies. Ms. English sued, claiming she was legally entitled to the title of interim director. The questions about his dual roles came as Mr. Mulvaney was on Capitol Hill for a second day, offering a feisty defense of his controversial tenure at the watchdog agency. For two hours, Mr. Mulvaney parried questions from Senate Democrats on the Banking Committee about why enforcement actions against shady businesses appeared to have stalled under his watch and why the members of the staff that he installed were receiving such handsome salaries — in some cases more than $200,000 per year. Mr. Mulvaney defended his actions as lawful, painting himself as a humble bureaucrat and reformer. “I’m not seeking to undermine the mission of the bureau,” Mr. Mulvaney insisted, adding that he no longer wanted it to be a regulatory “black hole.” "
"It’s been a busy week at the White House. President Trump promised to strike Syria and warned Russia against supporting Bashar al-Assad. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, also claimed that the president believes he has the legal authority to fire Robert S. Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia investigation. "
"Why did Paul Ryan choose not to run for re-election? What will be the consequences? Your guess is as good as mine — literally. I can speculate based on what I read in the papers, but so can you. On the other hand, I do have some insight into how Ryan — who has always been an obvious con man, to anyone willing to see — came to become speaker of the House. And that’s a story that reflects badly not just on Ryan himself, not just on his party, but also on self-proclaimed centrists and the news media, who boosted his career through their malfeasance. Furthermore, the forces that brought Ryan to a position of power are the same forces that have brought America to the edge of a constitutional crisis. About Ryan: Incredibly, I’m seeing some news reports about his exit that portray him as a serious policy wonk and fiscal hawk who, sadly, found himself unable to fulfill his mission in the Trump era. Unbelievable. Look, the single animating principle of everything Ryan did and proposed was to comfort the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted. Can anyone name a single instance in which his supposed concern about the deficit made him willing to impose any burden on the wealthy, in which his supposed compassion made him willing to improve the lives of the poor? Remember, he voted against the Simpson-Bowles debt commission proposal not because of its real flaws, but because it would raise taxes and fail to repeal Obamacare. And his “deficit reduction” proposals were always frauds. The revenue loss from tax cuts always exceeded any explicit spending cuts, so the pretense of fiscal responsibility came entirely from “magic asterisks”: extra revenue from closing unspecified loopholes, reduced spending from cutting unspecified programs. I called him a flimflam man back in 2010, and nothing he has done since has called that judgment into question. So how did such an obvious con artist get a reputation for seriousness and fiscal probity? Basically, he was the beneficiary of ideological affirmative action. "
"WASHINGTON — With tax rates falling, spending rising and deficits soaring, House Republicans dusted off a long-debated proposal on Thursday to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget — only to watch it fail. The amendment was supported by 233 House members but opposed by 184 others, leaving it well short of the two-thirds support needed for approval under the Constitution. The amendment was almost certainly going nowhere, since it would have needed a two-thirds vote in the Senate as well, followed by ratification by three-quarters of the states. In the abstract, the vote on Thursday was an opportunity for Republicans in the House to demonstrate their concern for the government’s fiscal health, even if recent actions by their party suggest otherwise. But the symbolic move was derided on both sides of the aisle. “It is an effort to fool the American people into believing that this Congress is financially responsible when quite clearly, based on the votes of the past year, it is wholly and completely irresponsible,” said Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, who nonetheless voted for the proposal. Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the Koch brothers, was similarly unimpressed. “If lawmakers think they can use a balanced-budget amendment as a fig leaf of fiscal responsibility after just voting for such an irresponsible spending bill,” he said, “they should think again.” "
"WASHINGTON — One day after he stunned fellow Republicans by announcing his retirement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan moved on Thursday to tamp down a succession fight, throwing his weight behind his second-in-command, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. But Mr. Ryan’s surprise exit, and his pledge to remain in his office until his term expires in January, set the stage for an unpredictable — and possibly unruly — leadership battle, with the ideological direction of the conference at stake. Mr. McCarthy’s ascension is hardly assured; the last time Mr. McCarthy sought the speakership, he angered Republicans with a series of gaffes, then withdrew for lack of support from hard-line conservatives. If he stumbles again, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the Republican whip, would be there to step in — and take the conference in a still more conservative direction. In an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Mr. Scalise said he did not intend to challenge Mr. McCarthy. “I’ve never run against Kevin and wouldn’t run against Kevin,” he said. Mr. Ryan, addressing reporters at his regular weekly news conference, apparently picked up on Mr. Scalise’s comment — and used it to project a sense of unity. “I was encouraged that Steve Scalise this morning said that he thinks that after the election, Kevin McCarthy ought to be the person to replace me,” Mr. Ryan said. “I think that’s encouraging because what it shows you is that we have an intact leadership team that supports each other, that’s all heading in the right direction.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department has relinquished some of its authority over implementation of the Trump tax cuts, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ceding the ability to review regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is headed by Mick Mulvaney. An agreement announced on Thursday by two of President Trump’s top economic advisers marks the end of a monthslong turf war that some tax experts feared could delay rollout of the law. The agreement centralizes more power within the White House, giving it more control over how the tax bill, including some of its murkier provisions, is interpreted. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul was rushed through Congress late last year and has left many lingering questions that the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, which is part of the department, have been scrambling to answer. Key among those are what kinds of businesses qualify as “pass-through” companies that are eligible for a new 20 percent deduction and how broadly to apply the international tax provisions aimed at preventing large companies from shifting profits overseas. Last year Mr. Trump called for a review of the Treasury’s exemption from the usual practice of the budget office doing cost-benefit analyses of regulations issued by government agencies, sparking a turf war between Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Mnuchin. Under the new agreement, the White House budget office will review Treasury regulations that could create interference or inconsistencies with regulations from other agencies. It would also assess regulations that raise “novel” legal or policy issues, such as penalizing conduct through the tax code. And regulations that have a revenue effect on the economy of more than $100 million will receive additional scrutiny. In its effort to maintain control over tax guidance, Treasury officials argued that giving the budget office final say would create additional layers of red tape that could slow implementation of a law the administration is hoping will provide an economic boost. They also argued that the budget office did not have sufficient tax policy expertise to properly scrutinize complex regulations. "
"WASHINGTON — With bipartisan agreement, members of Congress said this week that Silicon Valley needed to be reined in with new regulations after Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, failed to allay concerns over the company’s mishandling of user privacy. But time and again, when the most pressing issues have landed on Capitol Hill — like gun violence, school shootings, immigration and border control — Congress has declared five-alarm fires only to fail to follow through on major legislation. The current zest for new privacy laws is also likely to stall as lawmakers wrestle with the technical complexities and constitutional vexations sure to emerge with any legislation to control content on the internet. “I think we need to be careful,” cautioned Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. “I think there are a number of different ideas, but I don’t think anything has coalesced in terms of a consensus.” For the public, watching the many bursts of fireworks from Congress and the quick after-fizzle can be dizzying. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for internet regulation, warned voters not to expect much. “I hate to be such a pessimist, but I don’t believe the Republicans will end up doing anything,” he said. “I just don’t have any faith in their willingness to regulate to protect privacy in the context of Facebook.” Beyond the typical political gridlock that has stymied action in Congress, technology and the companies that sell access to it are particularly protected.

"LOS ANGELES — The Justice Department cannot require that local police departments help immigration agents in order to receive federal funding, a federal judge has ruled. The ruling is a significant victory for local governments that have opposed the Trump administration’s stance on immigration and vowed to stay out of enforcement efforts. United States District Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles issued a permanent, national injunction against the federal funding rules, giving the city an important win in a long-running legal battle with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the White House. The ruling is “a complete victory,” Mike Feuer, the Los Angeles city attorney, said Thursday. “This is yet another dagger in the heart of the administration’s efforts to use federal funds as a weapon to make local jurisdictions complicit in its civil immigration enforcement policies.” A Justice Department spokesman, Devin M. O’Malley, suggested an appeal was likely. The federal government is legally entitled to give priority in its grant funding to local governments “that prioritize the safety of their communities and their law enforcement officers when they promise to cooperate with federal immigration authorities seeking information about illegal aliens who have committed crimes,” he said in a statement. “Unfortunately,” he added, “the court not only rejected this common-sense conclusion, but it chose to issue a permanent nationwide injunction that is overbroad and inconsistent with the rule of law. We look forward to continuing the strong defense of our position.” "
"We took last week off for spring break, but students all over the country were still enthusiastically commenting on our daily writing prompts. So, this week, we chose the seven that were most popular in late March and early April and rounded up our favorite responses below. But while we have you, we want to mention something we’ve noticed. Over the course of this school year, we’ve seen the writing on our prompts get better and better, and we’re thrilled. However, lately we’ve also seen more and more students, perhaps at the behest of their teachers, go even further, posting multi-part formal essays, complete with in-text citations. But unlike our contests, where we hope for that kind of formal composition, here what we prize is conversational writing in which your real voices come through — almost as if you were simply raising your hands in class to add to the conversation. Below, you can find many examples of that kind of lively informal writing, but we’d like to call out one student in particular who does a notably good job writing about hot-button issues. Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C.: We like how thoughtfully you write, how you often you acknowledge other sides, and how you always keep your side of the discussion civil. Thank you.

"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Democratic primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, are poised to face their first consequential battle as early as this weekend, as they vie for one of New York’s most coveted progressive endorsements: the Working Families Party. The blessing of the small but influential coalition of labor unions and progressive activists is seen as an early test of the depth of liberal unhappiness with Mr. Cuomo and the potential energy around Ms. Nixon. The party endorsed Mr. Cuomo in both 2010 and 2014, although it did so reluctantly four years ago. The party’s convention, where a nominee will be formally chosen, is not until next month, but the 200-plus state committee members are gathering in Albany on Saturday and could jump the gun to deliver a shock endorsement, according to a half-dozen party officials. “I’m anticipating there might be a resolution that the party would endorse Cynthia Nixon,” said David Schwartz, an influential state committee member from Westchester County. If Ms. Nixon were to win the Working Families Party’s nomination and run as its candidate in November, and Mr. Cuomo were to win the Democratic primary, they would be in competition for voters — to the potential benefit of the Republican candidate. Ahead of the party’s vote, Ms. Nixon and Mr. Cuomo — either personally or through their emissaries — have been trying to seal up support. "
"BEIJING — In an elegantly furnished back room at a conference in eastern China in December, a member of the Chinese leadership asked American tech executives for help. The official, Wang Huning, a Communist Party strategist who has spent much of his career sizing up the United States as a geopolitical rival, wanted to know whether President Trump was serious about a trade war with China — and whether his American visitors could serve as a channel of communication to the White House. He has not been alone. For the past few months, some of the most powerful men in China — allies of President Xi Jinping with longstanding ties and deep experience with the United States — have been casting about for a better understanding of Mr. Trump and how to respond to his combative trade agenda, according to several people they have consulted. Vice President Wang Qishan has met in recent weeks with a series of American business leaders and former cabinet officials to question them about Mr. Trump’s trade threats. Liu He, the Politburo member coordinating economic policy, has done the same. One longtime China scholar in the United States said five officials had visited him seeking advice in the past two weeks alone. In these meetings, the Americans have warned that Mr. Trump’s complaints should be taken seriously because of widespread frustration in Washington with Chinese policies, especially a $300 billion program to dominate critical high-tech industries, known as Made in China 2025, that has alarmed the United States national security establishment. It is unclear whether that message is making it through to Mr. Xi — or whether he has chosen to ignore it after concluding that Mr. Trump is bluffing and that the United States will back off, as it has in the past. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump has in his first year marginalized American diplomats, sought to slash the State Department’s budget and reversed crucial pieces of his predecessor’s economic and diplomatic opening to Cuba. But Mike Pompeo promised on Thursday to reverse nearly all of that if he becomes the next secretary of state. In five hours of testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pompeo, now the C.I.A. director, said he was hoping for a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis, still believed that the Iran nuclear deal could be saved, disagreed with the president’s assertion that poor relations with Russia had been caused by the special counsel’s investigation and, perhaps most remarkably, promised to defend gay rights around the world. He was voluble, charming and gracious, which meant he was the opposite of how he had presented himself during the 2015 Benghazi hearings, the last time he had the nation’s attention. Then, he was the scowling, scathing attack dog hounding Hillary Clinton. On Thursday, he smiled throughout the hearing, occasionally even agreeing with Democrats. “At the State Department, there are too many holes, too many vacancies, too many unfilled positions,” Mr. Pompeo said in one of his many promises to restore the department to its former glory after his predecessor, Rex W. Tillerson, pushed out hundreds of diplomats. The vow was greeted with relief by nearly all on the panel. Under persistent questioning, Mr. Pompeo said he had spoken to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. But Mr. Pompeo refused to describe what he had said, maintaining that he was at the hearing to discuss foreign policy. His testimony in both tone and substance was so different from his past statements and profile as a Tea Party congressman from Wichita, Kan., that Democrats on the committee were left puzzled and, almost despite themselves, delighted. Gone was any hint of the warmonger his critics have portrayed him as. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. An imminent missile strike on Syria, tough questions for Mark Zuckerberg and an air disaster in Algeria. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump, using Twitter posts as geopolitical broadsides, promised that missiles would be fired at Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack and said relations between the U.S. and Russia were worse than ever. Mr. Trump also warned that the Kremlin should not partner with Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, calling him a “Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” Mr. Trump’s early morning tweets were a remarkable instance of telegraphing American military strategy. He’s being taken seriously: There were signs that Syria was moving crucial aircraft to a Russian base for protection, and Iran said it would support Mr. Assad in the event of foreign aggression. Planning a strike will involve delicate considerations. If it is too expansive, it could deepen the conflict with Russia or Iran, but a restrained operation might not change Mr. Assad’s thinking. _____ "
"My grandma, one of the millions of Syrians who have been internally displaced by war, just turned 90 amid the news of the chemical attack last week in the city of Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus. A mother of six children, she once lived in what has become a scene of utter destruction in the region known as Ghouta. Appalling images of the chemical attacks now are making headlines as President Trump threatens retribution, with the risk of raising the carnage to a new level. But the chemical attack is not what concerns many Syrians the most. The civil war, well into its seventh year, has made death part of daily life. And while the violence is often carried out with conventional weapons, the attack last week was not the first time weapons of mass destruction have been used in Syria. What matters most to Syrians is the sheer scale of killing and displacement, not what weapon has been used to cause it. And what worries my grandma is whether she can ever return to live in her ruined house. Recently, such a return seemed possible, thanks to a lull in violence after the Syrian regime made military advances in eastern Ghouta. The government forces now control many cities in those once very green and peaceful eastern suburbs of Damascus. But now eastern Ghouta’s beautiful agricultural landscape has again become a theater of extreme violence and inhumanity, recently described as “hell on earth” by the United Nations. Back in August 2013, the area was subjected to a chemical attack that left some 1,400 dead. Although my grandma is old, she follows the ebb and flow of developments on the battlefield that she still considers her neighborhood — a region where she spent more than 70 years. Dreading the probable impact of the terrible news, her children have not yet told her that her house has been destroyed and looted. So she continues to want to return as soon as possible, and her family continues to put her off. "
"TEL AVIV — On Wednesday, Israel observed Yom Hashoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is one of the most important days on the country’s calendar, observed with innumerable ceremonies and gatherings. At many of these, a motto will be recited: “To remember, not to forget.” Of course, in Israel no one forgets. One reason is that in this country, the Holocaust is not merely a matter of historical remembrance. It is part of our present. Many of Israel’s founders believed the Jewish state was necessary because the Jewish people would always be under the threat of destruction, others could not be relied upon to protect the Jews, and the preservation of the Jewish people required a country of their own. Or, to put it with typical Israeli directness, “to rely only on ourselves.” In 2011, I interviewed Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister, in his Tel Aviv office, on a subject that was at the time highly classified. Four years earlier, when he was in office, the Mossad had learned that North Korea was building an atomic reactor in northern Syria to be used for making nuclear weapons. Mr. Olmert asked the United States to destroy the facility, but President George W. Bush declined. Israeli leaders took this as proof that the United States would not take serious risks to protect Israel, especially in the period after the invasion of Iraq. “So what did you do?” I asked Mr. Olmert. He pointed at a photograph on the wall behind him. It showed three Israeli F-15 fighter planes flying over the railroad tracks and gate of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. In the picture, which the commander of the Israeli Air Force had given to Mr. Olmert, he had written, “The Israeli Air Force over Auschwitz; in the name of the Jewish people, the State of Israel; to remember and not to forget; to rely only on ourselves.” “I decided to act in accordance with that rule,” Mr. Olmert told me. On the night between Sept. 5 and 6, 2007, the Israeli Air Force bombed the reactor and destroyed it. Mr. Olmert gave the order despite warnings from the C.I.A., as well as some high-ranking Israelis, that such an attack could cause President Bashar al-Assad to start a war against Israel. Last month, the Israeli military lifted the ban that had prevented Israeli media from reporting that Israel had bombed the Syria reactor; the military’s communications office even released video footage and documents related to the attack. Why now, more than 10 years later? It was intended to send a clear message: Israel would not permit the construction of military and intelligence infrastructure in Syria by Iran and Hezbollah. "
"WASHINGTON — House speakers historically exit amid political intrigue, mounting scandal or humiliating rejection by the voters. By contrast, Paul D. Ryan’s disclosure on Wednesday that he would step aside at the end of the year was quite calm and businesslike even as he gave that most Washington of reasons — more time with the family. But the matter-of-fact way Mr. Ryan handled this bit of personal news belied the tumult that is certain to follow the unusually timed announcement that he would not seek re-election, essentially throwing his party’s leadership up for grabs seven months before an election that will decide whether his successor as speaker will be a Democrat or a Republican. For starters, the Ryan departure is sure to fuel a growing sense that House Republicans are in real trouble given that the top man wants to escape gracefully before being forced out. It will create a power vacuum in the already unruly House even as his top two lieutenants, Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, maneuver to take Mr. Ryan’s place. It will hurt party fund-raising while intensifying enthusiasm among charged-up Democrats who believe they have Mr. Ryan’s Republicans on the run. It could spur more retirements by Republicans. It could cement the impression that President Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party is complete if there is no room for a free-trading, happy warrior like Mr. Ryan. In short, it is likely to create a real mess. “His decision to retire today is not helpful in the overall picture of re-election of a House Republican majority,” Thomas M. Reynolds, a former New York congressman who oversaw the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a bit of diplomatic understatement. “Nobody is saying this is over just yet, but there is a very significant change in the dynamic based on his choice to retire.” "
"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, insisted on staying in luxury hotels that were costlier than allowed by government standards, while also pushing to fly on an airline not on the government’s approved list so he could accrue more frequent flier miles, one of his top former deputies at agency has told congressional investigators. The new allegations are detailed in a scathing six-page letter signed by two senators and three House lawmakers — all Democrats — whose staff members met this week with Kevin Chmielewski, who served as the E.P.A.’s deputy chief of staff until he was removed from his post after raising objections to this and other spending. In a separate letter on Thursday, Democratic lawmakers also demanded information about two previously unknown E.P.A. email addresses that have been used by Mr. Pruitt, asking if they were a tool for withholding public information from records requests. Their letter echoes a controversy in 2012, during the Obama administration, when Lisa P. Jackson, who was E.P.A. chief at the time, was criticized for a similar use of an undisclosed E.P.A. email account. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said the agency had consistently searched all email addresses associated with Mr. Pruitt when responding to records requests. Of the allegations outlined to lawmakers by Mr. Chmielewski, he said, “We will respond to members of Congress through the proper channel.” Ms. Jackson, who was President Obama’s first E.P.A. administrator, came under fire from Republican lawmakers when it was found that she used a secondary E.P.A. email address, under the name “Richard Windsor,” for government correspondence. The name was a combination of Ms. Jackson’s family dog growing up and her hometown, East Windsor Township, in New Jersey. According to Thursday’s six-page letter from lawmakers, Mr. Chmielewski told congressional staff members during a meeting this week that Mr. Pruitt would often seek to schedule trips back to Oklahoma, where he still owns a home, so he could stay there for weekends. “Find me something to do,” were the instructions Mr. Pruitt gave his staff, after telling them he wanted to travel to particular destinations, the letter says, quoting Mr. Chmielewski, who was expected to sign off on the trips. "
" Last fall the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw from Unesco, the cultural organization of the United Nations that is known to travelers for its list of World Heritage sites. The withdrawal is scheduled to go into effect at the end of 2018. There are 23 World Heritage sites in the United States, including Grand Canyon National Park, Independence Hall, Yellowstone National Park and the Statue of Liberty. The World Heritage program, which began in 1972, includes a list of 1,073 sites “that are of outstanding universal value to humanity,” and should therefore “be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy,” according to Unesco’s website. But in 2011 the United States stopped funding Unesco, standing with Israel when Palestine was admitted to the organization (legislation from the 1990s requires a cutoff of American funding to United Nations agencies that accept Palestine as a full member). Yet despite cuts in funding — United States contributions were 22 percent of Unesco’s yearly budget or about $70 million before the 2011 funding cutoff — travelers would not experience a direct impact when visiting World Heritage sites, according to George Papagiannis, the chief of media services at Unesco headquarters in Paris. “Maintenance and preservation of the sites is the responsibility of the host country,” Mr. Papagiannis said in a telephone interview. “But we do hold countries accountable to maintaining their sites in accordance with the World Heritage Convention.” Sites are monitored with conservation reports that all countries are required to file every six years. While there would be no immediate consequences for World Heritage sites, the withdrawal by the United States may affect Unesco in other ways. According to Dr. Stefan Simon, the director of Global Cultural Heritage Initiatives at Yale University, “With the U.S. once responsible for approximately 22 percent of Unesco’s budget, of course the announced withdrawal is detrimental, and would painfully reduce Unesco’s ability to fulfill its important missions, such as advancing and promoting literacy, gender equality, freedom of expression and scientific collaboration.” If the United States withdraws from Unesco, it would remain a state party, having signed and ratified the World Heritage Convention. “There is one consequence only,” Mr. Papagiannis said about the United States withdrawal. “The U.S. cannot be elected to the World Heritage Committee,” a managing committee made up of elected representatives from 21 countries. The committee is in charge of allocating financial assistance and determining what sites are included on, or removed from, the World Heritage List. "
"BURBANK, Calif. — When Olivia Pope arrived in prime time in April 2012 — talking fast, wearing stilettos and a Burberry trench coat, savoring red wine — she was a revelation. Appearing in Shonda Rhimes’s “Scandal,” Pope was the first African-American female lead in a network drama in almost 40 years. (“Get Christie Love!,” starring Teresa Graves as an undercover cop, debuted in 1974.) Pope, played by Kerry Washington, was a Washington fixer and the long-term lover of the married president of the United States, Fitzgerald Grant III (Tony Goldwyn). Her glamour, ambition, ruthlessness and unshakable loyalty to both the Republic and her team of lawyers, hackers and assassins — her “gladiators” — at Olivia Pope and Associates made her one of the most memorable antiheroes, let alone one of the more complex black characters, on television. For Ms. Rhimes, coming off the success of the pulpy medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal” was a risky proposition. (ABC originally ordered only seven episodes.) But its mix of dark comedy, over-the-top melodrama, hot-button social issues — and passionate sex scenes — transfixed audiences. “Scandal” became a ratings hit, appointment viewing and a hashtag-spawning social media sensation (#ItsHandled). Ultimately, its most lasting legacy is likely to be Olivia Pope herself. Both fully in command and deeply flawed, she was often driven by a higher purpose (“a white hat” in the show’s parlance) while resisting being controlled by any male, or in this season, female presidential authority in the form of Mellie Grant (Bellamy Young). With the show’s finale on April 19 nearing, Ms. Rhimes, Ms. Washington, Mr. Goldwyn and Ms. Young gathered at the ABC building here to chat about the show’s momentous run, craziest storytelling twists and nuanced handling of racial issues. These are excerpts from that conversation. Can we go back to the show’s beginning? I always imagined that you wanted to do a show with a black female lead, but that it was almost historically impossible. Did you have a strategy to create a viewership that would be able to “see” Olivia Pope? "

"The adage says if you teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime. Today, if you teach a man to fish, or a woman for that matter, they’ll end up on Instagram. Social media has become the newest place for anglers to document every whopper, track the finest fishing holes and meet like-minded pals who swap secrets about everything from the best bait and lures to the most picturesque seaside villages. Recreational fishing is on the rise in United States: The Fish and Wildlife Service reported last year that the number of anglers had grown eight percent, to 35.8 million in 2016 from 33.1 million in 2011. One of those new to the sport is Noelle Coley, 26, the manager of a medical marijuana dispensary who lives in Wheat Ridge, Colo. She said she took up fishing a few years ago after an ex-boyfriend gave her a rod and reel. Ms. Coley shares her catches on Instagram, but she guards her prized fishing holes from snoops, fearing her favorite streams will become crowded with newcomers. “I change the angle when taking a photograph,” she said of her popular Instagram posts. “I’m mindful not to tag rivers.” With 21,500 Instagram followers, she has attracted the attention of more than just curious lookyloos. Three months ago, she said she signed a contract with a sponsor, Hardy, a maker of fly fishing rods and reels based in Alnwick, England. The company gives her free equipment in exchange for mentions on her social media account. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • It was a job he never wanted. But the House speaker’s decision to abandon one of the most powerful jobs in Washington blindsided many Republican candidates who were counting on him to lead them to victory in the November midterm elections. Once considered one of his party’s brightest stars, Mr. Ryan, 48, said on Wednesday that he would quit politics for now. We looked at his two-and-a-half-year tenure, and at who’s running for his seat. • We also visited his hometown, Janesville, Wis., where his constituents were stunned … sort of: “Nobody can do a good job on their own,” one said. “I don’t think anyone in Washington is doing what they’re supposed to be doing. They just yell at each other.” • One of our technology columnists downloaded his Facebook data last week, “an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used.” Here’s what he learned.

"CHANDLER, Ariz. — An intensifying series of red-state battles over education funding and teacher pay threatens to loosen Republicans’ grip on some of the country’s most conservative states, as educators and parents rebel against a decade of fiscal austerity that has cut deeply into public education. As Arizona teachers pressed for higher salaries and more school funding, and Oklahoma teachers won some concessions from lawmakers amid a nine-day walkout, some in Kentucky continued their protests in favor of more money for education. Last month, West Virginia’s Republican-controlled government raised pay for teachers after a statewide strike. [Click here to read more on the decision by Oklahoma teachers to return to the classroom.] The clashes could elevate public education into a major issue in several midterm races this fall. Republicans are defending dozens of governorships and state legislative chambers across the country, including in several Southern and Western states where all-Republican governments have passed sweeping reductions in taxes and spending. On Wednesday in Chandler, Ariz., a middle class city in the Phoenix suburbs, hundreds of parents and students joined teachers in protesting outside schools. A parent, Christine Clinger Abraham, whose daughter is a senior at Chandler High School, wore a red blouse to show solidarity with the teachers’ #RedforEd movement. “They take so much personal interest in the kids,” Ms. Abraham said, “but they have to have a second job” to make ends meet. Ms. Abraham typically votes Republican, but said, “I would switch party lines” in order to support candidates who want to increase education funding. “I am very disappointed in the Republican Party we have locally,” she said. Both Republicans and Democrats in these strongly conservative states see the unrest around education as symptomatic of broader unease about years of budgetary belt-tightening that have followed popular tax cuts.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Paul Ryan cultivated an image that was false in some major ways. He pretended to be a budget hawk but consistently supported tax cuts that increased the deficit. He pretended to care about poverty but opposed many policies that had a record of reducing poverty. (Paul Krugman has long written about this hypocrisy, and Matthew Yglesias has a new piece on it in Vox.) But I don’t agree with the notion that Ryan is a complete hypocrite. He’s long displayed one admirable trait: A strain of honesty. He has acknowledged his desire to shrink popular programs like Medicare and Social Security. Many other Republicans refuse to admit as much. They claim that the government can cut taxes deeply for the rich and that Medicare and Social Security can somehow magically remain exactly as they are. You saw Republicans in Congress and Trump administration officials make precisely this case last year, during the rush to pass a tax cut. Ryan, by contrast, proposed radical cuts to Medicare, in his various budget blueprints over the years. He proposed the privatization of Social Security. And, in December, even before Congress passed the tax bill, Ryan said that changes to Medicare and Social Security would be his top priority in 2018. He wasn’t afraid of talking simultaneously about tax cuts and spending cuts — and allowing voters to draw a connection between the two. "
"During President Trump’s formative years, Queens — the New York City “outer borough” in which he grew up — was transformed from an all-white enclave into a racial and ethnic battleground. The forces unleashed in those struggles shaped Trump’s current policies on both immigration and racial integration. Trump was born on June 14, 1946. Until he was four, he lived in a two-story mock Tudor home built by his father, Fred, just south of Grand Central Parkway in Jamaica Estates. In 1950, Donald and his family moved around the corner to a grander 23-room, 9-bathroom redbrick — also built by his father — at 85-14 Midland Parkway. “The Jamaica Estates of Mr. Trump’s boyhood was an exclusive and nearly all-white place, resistant to outsiders and largely impenetrable to minorities,” The Times reported in 2015. In fact, the 1950 census found that at that time, 96.5 percent of the 1.55 million Queens residents were white. Taken together, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 — with attendant white flight — drove the upheavals that converted Queens into one of the most diverse counties in the nation. To those who love it, it is a vital, dynamic, multicultural community of people who enrich one another’s lives in myriad ways. To Trump, residents of modern American inner cities are “living in hell.” In 1960, when Trump turned 14, there were so few Hispanics that the census did not keep count; by 1970, when Trump turned 24, 153,691, or one out of 13, Queens residents were Latino. From 1960 to 1970, the black population of Queens grew from 145,885 to 258,006. "
"When your mother handed you a copy of “Our Bodies, Ourselves,” it meant one of two things: You were about to have a pained conversation with a parent wielding a hand mirror, or you were meant to take the book, read it and never mention it again. Either way, you were prepared. For generations of girls, “Our Bodies, Ourselves” was the starter pack to adulthood: It let you know whether your vulva was weird looking (it wasn’t), what kind of birth control you might want to use and whether you were the only one who had a special relationship with your pillow. (You weren’t, Page 162 assured.) But after nearly 50 years, Our Bodies Ourselves, the Boston nonprofit home of the book, will stop publishing the pubescent tome amid a period of “transition.” The book, last updated in 2011, will no longer have new editions. The nonprofit organization housing their programmatic work — they reported $279,460 in revenue for its 2016 fiscal year — will now be led by volunteers. “This is a really sad moment for our readers,” said Julie Childers, the executive director of Our Bodies Ourselves. “But we still have a strong, scrappy board of directors and 300 experts in the field to continue being a voice in the public sphere.” That the foundational feminist text will cease to publish at this particular time seems strange. Trump’s inauguration was dwarfed by millions of women wearing “pussy hats”; abusive men across every industry are being outed by #MeToo; women in film, television and music are embracing the feminist label with gusto. This week, Janelle Monáe released a music video that is rife with imagery celebrating the vulva. But feminist nonprofits, especially those founded during the movement’s second wave heyday, aren’t thriving in a way that reflects the moment. Stalwarts like the National Organization for Women and Ms. magazine still exist. But their profiles dwindle in the shadow of newer endeavors like Times Up, or Teen Vogue's recent political makeover.

"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday confirmed the Environmental Protection Agency’s second-in-command, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who not only shares the deregulatory zeal of Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. chief, but also his doubtful view of climate science. More notable, however, are the differences between the two men. Unlike Mr. Pruitt, a Washington outsider caught in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending, Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a low-key insider with years of Washington experience in the art of pursuing policy change while avoiding public distraction. Deregulation is among President Trump’s central campaign promises, and Mr. Pruitt has proposed ambitious rollbacks of rules governing clean air and water and fighting against climate change. But many of his initiatives have stumbled because of haste or imprecision, and at least six have been struck down by the courts. That makes the arrival of Mr. Wheeler’s expertise particularly consequential. In fact, on Thursday Mr. Trump also sent new marching orders to the E.P.A., directing the agency to weaken or delay implementation of a variety of air pollution regulations, several of which have been priorities for industries for which Mr. Wheeler has lobbied in the past. Among other things, the proposals would reverse an Obama-era policy of forcing federally designed pollution restriction plans on states that fail to meet national standards for reducing soot, smog, and nitrogen oxide. They would also allow states that fail to meet clean air standards not to comply with regulations if they attribute the dirtier air to pollution that drifted from Asia. Mr. Pruitt, in a statement, said, “This memorandum helps ensure that E.P.A. carries out its core mission, while reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing.” "
"It may not seem like television can currently accommodate one more topical late-night comedy show, but “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas” is ready to make the case. “Problem Areas,” which makes its debut Friday night on HBO, has a laid-back energy that’s very different from other late-night programs, but will be familiar to those who recognize the subdued Mr. Cenac, an alumnus of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” and a star of TBS’s “People of Earth.” A test episode screened last week for reporters had no studio audience and no canned laughter. There was just Mr. Cenac, 41, alone on a set resembling a groovy 1970s rec room, holding forth on topics like the interstellar aspirations of Elon Musk, the SpaceX chief executive, and the scientific uses of human excrement. The show will also feature longer field pieces reported by Mr. Cenac, and will spend multiple episodes of its debut season delving into policing in America and the many issues it brings up. The goal of the new program, he said, is to spend time exploring less familiar stories, rather than running down the headlines of a given evening. "
"PALO ALTO, Calif. — Doc Searls met with a group of fellow internet privacy experts one recent afternoon here at the Computer History Museum. On a whiteboard were the words “OUTRAGE” and “MAKE HAY” — capitalized, underlined and surrounded by lines jutting in all directions like a cartoon “BOOM!” For the first time in years, their field of expertise was front and center. Facebook had just come under intense scrutiny over how the political data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of up to 87 million its users. Seated in a wide circle of folding chairs, members of the group excitedly discussed what they could do next. “A lot of geeks in the world are looking at Facebook as a redwood that’s starting to fall,” said Mr. Searls, whose given name is David and who created ProjectVRM, a program at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society that seeks to empower internet users to protect personal privacy. “They’re saying, ‘O.K., it’s barn-raising time.’ ” The scandal swirling around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica has begun to usher in a new era for this once-ignored community of privacy researchers and developers. After years of largely disregarding their warnings about exactly what companies like Facebook were doing — that is, collecting enormous amounts of information on its users and making it available to third parties with little to no oversight — the general public suddenly seemed to care about what they were saying. The outcry over data privacy has been so strong that it pushed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, into testifying on Capitol Hill this week over the company’s failures to protect users’ information. Protesters rallied outside the Capitol during his testimony. Someone even arrived at a hearing dressed as a Russian troll. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) John Chiang, the state treasurer of California, is a Democrat running to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. California Today is conducting occasional question-and-answer sessions with candidates for office, and today is Mr. Chiang’s day at the plate. The interview, edited and condensed for clarity, was done for our story on the race. Q. What do you think of how Governor Brown has done? A. Jerry and I are aligned on making sure our fiscal house is in order. We don’t want to be a poor state. We don’t want to be broke — cutting health care, giving pink slips. Q. How big a problem is homelessness in this state? A. There are tens of thousands of homeless Californians. Do we take care of the vulnerable who live in the wealthiest state? To leave people in harm’s way is not acceptable. That is why I have tried to shore up the state’s financial position so we have the resources to take care of California’s homeless. The state has to partner with local governments — which I would hope to do as governor. Q. What do you see as the biggest problems facing California? A. Education is my top priority. You can’t have the disparate outcomes that you have. This needs to be a state where every child — regardless of background, heritage — gets access to a world-class education. Q. Are you worried the state is heading into a recession? A. People are very concerned about where we are in the economic cycle. They are very concerned about President Trump. If you look at the historical pattern, you know at some point we are going to face a recession. "
"CHENNAI, India — Over the last decade, India has been the world’s largest importer of aircraft, ships and other military gear, most of it from Russia. It is a dependence that the Indian government is eager to shed — and the United States wants to help. In fits and starts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to build up a homegrown defense industry that can supply more of India’s needs and even export weapons to other nations. The government in New Delhi is encouraging foreign defense companies seeking contracts from India to partner with local firms and share technology with them. The Trump administration has supported India’s efforts to get American technology, hoping to strengthen ties with a country it considers a key counterweight to China in the region, while diminishing Russia’s influence. Major American defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also gung-ho, seeing the chance to win billions of dollars in business from a country that has historically chosen Russian and European suppliers. The biggest prize is India’s plan to buy up to 110 fighter aircraft, a mix of single- and dual-engine models, a deal worth an estimated $15 billion that Boeing and Lockheed are both seeking to win with Indian partners. In addition to the Russians, whose MiG planes are the mainstay of the Indian air force, the American companies will face stiff competition from French and Swedish businesses seeking portions of the contract.

"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The big banks are getting ready to report first-quarter results. • Larry Fink believes robust global growth and earnings will support stocks. • There’s a consensus that Facebook must be regulated. The question is, how? • What Paul Ryan’s exit means for business. • Jack Ma argues that a trade war would hurt the U.S. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Headwinds and tailwinds are blowing through the financial markets and the global economy. The strength of these crosscurrents can be gauged, in part, by examining the results of the big banks, three of which report their first-quarter earnings on Friday. They are JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have large operations around the world and big Wall Street businesses, as well as Wells Fargo, which is more of a traditional lender focused on the United States. At the start of the year, the big banks had the wind in their backs. The global economy seemed to be on a clear growth path, the United States had just enacted large tax cuts and the Trump administration was expected to loosen bank regulations. But the threat of a trade war between the United States and China helped plunge the stock markets into correction during the first quarter. The banks’ results, as well as comments from their senior executives, could signal whether the tumult is seeping into the real economy. Here are some things to watch out for: Are the trade tensions reducing demand for credit? Large corporations may be holding off on some expansion plans, fearing that President Trump’s combative actions may make the investments less profitable. Executives at Citigroup and JPMorgan, with large global lending operations, are in a good position to provide insights on this subject. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive, may use the bank’s conference call to share his views on the brewing trade war. How concerned should we be with the volatility in the stock and bond markets? The first quarter was one the most turbulent periods in recent years for stocks and bonds, not just because of concerns about a trade war but also because the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it aims to keep raising interest rates. The volatility may have benefited the big banks because it might have prompted investors to trade more frequently. Companies and other entities have also continued to borrow heavily in the bond market, issuing $1.9 trillion of bonds, globally, in the first quarter, only slightly below the total for the same period in 2017, according to data from Dealogic. But will that appetite for borrowing remain strong? "
"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought on Thursday to slow down an imminent strike on Syria, reflecting mounting concerns at the Pentagon that a concerted bombing campaign could escalate into a wider conflict between Russia, Iran and the West. During a closed-door White House meeting, officials said, Mr. Mattis pushed for more evidence of President Bashar al-Assad’s role in a suspected chemical attack last weekend that would assure the world that military action was necessary. Despite the caution, two Defense Department officials predicted it would be difficult to pull back from punishing airstrikes, given President Trump’s threat on Twitter a day earlier of American missiles that “will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart.’” Mr. Mattis publicly raised the warning on Thursday morning, telling the House Armed Services Committee that retaliation must be balanced against the threat of a wider war. “We are trying to stop the murder of innocent people,” Mr. Mattis said. “But on a strategic level, it’s how do we keep this from escalating out of control — if you get my drift on that.” Hours later, after Mr. Mattis detailed his concerns at the White House, the president’s top national security advisers ended an afternoon meeting without a decision to attack, said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary. "
"For seven decades, “never forget” has been a rallying cry of the Holocaust remembrance movement. But a survey released Thursday, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, found that many adults lack basic knowledge of what happened — and this lack of knowledge is more pronounced among millennials, whom the survey defined as people ages 18 to 34. Thirty-one percent of Americans, and 41 percent of millennials, believe that two million or fewer Jews were killed in the Holocaust; the actual number is around six million. Forty-one percent of Americans, and 66 percent of millennials, cannot say what Auschwitz was. And 52 percent of Americans wrongly think Hitler came to power through force. “As we get farther away from the actual events, 70-plus years now, it becomes less forefront of what people are talking about or thinking about or discussing or learning,” said Matthew Bronfman, a board member of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which commissioned the study. “If we wait another generation before you start trying to take remedial action, I think we’re really going to be behind the eight ball.” Despite the gaps in the respondents’ knowledge, the study found an overwhelming consensus — 93 percent — that all students should learn about the Holocaust at school. And Holocaust denial remains very rare in the United States, with 96 percent of respondents saying they believe the genocide happened. “The issue is not that people deny the Holocaust; the issue is just that it’s receding from memory,” said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Claims Conference, which negotiates restitution for Holocaust victims and their heirs. “People may not know the details themselves, but they still think it’s important. That is very heartening.” "
"Donald Trump can feel the breath on the back of his neck. Aggressive federal investigators — in the Russia case and a separate inquiry of his lawyer’s behavior related to women who have alleged consensual sexual relationships with Trump — are taking ever more bold actions. They are getting closer to knowing things that I am sure Trump thought no one but the parties involved would ever know. This has frightened and enraged the president. There are reports that Trump is thinking of ways to thwart or constrict the Robert Mueller investigation, including the possibility of firing and replacing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to whom Mueller reports. As The New York Times has reported, Trump has at least twice sought to fire Mueller. The first time was last June “amid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible obstruction case,” and the most recent was in December when Trump became “furious” over “reports that the subpoenas were for obtaining information about his business dealings with Deutsche Bank.” Those reports about the subpoenas were not correct and Trump backed down. But there is a pattern here: When the investigation verges into Trump’s areas of vulnerability, he seeks to squash it. This is not the behavior of an innocent man. This is not the behavior of a “normal” president. There is no doubt in my mind that a strong case could be made that Trump has consistently sought to obstruct justice. That is as clear as creek water. "
"On Saturday I took my family to have a closer look at Syria. This was on the Golan Heights, from a roadside promontory overlooking the abandoned Syrian town of Quneitra. The border is very green at this time of year, a serene patchwork of orchards and grassland, and it was hard to impress on our kids that hell on earth was visible in the quiet distance. But I wanted them to see it — to know that Syria is a place, not an abstraction; that the agonies of its people are near, not far; that we should not look away. Later that day, in a suburb of Damascus, Syrian forces apparently again gassed their own people. It’s fortunate for Israel that it did not bargain the Heights away during the ill-fated peace processes of the 1990s: Had it done so, ISIS, Hezbollah or Iran might in time have trained their guns on Israeli towns below. The strategy of withdrawal-for-peace has not been vindicated in recent years, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Gaza. It’s a point Donald Trump obviously missed when he insisted last week on U.S. withdrawal from Syria, likely encouraging the apparent chemical attack he now threatens to punish. As it is, the chances of a wider and bloodier war over Syria have grown in recent days. Syrian tanks and artillery have reportedly entered the demilitarized buffer zone near the Israeli border, in brazen violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, as they prepare to sweep rebel forces from the rest of the border area. Israel did very little to deny its attack Monday on an air base used by Iran in central Syria, and Jerusalem is threatening more aggressive steps to keep Tehran from further entrenching itself militarily in its client state. The Iranians have vowed retaliation for the attack, which they are sure to make good on, probably via their proxies in Hezbollah. And tensions between Israel and Russia are at their highest point since the Cold War, in part because Israel did not notify Russia in advance of Monday’s attack. So where is the United States in all of this? As Michael Doran pointed out in an astute Times op-ed on Tuesday, Trump seems to have violated his own ostensible rules for winning in recent days. First he promised to withdraw U.S. forces, which would eliminate what little military leverage we have with Syria (and Turkey), and then he telegraphed the kind of feckless missile strike he seems intent on carrying out sometime in the coming hours or days.
