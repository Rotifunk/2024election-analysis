"The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resigned on Wednesday, in the middle of the nation’s worst flu epidemic in nearly a decade, because of her troubling financial investments in tobacco and health care companies that posed potential conflicts of interest. Alex Azar, the newly appointed secretary of Health and Human Services, announced the resignation of the director, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald. An agency statement cited her “complex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all her duties as the C.D.C. director.” The statement continued: “Due to the nature of these financial interests, Dr. Fitzgerald could not divest from them in a definitive time period. After advising Secretary Azar of both the status of the financial interests and the scope of her recusal, Dr. Fitzgerald tendered, and the secretary accepted, her resignation. ” Mr. Azar, a former executive with Eli Lilly, made the decision on his third day running the sprawling H.H.S. agency. Dr. Anne Schuchat, a veteran official with the C.D.C., was named acting director — the position she had filled before Dr. Fitzgerald took office. She has had prominent roles in many of the agency’s emergency responses to disease outbreaks and vaccine programs around the world. The resignation was announced less than a day after Politico reported on Tuesday that Dr. Fitzgerald, 71, had traded in tobacco stocks even after taking the position at the public health agency. The tobacco trades were small: Dr. Fitzgerald bought between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock in Japan Tobacco in August, according to her financial disclosure forms, before she signed her ethics agreement. She sold the stock, as promised, in October. Before assuming the post, she also had investments in major tobacco companies, including Reynolds American, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands, Philip Morris International, and Altria Group. Those were also sold in October, along with many of her other holdings. "
"President Trump gave a bravura performance on Tuesday night. Among presidential speeches, the State of the Union address comes closest to the long, disjointed, episodic form of the campaign rally — the form of oratory at which he excels. So even though virtually every word of the speech is scripted, it has the shout-outs, the self-applause, the knowing smiles and mugs that this president enjoys and that allow him to engage the congressional and the television audience over a long evening. He became almost as much a conductor as a speaker, expertly cuing the soloists, as it were, a dozen or so times during the speech — surely the largest number of hero-witnesses crammed into one of these events since Ronald Reagan had the dubious idea of turning the State of the Union into a report card on the State of the People. The rhetorical flourishes in last night’s address owed much to Reagan: not merely the heroes and volunteers, but above all the business and personal tax cuts, the largest in a generation, and with them the whirring and turning of economic gears, lifting citizens (in a nice phrase) “from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.” A few hard edges were smoothed away. The phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” did not appear in the speech, as it had in Mr. Trump’s Inaugural Address and his message to the joint session of Congress last year. He did not mention the news media, libel laws or Russia (except to criticize it alongside China as rivals “that challenge our interests, our economy and our values”). The phrase “America First” is gradually softening (another Reagan touch?) into putting “Americans first.” As Mr. Trump put it winningly: “I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.” Some hard edges remained. It is not enough to defeat or destroy the Islamic State. The president won’t rest until we “extinguish ISIS from the face of the earth.” He understands wedge issues better than any current American politician. That side of him might be called Nixonian, except that Mr. Trump tends to be more boldfaced than tricky. His immigration plan, “bipartisan” he called it, is calculated to open up fissures on the Democratic left. The repeal of the Obamacare mandate — “an especially cruel tax” (tip of the hat to the Supreme Court!) “that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year” — was a political masterstroke, devised by the impressive Senator Tom Cotton but quickly embraced by Mr. Trump. "
"The prospect of food and water assistance coming to an end for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico blindsided the island’s government this week, prompting angry reactions from local leaders and alarming lawmakers in Washington, who urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reverse course. By Wednesday, FEMA had done so — except it said it had never intended to stop helping Puerto Rico in the first place. The agency will continue providing aid to the storm-ravaged island for as long as it is needed, said William Booher, an agency spokesman. The uproar began when agency officials mistakenly told NPR in an interview published on Monday that FEMA planned to cut off food and water assistance on Jan. 31. “This aid is not stopping,” Mr. Booher said in an interview on Wednesday. “There was no, and is no, current plan to stop providing these commodities, as long as there continues to be an identified need for them.” According to Mr. Booher, Wednesday was not an actual cutoff point, but rather an internal planning date to evaluate if Puerto Rico could still justify needing assistance. The confusion marks the latest blot in the federal government’s response to Maria, which was widely criticized as too small and too slow. More than four months after the storm, nearly a third of Puerto Rican power utility customers are still without electricity, and the island’s financial position remains shaky. "
"There was only one reference to the deficit in last night’s State of the Union speech, and it had nothing to do with the federal budget. I found that refreshing — we can carry a deficit if the money’s spent wisely — but that’s another story. What President Trump talked about was America’s staggering infrastructure deficit, a whopping $2 trillion fault line in the backbone of the American economy, according to the latest estimates from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The president’s proposal sounded like an ambitious plan to take a big bite out of the problem. He urged Congress to produce a bill that would “generate at least $1.5 trillion” to modernize our decrepit infrastructure. The problem — at least for Democrats — is that the bulk of the financing is apparently supposed to come from private investors, who would ultimately shift most of those costs onto the public in the form of user fees and tolls. Most Democrats won’t sign on to this kind of legislation. Yet without the support of many Democrats, there can be no bill. So where does that leave us? Doing nothing is itself costly. As water mains break, roadways deteriorate and bridges crumble, businesses forgo trillions in sales, families lose an estimated $3,400 a year in disposable income, and our economy sacrifices millions of jobs. That’s why Larry Summers, the former Democratic Treasury secretary, urged the next president to go big on infrastructure spending. If Democrats were in control, they would be pushing not only for the brick-and-mortar projects the president spoke of last night but also for enormous investments in high-speed broadband and renewable energy. Unfortunately, the president wants to spend more money on 20th-century technology — so-called clean coal — instead of modernizing our electric grid and reorienting our economy away from coal and other fossil fuels. So how can Democrats find a way to get things into an infrastructure bill that (a) are good policy and things they would want anyway and (b) can be tied to goals of the Trump administration and a certain number of moderate Republicans in Congress? If done right, infrastructure can actually deliver in four areas the president emphasized again and again in his speech last night: a boon for the economy and the Trump administration; addressing the high cost of health care; tackling the opioid epidemic ravaging the country; and ensuring the safety of the American people.

"Not everyone needed 80 minutes behind a microphone to make a statement at the State of the Union address. The Democratic Women’s Working Group wore black pantsuits, skirts and dresses. In doing so, they followed the women of Hollywood, who wore all black to the Golden Globes in honor of the Time’s Up and #MeToo movements. It was a stark contrast to what has, in the past two years, become the Democratic women’s unofficial color: white. Hillary Clinton memorably wore a white pantsuit when she became the first woman to accept the Democratic nomination for president — a nod to the suffragists, who adopted it as one of their signatures in 1913. And last February, Democratic women wore all white during Mr. Trump’s address to Congress. Yet on Tuesday, in a strange turn, it was Melania Trump who chose white — a gorgeous pantsuit by Christian Dior. Was it meant to stand out against the all-black crowd? Was it a nod to women’s rights? Or perhaps a thumb in the eye of her husband, who was recently accused of having an affair with the porn star Stormy Daniels just weeks after Mrs. Trump gave birth to their son? To judge from Melania’s face and the reports that she traveled to the speech apart from her husband, I suspect the latter. The members of Mr. Trump’s party kept things traditional. Paul Ryan wore the classic American flag pin on his lapel and his equally classic smug face. And many Republican men wore red, white and blue ties. "
"To the Editor: Re “President Issues Appeal for Unity in State of Union” (front page, Jan. 31): President Trump has demonstrated that for 80 minutes, by following the script on the teleprompter, he is capable of at least appearing presidential. Most of us know by now that this will not last. Mr. President, the moral and ethical underpinnings of our union, far from being renewed and rejuvenated, are decaying. Your incessant demeaning of government institutions, assaults on the free press and prevarication show your true colors. It is true that in your first year the state of our union economically has become stronger and the advance in the stock market has added to the wealth of our country, although mostly among a small subset of the population. But what is undeniably also true is that our democratic ideals are under attack from within the Republic and from outside it. Until you accept and deal with this reality, the state of our union will remain in peril. KEN DEROW, SWARTHMORE, PA. To the Editor: President Trump, love him or hate him, hit the ball out of the park in his State of the Union address, leaving Democrats scavenging for criticism. His balcony guests were a mix of stories of heroism, heartbreak and patriotism, all of which registered with Americans. The Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, demonstrated an embarrassing petulance in the congressional gallery. One maxim sums up the night: You cannot argue with success. PHIL SERPICO
KEW GARDENS, QUEENS To the Editor: It’s sad that President Trump used honorable, responsible and in some cases grieving individuals as props for a shell of a speech that neither addressed the state of the union with substance nor proposed anything but sketchy plans for the future. "
"When someone tells you who they are, believe them. In his State of the Union address, Donald Trump told us exactly who the modern-day abortion opponents are — and exactly what they think of women. This revelation came more than halfway through the speech Tuesday, and probably by accident, when President Trump told a story that was, at least nominally, about human kindness as a cure for the opioid epidemic. As Mr. Trump described it, a 27-year-old Albuquerque police officer, Ryan Holets, happened upon a pregnant woman who was homeless and was “preparing to inject heroin.” The president continued: “When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.” The president said that Officer Holets “felt God speak to him,” that he took out a picture of his wife and their four children, and “went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.” You might have been wondering — I know I was — what happened to that homeless woman? Was she offered treatment? Was she given a chance to reunite with her newborn baby, which could have been a powerful incentive to get clean? Can she be part of the baby’s life? Where is she now? Is she O.K.? The woman’s name is Crystal Champ, and her history is sad, and, at this point, to anyone who’s been paying attention to the devastating opioid epidemic, sadly familiar. And, according to a December CNN report, she has been addicted since she was a teenager, and on the street for the past two years. “I did give up. I just decided this was going to be my life,” Ms. Champ told CNN. Her previous attempts to get clean all ended in failure. “It just keeps coming back and ruining my life.” "
"DIRECTORATE S
The C.I.A. and America’s Secret Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan
By Steve Coll
Illustrated. 757 pp. Penguin Press. $35. Steve Coll has written a book of surpassing excellence that is almost certainly destined for irrelevance. The topic is important, the treatment compelling, the conclusions persuasive. Just don’t expect anything to change as a consequence. The dean of Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism, Coll is a seasoned and accomplished reporter. In 2004, “Ghost Wars,” his account of conflict in Afghanistan from the 1979 Soviet invasion to the eve of 9/11, earned him a Pulitzer Prize, his second. “Directorate S” — the title refers to the arm of Pakistani intelligence that covertly supports the Afghan Taliban — is a sequel to that volume, carrying the story up to 2016. That story is a dispiriting one, abounding in promises from on high, short on concrete results. In December 2001, with Operation Enduring Freedom barely underway, President George W. Bush declared it America’s purpose “to lift up the people of Afghanistan.” Bush vowed that American forces would stay until they finished the job. In December 2017, during a brief visit to Kabul — unannounced because of security concerns — Vice President Mike Pence affirmed that commitment. “We’re here to stay,” he told a gathering of troops, “until freedom wins.” Yet mission accomplishment remains nowhere in sight. Over the past year, the Taliban have increased the amount of territory they control. Opium production has reached an all-time high. And corruption continues to plague an Afghan government of doubtful legitimacy and effectiveness. For a war now in its 17th year, the United States has precious little to show, despite having lost over 2,400 of its own soldiers and expending an estimated trillion dollars. After 9/11, “the United States and its allies went barreling into Afghanistan,” Coll writes, “because they felt that they had no alternative.” Once in, they were soon plunged into a quagmire. Rarely has a great power undertaken a major military campaign with such a flawed understanding of the challenges ahead. Yet first Bush and then Barack Obama concluded that the United States had no choice but to persist, a view that Donald Trump has now seemingly endorsed. "

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has formally suspended a major Obama-era clean water regulation ahead of plans to issue its own version of the rule later this year. President Trump has taken aim at the bitterly contested rule, known as Waters of the United States, since his campaign, calling it “one of the worst examples of federal regulation.” Among Mr. Trump’s first actions in office was an executive order directing his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, to begin the legal process of rescinding the rule and replacing it with a more industry-friendly alternative. On Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt took a major step toward completing that task, filing the legal documents required to suspend the Obama rule for two years. The rule was set to be implemented in the coming weeks, following a Supreme Court decision last week that gave jurisdiction of the matter to district courts. Having suspended the water rule, Mr. Pruitt is now crafting a Trump administration version, which is expected to include much looser regulatory requirements on how farmers, ranchers and real estate developers must safeguard the streams and tributaries that flow through their property and into larger bodies of water.

"President Trump’s first State of the Union address drew an audience of 45.6 million, about two million fewer than the number who watched his speech to a joint session of Congress a year ago. The viewership figure, tallied by Nielsen from the broadcast networks and cable channels that aired the 80-minute address on Tuesday night, reflects Mr. Trump’s preferred manner of watching television: the old-fashioned way, on a TV set, in real time. It does not include streaming data. The television audience was also smaller than the one for President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union address in 2010, which had 48 million viewers. Mr. Trump’s joint session speech last year drew 48 million viewers, according to Nielsen, about four million fewer than the 52 million who watched Mr. Obama’s joint session speech in 2009. The comparison, though, is complicated by the fact that more people stream these days than they did even five years ago. Fox News won the night, with an audience of 11.5 million. The leading broadcast networks were CBS and NBC, each with an audience of roughly seven million for the president’s speech. Both benefited from highly rated lead-ins: CBS aired an hourlong special on Super Bowl commercials, and NBC turned to its hit new game show centered on Ellen DeGeneres, “Ellen’s Game of Games.” The speech was also carried on several cable networks, including MSNBC and CNN, as well as PBS and the Spanish-language channels Univision and Telemundo. With Mr. Trump speaking considerably more slowly than his predecessors, his State of the Union address was the third longest in the last 50 years. Digital viewing is difficult to measure because statistics are not compiled by a third-party service, like Nielsen, that is regarded as an industry standard. CNN said that it had 1.7 million video starts on its website and across its apps during Mr. Trump’s address, and that viewership peaked a little before 10 p.m. with 320,000 concurrent users. Coverage on Tuesday included Megyn Kelly’s debut as a prime-time analyst on NBC and the first night for Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, as an ABC pundit. During a luncheon with news anchors on Tuesday, Mr. Trump predicted that his address would have a bigger audience than the Grammys. He got that one right: The Grammys had 19.8 million viewers on Sunday, a drop of 24 percent from last year. In the late-night numbers, Stephen Colbert, who returned to a live format on Tuesday, easily had the highest household rating with a 2.9 share, dwarfing the 2.3 for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and 1.9 for Jimmy Fallon’s “The Tonight Show,” according to Nielsen. Mr. Kimmel, whose main guest was Stormy Daniels, the pornographic actress who reportedly got a settlement to keep a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump quiet, had the highest rating among the advertiser-coveted 18-to-49-year-old demographic in the 25 leading markets.

"GENEVA — The United Nations rattled Israel on Wednesday by disclosing that it was examining more than 200 companies doing business with Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank but deferred naming any of them until it had completed a review of their activities. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a long-anticipated report that an initial review of 321 companies had identified 206 that were involved in doing business with the settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Of those identified, 143 were based in Israel and 22 were in the United States, the United Nations said. The remaining 41 companies were spread among 19 countries, mostly in Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands, France and Britain. “The violations of human rights associated with the settlements are pervasive and devastating, reaching every facet of Palestinian life,” including restrictions on movement, freedom of religion, education and land ownership, the report said. It observed that “businesses play a central role in furthering the establishment, maintenance and expansion of Israeli settlements” and said that they should consider whether it was possible to operate in such an environment in a manner that met their obligation to respect human rights. The report was a result of a resolution passed by the Human Rights Council in March 2016 that called for a database detailing the companies engaged in a list of specified activities that directly enabled, supported or profited from Israeli settlements. Those activities included supplying construction machinery or materials, surveillance equipment and security services, as well as providing banking and financial services. "
"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, consider the State of the Climate address that wasn’t delivered and join Team Climate on a burger taste test. As was widely expected, President Trump didn’t say anything about climate change in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. And why would he? It’s clear by now that the issue simply isn’t a priority for him. But that got us thinking: If one were to give an update on the state of American climate policy after one year of the Trump administration, what would it look like? We’d start with the fact that the administration has pushed to dismantle nearly all federal regulations related to climate change. That includes the Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions from power plants and a federal flood standard that would have required new infrastructure projects to prepare for a changing climate. (See our updated deregulation tracker for the full list.) And it includes a disavowal of the Paris climate agreement. But you’d also want to note that Mr. Trump hasn’t been able to halt many of the most important trends around the country toward lower emissions. Plenty of states, like California and New York, are still pressing ahead with their own local climate policies. The coal industry, responsible for a quarter of the nation’s emissions, continues to shrink, edged out of the energy market by less expensive natural gas despite Mr. Trump’s efforts to save it. "
"WASHINGTON — An American interceptor missile missed its target in a test off the Hawaiian coast on Wednesday, Defense Department officials said, renewing concerns of how the United States will defend itself in the event of a missile attack by North Korea or another adversary. A Pentagon official said that the interceptor, an SM-3 Block IIA missile that is being developed by the Raytheon Company, was launched from a test site in Hawaii. Officials likened the test launch to an attempt to hit a bullet with another bullet. It was the second failure over the past year of a test of the SM-3, known as the standard missile; the last one was in June. Mark Wright, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency, confirmed “a live-fire missile flight test” from Kauai. He did not confirm that the test had failed. But two Defense Department officials, speaking on grounds of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the test’s failure, said that the missile missed hitting the incoming dummy missile. The failure comes as tensions with North Korea are running high. But it was somewhat routine for a missile defense system that even advocates will not promote as providing a defensive shield. Around half of the tests over the 13 years since the system became operational have been declared fully or partly successful. Last August, the United States did successfully intercept a medium-range ballistic missile off the coast of Hawaii. North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in November that flew both higher and longer than previous launches. Analysts said that missile had exhibited a potential range of more than 8,000 miles, able to reach Washington or any other part of the continental United States. Pyongyang has worked hard to be able to overwhelm defense systems that the Pentagon has placed in California, Alaska and Hawaii. North Korea regularly practices firing salvos of missiles because the American system is designed to intercept only one or two incoming warheads at a time. Analyses of recent North Korean flight tests and missiles that have been paraded through the streets of Pyongyang suggest that the North may also be seeking to develop maneuverable warheads. Such a tactic, if successfully developed, would help warheads dodge antimissile interceptors. Tests of the United States’ multibillion-dollar efforts at missile defense have had mixed results. A Pentagon report last year criticized the long-range system, saying that it “demonstrates a limited capability to defend the U.S. homeland from small numbers” of medium- and long-range missiles “launched from North Korea or Iran.” Military officials said that it was unclear why Wednesday’s test failed. On Tuesday, President Trump used his State of the Union speech to lash out at the North Korean government. He said that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had brutalized his own people, and that he must be made to relinquish his nuclear program. "
"No one can accuse the Trump administration of being boring, even when it comes to telecom. According to leaked documents, there is a proposal going around  the White House to build a federally owned 5G telecommunications system — the next version of a mobile broadband network — or perhaps even to nationalize the 5G networks that private telecom companies are now building. (5G is the “fifth generation” wireless protocol, which promises to be faster and more secure than its predecessor, 4G, but requires new antennas and cell towers.) The White House proposal, which at the moment is just an idea, appears driven by concerns about security threats related to China’s development of 5G networks. But the strongest case for building a national network is different. Done right, a national 5G network could save a lot of Americans a lot of money and revive competition in what has become an entrenched oligopoly. Done wrong, on the other hand, it could look like something out of Hugo Chávez’s disastrous economic playbook. Americans spend an extraordinary amount of money on bandwidth. The cable industry is the worst offender: Since cable providers have little effective competition, cable bills have grown at many times the rate of inflation and can easily reach thousands of dollars per year. Mobile phone service is not exactly a bargain, either. And with plans to connect cars, toasters and pets to the internet, broadband bills may continue to soar. These bills, collectively, function like a private tax on the whole economy. Could a public 5G network cut that tax? A national 5G network would be a kind of 21st-century Tennessee Valley Authority. The government would build or lease towers across the country, prioritizing underserved areas, and set up a public utility that sold bandwidth at cost. This cheap bandwidth would be made available for resale by anyone who wanted to provide home broadband or wireless, thus creating a new business model for small local resellers. "
"WASHINGTON — As the head of the federal agency controlling billions of acres of public lands and waters, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has spent the past year making bold policy proclamations to advance President Trump’s energy agenda: He would open coastal waters to drilling, shrink national monuments, lift Obama-era fossil fuel regulations and reduce wildlife protections. But legal experts say many of the moves were made without fully considering the laws and procedures governing changes like these, making them vulnerable to legal challenges that could delay or block them. They say many of the proposals may follow the fate of other bold and hasty moves by the Trump administration, such as the attempts to limit travel from countries with sizable Muslim populations on security grounds. “They’re acting in a hurry, appealing to the base, and trying to seem decisive,” said Patrick Parenteau, a professor of environmental law at Vermont Law School. But, he added: “They’re not following the prescribed steps of the law. They’re creating errors for themselves as they go, sowing the seeds for the legal attacks.” It is not unusual for major policy changes to be hit by lawsuits from opponents. The Obama administration’s own environmental regulations were sometimes controversial because they relied on creative interpretations of decades-old laws to rein in smokestack pollution or stop oil, gas and coal exploration. Some Obama-era rules have been blocked or delayed by courts. But there is one big difference, Mr. Parenteu said. Even though some rules “pushed the edges of legal authority,” the Obama administration mustered a stronger defense by assembling “thousands of pages of support and technical analysis, laid out in mind-numbing detail,” he said. “Here, you have much more ad hoc, knee-jerk decision-making.” A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the legal foundations for Mr. Zinke’s moves. "
"Does Donald Trump actually believe in contraception? Today we’re going to talk about how this administration is hacking away at government support for family planning. But in order to get there, we’ll have to spend a minute discussing the president’s sex life, and Stormy Daniels, the porn star. I know you’d much rather get into the serious issue right away, but bear with me. Daniels recently became famous when The Wall Street Journal reported that she had been paid $130,000 in hush money shortly before the election to keep quiet about a one-night stand she’d had with Trump. That was back in 2006, right after Melania gave birth to Barron. Lately, Stormy has been signing denials while making TV rounds and winking broadly. The best evidence that the interlude did occur is an interview she gave In Touch magazine in 2011. Her description of their one-night stand was so boring, it seems impossible she was making it up. The only truly interesting part was Daniels’s report that Trump really hates sharks. (“He was like, ‘I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.’”) We know people cared about that part because of the flood of donations to pro-shark charities. The sex, in case you’re interested in that sort of thing, sounded pretty run-of-the-mill. The only unusual part was that she said Trump did not use a condom: “And I was really kind of upset about it because I am so, like, careful.” Our president spoke highly of condoms back in the day, when he did endless radio guy-talk sessions with his old pal Howard Stern. On the other hand, he volunteered that he had been surprised when his squeeze Marla Maples announced she was pregnant: “She said, ‘I think I’m so happy! We’re about to have a child.’ I said, ‘Excuse me?’ I didn’t know about this.” The wife Trump ditched for Marla was Ivana, who later claimed she had gotten pregnant on their honeymoon even though she was using an IUD. “Three years later, the same thing happened!” the first former Mrs. Trump reported in her recent biography. And then again. The failure rate for IUDs is currently about 0.8 percent, but Ivana’s were apparently less reliable than a fortune cookie. "
"NATIONAL An article on Tuesday about Melania Trump’s reaction to reports that her husband had an affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels misstated the time period in which the affair reportedly occurred.

NEW YORK An article on Tuesday about Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen’s decision to retire from Congress when his term expires referred incorrectly to Representative Frank LoBiondo’s status in office.

BUSINESS DAY A picture caption with an article on Tuesday about a new provision in the tax code that encourages investment in areas with high poverty and sluggish job and business growth referred incorrectly to Baltimore’s location. The city is in the Mid-Atlantic region, not New England. • The Vocations column on Sunday about Tara Hartson, a surveyor in Ellsworth, Me., relying on information from a source, referred incorrectly to Ms. Hartson’s academic background. While she studied at Carleton College, she did not receive a bachelor’s degree from that institution. She received a bachelor’s from St. Olaf College. OBITUARIES A picture caption with an obituary on Jan. 21 about the writer Julius Lester misstated the consequences of his public criticism of James Baldwin during his tenure at the University of Massachusetts.

"Rare is the Washington secret that can be kept for any extended period of time. But after more than a year, one of the biggest mysteries of the Trump administration was finally revealed this week. It was a picture frame. That was the present wrapped in a Tiffany & Company blue box that Melania Trump presented to a befuddled Michelle Obama as the Obamas greeted the soon-to-be first lady and her husband, Donald J. Trump, outside the north portico of the White House on Jan. 20, 2017, Inauguration Day. Mrs. Obama disclosed the box’s contents in a recent appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, breaking her silence on an awkward moment that was broadcast live. “It was a lovely frame,” Mrs. Obama said on the show, which was broadcast on Thursday. On the show, Mrs. Obama recounted the moment she received the surprise gift. It might seem obvious now that it had to be a frame, but on Inauguration Day there were few clues. Mrs. Trump delivered it to Mrs. Obama after she exited a limousine outside the White House and the couples shook hands and hugged. On a day full of pomp and protocol, the couples were then supposed to pose for a photograph, as two Marines saluted by their sides. But instead of pivoting for the photograph, Mrs. Trump handed Mrs. Obama a rectangular box wrapped in robin-egg blue paper and a white bow. Mrs. Obama grabbed it with two hands and then panicked. It was not part of the script, she confirmed on the show. “I mean, this is like a state visit, so they tell you that you’re going to do this, they’re going to stand here,” Mrs. Obama said in the interview with Ms. DeGeneres. “Never before do you get this gift, so I’m sort of like, O.K.,” she said. Holding the box, she turned to her left toward one of the Marines, glancing in all directions for a spot to place the gift. The Marine did not budge. It could not go on the ground. At last, she appeared to give up, resigned that it would appear in an official photograph to commemorate the transfer of power. But then Mr. Obama stepped in. “No, no, no,” he said, looking at the package. “Hold on a second.” Mr. Obama grabbed it and walked it inside the White House. It was not seen in public again. "

wrote this week about some scenarios that could become illegal if Australia approves espionage legislation introduced in December. Then, on “The Drum” on Wednesday night, I talked more about Australia’s tolerance for a lack of government transparency. But it’s not exactly a subject for live television — at least not with me explaining it — so I thought I’d return to the issue here in this week’s newsletter. First a bit of context: Australia is not alone in trying to clamp down on information. Japan passed a special secrets law in 2014, over widespread opposition; the United Kingdom has been looking at how to tighten its controls with longer prison sentences; and American investigations into government leaks have increased since Sept. 11, tripling under President Trump. Countries like Turkey, Cambodia, China and Cuba have also made a habit of creating and enforcing laws that allow for maximum control over government information. At a time of rising nationalism worldwide, “national security” has effectively become a catchall category — a legitimate concern expanded to include documents, digital communication and political issues that may not have much to do with national security.

"WASHINGTON — For years, immigration advocates have defined hundreds of thousands of young people brought to the country illegally as children by the sympathetic term “Dreamers.” Long irritated by the rhetorical branding, President Trump finally came up with his own rejoinder: “Americans are Dreamers, too.” The point was to shift the terms of the polarizing immigration debate and reinforce the argument that those born in the United States or living here legally deserve sympathy as well. But if Mr. Trump believed the line in his State of the Union address would help bring the sides together for the bipartisan agreement he says he seeks, he received little encouragement on Wednesday. The two sides appeared further apart than ever. Although Mr. Trump characterized his immigration proposal as a “down-the-middle compromise,” his speech further alienated him from the bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to negotiate a deal. Rather than act as a catalyst for cooperation, it seemed to only deepen the divide. And it underlined the political ramifications of the nativist language that the president used in the 2016 campaign and during his first year in office. The president faces a year in which a bitterly divided Congress and a swirling Russia scandal could rob him of any high-profile legislative successes. He is sure to play up the benefits of the landmark tax cuts that he helped push through last year, as he did at the White House on Wednesday in an appearance with families who will benefit from the plan. But his proposal for a $1.5 trillion building program to fix the nation’s roads, bridges, airports and other structures generated little enthusiasm, and he offered few other major concrete ideas for legislation. It was the starkly divergent reactions to his discussion of immigration, however, that stood out most on Wednesday. Democrat saw his speech as a dark and hard-edge portrayal of immigrants as gang members and killers, and they seemed more, rather than less, resistant to a deal with Mr. Trump that would upset their liberal base. While some conservatives were unhappy that Mr. Trump had, in their view, gone too far, Republican officials focused their ire on the Democrats for what they considered their intransigence. "
"WASHINGTON — Aboard Air Force One on a flight home from Europe last July, President Trump and his advisers raced to cobble together a news release about a mysterious meeting at Trump Tower the previous summer between Russians and top Trump campaign officials. Rather than acknowledge the meeting’s intended purpose — to obtain political dirt about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government — the statement instead described the meeting as being about an obscure Russian adoption policy. The statement, released in response to questions from The New York Times about the meeting, has become a focus of the inquiry by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller in recent months have questioned numerous White House officials about how the release came together — and about how directly Mr. Trump oversaw the process. Mr. Mueller’s team recently notified Mr. Trump’s lawyers that the Air Force One statement is one of about a dozen subjects that prosecutors want to discuss in a face-to-face interview of Mr. Trump that is still being negotiated. The revelation of the meeting was striking: It placed the president’s son and his top campaign officials in direct contact with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, and an email to the president’s son emerged saying that the information was part of Russia’s effort to help the Trump campaign. The special counsel is investigating how those revelations were handled in real time in part because the president was involved in his administration’s response. Some lawyers and witnesses who have sat in or been briefed on the interviews have puzzled over Mr. Mueller’s interest in the episode. Lying to federal investigators is a crime; lying to the news media is not. For that reason, some of Mr. Trump’s advisers argue that Mr. Mueller has no grounds to ask the president about the statement and say he should refuse to discuss it. What is already clear is that, as Mr. Trump’s aides and family members tried over 48 hours to manage one of the most consequential crises of the young administration, the situation quickly degenerated into something of a circular firing squad. They protected their own interests, shifted blame and potentially left themselves — and the president — legally vulnerable. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s long-awaited plan for overhauling the nation’s crumbling infrastructure includes spending $200 billion in federal money over the next decade to spur an additional $1.3 trillion in spending from cities, states and private companies on major projects, White House officials said on Wednesday, a formula that faces long odds on Capitol Hill. The increased infrastructure spending would be offset by unspecified budget cuts. Officials would not detail where those cuts would come from, or how the proposal would effectively leverage at least $6.50 in additional infrastructure spending for every dollar spent by the federal government, a ratio many infrastructure experts consider far-fetched. The officials said Mr. Trump would leave it up to Congress — where there is little consensus about how to pay for such a plan — to figure out the details, giving lawmakers wide latitude in creating what would need to be a bipartisan bill against the backdrop of the midterm elections. Asking a polarized Congress to hash out a complex and contentious plan could complicate an already steep climb for a proposal that was a pillar of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. That difficulty was underscored by a cool reception for Mr. Trump’s proposal from Democrats and labor groups, longtime champions of boosting infrastructure spending, on Wednesday. “That’s not a plan. That’s a hope,” said Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill. “It’s sort of pathetic.” Democrats and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have pushed Mr. Trump’s administration to commit far more federal dollars, funded by tax increases. The Chamber of Commerce proposed a federal gasoline tax increase this month that it estimates would raise nearly $400 billion over a decade, as part of a broader infrastructure package that includes private funding, worker training and streamlined permitting. Senate Democrats called last year for a $1 trillion infrastructure program, financed by closing tax loopholes. They seemed unimpressed by the latest details of Mr. Trump’s plan. "
"Desperate for a strong regional ally in the fight against the Islamic State, both the Trump and Obama administrations eagerly worked with Kurdish forces in Syria, even though allies of those forces were waging an insurgency across the border in Turkey, a NATO ally. Now, American successes against the Islamic State are threatened by Turkish attacks on the Syrian Kurds. The clash, long feared, could provoke a wider war and a division of Syria into zones of influence. But stopping it would require a diplomatic commitment on all sides that has so far been lacking. The confrontation began last week when Turkish forces crossed the border into Syria and attacked Kurdish troops, who control the northwestern town of Afrin. Since then, events have escalated, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatening to take the fight to the Kurdish-controlled town of Manbij, where American Special Operations forces are based. He is also talking about expelling the Kurds and resettling the area with Syrian refugees. The Kurds, known as the People’s Protection Units, dominate the Syrian Democratic Forces, an umbrella organization that receives American training, weapons and air support. The Turks consider them terrorists, indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that has waged a separatist war in Turkey for more than 30 years. While the Syrian group plays down its ties to the organization in Turkey, and there are differences, links do exist. The two groups have common roots, but experts say the Syrian contingent has largely kept a 2012 promise not to provide material support to the Turkish Kurds, who are formally recognized as a terrorist group by the United States and Europe. Despite the complications of Americans working with one Kurdish group while another group waged an insurgency against a NATO ally, the decision made sense. Turkey was so focused on overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria that it refused to help America fight ISIS. It left its border wide open, enabling foreign fighters to swell ISIS’ ranks. The Kurds, on the other hand, wanted to fight ISIS, which threatened their forces, and they were good at it. Still, the United States should have done more to prevent the two parties from going to war with each other even before the ISIS threat receded. "
"Nearly 7,000 Syrians who were granted temporary permission to live and work in the United States as a civil war devoured their country will be allowed to stay for at least another 18 months, the Trump administration announced on Wednesday, in an acknowledgment that Syria continues to be rattled by conflict. The decision came as a major relief to Syrians and their advocates. Over the past year, the administration has ended Temporary Protected Status, as the humanitarian program is known, for Salvadorans, Haitians and Nicaraguans, decisions that will collectively expose more than 326,000 people to deportation. The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, said that the situation in Syria justified allowing Syrians to remain in the United States. “After carefully considering conditions on the ground, I have determined that it is necessary to extend the Temporary Protected Status designation for Syria,” Ms. Nielsen said in a statement. “It is clear that the conditions upon which Syria’s designation was based continue to exist, therefore an extension is warranted under the statute.” But the extension arrived with a caveat: Those who came to live in the United States after Aug. 1, 2016, will not be eligible to join the program, a distinction that the Syrian community and its advocates said left some Syrians vulnerable. Though he was relieved to hear of the final decision, “it’s been very stressful the last few months, especially seeing other countries, that they were terminated from their T.P.S. status, so we were preparing for the worst,” said Nawwar Kabbani, 33, a software architect from Aleppo who was able to start working when he received the temporary permission five years ago. “I’ve been looking at the news every five minutes for the past two days.” "
"In Missouri, an acolyte of President Trump is running for the U.S. Senate and denouncing “manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.” The candidate, Courtland Sykes, a conservative Republican, is seeking to oust a moderate Democrat, Claire McCaskill. That diatribe by Sykes is worth quoting as a window into the backlash against #MeToo and empowered women: “I don’t buy into radical feminism’s crazy definition of modern womanhood and I never did,” Sykes wrote on his campaign’s Facebook page. “They made it up to suit their own nasty, snake-filled heads.” “I don’t buy the non-stop feminization campaign against manhood,” he added. “I want to come home to a home cooked dinner at six every night, one that [my fiancée] fixes and one that I expect one day to have daughters learn to fix.” Speaking of those daughters, Sykes clarifies: “I don’t want them [to] grow up into career obsessed banshees who … become nail-biting manophobic hell-bent feminist she-devils.” Sykes, who has not been endorsed by Donald Trump and who seems unlikely to be elected, says that young women are turning against feminism because of distaste for Hillary Clinton: “They look at her personal life’s wreckage and didn’t want to become like her.” "
"“What makes America great? The answer is simple, really. Americans make America great.” That line could have been taken straight from Donald J. Trump’s State of the Union address, but instead it was in a trailer for the horror movie “The First Purge” that debuted during coverage of the president’s speech on Tuesday night. The “Purge” franchise, set in a dystopian America in which residents are allowed to commit mayhem and murder one night every year, has always been timely. The third and most recent previous installment, “The Purge: Election Year,” was released in summer 2016 and outgrossed its predecessors, making $118 million worldwide. “The First Purge,” as its title implies, is a prequel, depicting the events that led to the creation of the deadly annual free-for-all by the New Founding Fathers of America party. The teaser features seemingly patriotic scenes of American flags, the Statue of Liberty, and fireworks as a folksy narrator growls lines like, “You are the lifeblood of the nation, and your rights as Americans must be safeguarded.” The 30-second spot ends with the movie’s title emblazoned on a red, “Make America Great Again”-style baseball cap. “The First Purge” hits theaters, aptly enough, on July 4.

"STOKE-ON-TRENT, England — Rain predictably pelted the windshield on the nearly 40-mile journey down the dark motorway back to his home on the outskirts of Manchester, but Geoff Cameron wasn’t about to let a soaking interrupt him. Not after all these years here. Even after playing a full 90 minutes for the second time in three days, and even after the most damaging league defeat in his six seasons as a Stoke City player, Cameron had plenty to say. Over the course of the next hour, after some expletive-laden venting in the wake of a costly 1-0 home loss to Newcastle United, he invited questions on a number of subjects: Stoke’s increasingly dire predicament in the Premier League, his brush with political controversy last year and the challenges of life as an American abroad. Cameron also naturally ruminated on the United States’ ill-fated World Cup qualifying campaign, heading into a summer of unforeseen spectating. A sample: ■ “There’s no doubt in my mind that if Jurgen Klinsmann was still our head coach, we would have qualified for the World Cup.” ■ “People can have their opinions and say I’m a bad player and this and that. Well, I’ve been over here for this long for a reason. So I think I have to be doing something right.” ■ “My goal is to play this game until I’m 40.” ■ “Bruce Arena made decisions that cost us going to the World Cup. And I don’t have a problem saying it, because we had the right group of guys.” "
"In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night President Trump said that illegal immigrants “have caused the loss of many innocent lives,” and he paid special attention to the gang known as MS-13. Many of its members, he said, “took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors” and then ended up murdering American citizens. In the gallery as his guests were the parents of two teenagers from Brentwood, N.Y. on Long Island, Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, who were killed by the gang in 2016. They cried when Mr. Trump told the story of their children’s death. Kayla, 16, had been feuding with MS-13 members at school and on social media, prosecutors have said, and Nisa, on the eve of her 16th birthday, was with her on Sept. 13, 2016, when the gang members attacked as they were walking down a street at about 8:30 p.m. Both girls were bludgeoned to death with baseball bats and machetes. That night on Long Island brought attention to the working-class, immigrant community, where just seven months later, MS-13 struck again. Four Latino young men — three of whom were immigrants — were killed in the woods behind a soccer field in nearby Central Islip. The authorities arrested more than 15 members of MS-13 for the homicides. In a span of 17 months on Long Island, there were 17 murders attributed to MS-13. MS-13 was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by refugees from El Salvador escaping civil war. The abbreviation stands for Mara Salvatrucha, which roughly translates to “Salvadoran street posse.” The government has said that it is has an estimated 10,000 members across the country, though that figure has been widely disputed. In the mid-1990s, the government started deporting the immigrant gang members, which helped grow its leadership base in El Salvador. At the same time, MS-13 migrated to other areas of the country with large immigrant populations. Today, it is considered transnational, existing in countries like Honduras and Mexico. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) On his first day as the new editor in chief of the Los Angeles Times, Jim Kirk held a meeting. His newsroom had suffered through several months of turmoil — and staff members had many questions. One of the most poignant came from a columnist, Robin Abcarian: Had Mr. Kirk ever been a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit? “No,” he replied, which Ms. Abcarian said prompted a round of applause. Her question, Ms. Abcarian said in a telephone interview on Tuesday, was an earnest one. It came less than two weeks after Ross Levinsohn, who was named The Times’s publisher in August, was put on leave after a National Public Radio article detailed sexual harassment allegations made against him while he worked at other companies. (The New York Times reported this week that Tronc — the parent company of the Los Angeles Times — vetted Mr. Levinsohn before he was hired, but the company was not aware that he had twice been a defendant in sexual harassment lawsuits.) Mr. Kirk, who had recently served as the interim executive editor of the Los Angeles Times, replaced Lewis D’Vorkin. During his brief tenure as executive editor, Mr. D’Vorkin had sown widespread distrust and discontent among members of the newsroom. Some at the Los Angeles Times feared he would focus more on pageviews and advertising than on quality journalism. In a statement announcing the changes on Monday, Justin C. Dearborn, the chief executive of Tronc, sought to reassure the staff, saying, “We are continuing to invest in high-quality journalism, which will always be the company’s top priority.” "

"On Dec. 22, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio signed Senate Bill 164 banning doctors from performing abortions in cases in which a fetus is likely to have Down syndrome according to prenatal testing. Despite being staunchly pro-choice, I was primed to sympathize with the bill’s supporters more than ever, given my personal circumstances. I’d just moved to Ohio shortly after giving birth to my daughter in August. My husband and I are both (very differently) disabled: he, quadriplegic; me, neuroatypical (anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders). Moreover, one of his close family members has Down syndrome. Rhetorical gestures toward “protecting” the lives of disabled individuals constitute a familiar refrain in anti-abortion justifications for legislation like SB 164, with supporters claiming to combat the systemic devaluation of the lives of people with disabilities. But the reality of how this brand of legislation uses the idea of disability to gain political traction is much more complicated. The business of birth itself is often structured around the specter of disability. My husband and I had just been made privy to this via my own pregnancy and birth experience. An early ultrasound revealed our daughter’s possible congenital lung malformation; that, coupled with my own neuroatypicality, our family history of Down syndrome and my husband’s spinal cord injury, made us an eyebrow-raising trio for every clinician we encountered over the course of my prenatal care. For six months, I dutifully shuffled into Southern California business parks for twice-weekly ultrasounds, nonstress tests and countless appointments with specialists, growing ever more anxious at the looming prospect of we-didn’t-know-what. Our daughter’s potential lung problem fully resolved on its own in utero — she was born asymptomatic at birth and has been ever since — but I remained designated as “high-risk,” the pregnancy now haunted by solemnity and fear. When I gave birth, we were ushered into a postpartum room that wasn’t wheelchair accessible. We had been promised that it would be, so my husband asked whether a piece of furniture or two meant for the birth partner could be moved so that he could fit into the corner to hold the baby. The staff member looked at him as if he’d asked whether she could spoon-feed caviar to our newborn. “No furniture can be moved from the room,” she answered, her tone one of clipped finality before her determined exit. After 30 hours of labor, I was in no mood to argue (well, not rationally), but I did very nearly laugh at the absurdity of the whole thing: We could spy on a potential abnormality for months via sound waves and some goo, but we couldn’t move a chair for a father who already existed?

"A lot of Trump’s speech — and an even greater share of the emotional energy, since he seemed bored reciting misleading economic numbers — was devoted to lamenting a wave of violent crime by immigrants. Was this racist? Yes, of course. But saying that doesn’t capture the full evil of what he was doing (and I use the term “evil” advisedly). For he wasn’t exaggerating a problem, or placing the blame on the wrong people. He was inventing a problem that doesn’t exist, and using that imaginary problem to demonize brown people. Racist dog-whistles are, of course, nothing new in American politics. Indeed, much of the rise of the modern, far-right GOP rested on the politics of racial division, with even “respectable” Republicans perfectly willing to exploit racial fear and hostility — most famously, Bush the elder’s Willie Horton ad. But here’s the thing: back in the 70s and 80s there really was a crime wave, and a lot of it did involve blacks. That’s no excuse for racism, let alone the cynical political exploitation of that racism. But at least the panic was about something real. This time, by contrast, there is no crime wave — there have been a few recent bobbles, but many of our big cities have seen both a surge in the foreign-born population and a dramatic, indeed almost unbelievable, decline in violent crime: Most notably of all, New York — once the emblem of the supposed collapse of law and order — is safer than it has ever been, despite being run by a mayor who, strange to say, has tried to rein in racist behavior by the police. So Trump wants us to be scared of brown people based on nothing at all. That’s really ugly. "
"Pretend you are the lead detective on a hit new show, “CSI: Terrible Stuff on the Internet.” In the first episode, you set up one of those crazy walls plastered with headlines and headshots, looking for hidden connections between everything awful that’s been happening online recently. There’s a lot of dark stuff. In one corner, you have the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election with digital propaganda. In another, a rash of repugnant videos on YouTube, with children being mock-abused, cartoon characters bizarrely committing suicide on the kids’ channel and a popular vlogger recording a body hanging from a tree. Then there’s tech “addiction,” the rising worry that adults and kids are getting hooked on smartphones and social networks despite our best efforts to resist the constant desire for a fix. And all over the internet, general fakery abounds — there are millions of fake followers on Twitter and Facebook, fake rehab centers being touted on Google and even fake review sites to sell you a mattress. So who is the central villain in this story, the driving force behind much of the chaos and disrepute online? This isn’t that hard. You don’t need a crazy wall to figure it out, because the force to blame has been quietly shaping the contours of life online since just about the beginning of life online: It’s the advertising business, stupid. And if you want to fix much of what ails the internet right now, the ad business would be the perfect perp to handcuff and restrain — and perhaps even reform. "
"In its fantastic second season, NBC’s “The Good Place” found empathy within the devil. Michael (Ted Danson), an immortal bureaucrat charged with torturing four souls in The Bad Place — a version of hell where his prisoners are meant to inflict their neuroses on one another — develops a conscience and helps them escape. While they argue their eternal cases in front of an omniscient judge (Maya Rudolph), Michael explains himself to his infernal supervisor. “I was just trying to prove that humans could be made to torture each other,” he says. “Instead, they helped each other. They were bad people. This wasn’t supposed to be possible.” People never learn, people don’t get better: These are unsurprising beliefs from a minion of hell. But they’ve also been the guiding principles of the last two decades of TV. From the dawn of “The Sopranos” through the rise of Netflix, acclaimed antihero dramas have focused on bad people getting worse or good people going bad. (In “Breaking Bad,” the concept is right in the title.) There are many delights to “The Good Place,” which ends its too-short 13-episode season Thursday: its ingenious twists, its riffs on the banality of damnation. (Hell is stocked with Hawaiian pizza and plastered with movie posters for “Pirates of the Caribbean 6: The Haunted Crow’s Nest or Something, Who Gives a Crap.”) But the most refreshing thing about “The Good Place,” in an era of artistic bleakness, is its optimism about human nature. It’s made humane and sidesplittingly entertaining television out of the notion that people — and even the occasional immortal demon — are redeemable. For a generation now, the moral journeys of TV’s best shows have mostly run in the other direction. Tony Soprano spent six seasons in therapy yet learned nothing except how to be a better criminal. The corrupt police officer Vic Mackey, in “The Shield,” rationalized his brutality as what it took to bust gang members. "
"The conflict between Turkey and the Kurds has escalated since Turkey started a military offensive against the Syrian Kurdish enclave of Afrin on Jan. 20. The Kurdish militia, the People’s Protection Units, which is the United States-led coalition’s top partner in the fight against the Islamic State, controls Afrin. And Turkey is a critical NATO ally. The Trump administration is floundering. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has ignored President Trump’s appeal to avoid actions that might risk conflict between Turkish and American forces and torpedo the campaign against the Islamic State. Mr. Erdogan has vowed to carry the battle further east to militia-controlled territory stretching all the way to the Iraqi border, where an estimated 2,000 American Special Operations Forces are deployed. Turkey blames Washington’s support for the People’s Protection Units for the meltdown in American-Turkish ties. Many of the militia’s top cadres are drawn from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., the armed group that has been waging a bloody campaign for self-rule inside Turkey. The State Department lists the P.K.K. as a terrorist organization but does not so designate the People’s Protection Units. Turkey insists that the P.K.K. and the militia are the same. Turkish officials believe that once the Islamic State is defeated, the People’s Protection Units will melt back into the P.K.K. and train its American weapons on Turkey. American officials retort that it was Turkey’s tolerance for — if not outright collusion with — thousands of jihadist fighters who flowed into Syria through Turkey that forced them to embrace the militia. Both arguments have merit. The truth is that Turkey’s Kurdish problem was not concocted by Western powers but is a result of decades of brutal suppression of its Kurdish population. Syria, a former Ottoman dominion, has always figured in the fight. In the early 20th century, Kurdish rebellions erupted across Anatolia and were savagely suppressed. Turkey’s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who won the Kurds’ support against Allied occupation, embarked on an unremitting campaign of assimilation. The Kurds were dismissed as “mountain Turks.” Thousands fled to Syria, then under French mandate, where Kurdish intellectuals, tribal leaders and sheikhs united around a society called Xoybun, established to liberate Kurds from Turkey’s grip.

"SEOUL, South Korea — When President Trump wanted to highlight the brutality of North Korea’s government during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he pointed to a man in the audience who had traveled thousands of miles on crutches to find freedom. The story that man, Ji Seong-ho, tells of his escape is remarkable even by the standards of North Korean defectors. When Mr. Trump pointed him out, Mr. Ji jubilantly raised his crutches as television cameras captured the moment. In 1996, Mr. Ji was 13, his parents’ eldest son, living in a mining village near the city of Hoeryong in northern North Korea. The country was in the midst of a famine that would kill more than two million, by some estimates. Surviving on roots and corn stalks, Mr. Ji’s family became so weak that they spent most of the day lying on the floor, sometimes hallucinating, he said in a 2014 interview. His grandmother had died of hunger the previous year. In school, teachers were too weak to teach. Few students showed up to class. Mr. Ji said he began stealing coal from moving freight trains, to barter it for corn. “There must have been 100 of us. When the train moved out of the station at night, we came out of hiding and crawled up the cars like zombies,” Mr. Ji said. “If we missed the train, our families would have nothing to eat for a few days.” Villagers could steal the coal only between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., when the train was not guarded by armed police officers, he said. They had no flashlights. "
"Reactions to Donald Trump, India’s budget, and fast skiers. Here’s your Morning Briefing: • Our national correspondents were in the field to gauge the reaction to President Trump’s first State of the Union address, called for unity at home and a more muscular America abroad. One viewer put it this way: “I’m happy with him and I’m embarrassed by him at the same time.” But Washington’s focus shifted when an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of Congress to a retreat crashed into a large truck, and the F.B.I. director publicly clashed with Mr. Trump over a Republican memo accusing the bureau and the Justice Department of surveillance abuses. _____ • One of the guests Mr. Trump invited to the address to hail as a hero was Ji Seong-ho, a defector from North Korea. We have more of his story. Speaking with our Seoul correspondent in 2014, Mr. Ji told of losing a leg and arm while stealing coal from a moving freight train during a 1996 famine. He traveled thousands of miles on crutches to freedom. "
"Gone are the days when hearing directly from the president was a special event. Now President Trump is a regular, unfiltered presence on Twitter, often before Americans have had their first cup of coffee. Still, his first State of the Union address on Tuesday prompted some of the traditional rituals: the viewing parties, the instant analyses, the debates over what the president should or should not have said. (Plenty of Democrats followed a newer tradition they deemed #SOTUBoycott and turned on Netflix instead.) Our national correspondents watched the speech to gauge the mood in competitive congressional districts in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois and Texas, where Republicans are waiting to see if a wave of Democratic enthusiasm could be enough to cost them seats in 2018. PALATINE, Ill. — Bob Schmidt, 36, glanced up from his beer just in time to see President Trump pause from his State of the Union address and heartily applaud for himself. “Ugh,” Mr. Schmidt said, turning away from the flat-screen televisions hanging over the bar. “I voted for him and he’s the joke of the country. I don’t know how, but I’m happy with him and I’m embarrassed by him at the same time.” "
"“This, in fact, is our new American moment,” President Trump declared in his State of the Union speech. “There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.” But which American Dream? Trump portrayed a dark and menacing world in which immigrants, who stand at the heart of the American idea, were equated with gangs, murderous criminals and “horrible people.” In his 80-minute speech, the word “woman” did not come up once. Other words or phrases never mentioned included “peace,” “human rights,” “equality,” “Europe,” “multilateral,” “civil rights” and “alliance.” The Constitution flitted onto Trump’s radar chiefly in the context of appointing his kind of judges. If there was a theme, it was the demonization of immigrants and of the rest of the world, combined with an exaltation of American might. He spoke of building a “Great Wall” on the Mexican border, but it may as well have been against the rest of humanity. Trump once again put the world on notice that the rules-based, post-1945 world order founded on alliances like NATO and American-backed multilateral organizations is one he would rather shred than bolster. Of course, the world has learned that this president’s bark is worse than his bite. Still, he keeps on barking. That is not reassuring. In perhaps his clearest signal of contempt for the views of allies, Trump announced that he had signed an executive order revoking President Barack Obama’s January 2009 order to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility. Trump’s order directs that “the United States may transport additional detainees to U.S. Naval Station Guantánamo Bay when lawful and necessary to protect the nation.” "
"President Trump had promised a unifying speech, and he was true to his word, delivering a State of the Union on Tuesday night perfectly pitched to satisfy a party now thoroughly unified behind him. Buoyed by a booming economy, a becalmed international scene and a congressional majority that has obligingly placed the skids under an independent investigation it was inevitably going to dismiss anyway, the president stood at a new pinnacle of his year-old administration. It was one from which all concerned could glimpse at last a future of soaring popularity that might well see Mr. Trump through his first term, and his party through what had been looking like a dire midterm election. The sense of almost giddy relief seemed palpable in the Capitol, where Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans greeted him with sustained applause, repeatedly rose into enthusiastic standing ovations, and at the end delivered a thunderous chorus of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” that would have done any party rally proud. Mr. Trump, for his part, played at Ozymandias, complete with frown, and wrinkled lip, and the sneer of cold command. He moved around the podium snuffling, nodding, mugging, gesticulating, applauding his own words, and squinting heroically (profile turned to the left!). He bit off choice words ferociously and gestured contemptuously toward the Democrats whenever they failed to join in the applause. He took full credit for every good thing that has happened in the last year, and if he did it with less grace and more braggadocio than most, well, that is what politicians do. The economy, in the ninth year of its expansion, is good, and the Islamic State has been vanquished, for now, even if it had already been reduced to a single, besieged city in the desert. If it seems remarkable that this thrice-married serial groper, who demonstrated during the campaign that he did not understand the most basic tenets of Christianity, would shout out: “We know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is ‘In God We Trust!’” — well, that’s par for the course as well, in our post-hypocrisy age. "
"The 21 Club, the venerated Midtown Manhattan restaurant, is famous for its clubby atmosphere and influential celebrity patrons, so it was strange recently to see its ornate iron gates padlocked and a sign explaining that the iconic place was closed because of water damage. Stranger still was a walk inside “21,” during what would normally be a bustling weekday. The place was emptied of its clientele, and largely gutted of its well-appointed décor and furnishings, revealing its original gritty endoskeleton. On Jan. 2, the restaurant flooded, causing damage that will keep it closed at least until March, with upper floor catering rooms closed at least until June. Broken pipes near the ceiling on the fifth floor set off three fire sprinklers, sending thousands of gallons of water into the restaurant’s walls and floors and cascading four floors down the restaurant’s old wooden staircase “like Niagara Falls,” said Teddy Suric, the general manager of “21.” Within a half-hour, the main water line from the street was shut, but not before the flooding had caved in ceilings and ruined several recently renovated bathrooms, Mr. Suric said.

"WASHINGTON — An Amtrak train carrying Republican lawmakers to their annual policy retreat crashed into a large truck in rural Virginia on Wednesday, killing one of the truck’s passengers. Two other passengers from the truck were injured — one seriously — and taken to a hospital. Two members of the train’s crew and at least two passengers, including Representative Jason Lewis, Republican of Minnesota, were also taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The crash occurred around 11:20 a.m. about 10 miles northwest of Charlottesville. By early afternoon, the train was on its way back to Charlottesville, where buses were waiting to finish the trip. The deceased passenger was identified by the local authorities as Christopher Foley, 28, of Louisa County, Va. The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the crash. Republicans had chartered the train to carry them from Washington to the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, where the party is holding its annual policy retreat through Friday. Several lawmakers who were aboard the train estimated that more than half of the Republican members of the House and Senate, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan, were on board, many with spouses. Mr. Ryan spoke by phone with President Trump to update him after the crash, White House officials said. "
"The Department of Justice on Wednesday dismissed all the remaining charges against Senator Robert Menendez, a decision that underscores how a 2016 Supreme Court ruling has significantly raised the bar for prosecutors who try to pursue corruption cases against elected officials. The motion to dismiss comes less than two weeks after prosecutors said they were intent on retrying Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and it allows him to run for re-election without having to face a second trial. The Justice Department on Wednesday cited last week’s decision by Judge William H. Walls to throw out several charges the senator had faced, including bribery counts stemming from accusations that Mr. Menendez lobbied on behalf of a wealthy Florida eye doctor in exchange for political donations. All charges against the doctor, Salomon Melgen, were also dismissed. “Given the impact of the court’s Jan. 24 order on the charges and the evidence admissible in a retrial, the United States has determined that it will not retry the defendants on the remaining charges,” said Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declining to provide any more details about the agency’s rationale. The unraveling of the case against Mr. Menendez is the latest example of how difficult it has become to win public corruption cases after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision to overturn the conviction of the former Republican governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, who had been accused of accepting luxury items, loans and vacations in exchange for helping a businessman, Jonnie R. Williams Sr. That decision drastically limited the kinds of “official acts” performed by lawmakers that can constitute bribery or corruption, with the court ruling that only specific actions could be deemed to cross a legal line. "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump announced Tuesday in his State of the Union address that he had signed an executive order to keep the Guantánamo Bay wartime prison open, he ad-libbed a line that was not in his staff-vetted prepared remarks, declaring that “in many cases,” terrorism detainees who are captured in the future will now be sent there. With that, Mr. Trump signaled that he still wants to fulfill a vow he made during the 2016 presidential campaign to fill the prison back up — even though he sent no new detainees there in his first year. But the problems with Guantánamo that so far have steered his administration to other options have not changed. “This is much easier said than done,” said Robert M. Chesney, a University of Texas, Austin, law professor who worked on a detention policy task force at the Justice Department in 2009. “Nothing in the new executive order changes the various legal and policy obstacles that help explain why no one was brought there in 2017, despite his campaign pledge.” Even if one rejects the Obama administration’s arguments that it is too expensive to imprison people at the American military base in Cuba and that it is a tainted symbol that fuels anti-Americanism, Guantánamo is unattractive because of three sets of practical problems, he said. They involve the Islamic State, transfers and the military commissions trial system. Mr. Trump’s new order was largely symbolic, rescinding an already obsolete executive order that President Barack Obama signed in January 2009. In it, Mr. Obama had directed the prison shuttered within one year. His administration failed to achieve that goal, although it did winnow the number of detainees to 41 from 242. Mr. Obama also refused to send any new detainees there. Mr. Trump’s order, by contrast, stated that the government may send new detainees to Guantánamo “when lawful and necessary to protect the nation,” which was already his administration’s policy, in theory. And if any new detainees are someday sent there, the order directs that they receive periodic reviews before a parole-like board established under Mr. Obama. "
"WASHINGTON — Now back to our regularly scheduled acrimony. While a toned-down President Trump called for more bipartisanship in his first State of the Union address Tuesday night, the reality is that relations between the two parties on Capitol Hill — and between Democrats and the White House — are badly strained if not downright toxic at present. The speech seemed to do little to ease tensions and in fact may have exacerbated them. Mr. Trump will find fulfilling his stated goals on public works projects, immigration and other top initiatives very difficult given the polarized atmosphere. Deep divisions were on display in the House chamber as Democrats sat stone-faced through most of the president’s remarks — rarely rising to offer even polite applause. Republicans cheered line after line, reserving one of their loudest roars for Mr. Trump’s celebration of “our massive tax cut” — a proposal opposed by every single Democrat in the House and Senate. Mr. Trump also celebrated overturning elements of the new health care law and drove home his success at lifting federal regulations and appointing conservative judges — other areas where he is at odds with Democrats. “I have never seen a president who cares nothing about reaching out to people who did not vote for him,” said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as he exited the Capitol after what he and many other Democrats considered a divisive speech meant mainly to appease Trump backers. As the president hailed a “new American moment,” reaction to the speech reflected the same dynamic of the past year — Republicans embracing Mr. Trump as a president who will advance their agenda despite quiet concerns about his behavior, while Democrats were appalled. "
"WASHINGTON — Representative Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who was swept into office with the Tea Party wave of 2010 and became one of the best-known investigators on Capitol Hill, said on Wednesday that he was leaving the House. “There is a time to come and a time to go,” Mr. Gowdy wrote on Twitter. He said he did not plan to file for re-election in the coming weeks and would not seek higher office. Mr. Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor who is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has been threatening to leave elected office for years. He has told associates that he wants to be a federal judge, ideally at the appellate level. On Wednesday, he said only that he planned to return to the world of criminal justice. A person familiar with the lawmaker’s plans said that Mr. Gowdy had turned down an offer by the Trump administration to nominate him for a judgeship on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and that he planned to enter private practice in South Carolina instead. “Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,” he said in a statement. “As I look back on my career, it is the jobs that both seek and reward fairness that are most rewarding.” "
"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. clashed publicly with President Trump for the first time on Wednesday, condemning a push by House Republicans to release a secret memo that purports to show how the bureau and the Justice Department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. “The F.B.I. was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it,” the bureau said in a statement, referring to the House Intelligence Committee. “As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” The high-profile comment by the F.B.I. thrust Christopher A. Wray, the bureau’s director, into a confrontation with the president, who had abruptly fired Mr. Wray’s predecessor, James B. Comey. Mr. Wray had pleaded in recent days at the White House to keep the document private. Mr. Trump wants to see the memo released, telling people close to him that he believes it makes the case that F.B.I. and Justice Department officials acted inappropriately when they sought the highly classified warrant in October 2016 on the campaign adviser, Carter Page. Democrats, who have sided with law enforcement on the matter, made a last-minute attempt to halt the process late Wednesday night when Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Representative Devin Nunes, its Republican chairman, charging that the Republicans had made “material changes” to the memo after voting to release it on Monday and before they sent it to the White House for review. Those changes, Mr. Schiff argued, meant that the committee should halt the review process and vote on the new, altered memo — a proposition that could potentially take days. "
"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s director can be fired by the president only for cause, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday, restoring security to a job that has become a political lightning rod. When Congress created the bureau seven years ago, it specified that the director — after being nominated to a five-year term by the president and confirmed by the Senate — could be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.” That standard differs from those in effect at most other federal agencies, whose leaders can typically be removed at will by a president. Last year, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the bureau’s setup to be unconstitutional. On Wednesday, the full circuit court issued a ruling that vacated the earlier decision and upheld the constitutionality of the consumer bureau’s structure. There is “no constitutional defect” in the unusual independence that lawmakers granted to the bureau’s director, the ruling issued on Wednesday said. The court added: “Congress’s decision to provide the C.F.P.B. director a degree of insulation reflects its permissible judgment that civil regulation of consumer financial protection should be kept one step removed from political winds and presidential will.” The Trump administration had argued in a court brief that the president should have the power to remove the agency’s leader at will. A Justice Department official said, “We are disappointed in the decision and reviewing our options.” The ruling, which can be appealed to the Supreme Court, stems from a lawsuit filed by the mortgage lender PHH Corporation challenging the scope of the bureau’s authority and a $109 million fine levied against the company. The appeals court left in place an earlier decision throwing out the fine. In a statement, PHH called the ruling on Wednesday “an important and gratifying outcome.” A PHH spokesman, Dico Akseraylian, said the company had not decided whether to appeal the ruling. The appeals court’s decision came too late to protect the suit’s initial target, Richard Cordray, who resigned in November. Mr. Cordray, a Democrat appointed by President Barack Obama, took an aggressive approach to regulation that made him unpopular with the financial industry. Mr. Cordray’s departure allowed President Trump to install his own acting director at the agency, Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director. Mr. Mulvaney has dropped some of his predecessor’s lawsuits and investigations, delayed new rules from taking effect and called for more “humility and prudence” at the bureau. A spokesman for the bureau said, “We are analyzing the decision.” Mr. Mulvaney’s appointment is also the subject of a continuing court battle that the Trump administration has prevailed in so far. Mr. Cordray, who is now running for governor of Ohio, praised the appeals court’s ruling. “Much more to be said, but today’s decision is all about maintaining independent law enforcement free from politics,” he wrote on Twitter. "
"Before last night’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump invited news correspondents to the White House, where he told them, “I would like to see the country united.” But hours later, he gave a speech meant to rally only part of the country. He complimented coal and welding in a love letter to the white working classes of Appalachia and the Midwest. By admonishing people who don’t stand for the national anthem, he reminded us that as president, he has picked fights with black N.F.L. players protesting police brutality. He repeatedly disparaged nonwhite people during his speech. Instead of unifying the country, President Trump made it clear, yet again, that he supports only white Americans — to hell with everyone else. The contrast between President Trump and President Barack Obama couldn’t be more apparent. President Obama understood that our country’s diversity was one of its greatest strengths and painted an inclusive picture of how America could move forward. “Our unique strengths as a nation — our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery and innovation, our diversity and commitment to the rule of law,” he said in 2016, in his last State of the Union address. “These things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.” But President Trump wants to divide the country between the white Americans he prizes and their purported foes, who may lurk around any corner unless he and Congress carry out the policies he described last night: the most extreme crackdown on immigration since 1924, an expansion of our nuclear arms program, the removal of federal employees who “undermine the public trust or fail the American people” and the continued operation of the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, which as of December 2017 held 41 people who are subject to indefinite detention in violation of due process.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Stephanie Clifford, the former pornographic-film actress known as Stormy Daniels, is not making life easy for the Trump administration. Just minutes after President Trump’s first State of the Union address ended Tuesday night, Ms. Clifford appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” where she did not deny — or confirm — having an affair with Mr. Trump. On Tuesday afternoon, a statement claiming to be from Stormy Daniels emerged that forcefully refuted all allegations of an affair. But on Mr. Kimmel’s show, Ms. Clifford strongly implied that she had not written that denial letter. (A lawyer for Mr. Trump had issued a separate letter signed by Ms. Daniels on Jan. 10 denying the affair. That letter was not in question here.) Mr. Kimmel pointed out that the signature on the more recent statement did not appear to match her autograph on other documents. She agreed, saying, “It does not look like my signature.” He then asked where she thought the letter had come from. “I do not know where it came from,” she said. “It came from the internet.” According to a report last month in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign team paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 to sign a nondisclosure agreement about an alleged affair. While she did not explicitly admit to Mr. Kimmel that she had signed such an agreement, she seemed to come close. At the end of the interview, Mr. Kimmel tried one more trick to coax out a definitive response. Ms. Clifford deftly deflected it. "
"The Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the United States is expected to bump up against its borrowing limit a month earlier than previously expected, a function of last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, which is resulting in less revenue for the Treasury Department. According to the budget office, the borrowing limit will most likely need to be raised in early March after the “extraordinary measures” to extend borrowing employed by the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are exhausted. The budget office previously projected that the debt limit would need to be raised beyond its current level of $20.5 trillion in late March or early April. The reason for the change stems from the tax cuts, which went into effect in January and are expected to translate into less revenue for the federal government. The Internal Revenue Service released new withholding tables this month to reflect the new, lower tax rates, which will result in companies withholding less money from worker paychecks. Beginning in February, the government is expected to see $10 billion to $15 billion less tax revenue each month. The Trump administration has said that faster economic growth spurred by the tax cuts will eventually allow the cuts to pay for themselves. Mr. Mnuchin has acknowledged that the additional revenues will be backloaded over the 10-year budget window and that he does not expect to see an increase in government revenues this year. On Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin called on Congress to lift the debt limit by the end of February in order for the United States to borrow more money to pay its bills. He said that the trajectory of the national debt was something that concerns President Trump but dismissed suggestions by Democrats that the tax cut was only worsening the fiscal situation, saying that if economic growth can be sustained at an annual rate of 3 percent, the tax cuts will pay for themselves. (Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, expects growth in the first three months of 2018 to fall to 2.3 percent.) "

That’s the nickname given to those who play HQ, the wildly popular trivia smartphone app that has been called “the best worst thing on the internet.” Twice daily, at 3 and 9 p.m. on weekdays (and once daily on weekends), as many as 1.6 million HQties across the country open the app for a live, 15-minute trivia run with the host Scott Rogowsky. Contestants who make it through all 12 questions — which become increasingly obscure and move so quickly that it’s nearly impossible to Google the answers — can win cash prizes. Some might be surprised to learn that the retro-themed trivia game, which resembles a ’90s cartoon mixed with a scene from “Alice in Wonderland,” is actually filmed at a studio in SoHo. Another possible shock: Mr. Rogowsky, 33, who goes by Quiz Daddy on the app and now has a following across the globe, is from New York and was, until recently, a struggling comedian here.

"It has been one year and 28 days since my last tweet. I deactivated my account shortly after President-elect Donald Trump tweeted, “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won’t happen!” on Jan. 2, 2017. The tweet struck me as an unsettling portent of how Trump’s presidency was likely to unfold: rash, petty, ostentatiously uninformed, with no regard for public safety or the mechanics of governance. The internet makes neighbors of us all, and my conscience demanded I put some virtual real estate between myself and the befuddled, racist mobster seemingly determined to dismantle and loot the republic. If seeding nuclear war wasn’t a violation of Twitter’s terms of service, then Twitter wasn’t a service I wanted to endorse. Exactly one year later, on Jan. 2, 2018, President Trump tweeted, “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” How exquisite it would have been to be wrong. Trump essentially daring Kim Jong-un (just a hop, a skip, and a Pacific away from my house in Seattle) to prove his nuclear capabilities is what finally pushed me over the edge, but the cliff itself was built of years of accumulated grievances with Twitter’s culture of harassment and its leadership’s torpid failure to fix it. When you work in media, Twitter becomes part of your job. It’s where you orient yourself in “the discourse” — figure out what’s going on, what people are saying about it and, more important, what no one has said yet. In a lucky coup for Twitter’s marketing team, prevailing wisdom among media types has long held that quitting the platform could be a career killer. The illusion that Twitter visibility and professional relevance are indisputably inextricable always felt too risky to puncture. Who could afford to call that bluff and be wrong? So, we stayed, while Twitter’s endemic racist, sexist and transphobic harassment problems grew increasingly more sophisticated and organized. Those of us who complained about online abuse were consistently told — by colleagues, armchair experts and random internet strangers — that we were the problem. We were too soft. We, who literally inured ourselves to rape threats and death threats so that we could participate in public life, were called weak by people who felt persecuted by the existence of female Ghostbusters. Meanwhile, Twitter’s leadership offered us the ability to embed GIFs. "
"Teachers across the country will soon be able to train for an active shooter on school grounds using a computer simulation that includes realistic details like gunfire, shattered glass and the screams of children. This vivid and realistic digital simulation was created by the federal government. It was modeled after a real school and includes 20 classrooms, a library, a cafeteria and a gymnasium with blue-padded walls. To depict the chaos of a school shooting, the software developers studied audio dispatches from the mass killings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. “It is a very traumatic, very panicky situation,” said John Verrico, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which funded the $5.6 million program. “We tried to make the environment just that disturbing.” Since the attack on Columbine High School in 1999, mitigating the damage of on-campus shootings has been an increasingly urgent priority. More than two-thirds of public schools nationwide practiced their response to a shooting in the 2013-14 academic year, according to the Department of Education; 10 years earlier, fewer than half of schools did so. Lockdown drills are now commonplace, and if safely escaping is not possible, teachers are advised to protect students by shutting off the lights, barricading doors and silencing cellphones. "
"In the 200 years since Mary Shelley wrote “Frankenstein,” her monster has turned up in countless variations — but few of them have been as wild or politically pointed as the monster in Ahmed Saadawi’s “Frankenstein in Baghdad,” which leads our list of recommended titles this week. It’s not the only fiction with politics on its mind: You’ll find a pair of satirical Chinese novellas, a symphonic look at Germany’s fraught history and, in Leni Zumas’s “Red Clocks,” a dystopian vision of American patriarchy. In nonfiction, we have Thomas Jefferson’s daughters and Donald Trump’s erosion of democratic norms, along with the battle for civil rights, the experience of immigrant high schoolers, and memoirs about bird-watching and bipolar disorder. And yes, we know that Frankenstein was actually the name of the doctor. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books FRANKENSTEIN IN BAGHDAD, by Ahmed Saadawi. (Penguin, paper, $16.) In Saadawi’s intense and surreal novel, an Iraqi junk peddler named Hadi starts to bring home the body parts of bomb victims, stitching them together in the hope that if he can create a whole corpse someone will give it a proper burial. The ensuing hallucinatory story is “funny and horrifying in a near-perfect admixture,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. Saadawi has “written a complex allegory for the tribal cruelties in Iraq in the wake of the American invasion.” WHEN THEY CALL YOU A TERRORIST: A Black Lives Matter Memoir, by Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Asha Bandele. (St. Martin’s, $24.99.) Khan-Cullors, an activist and a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, wrote this memoir with the journalist Bandele. Khan-Cullors grew up poor in Los Angeles, and attended a gifted program in a middle school in Sherman Oaks, a nearby affluent neighborhood. “There’s a persistent longing that threads through this book,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, “not so much for the consumerist dream represented by Sherman Oaks, but for the secure relationships she saw her wealthy, white classmates taking for granted.” A MORE BEAUTIFUL AND TERRIBLE HISTORY: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History, by Jeanne Theoharis. (Beacon, $27.95.) This history revisits the hostile reception that greeted civil rights activists half a century ago. It’s particularly attuned to how the legacies of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. have been co-opted into a narrative of uplift, with civil rights history sanitized for public consumption. “At bewildering moments like this one,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, “it’s clarifying to read a history that shows us how little we remember, and how much more there is to understand.” RED CLOCKS, by Leni Zumas. (Little, Brown, $26.) This highly absorbing novel imagines a near future of America in which abortion is illegal in all 50 states. Zumas has a perfectly tuned ear for the way society relies on a moralizing sentimentalism to restrict women’s lives and enforce conformity. “I doubt any reader will need to suspend disbelief for even a moment,” Naomi Alderman writes in her review. HERE IN BERLIN, by Cristina García. (Counterpoint, $26.) In a series of short quasi-fictional encounters, the Cuban-American novelist uses a chorus of voices to explore the long, ghostly reach of Germany’s history, in which the remembered or purposefully forgotten past seems as alive as the present. “We can none of us ever get entirely free of our ghosts, either personal or national,” our reviewer Wendy Lesser writes, “and Berlin, with its peculiar history of destruction and division, seems designed to bring that realization to the fore.” "
"WASHINGTON — The White House signaled on Thursday that President Trump would allow a secret memo written by Republican congressional aides to be made public, despite fears from some in the West Wing that it could prompt the resignation of the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, and lead to another crisis for the administration. Mr. Trump, who had a brief window to block the memo’s disclosure on national security grounds, was expected to tell Congress on Friday that he had no objections and would probably not request that any of its substance be redacted, according to a senior administration official. The president’s eagerness to see the document made public pitted him against his own top national security officials, who have warned that it omits crucial context and that its release would jeopardize sensitive government information. The memo is said to accuse federal law enforcement officials of abusing their authorities in seeking court permission to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser. White House aides worked on Thursday to accommodate concerns raised by Mr. Wray as well as Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence. It was unclear what changes, if any, were being made before the document was transmitted back to the House. White House officials cautioned that the situation remained fluid. Once Mr. Trump’s decision is formally conveyed to Congress, the House Intelligence Committee, whose leaders have pushed for its release, can make the document public. Exactly how and when that would happen was not immediately clear. Republicans were relying on a never-before-used House rule and did not telegraph their plans. Mr. Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein had already tried unsuccessfully this week to persuade the White House to stop the release of the memo, and Thomas O’Connor, the president of the F.B.I. Agents Association, issued a statement on Thursday supporting Mr. Wray. It thanked the director for “standing shoulder to shoulder with the men and women of the F.B.I.” and came a day after the bureau itself strongly condemned the push for the memo’s release. "
"WASHINGTON — Ahead of his first trip as secretary of state to South America, Rex W. Tillerson warned countries in the Western Hemisphere on Thursday about the dangers of the region’s growing trade with China and Russia. “China’s offer always comes at a price,” Mr. Tillerson said in a speech at the University of Texas, Austin, where he was once a student. “Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their own people.” In wide-ranging remarks, Mr. Tillerson also pledged more help in Mexico’s fight against drug cartels and Colombia’s peace initiative and efforts to cut back on coca production. He also called on both Cuba and Venezuela to embrace democracy, and said that updating the North American Free Trade Agreement and striking other trade deals were a priority. But his most pointed remarks came in his warning against Russian military sales and trade with China, which has displaced the United States as the largest trading partner for Chile, Argentina, Peru and Brazil. “Our region must be diligent to guard against faraway powers,” he said in an echo of what Chinese officials say about the United States in Asia. Left unsaid, though, was that the Trump administration has pulled back from trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is intended to serve as a check on China. The Chinese have been eager to fill the vacuums left by the United States on the world stage. "
"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department has effectively shuttered an Obama-era office dedicated to making legal aid accessible to all citizens, according to two people familiar with the situation. The division, the Office for Access to Justice, began as an initiative in 2010 under former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to increase and improve legal resources for indigent litigants in civil, criminal and tribal courts. Though the head of the office reports directly to the associate attorney general, it never gained much visibility within the Justice Department because it did not oversee a large staff of prosecutors. While Attorney General Jeff Sessions cannot close the office without notifying the Congress, he can sideline it by moving its resources elsewhere. Its offices now sit dark on the third floor of the Justice Department building. The staff of a dozen or so has dwindled and left the department over the past few months, the people said. Maha Jweied, the acting director of the department, left this month to start a consulting business, according to her LinkedIn profile. The Justice Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment, and Ms. Jweied did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Career prosecutors emphasized that new administrations reshuffle the Justice Department’s priorities, de-emphasizing or shuttering projects that previous administrations had supported to devote resources to their own agendas. The office’s stated mission was to “deliver outcomes that are fair and accessible to all, irrespective of wealth and status.” It worked with other federal, state and local entities in the justice system to “increase access to counsel and legal assistance” for people who could not afford lawyers.

The resignation of the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only adds to a list of Trump administration scandals that has already become terribly long. This newsletter first published a list of those scandals last year, and my colleague Ian Prasad Philbrick and I have updated it to include a few new entries from this week. “There have been 4 new stories about Trump administration self-dealing in the last day alone,” Jonathan Chait of New York magazine tweeted yesterday. (Chait’s story is here.) The C.D.C. director, Brenda Fitzgerald, quit after a damning exposé by Politico’s Sarah Karlin-Smith and Brianna Ehley. They reported that Fitzgerald had purchased shares in a tobacco company after taking charge of the agency that discourages smoking. Other revelations include conflicts of interest involving Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development (via The Washington Post); the Trump family real-estate business (via The Palm Beach Post); and Trump’s infrastructure advisers (via Democracy Forward Foundation). Even apart from the Russia story — be sure to read the latest Times scoop on Russia if you haven’t yet — this administration is more scandal-plagued than any other in memory. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday boasted, incorrectly, that his State of the Union address drew the highest number of viewers in history. He was off by millions of people. Mr. Trump’s claim that his address was “the highest number in history,” is wrong because it ranks ninth out of the annual addresses delivered by presidents since 1993. President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union speech in 2010 beat Mr. Trump’s by about 2 million, with some 48 million viewers. Even factoring in online streams, Mr. Trump’s address would not outrank Mr. Obama’s. It is impossible to do a conclusive tally, but the White House’s official stream of Mr. Trump’s address on YouTube has drawn roughly 51,000 views while Mr. Obama’s 2010 address has been viewed 524,000 times. But wait, there’s more. According to the Nielsen Company’s ratings, President George W. Bush’s addresses in 2002 and 2003 drew even more viewers than Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama, topping off at 51.8 million and 62.1 million; and President Bill Clinton’s addresses in 1994 and 1998 were viewed by 45.8 million and 53 million people "
"Good morning. Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) One of the trickiest things to write about if you are a reporter covering Los Angeles for a New York-based newspaper — as I have been for close to eight years — is the subject of Los Angeles itself. I was reminded of that this week when I, along with a colleague, Tim Arango, wrote a piece about the turmoil at the Los Angeles Times and explored what it said about the lack of civic institutions in Los Angeles. The angle was new, but it’s not a particularly new observation or thought. The Los Angeles Times addressed many of the same questions in 2006 and again in 2015, when an organization was founded by longtime civic figures here to respond to what they saw as a civic vacuum. I am also well aware of the (in truth, well-founded, in my view) wariness Los Angeles readers have of East Coast media coming in and offering look-down-your-nose judgments on life here. (Botox! Day care for dogs! Traffic!) It is a trope that I and my colleagues in the bureau here have tried at all costs to avoid. Part of the challenge and allure of covering a place like Los Angeles is people have very strong opinions of, and loyalty to, the place where they live. I expected the story would ignite a hearty and thoughtful debate, though I wasn’t quite prepared for how my Twitter feed blew up the night it posted. And the next morning. And the next afternoon. The story is based on interviews with prominent Los Angeles figures, including a former mayor and two people who headed commissions that tried to deal with governance in the city. And on a personal note, I not only love living here, I think this is one of the most — if not the most — interesting municipalities to cover in the nation, if not the world. So in that spirit, here are some of the responses we got, on social media and in emails to our newsletter, California Today. They have been edited for clarity and brevity. "
"At 8:30 a.m. on Friday, dozens of economics journalists will simultaneously flood the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for a monthly ritual known officially as the Employment Situation and informally as “jobs day.” The monthly employment report is almost certainly the single most-watched of the government’s economic indicators. It’s where we learn how many jobs employers added the previous month, as well as what happened to the unemployment rate, hourly earnings and dozens of other measures of the labor market’s health. The report can move markets, influence monetary policy and set off political ripples — especially if President Trump, as he often does, weighs in on Twitter. Jobs day has also become something of a monthly club meeting for economics nerds, complete with its own clubhouse (Twitter) and secret language: “beats” and “misses,” U-3 and U-6 (two different measures of unemployment), and an alphabet soup of obscure acronyms and abbreviations. Reporters, economists and policy wonks race to post charts; call out interesting tidbits; and, inevitably, argue about how to interpret the latest batch of data. I’ve participated in this frenzy nearly every month since 2011. I have covered job reports for The Wall Street Journal, for the data journalism site FiveThirtyEight and now for The Times. When jobs day happened to fall during my two-week break between news outlets last year, I couldn’t stay away — I covered the report on my personal Twitter account. (You think that’s bad? A colleague at The Upshot, Neil Irwin, did the same while on his honeymoon.) No matter the venue, the mission is the same: to distill the data to its essential themes as quickly as possible. The trouble is, the report doesn’t always make that easy. To understand why, it helps to know a bit about the jobs report. For one thing, it’s really two reports stitched together. One, based on a survey of employers, provides information on jobs: how many were created (or eliminated) the previous month and how much those jobs pay. The other, based on a survey of households, focuses on individuals: how many are working or not working, along with information on their age, race, education and other characteristics. "
"WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — President Trump turned up the pressure on Democrats on Thursday to come to an agreement with Republicans on protections for young undocumented immigrants, asserting that opposition leaders “talk a good game” but cared more about politics than actually resolving the matter. In a speech to Republican lawmakers at their annual retreat, Mr. Trump complained that Democrats were unwilling to budge and would rather see him fail than make progress on immigration or other issues that would benefit the country. At the same time, he warned his fellow Republicans that they would have to make compromises themselves to reach a deal. “They talk a good game with DACA, but they don’t produce,” Mr. Trump said of Democrats, referring to the Obama-era policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that he has ordered canceled. “Either they come on board or we’re just going to have to really work” to elect more Republicans in the midterm congressional elections in the fall. Mr. Trump moved in September to end the DACA program, which grants work permits to immigrants brought to the country illegally as children and protects them from deportation, on the grounds that President Barack Obama exceeded his authority by creating it through executive action. But Mr. Trump has expressed support for protecting those immigrants, known as Dreamers, through legislation if Congress can agree. He gave lawmakers until March 5 to take action, though his cancellation of the program is now tied up in the court system. The president’s comments on Thursday in his speech at the retreat, held at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, came hours after he denounced Democrats on Twitter for “doing nothing about DACA.” "

"TEL AVIV — When Vice President Mike Pence spoke to the Knesset on Jan. 22, legislators who oppose a two-state solution sent a clear signal that they have taken President Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital as a green light to proceed with initiatives to annex portions of the West Bank. The signal came in two parts: As Mr. Pence reiterated America’s commitment to Israeli-Palestinian peace, every member of the governing right-wing coalition stayed silent while opposition legislators rose to applaud. More stunningly, the Knesset’s speaker, Yuli Edelstein, declared that Israel will “develop the whole of the country, including Judea and Samaria,” referring to the biblical names for the entire West Bank. But none of the legislative initiatives toward that goal addresses the implications for Israel’s security that would come with them. That is a potentially fatal lapse, because what now seems to be under serious consideration would have disastrous consequences for Israel’s security and would undermine American interests throughout the Middle East. It is no accident that none of the proposals suggests annexing the entire West Bank. Even the most zealous legislators realize that absorbing all of the West Bank’s 2.7 million Palestinians would threaten Israel’s existence as a Jewish and democratic state. Consequently, those seeking to block prospects for separation from the Palestinians into two states look for a “luxurious annexation”: absorb as much of the land, with as little of the population, as possible. Competing proposals put forward by the end of January included annexing all Jewish settlements in the West Bank without touching areas populated by Palestinians. Another would annex the Gush Etzion and Ariel settlement blocs plus the Jordan Valley. Yet another would create a region called “Greater Jerusalem.” "
"President Trump’s immigration proposal has put Democrats in a bind; they know it and he knows it. Trump’s immigration “framework” — first outlined on Jan. 25 — represents an unusually sophisticated strategy. He proposes to more than double the number of Dreamers granted a path to citizenship, a significant concession to Democrats. In return, he seeks approval of a set of policies strongly opposed by the left, each of which is designed to stem what Trump sees as a threatening increase in the nonwhite population of the United States. What kind of numbers are we talking about? According to the Pew Research Center: There are now an estimated 690,000 registered Dreamers in the United States, all of whom were brought to this country as children before 2007. Trump’s offer would increase the number offered a path to citizenship to 1.8 million by adding those who are eligible for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), but who never registered. For a Democratic Party whose electoral strength depends on Hispanic support (64 percent of Latinos identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party in 2016) preventing the deportation of the Dreamers and providing them with legal status has become a matter of political necessity. Trump, acutely aware of the importance of DACA to Democrats, deliberately turned the status of Dreamers into a crisis on Sept. 5 when he ended the Dreamers program. Since then, DACA has been the subject of constant debate and negotiation. Democrats have continued to threaten to shut down the government, when the Treasury runs out of money on Feb. 8, if no favorable agreement can be reached. "
"Late last year, Tom Nichols, a professor at the Naval War College and a NeverTrump conservative, proposed a little thought experiment for Republicans skeptical of Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s Russia ties. “Let’s play Alternate Universe,” he wrote on Twitter. “It’s 2017, and President Hillary Clinton is facing charges that Chelsea met with Russians who offered oppo on Trump. Chelsea didn’t call the FBI; and Clinton nat sec adviser Jake Sullivan lied to the FBI about talking to the Russians.” Nichols laid out the unfolding drama over a series of tweets. President Clinton fires the F.B.I. director after he declines her request to “let it go” on Sullivan. “Then, at least three other Clinton campaign officials end up indicted. All of them are tied in some way to a hostile foreign power.” Later, she threatens to “yank FOX’s license” because she didn’t like its critical coverage. “I’m sure … totally sure …” Nichols added with no little irony, “that stalwarts of the G.O.P. would say: Look, this is a nothingburger, you can’t define ‘collusion,’ it’s just ‘the coffee boy,’ and on and on.” I’m reminded of Nichols’ astute tweets as the Republican campaign against the Russia investigation kicked into higher gear this week. At the State of the Union on Tuesday night, Trump was overheard telling Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, that he was “100 percent” committed to releasing House Committee Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes’s secret memo on the Russia investigation, over fierce F.B.I. objections regarding “material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.” "
"Diplomacy and politics may go hand in hand, but their partnership isn’t one of equals. It is logical — especially in a democracy — for a country’s diplomacy to serve its political leaders. Sometimes, however, smart leaders allow diplomacy to influence politics. For that influence to be truly worthwhile, governments around the world must solve an acute problem: Global diplomacy today is not very effective, in part because it is misunderstood and starved of resources. The best diplomacy carries out foreign policy professionally, yet most countries let amateurs practice it. I’m talking about appointees who receive diplomatic posts thanks only to political connections. To resolve at least some of the many conflicts, disputes and other problems around the world, governments must start building or strengthening professional diplomatic services, providing them with proper training and career development, and giving them all the tools, resources and authority necessary to get the job done. Few countries come close to this standard today. No one is born with the ability to practice international diplomacy — to manage a country’s relations with other states, understand and engage foreign societies, influence governments and publics, conduct difficult and consequential negotiations, anticipate threats and take advantage of opportunities. These are skills that have to be acquired. The mantra among career diplomats has long held that on-the-job training — not lessons in a classroom — is the only way to learn how to practice diplomacy. As a result, many countries’ official representatives don’t get anything that resembles proper training before they are posted abroad. They are left to figure things out as they go along, taking months or even years to get a decent grasp of what exactly their job entails. Some governments have outsourced a big part of diplomats’ work to lobbyists and consultants. Many embassies in Washington use the costly services of public relations firms to do their bidding. At the same time, some of their own employees arrive with barely any knowledge about how Washington works and how to navigate the government bureaucracy. Another recent trend — no doubt following an example of a regrettable American practice — has been to increase political appointments in ambassadorial and other diplomatic posts. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s re-election campaign raised $15.2 million in the last three months of last year, and spent $1.2 million on legal fees — with much of the cash going to law firms responding to investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election — according to campaign finance reports. The reports, filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday evening, indicate that Mr. Trump’s campaign and two fund-raising committees it formed with the Republican National Committee — Trump Victory and Trump Make America Great Again — entered this year with $32.3 million in the bank. That is an unusually large nest egg for a president at this point in a first term, reflecting an earlier and more aggressive start to re-election fund-raising that began almost immediately after Mr. Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in a campaign in which she drastically outspent him. Mr. Trump and his team seem determined not to repeat that. They have worked to woo major donors of the sort who were slow to embrace Mr. Trump — paying to host fund-raising events at upscale venues like his hotel here. One of the joint committees paid $7,000 last month for catering and facility rental at Wynn Las Vegas, the casino hotel founded by Stephen Wynn, who had served as the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee until stepping down last week after being accused of a yearslong pattern of sexual misconduct. The top donor to Mr. Trump was the New York private equity executive Stephen A. Schwarzman, who gave $344,000 to Trump Victory. The Dallas oil heir Al G. Hill Jr. donated $200,000 in October, before dying in December at 72. A considerable portion of the money raised in the fourth quarter, more than $4 million, came from supporters who gave $200 or less. "

"On Tuesday evening, Arsenal suffered another one of those indignities that tend to pockmark its seasons. This time, the humiliation came in the driving rain of South Wales and at the hands of Swansea City: facing a team at the bottom of the Premier League table, Arsenal dominated the game, monopolized possession and then went and lost anyway, 3-1. For Arsenal’s fans, these defeats have become wearily familiar in the last decade or so, as Arsène Wenger’s two-decade reign at the club has drifted into a sort of managed decline. They have turned Arsenal into a place hard-wired to treat every disappointment as an existential crisis. The reaction, now, is so habitual that it is almost comforting, one of the few fixed points in soccer’s ever-changing landscape. There are the calls for Wenger to abandon — or be relieved of — his post with immediate effect. There are the videos, drawn from Arsenal’s compelling YouTube fan channels, of despair and rage, going viral. There are the fuming calls to phone-in programs, the cascade of former players bemoaning a great institution on its knees. Occasionally, when things get really bad, there are light aircraft. Tuesday should have been a classic of the genre. Losing at Swansea in any circumstance, for a club of Arsenal’s ambition, would be a setback. Given that Arsenal has now won only three of its last 11 Premier League games, and that it sits 8 points behind Chelsea for the fourth, and final, Champions League spot for next season — the bare minimum requirement for a passable campaign, by Wenger’s own estimation — this defeat qualified as indicative of a deep-rooted problem. And yet, by Wednesday morning, none of it had materialized. There were no grumblings of mutiny, no furious videos racking up the retweets, no flood of thinkpieces about where it has all gone wrong, no rending of garments or gnashing of teeth. "
"Can private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It’s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House. There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success — a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school — there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be. But companies haven’t stopped trying. Just this past week, the ambitions reached new heights when three of today’s most successful business leaders said they would form an independent company aimed at lowering the burden that health care places on the economy while improving the system for their employees. In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves. “The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.” Joining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care? "
"To the Editor: Re “The Decline of Anti-Trumpism” (column, Jan. 9): While I agree with David Brooks that it is not helpful for the anti-Trump movement to become consumed with some of the same misguided standards of many of the president’s apologists, I think that it is important to consider why Republicans are choosing to simply look the other way, or worse, lavish him with the acclaim that he so clearly relishes. One of the most lasting memories of those old enough to have lived through Watergate is of patriots like Howard Baker and John Dean who risked their political careers by speaking publicly about unacceptable threats to our democracy by President Richard M. Nixon. They chose allegiance to the Constitution and the country over obsequious actions like those of Senator Lindsey Graham and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Brooks would do better by focusing on what powerful leaders can do to stand up for and help preserve our democracy rather than lamenting the excesses of those who have adopted the same “lowbrowism” that is found both in Trump supporters and opponents.

"It’s hard to come away from the State of the Union address without a heightened sense of foreboding about President Trump’s intentions toward North Korea. The signs increasingly point to unilateral American military action. To which we say: Don’t. The references to North Korea in the address were worrying enough. Mr. Trump called the country’s leadership “depraved.” He trumpeted his “campaign of maximum pressure” to ensure that the North does not succeed in perfecting a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the continental United States. He asserted that “past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.” He pledged, “I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.” Mr. Trump seemed to be building a case for war on emotional grounds, invoking the case of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who died last year after being detained by North Korea. “Tonight we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with total American resolve,” the president said. The Warmbier family was among the president’s guests in the gallery. To an extent, such words were in line with his history of bellicosity toward North Korea, whose nuclear program and brutal regime are indeed grave threats and demand an effective response. Last year he threatened to answer North Korean provocations with fire and fury “the likes of which this world has never seen before.” What made Mr. Trump’s latest comments most alarming was the context. They were delivered as South Korean efforts to dial down the tension with the North, through dialogue and joint participation in the Winter Olympics, appeared to be bearing fruit. And they came just after it was reported that the administration had abandoned a long-delayed plan to nominate a prominent Korea scholar, Victor Cha, as its ambassador to Seoul. Mr. Cha, a senior Asia adviser in the George W. Bush administration and now a Georgetown University professor, has the credentials and experience often lacking in administration nominees. He completed the vetting process required of potential senior government officials, and South Korea had agreed to his appointment. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • How did a divisive statement written on Air Force One last year come together, and how much did President Trump oversee the process? Prosecutors have recently questioned numerous White House officials to find out. Our Washington reporters compiled a detailed timeline of how the administration responded to news of a meeting in 2016 between Russians and top Trump campaign officials. A statement described it as being about a Russian adoption policy; in fact, it involved an offer of political dirt about Hillary Clinton. • On Wednesday, the F.B.I. condemned a push by House Republicans to release a secret memo said to show how law enforcement officials abused their authority in the Russia inquiry. Mr. Trump has said he wants the document released. • During his State of the Union address, President Trump noted that “Americans are Dreamers, too,” adopting a term used to refer to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally. The reaction in Congress was sharply divided on Wednesday, and the two sides in the immigration debate now seem further apart than ever. "
"Democrats could be forgiven for dreaming about a “blue” Florida.  It is diversifying as fast as Texas or Arizona, and the demographic composition of its electorate may be poised to shift even faster than anticipated. As many as 300,000 people have fled to Florida from Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. And a ballot initiative this November could return the vote to the state’s estimated 1.5 million discharged felons. At first glance, either tally of these two Democratic-leaning groups would seem to dwarf Donald J. Trump’s 113,000-vote margin of victory in the state in 2016. But the reality for Democrats is that neither development is likely to fundamentally alter Florida’s political character heading into the 2020 election. The main reason? The electoral effect dwindles after accounting for the relatively low turnout rates among these groups. More generally, even big demographic shifts that seem to favor Democrats could easily be swamped by other demographic shifts that do the opposite. Of the two major shifts — assuming the ballot measure clears the 60 percent approval required, and that’s hardly a sure thing  — the influx of Puerto Ricans is probably less likely to have a major effect. That’s even if you accept the high-end estimate of 300,000 new residents (and some university professors have questioned that total). To start, exclude the roughly 75,000 children out of that 300,000 figure, based on the 24 percent of Puerto Ricans who were younger than 18 in the 2010 census. Then consider how many eligible adults will actually register to vote. Let’s generously assume that 57 percent will register by 2020, the same share for Hispanic adult citizens nationwide, according to the 2016 census Current Population Survey. That would mean around 130,000 newly registered voters, not all of whom will vote. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Samantha Bee continues to speak out against workplace harassment, and on Wednesday’s “Full Frontal” she focused on so-called forced arbitration clauses, which often serve to silence women when they accuse co-workers of misconduct. Bee sat down with the former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who sued Roger Ailes in 2016 for sexual harassment and is now pushing Congress to pass legislation limiting the use of forced arbitration. Bee admitted to making fun of Carlson “for 12 straight years at my previous gig” — “The Daily Show” — but she said fighting workplace harassment should be a bipartisan effort. The other late-night shows focused on President Trump’s State of the Union address, and each host seemed to have his own particular beef with it. Some were skeptical of the president’s appeals to bipartisanship. Bee took issue with the way the president addressed the debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that protects from deportation young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.

"Religious colleges would be able to bar openly same-sex relationships without fear of repercussions. Religious student groups could block people who do not share their faith from becoming members. Controversial speakers would have more leverage when they want to appear at colleges. A 590-page higher-education bill working its way through Congress is a wish list for a wide range of people, groups and colleges saying that their First Amendment rights — freedom of speech, religion or assembly — are being trampled. Many of them are religious, right-leaning or both, and the Republicans behind the bill have eagerly taken up the cause, correcting what they see as antipathy toward conservative beliefs on American campuses. “Colleges and universities, both public and private, have long been considered environments that support robust debate and freedom, and Republican members of Congress share that belief and are sending a message to the higher education community that these important issues cannot be ignored,” Michael Woeste, a spokesman for Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chairwoman of the House education committee, said in a statement. The bill’s religious elements reflect the continuing national debate over whether the First Amendment covers actions that might otherwise be called discriminatory. That very question is before the Supreme Court in the case of a Colorado baker, Jack Phillips, who said that being forced to make a wedding cake for a gay couple would violate his religious freedom. Last month the Trump administration expanded protections for health care workers who object to performing procedures like abortion and gender reassignment surgery, one of President Trump’s “historic actions to protect religious liberty” that he heralded during the State of the Union address on Tuesday.

"CAIRO — When it comes to securing a second term in power, Egypt’s president is leaving little to chance. Potential rivals in the March election have been sidelined, jailed or threatened with prosecution. The news media is largely in his pocket. On polling day, Egyptians will have a choice between President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and one of his most ardent supporters — an obscure politician drafted at the 11th hour to avoid the embarrassment of a one-horse race. As he cruises toward victory, Mr. Sisi need not worry either about foreign censure: President Trump has hailed the Egyptian leader as a “fantastic guy,” and most other Western leaders have been largely silent. Across the world, autocratic leaders are engaging in increasingly brazen behavior — rigging votes, muzzling the press and persecuting opponents — as they dispense with even a fig leaf of democratic practice once offered to placate the United States or gain international legitimacy. The global tide is driven by a bewildering range of factors, including the surge of populism in Europe, waves of migration, and economic inequality. And leaders of countries like Egypt, which had long been sensitive to Washington’s influence, know they run little risk of rebuke from an American president who has largely abandoned the promotion of human rights and democracy in favor of his narrow “America First” agenda. In Cambodia, Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled the country for 33 years, has led a sweeping crackdown on opponents before elections this summer. In November, Mr. Trump flashed a big thumbs-up as he posed for a photo with Mr. Hun Sen, who later praised the American president for what he called his lack of interest in human rights. "
"MANBIJ, Syria — The front line between rival American-backed and Turkish-backed militias in northern Syria, just eight miles north of Manbij, snakes over mostly barren hillsides and through newly planted olive orchards. It consists of many miles of bulldozed earthworks, with fortified bunkers every few hundred yards. This is the line, along the Sajur River valley, that Turkish forces would have to cross if ordered to carry out President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s threat to extinguish Kurdish control in northern Syria, and it is also the line the American military has said it will not give up to Turkey, its NATO ally. The possibility of a military conflict between two NATO allies is unprecedented but, after years of deteriorating relations between Turkey and the United States, not unthinkable. If Turkey were to attack Kurdish forces and their allies in Manbij, and the American military intervened, the strains on the NATO alliance would be extreme. The local front-line commander for the Manbij Military Council, Shiar Gherde, is keenly aware of the tenuous nature of his position, but his worries are not tactical. “This is a political conflict now, more than a military one,” Mr. Gherde said during a tour on Wednesday of his fighters’ fortifications. And politically, as he saw it, the Americans are on their side. The Manbij Military Council is aligned with the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, and while the majority of the council’s fighters are Arabs, most of its field commanders, like Mr. Gherde, are Kurds. Mr. Gherde took out his Samsung tablet to consult a military map online, thanks to a strong signal from his enemies’ Turkcell network. Like most Kurdish commanders, Mr. Gherde has no formal rank. He pointed to the northeast at a hillock surrounded by whitish earthworks, which he said was the local Turkish base, then consulted his map to work out the distance: 3.5 kilometers, or about two miles. Clearly visible, the base was out of rifle range, and even out of range of their big .50-caliber machine guns nestled just behind the berms. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. That Republican memo that’s roiling Washington? It could become public as early as Friday. President Trump cleared the way for the release of the memo, which is said to criticize the F.B.I.’s actions in obtaining a warrant to spy on Mr. Trump’s campaign adviser Carter Page, above. That puts the ball in the House Intelligence Committee’s court. The uproar has everything to do with the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s role in the presidential election.

"Democrats offered five separate responses to President Trump’s State of the Union address, differing in content and tone but united in their disapproval of Mr. Trump. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts gave the official Democratic rebuttal on Tuesday night, in which he portrayed Mr. Trump as a divisive figure. Elizabeth Guzman, a delegate in Virginia’s State Assembly, delivered another Democratic Party response in Spanish. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont followed with his own response. Donna Edwards, a former congresswoman from Maryland, spoke on behalf of the Working Families Party, a minor party with several state-based chapters. And Representative Maxine Waters of California spoke on Black Entertainment Television on Wednesday night. The New York Times fact-checked Mr. Trump’s address in real time. Now, here’s an assessment of the various Democrats’ responses. Mr. Kennedy is likely referring to a 2014 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. It found that compensation for chief executives at the top 350 American firms was about 300 times more than their employees. To start, that figure is out of date. The institute’s most recent study on the matter, released in 2017, found a smaller — but still high — ratio of 271 to 1. "

With Bickelhaupt’s wife, Alexa, running the front of the house, the two entered into a successful partnership that nonetheless buckled under the combined stresses of their personal and professional lives. “42 Grams” offers up the eye candy of a typical foodie doc, but it also witnesses the volatility and ego that sabotage their dreams.

Add it to your Watchlist The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman burst onto the scene with this wholly original, playfully surreal comedy about a portal into John Malkovich’s head that allows people to experience his state of being for 15 minutes at a time. Kaufman and director Spike Jonze delight in playing around in this metaphysical space, while also offering up such absurd creations as an office space on a half-floor and a 60-foot Emily Dickinson puppet. Yet “Being John Malkovich” is sneakily moving, turning on the common and melancholy yearning of what it’s like to want to escape your own skin.

Director John Stockwell, who made the fine teen romance “Crazy/Beautiful,” has a good handle on the emotional state of a gifted young surfer (Kate Bosworth) who’s trying to make it back in the water after near-fatal incident. Her comeback follows the usual sports-movie formula, but for surfing footage so spectacularly rendered, that much is forgiven.

Director Peter Berg doesn’t have time to explore fully the characters and social complexities of Bissinger’s book, but he does capture the pressure-cooker atmosphere of a place where football is religion. All that pressure is brought to bear on the coach (Billy Bob Thornton), who’s expected to win every game or lose his job.

Following a former assassin out for revenge, “Kill Bill” spans multiple genres and pays tribute to dozens of movies in creative ways. One of the most notable of those tributes is the yellow and black tracksuit Uma Thurman wears in the first volume, a callback to Bruce Lee’s outfit in “Game of Death.”

"The 20 largest employers in the United States now offer paid parental leave to at least some of their workers. Lowe’s, which had been the only one that gave no employees paid time off after they had a baby,  announced a new leave policy for all new parents on Thursday. Under the policy, which goes into effect May 1, birth mothers will have 10 weeks of paid leave, and all other parents — including fathers and adoptive, foster and same-sex parents — will have two weeks of paid leave. All salaried and full-time hourly employees, like those who work in Lowe’s stores and distribution centers, will receive the benefit. In most American families, both parents work, and many are struggling to combine work and parenthood. Companies have been trying to adjust to that fact. In the absence of a federal paid leave policy — the United States is the only industrialized country not to have one — companies and some states and cities have been starting their own. President Trump called for paid leave in his State of the Union address Tuesday, but did not say whether he supported a government policy or, as some Republicans have suggested, tax incentives or other encouragement for more private companies to offer it. “Let us support working families by supporting paid family leave,” he said. Large majorities of Americans favor paid parental leave, but only about one-fifth think state or federal government should pay for it, according to two recent Pew Research Center surveys. More than half said employers should provide it. Respondents were split on whether the government should require it. The biggest employers have an easier time paying for leave and replacing employees when they are out. Small business owners say it’s much more challenging for them. Although 94 percent of respondents in the Pew survey said paid leave would be good for families, 57 percent said it would be bad for small businesses. Despite the policies at the biggest employers, only 13 percent of private industry workers have access to paid family leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Paid leave increases the chances that women keep working after having children, research has shown. It also has benefits for babies’ health, mothers’ physical and mental health, and gender equity. It’s a sign of employee demand and a competitive job market that Lowe’s and other companies are offering paid leave to hourly employees, not just salaried ones. Starbucks and AT&T also recently expanded their policies for some hourly workers. The Lowe’s policy is among the most generous for hourly employees, who are 59 percent of the American work force. Hourly employees are generally much less likely than salaried employees to receive paid leave, but they are also less likely to be able to afford unpaid leave or newborn child care. At the 20 largest employers, six others give birth mothers or primary caregivers 10 weeks or more among hourly employees. Just eight others guarantee other parents any time at all. More complete details on company policies are available here.  "
"Every major policy overhaul has unanticipated consequences, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be no exception. One tantalizing possibility for this one: The Republican tax overhaul helps Democrats in the midterm and 2020 elections by bringing forward the date at which a few critical states — Georgia and possibly even Texas — flip from red to blue. How might this happen? It stems from the new caps on the home mortgage interest and state and local tax deductions. Restrictions on building have pushed up the costs of housing in expensive coastal blue-state cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. High income and property taxes piled onto exorbitant rents and mortgage payments amount to cost-of-living force fields that already deflect talented workers to relatively affordable red-state cities, like Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C. The tax act’s ceiling on deductions is likely to make many blue-state metro areas even more expensive — at least in the short run. With the Republican changes to the tax code, the high-cost dynamic that has effectively redistributed some probable Democratic voters from left-leaning to right-leaning states will be thrown into overdrive. Furthermore, the lowered corporate tax rate is also more likely to spur capital investment, business expansion and job growth in places that are both economically thriving and comparatively cheap — many of them urban areas in red states — which should bring a relative abundance of attractive new opportunities and cost-conscious job seekers. It’s only mildly surprising that Republican tax reform would stick it to Democratic states and goose the growth of powerful Republican states. But it might come as a shock that this could speed us toward the date when these states are no longer reliably Republican. "
"Most presidents will at some point benefit from a surging economy and stock market, but none has claimed more credit for them than Donald J. Trump, as he did again during this week’s State of the Union address. Among the highlights: • “$8 trillion and more” in stock market gains. • “2.4 million new jobs” created since his election. • “Over 3 million workers have gotten tax-cut bonuses” and “rising wages.” • All thanks to “the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.” Since the president has frequently complained that the media denies him credit for any of this, I thought it only fair to assess the degree to which the undeniably strong economy, low unemployment and surging stock market are because of Mr. Trump’s achievements, notably his sweeping tax bill. It turns out that’s no easy task, especially since Mr. Trump has only been president for a year, and the tax legislation is little more than a month old. Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagan’s 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passage. “It’s not like chemistry or physics where you can do a controlled experiment and change one variable,” said Joel Slemrod, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, and co-author of a seminal study of the economic impact of the 1986 tax reform act. “We can never be entirely sure because we don’t know what would have happened without the tax act.” Even so, “there are specific things that are hard to imagine being attributed to anything else” other than the tax legislation, said Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor Slemrod’s co-author on the study of the 1986 reform. With that in mind, here’s a look at the major areas where Mr. Trump claims credit. The S.&P. 500 index rose 23 percent during Mr. Trump’s first year in office, an increase surpassed only by Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama, both Democrats who took office in the wake of financial crises and stock market crashes. Mr. Trump’s policies and Republicans in Congress deserve some credit, given that economists expect the cut in corporate taxes to raise company earnings, and stock prices are fundamentally a reflection of earnings expectations.

"For all of Bill de Blasio’s first term, New York City saw uninterrupted growth in tax revenue and continued economic expansion, enabling him to spend like no other mayor in the city’s history, growing the payroll and work force to a new level. With the Trump administration threatening to cut federal aid, the coming year’s budget represents the first potential check to the mayor’s spending habits. On Thursday, Mr. de Blasio released a preliminary budget that contained few new projects and offered little guidance on how the city would deal with possible cuts from Washington. In fact, the mayor called for an increase in spending to $88.7 billion in the next fiscal year, and he adjusted spending up for this fiscal year, to $87.4 billion or about $3 billion more than projected at this point a year ago. City officials acknowledged that at least $700 million was already at risk because of changes to federal payments for public hospitals and a dampening of the value of tax credits for affordable housing. The situation could worsen when President Trump releases his budget later this month. Mr. de Blasio also underscored the “risks from Albany” in his presentation, and highlighted the harm of a projected $400 million in cost shifts or cuts to state funding for the city in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s budget proposal. Notably, the mayor’s plan includes no new money for the ailing subway system, a source of constant bickering between the mayor and Mr. Cuomo. The governor has sought more than $400 million in additional city spending for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Mr. de Blasio has countered that about the same amount should come from the state, accusing Albany of diverting funds from the transportation authority over the years.

"Karen Reyes spends her days teaching a group of deaf toddlers at Lucy Read Pre-Kindergarten School in Austin, Tex., how to understand a world they cannot hear. For the first time in her four-year teaching career, Ms. Reyes, 29, is at a loss. One of nearly 9,000 educators protected under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, Ms. Reyes has struggled to explain to her students, through sign language and pictures, the uncertainty of her future. When President Trump rescinded the  program in September, he gave Congress until early March to find a replacement before deportations are set to begin for the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children who gave their names to the government and were granted work permits. Ms. Reyes’s teaching days may be numbered — to 119 to be exact. “I don’t know what I’m going to tell them,” Ms. Reyes said through tears. “They understand when I go on an airplane. Maybe they’ll just think I’m on a never-ending flight.” Educators played a crucial role in helping young unauthorized immigrants realize DACA’s potential. The National Education Association, for instance, held clinics at which it encouraged eligible families to apply for the program, and worked with school districts to declare themselves “safe zones” for undocumented students and their families. Much to the chagrin of educators and advocates, the program, created in 2012 by President Barack Obama, has become a bargaining chip for the White House. Mr. Trump has conditioned its codification in law on Democratic acceptance of tough  demands, including an end to decades of family-based migration policies, a wall on the Mexican border and a crackdown on other immigrants in the country illegally.

"Three big banks were punished for market manipulation this week — and tucked into the punishment was a single sentence that could pay big dividends for the banking industry. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, banks that violate financial rules are disqualified from access to a streamlined process for certain types of business they conduct, unless they receive a waiver from federal regulators. That provision, known as the bad actor rule, was created to make legal settlements with regulators riskier and more financially painful for banks — an incentive for them to avoid the conduct that precipitates such settlements. On Monday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission reached settlements with Deutsche Bank, HSBC and UBS Group for a type of market manipulation called spoofing. The banks collectively paid just under $47 million to settle the civil charges without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. But while the commission and Justice Department trumpeted their crackdown on market manipulation, the settlements included language that gave all three banks an automatic waiver from the bad actor rule — drawing sharp criticism from one Securities and Exchange commissioner, a Democrat. “I am extremely disappointed by the C.F.T.C.’s actions in this case,” the commissioner, Kara Stein, said on Thursday. “They did not consult with the S.E.C. before injecting themselves into securities markets in which they have little or no expertise. The implications of the C.F.T.C.’s actions are deeply troubling and may put U.S. investors at risk.” "

"LONDON — A man accused of driving a van into Muslim worshipers outside a London mosque, killing one person and injuring nine others, was found guilty of murder on Thursday, after a trial that raised questions about the radicalizing influence of far-right groups in Britain. The man, Darren Osborne, 48, had denied responsibility for the June 2017 assault near the Finsbury Park Mosque, in north London, though he admitted that he had hoped to kill Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, as well as the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, at a different location. After an eight-day trial at the Woolwich Crown Court, jurors took an hour to declare him guilty both of murder and attempted murder. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. The court heard evidence suggesting that Mr. Osborne had been radicalized relatively quickly. According to Mr. Osborne’s partner, Sarah Andrews, his Islamophobic views developed in the weeks before the attack, as he became convinced that not enough was being done to combat Islamic extremism. Ms. Andrews said Mr. Osborne had become “obsessed” with Muslims, particularly after watching “Three Girls,” a BBC dramatization of an abuse scandal in Rochdale, England, in which mostly young, white girls were groomed by men who were mostly of Pakistani heritage. She said Mr. Osborne then dived into the right-wing media sphere and “seemed brainwashed” by that world. Devices seized by the police showed internet searches for a variety of such sites, including that of the English Defence League, a far-right anti-Muslim group. "

hey could have been any two billionaire schmucks taking an evening stroll through Manhattan. Robert Kraft and Arthur Blank, the owners of the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, respectively, had met up at the Plaza Hotel, where Kraft keeps an apartment. It was a warm night in August, and they decided to forgo the usual limo and head to dinner on foot. Passers-by who recognized them on the street expressed mild surprise that Kraft and Blank, the rival owners from last February’s Super Bowl, would be seen together. Kraft and Blank shared a few laughs over this. They are in fact close friends of similar age (Blank is 75, Kraft 76), background (observant Jews from the Northeast, Blank from Queens and Kraft from Brookline, Mass.), means (multiple billions) and tastes (bespoke suits, younger women). But few bonds run deeper than shared association in this most exclusive club of American fat cats, the 32 magnates who own N.F.L. franchises. Blank needed to unburden himself of a minor beef with Kraft. It involved the aforementioned Super Bowl LI. After the Falcons blew a late 28-3 lead over the Patriots and lost in overtime, and “28-3” entered the lexicon of football taunts, Kraft ordered exactly 283 diamonds embedded into each of the 10-karat white gold Super Bowl rings he commissioned for the Patriots. Blank, who bought the Falcons in 2002, mostly took the loss and the attendant trolling in stride. But the ring stunt bothered him. He found it unnecessary and tacky. “I said to Robert, ‘You didn’t have to do the 28-3 in the ring,’” he told me recently. “It kind of pissed me off.” But Blank and Kraft had more important matters to discuss. They had come to New York in their capacities as members of the N.F.L.’s compensation committee, the six owners charged with determining the salaries of the league’s top executives. They would be meeting for dinner in a private room at the Midtown restaurant Patroon to iron out the details of a new five-year contract extension for the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell. By the terms of the agreement that had been in the works for several months, Goodell stood to make as much as $200 million by 2024 if the league hit its financial targets. But some other owners had begun grumbling about the deal, at first in private and then very much in public. After all, Goodell would earn this spectacular paycheck despite the fact that, of late, he always seemed to be presiding over some self-inflicted fiasco, and despite the creeping notion that the once-mighty N.F.L. had been operating in a baseline state of turmoil in recent years, if not outright decline. There had been a two-year drop in television ratings, which the league has blamed on factors like the attention-devouring 2016 presidential campaign and a proliferation of “cord-cutting” viewers disrupting the broadcast model (TV accounts for 60 percent of the N.F.L.’s total revenue). But the dip could just as easily have reflected more existential threats to the league. There was the drumbeat of ominous new research about concussions and, with it, a drop in youth participation in football; regular testimonies from former stars about the sad state of their health; and posthumous diagnoses of degenerative brain disease (chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E.).
