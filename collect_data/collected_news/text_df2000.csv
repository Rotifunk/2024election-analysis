"To the Editor: Re “Trump Sours on Sessions, Blaming Him for White House Troubles” (news article, June 6) and “Sessions Offered to Resign” (news article, June 7): President Trump’s rage at Attorney General Jeff Sessions is just additional proof that he really doesn’t understand how government functions. He seems to regard his cabinet as “fixers,” carrying out his wishes, legal or not. When people in government are constrained by the Constitution, Mr. Trump takes it as a betrayal of his personal authority. This may fly in a family-owned business, but it cannot be a governing model for the United States. The daily outrages give everyone a chance to mock and be shocked, but this cannot continue. Some members of Congress will have to do their constitutional duty and begin proceedings to have Mr. Trump declared incompetent, with a goal of removing him from office. We cannot have a government that is in a constant state of nervous breakdown. HOWARD SCHMITT, CRAFTON, PA. To the Editor: Re “Intelligence Contractor Is Charged in the First Criminal Leak Case of the Trump Era” (news article, June 6): Anyone interested in knowing what impact the Russian efforts had on the presidential election owes Reality Leigh Winner gratitude. The report on Russian activities to tilt the election toward Donald Trump should have never been classified and kept from the public. Just how far beyond hacking the Hillary Clinton campaign’s emails and releasing them did the sabotage effort go? The summary that Ms. Winner released points to direct attempts to meddle with voting. If our government won’t tell us what it knows, it will require courageous people like Ms. Winner to get the information out. I hope the media will follow up and pursue the new leads, and call for her protection as a whistle-blower, not a criminal. BILL HAVERT, SEQUIM, WASH. To the Editor: “The Problem With Jared Kushner” (editorial, June 3), concerning Mr. Kushner’s mysterious machinations with the Russians to set up a back channel that American intelligence agencies could not monitor, does not draw the obvious conclusion. You call Mr. Kushner Donald Trump’s “closest and perhaps most influential confidant and executive.” It is inconceivable to me that Mr. Kushner was freelancing when he approached the Russians. Mr. Trump’s confidants know better than to take an initiative that he has not cleared, or they don’t stay confidants. Far more likely, Mr. Kushner was acting as his father-in-law’s agent in exploring this secret back channel, and that is clearly the direction any investigation must take. Not just “what did Donald Trump know and when did he know it?” but “did he instigate it, and why?” RON BONN, SAN DIEGO "
"Last week, Lee Camp, an acerbic left-wing comic, dedicated six minutes of his topical TV show, “Redacted Tonight,” to the discredited conspiracy theory that it wasn’t Russian hackers who leaked emails during the presidential election but Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member killed in a botched robbery. Mr. Camp’s tepid take — he doesn’t know the truth, but he’s skeptical — was less revealing than his introduction. “Every day I get an email from at least one person or another who says: Why don’t you talk about Seth Rich?” he said, shouting this demand. “And that spirals into: Lee Camp has been told not to talk about Seth Rich. And that will soon become: Lee Camp has accepted $1 million to not talk about Seth Rich. And then a week from now, The Washington Post will run with: Russia infiltrates comedian, forces him not to talk about secret Russian agent Seth Rich. Russia!” If Mr. Camp, who is in his mid-30s, sounds a bit defensive, that may be because it’s a challenging time to be a righteous American host of a political comedy show sponsored by the Russian government. “Redacted Tonight” airs weekly on RT America, the English-language channel financed by Russia that American intelligence agencies have described as the “Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet.” The program belongs to the television genre pioneered by “The Daily Show”: A comedic take on the news of the day from an exasperated host and correspondents who mix commentary with jokes. Mr. Camp — who looks like a Broadway musical costume designer’s idea of a counterculture comedian, with “Jesus Christ Superstar” hair and T-shirts bearing images of Bill Hicks or “Catch-22” — has more radical politics than his television peers. Occupy Wall Street and the Bernie Sanders campaign are lodestars. But Mr. Camp covers many of the same topics (net neutrality, global warming) that John Oliver and Samantha Bee do, except that is, when it comes to Russia. As hacking and Russia’s relationship to the Trump campaign increasingly dominate headlines, Mr. Camp’s refusal to dig into the story is conspicuous. He avoids the subject on air, and while he does criticize President Trump, his considerable comic bile rarely focuses on him. Mr. Camp, in fact, plays down Mr. Trump as a distraction or as no worse than other elites. The day after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, whose agency is investigating links between Russia and the president’s associates, Mr. Camp alluded to it briefly, and dutifully, only to make fun of the news media for obsessing about the story. "
"CINCINNATI — President Trump, delivering a forceful “America first” message as he promoted his infrastructure plan, used a rally here on Wednesday to muster support from his base ahead of a nail-biting day in Congress. Mr. Trump, bracing for testimony on Thursday by his ousted F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, traveled to the red outskirts of this blue city to pitch his 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure outline as part of a week’s worth of events emphasizing progress on the proposal, though it has yet to be fully fleshed out. The president delivered the speech shortly before the Senate Intelligence Committee released remarks that Mr. Comey plans to make to the panel on Thursday. In the written remarks, Mr. Comey says Mr. Trump repeatedly pressed him to announce that the president was not personally under investigation in the Justice Department’s inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Like so many of his speeches, Mr. Trump’s pitch on Wednesday at Rivertowne Marina was a wandering assortment of self-defenses, attacks and non sequiturs that bumped into one another like untethered barges. He began by attacking Democrats over his health care bill, calling them “obstructionists,” then congratulated himself for winning Ohio “not by a little, by a lot.” He trumpeted a major insurer’s pullout from health insurance exchanges here as proof of the Affordable Care Act’s “death spiral,” and predicted that deals he had made on his overseas trip last month would create “millions of jobs.” The president saved his harshest criticism for the Paris climate accord, vowing, to polite applause, that “we will never have outside forces telling us what to do and how to do it.” "
"WASHINGTON — The White House on Wednesday announced a new slate of 11 judicial nominees, making good on a promise last month to name monthly waves of candidates to the federal bench in a methodical effort to fill more than 120 openings. The administration’s attention to judicial vacancies stands in contrast to its less vigorous efforts to fill empty positions in the executive branch, where many senior positions remain vacant. The new nominees, like the 10 announced last month, include prominent conservative judges and scholars. President Trump’s appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court created one of the vacancies the White House now seeks to fill. Justice Gorsuch had served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in Denver. The administration hopes to replace him with Allison H. Eid, a member of the Colorado Supreme Court. Justice Eid, like some of Mr. Trump’s earlier nominees, was on lists of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees issued during the presidential campaign. The lists were compiled with the help of two conservative groups, the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. Justice Eid had served as the Colorado solicitor general and as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas. The administration may believe that shifting her from a state supreme court to a federal appeals court could make her a more attractive candidate for eventual elevation to the Supreme Court, as the new job will require Senate confirmation and give rise to a body of federal appeals court opinions.

"WASHINGTON — Two top intelligence officials refused to answer senators’ questions on Wednesday about whether President Trump had asked them to intervene in the F.B.I. investigation into Russian election interference, saying only that they had never felt “pressured” by the White House to do anything improper. The two officials — Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency — testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on the eve of a highly anticipated appearance before the panel by James B. Comey, who was fired as F.B.I. director by Mr. Trump last month. Mr. Comey, in prepared remarks released by the committee after the two officials testified, said Mr. Trump had asked him to drop an investigation into the president’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The reticence by Mr. Coats and Admiral Rogers drew sharp criticism from many senators, including Republicans, who said during the sometimes testy hearing that they had no justification not to answer questions. “At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer,” said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the committee’s chairman. “The requirements of our oversight duties and your agencies demand it.” Amid mounting evidence that Mr. Trump sought to interfere in the Russia investigation, senators often strayed far from the planned subject of the hearing: legislation to extend the FISA Amendments Act, which is the basis for the N.S.A.’s warrantless surveillance program and is set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats seized the opportunity to set the stage for Mr. Comey’s testimony on Thursday. In his prepared remarks, Mr. Comey said that, in addition to asking him to drop the Flynn investigation, Mr. Trump had asked him for an expression of personal loyalty, as The New York Times reported last month. Mr. Comey also said that Mr. Trump had repeatedly pressed him to announce that the president was not personally under investigation in the Russia case. "
"WASHINGTON — This summer was supposed to be a heady time for Republicans, who would be repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code, and reining in the reach of government. But now the party, rife with divisions, faces a familiar fight of its own making: raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit. Once a distasteful but manageable task for Congress, the debt ceiling has become a battle Washington seems unable to escape. By law, Congress must periodically raise the cap on the amount of money that the government can borrow on international lending markets. Republicans transformed the once-routine task of lifting the debt ceiling into high-stakes games of chicken during the Obama presidency — edging the economy toward so-called fiscal cliffs to extract policy concessions such as budget cuts and spending caps. With Republicans in control of both houses of Congress and the Oval Office, some thought that the debt ceiling would be an easy lift. Instead, it has become an obstacle threatening to further stall an agenda that has already fallen well behind schedule. The Treasury Department wants the debt ceiling raised before Congress leaves for its August recess, a demand that could consume many of the 13 legislative days on the calendar next month. "
"OTTAWA — The timing was coincidental, but the meeting had a new urgency. One day after President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord — saying he was elected to serve Pittsburgh, not Paris — the transport minister in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet visited with the mayor of Pittsburgh to discuss climate change. The meeting was part of a broad strategy by the Canadian federal government to work directly with American states and cities on global warming, and to become a leader on the issue. Though the effort began several months ago, Mr. Trump’s rejection last week of the Paris agreement has energized it. “I think it’s disappointing that the United States’ administration has not stepped up,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister, referring to Mr. Trump’s decision on the climate pact. “But the United States is bigger than the administration.” Mr. Trudeau has made battling climate change a top priority since his election in 2015, and Canadian provinces and American states have been dealing directly with one another on a variety of initiatives. Quebec and California have linked their cap-and-trade programs — an effort that Ontario, the most populous province, is set to join. Ontario and Manitoba participate in a climate coordination group primarily made up of Midwestern states. The government is also working on building alliances with Florida, Indiana, Texas, Michigan, New York and other states. Immediately after Mr. Trump’s announcement about the Paris accord, Ms. McKenna was on the phone with Jerry Brown, California’s governor, and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington. Both back the agreement, and Canada hopes to coordinate its climate efforts with their states, she said. "
"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans are closing in on a bill to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, diverging from the House on pre-existing medical conditions and maintaining federal subsidies that proponents see as essential to stabilizing insurance markets around the country. The changes appear largely designed to appeal to Republican senators who hail from states where the Affordable Care Act is popular and who were critical of the House bill, which would eliminate insurance for millions of Americans covered under the current law, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But the revisions may well alienate the Senate’s most conservative members, who are eager to rein in the growth of Medicaid and are unlikely to support a bill that does not roll back large components of the current law. Even with more moderate Republicans on board, party leaders would have a very narrow margin for passage on the Senate floor. “I think it’s fair to say that the House bill was something necessary to move it to the Senate, but I don’t think that anyone expected that the House bill would define what the Senate did,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who called the chances for approval in the Senate “better than 50-50.” Republicans appeared to be on a swift march to repeal the Affordable Care Act when the new Congress convened this year, even as Democrats were determined to preserve the law. The deterioration of health insurance markets in some states has added to the pressure on lawmakers to take at least some action in the next few months. Senate Republicans, meeting daily behind closed doors, are coalescing around a proposal that would provide money for “cost-sharing reduction” payments, which insurance companies receive under the Affordable Care Act so they can reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income consumers.

"The schedule has been cleared and the popcorn readied at Evergreen Partners, a strategic communications firm in central New Jersey, where the rule for employees on Thursday morning is simple: No client talk while James B. Comey is speaking. “We canceled meetings when we saw what time it was on,” said the firm’s president, Karen J. Kessler, who is planning a cheese-and-crackers spread by her office’s 60-inch screen. “It’s must-see TV.” Americans do not agree on much these days. But millions are expected to pause on Thursday to take in a spectacle already being compared to other political-cultural touchstones, like the Army-McCarthy hearings and Anita Hill’s testimony about Clarence Thomas. This time, Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, will dish to the Senate Intelligence Committee about President Trump, the man who fired him. By the time details from Mr. Comey’s prepared remarks surfaced on Wednesday — revealing an anxious president pressing his F.B.I. director about a continuing investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russia — the hearing had leapt from Beltway curiosity to required viewing, a cliffhanger episode of the nation’s real-life reality show. C-Span, this is not. (Although C-Span will be covering it.) Every national broadcast network — along with an alphabet soup of cable stations from CNBC to HLN — plans to carry the 10 a.m. hearing live. Bars in Houston, San Francisco and Washington are opening early. Schoolteachers are remaking lesson plans to discuss the testimony instead. Adding to the anticipation: Mr. Trump is expected to be among the viewers, and there is speculation that he may respond to Mr. Comey on Twitter in real-time — “Mystery Science Theater 3000” in the West Wing.

"LONDON — Britain votes on Thursday in a general election campaign that has been early, nasty and suspended twice by terrorist attacks. The two main candidates, Prime Minister Theresa May of the Conservative Party and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, are dragging themselves to the finish of a snap election, three years early, that was supposed to be about Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, but has ended up being about social fairness and security. Mrs. May, 60, succeeded to the post when David Cameron lost the Brexit referendum last June and quit only a year after winning a surprise Conservative majority in Parliament. Although she promised not to call an early election, she did so anyway, in an effort to increase her party’s narrow majority when Labour seemed weak and thus secure her personal mandate for the next five years. It was only the first of several U-turns for a politician who was largely unknown to Britons but had a reputation of being sensible, hard-working, pragmatic and reliable — “strong and stable” was her mantra. But the reversal was soon turned on her after a number of campaign gaffes, with opposition parties calling her “weak and wobbly.” On the campaign trail, and in front of television viewers, Mrs. May appeared awkward and uncomfortable, better at repeating slogans than discussing substance, while refusing to debate other party leaders face to face. And it was Mr. Corbyn, 68, who has had an excellent campaign, especially given low expectations. A man of the farther left, he has pushed the party and its platform that way, promising increased social benefits and more spending on everything from the health service to the police. "
"DOHA, Qatar — If the Islamic State did carry out the twin terrorist attacks on Wednesday in Iran, as the militant group claims, it struck at an opportune time to further the cause of chaos. Iran rushed to blame Saudi Arabia, its chief rival in a contest for power playing out in proxy wars in at least two other countries in the region, Syria and Yemen. Saudi Arabia, however, seemed too preoccupied to respond. Its state-run news media was dominated by criticism of its neighbor and ostensible ally, Qatar, after the Saudis and other Arab allies cut off ties to Qatar as part of a different struggle for power within the Persian Gulf. The attacks in Tehran threatened to escalate the broader regional conflict between the two heavyweight powers, Iran and Saudi Arabia, at a time when the Western-allied gulf bloc is divided against itself. And Saudi Arabia, under the two-year-old reign of King Salman and his powerful son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is demonstrating an unexpected willingness to plunge into risky multifront battles. Turkey has long been a partner to the gulf monarchs in their proxy war against Iran in Syria. But in Ankara, the Turkish capital, on Wednesday, Parliament voted to authorize sending troops to Turkey’s base in Qatar — presumably to help defend against the Saudis. What’s more, the Saudis may actually risk driving Qatar — the world’s largest producer of natural gas, and home to the largest American air base in the region — even closer to Iran. "
"President Trump’s impetuousness and his simplistic view of American interests have again put national security at risk. He has taken sides with Saudi Arabia and four other Sunni states in their attempt to isolate and bully Qatar, the tiny gulf nation that is arguably America’s most important military outpost in the region. Rather than position the United States to ease tensions in the Middle East, Mr. Trump has, essentially, picked one side in a small rivalry within a big rivalry. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen chose to cut ties to Qatar for a number of reasons, some of them petty, but principally because Qatar has a relatively close relationship with the Sunni states’ greatest rival, Shiite Iran. Iran is a bad actor in many ways, but it also shares some interests with the United States, including in the fight against the Islamic State. On Wednesday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for two attacks that killed 12 people in Tehran at the Iranian Parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Mr. Trump has made clear he seeks no opening to Iran and has no interest in building on the Obama administration’s success in reaching a nuclear deal with it. But even if his goal is to isolate Iran, allying with Saudi Arabia to punish Qatar is a self-defeating way to go about it: Qatar is home to the forward headquarters of the United States Central Command and is a major intelligence hub. It hosts Al Udeid Air Base, with more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces. There is no sign that Mr. Trump has actually thought any of this through. Even as other American officials were saying they would try to calm the Saudis because Qatar was too important to the United States, the president leapt to Twitter to claim credit for persuading Saudi Arabia to act against Qatar. “During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,” he wrote, adding, “Leaders pointed to Qatar — look!” In two other tweets he reinforced this message, saying: “So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding … extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!” "
"It is hard to calculate the grievousness of the wounds that James Comey’s testimony will inflict on Donald Trump. On Wednesday, representatives of Comey, the consummate showman whose own flair for the dramatic rivals Trump’s, requested the release of his incredibly detailed opening statement in advance of his Thursday Senate testimony. If you believe the Comey statement, you must take away from it that Trump is a liar, a bully and a criminal. You must take away from it that Trump has a consuming need to be surrounded not only by loyalists but also by lackeys. You must take away that Trump is brand obsessed — his own brand — and that anything that besmirches that brand must be blunted. You must take away that Trump knows nothing of decorum and propriety and boundaries. You must take away that this is the most comprehensive and compelling case thus far that Trump did indeed engage in obstruction of justice. Trump’s comments as alleged in the Comey statement make Trump sound more like a mob boss than the president of a democracy. Comey recounts that at a Jan. 27 dinner alone with Trump in the Green Room of the White House, Trump demanded, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” This was after Trump seemed to implicitly threaten Comey’s job: “The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away.” Trump was also insistent that Comey publicly state that Trump — not necessarily members of his campaign — was not at that time under investigation, because “the cloud” the suspicion created was impeding his progress as president. As Comey recalls, Trump said he would do as Comey advised and have the White House counsel contact the leadership of the Department of Justice to make the request for a public statement, but then Trump added: “‘Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.’ I did not reply or ask him what he meant by ‘that thing.’” "
"WASHINGTON — The morning, at least, seemed to go reasonably well for President Trump. He announced a new F.B.I. director, and two intelligence chiefs told Congress the president had never pressured them to interfere in the investigation into Russian election meddling. And then James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was fired by Mr. Trump last month while leading an investigation into the president’s associates, dropped the hammer. By authorizing the immediate release of the opening statement he plans to give in his much anticipated appearance before a congressional committee on Thursday, he instantly changed the conversation back to his assertion that the president tried to shut down part of the F.B.I. investigation. Mr. Trump may be relatively new to Washington, but Mr. Comey is not. A savvy veteran of the capital who has worked in high positions in multiple administrations, he has usually emerged on top in any internal power struggle. And in the month since his dismissal, Mr. Comey has shown why presidents are normally loath to fire F.B.I. directors. The release of Mr. Comey’s statement and the prospect of his televised testimony left the White House on the defensive on Wednesday. The president’s nomination of Christopher A. Wray to lead the F.B.I. and his trip to Ohio to discuss infrastructure were overshadowed, and administration aides were left grumbling about the coming spectacle of a longtime lawman accusing the commander in chief of actions that some lawyers call obstruction of justice. “At every turn since his firing, Comey has played his hand perfectly, controlling the narrative and preserving his well-earned reputation for integrity and professionalism, while Trump has only made his situation worse every time he opened his mouth or logged onto Twitter,” said Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. In effect, Mr. Comey’s account of his interactions with Mr. Trump stepped on testimony by Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the National Security Agency director, that they did not feel pressured by the president to intervene in the investigation into whether his associates collaborated with Russia during or after last year’s election (although neither would deny that Mr. Trump had asked). "
"WASHINGTON — Rarely has the Trump administration spoken of Iran other than to condemn it as the world’s chief sponsor of terrorism and an aspiring nuclear weapons state. So when the White House woke on Wednesday to images of a possible Islamic State attack on Tehran, it prompted a sharp quandary: How does President Trump condemn the violence without seeming to embrace the victims? Several administration officials said it took most of the day for the White House to work out the terse, curt wording of a statement that sought to show sympathy for the Iranian public even as it pointedly suggested that the behavior of Tehran’s clerical leaders made its people a target. “We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,” Mr. Trump wrote. “We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.” The statement capped a day during which Mr. Trump thrust himself into the messy politics of Persian Gulf states, trying to also play peacemaker in a bitter dispute between Qatar and other Sunni Muslim neighbors that threatens to splinter a Middle Eastern alliance fighting the Islamic State. For the administration, Wednesday served as a reminder that the world does not operate in the black-and-white terms that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail and on Twitter, one in which the Sunni-dominated Islamic State and Shiite Iran are part of a continuum of “radical Islamic extremism.” “This is an illustration of the competing priorities and contradictions facing this administration, which will prove hard to reconcile,” said Robert Malley, the top Middle East policy official for the Obama administration. “You can’t be all-out against Iran, all-out against ISIS and terrorism, and maintain ‘America First’ — another way of saying keeping a light footprint in the region.” "
"WASHINGTON — Appalling. Disturbing. Partisan. Completely puzzling. Those were among the harsh words top Democrats used to toss around about the actions of James B. Comey during his tenure as director of the F.B.I. Their anger and resentment over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email matter and other issues were so pronounced that President Trump expected applause from them when he fired Mr. Comey. That turned out not to be the case. Now Democrats are embracing Mr. Comey, a man many of them blame for Mr. Trump’s election, as a star witness in the investigation into Russian election meddling and potentially problematic behavior by the president. All is not forgiven. But to the Democrats who will do the questioning at Thursday’s Senate Intelligence Committee session, the issue of how Mr. Comey performed in his job is very distinct from the issue of how he was forced out of it. “I have long disagreed with Comey about surveillance, about encryption, about secret legal interpretations,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat and Intelligence Committee veteran. “But I continue to believe the timing of the decision to fire James Comey just stinks.” Democrats do not intend to dwell on the awkward past at Thursday’s hearing, which is conjuring a level of anticipation associated only with that most riveting of Washington set pieces: a televised congressional hearing reaching into the Oval Office. Instead, they say they simply want to determine whether Mr. Trump took steps to thwart Mr. Comey in overseeing an investigation into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia related to the election. “I just want to know whether this administration or this president ever tried to interfere with him doing his job,” said Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat and member of the Intelligence Committee. “I didn’t always agree with his judgment, but that is different from trying to interfere with his day-to-day operations at the F.B.I.” "
"The terrorist attacks in Tehran on Wednesday — in bright daylight and at two very different yet entirely related locations — up the ante in what has become a battle royale for influence in the Middle East, and in the fight against the terrorists wreaking havoc in the region and in the West. While Iran may seem to Americans a million miles away, what happens in Tehran most definitely does not stay there. On his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, President Trump joined many of his Arab counterparts in denouncing Iran as the foremost sponsor of terrorism, perhaps unaware of the irony of doing so while being feted in the country of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State’s ideological forefathers. Qatar, whose emir met with Mr. Trump in Riyadh and who was perhaps alarmed by the carte blanche being given to Saudi Arabia, subsequently reached out to Iran in an attempt to calm tensions in a combustible region. He was rewarded with the cutting off both political and economic relations by a Saudi-led coalition: Arab unity be damned. Two days later, terrorists struck in Tehran. The timing is significant, but so are the locations: The sites of the Islamic State’s attacks demonstrate what Iran’s enemies hope to destroy and how these goals are tied to the wider instability facing the Middle East. One of the sites of the jihadists’ terror was the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, the founder of both the Islamic revolution and the republic it gave birth to, a figure revered by both conservatives and reformists in Iran’s Islamic political structure. Khomeini’s political ideology, known in Farsi as “velayat-e-faqih,” or guardianship of a supreme jurist, is a uniquely Shiite concept. By its very nature, it conflicts with Sunni beliefs and especially Wahhabism, the ideology that all the terror groups inflicting misery on Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria — as well as London, Paris and Brussels — adhere to. The political concept is that in the absence of the Messiah, a qualified jurist cleric — an ayatollah for Shiites — must be the guardian over the Muslim faithful, thus the position of Supreme Leader in Iran; the Shiite interpretation is anathema to fundamentalist Sunnis’ worldview. To attempt to blow up the resting place of the father of the velayat — a conspicuously huge structure on the outskirts of Tehran — and to kill Shiites from different countries who had come to pay their respects to Khomeini is hugely symbolic for the Islamic State’s supporters. But it pleases Wahhabists everywhere. Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, recently declared that there is no point in talking to Iran because the country adheres to an “extremist ideology,” seemingly a reference to velayat. "
"In his prepared testimony before Congress, James Comey says he spoke alone with President Barack Obama on just two occasions — once simply for Obama to say a brief goodbye. In contrast, he adds, “I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months.” These were profoundly uncomfortable and in some cases “very concerning” and highly irregular, recounts Comey, who was fired as F.B.I. director last month. After one conversation, he says, “I took the opportunity to implore the attorney general to prevent any future direct communication between the president and me. Trump sought a pledge of personal loyalty so as to turn the head of the F.B.I. into a political lackey. “I need loyalty,” Comey quotes Trump as telling him. “I expect loyalty.” “I didn’t move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed,” Comey adds. “We simply looked at each other in silence.” Trump’s behavior is reminiscent of what tin-pot despots do. I know, for I’ve covered the overthrow of more than I can count. So let’s not get mired in legal technicalities. Whether or not it was illegal for Trump to urge Comey to back off his investigation into Russia ties to Mike Flynn, who was fired as national security adviser, it was utterly inappropriate. What comes through is a persistent effort by Trump to interfere with the legal system. There’s a consistent pattern: Trump’s contempt for the system of laws that, incredibly, he now presides over. "
"WASHINGTON — From his first days in office, President Trump repeatedly put pressure on his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. He demanded loyalty. He asked that an investigation into an adviser be dropped. And he implored Mr. Comey to publicly clear his name. As Mr. Comey described Wednesday in written testimony prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s entreaties continued for months, in unexpected phone calls and awkward meetings. As Mr. Comey’s discomfort grew, so did the president’s persistence and his frustration with Mr. Comey’s unwillingness to help. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last month, and his account offered an extraordinary back story, one that unfolded with cinematic detail, terse dialogue and tense moments across a White House dinner table. Mr. Comey is scheduled to deliver the testimony on Thursday at a Senate hearing that is shaping up to be the most dramatic moment so far in the tangle of congressional and F.B.I. investigations into Mr. Trump’s associates and possible collusion with Russian operatives during the 2016 election. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied any such collaboration, and Mr. Comey confirmed that he told the president three times that he was not personally under investigation. Mr. Trump had encouraged Mr. Comey to say so publicly, but Mr. Comey refused — in part because he did not want to have to recant if that changed. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, suspended the deployment of the American missile defense system known as Thaad — a move that our Shanghai bureau chief called “a victory for Beijing.” Mr. Moon’s decision, citing an environmental assessment, could strain relations with the White House, and raise concerns about efforts by the United States to present a tough, unified stance against North Korea. North Korea launched several cruise missiles from its east coast toward the ocean on Thursday. Check back for updates. _____ "
"LONDON — Half a century ago, wet behind the ears, I sailed from England to Australia. My parents wept. They weren’t sure they’d see me again. A journey of three or four weeks by sea was considered perilous in those days. And even if I did make it to Sydney safely, there was no knowing when, if ever, I’d return. When I did arrive — in one piece, as it happened — I had to book an international telephone call from the city’s central post office to tell my parents I was O.K. It was two hours before a line became free. You could say that this was the proper way to respect distance. If you’re going halfway around the world, it should seem like it. Since that time, the world has shrunk. We don’t weep in the arms of our friends before we travel. We can reach anywhere by air in less than a day and report on the progress of the journey every half-hour by cellphone. Or at least, that was the way it was the day before yesterday. Now inconvenience and apprehension are back. It’s all more modern and streamlined apprehension, but disquiet is disquiet, and there are humiliations thrown in today, as well. We wait like animals in pens. We remove items of clothing before we pass through security. We are frisked. We are questioned. We don’t complain. We understand the necessity. Terrorism has made the most perfunctory journey a jeopardy. Board the plane itself and you can’t be sure you won’t be manhandled off it. Passengers waiting to travel by British Airways last week didn’t even get that far. Crowded into departure terminals for days, they resembled the damned, massing to cross the River Styx. The company did what companies do — and blamed its computer system. "
"PARIS — Sitting courtside at the French Open on Wednesday, close enough to hear the ball bouncing off the damp red clay, you were also close enough to sense the hunger gap. Dominic Thiem, 23 and on the rise, was throwing himself into next-gear forehands on Suzanne Lenglen Court — sprinting and sliding for drop shots and exuding the relentless positive energy that wins Grand Slam titles. Novak Djokovic, 30 and on the wane, seemed muted in comparison. Yes, there were flashback moments: a reflex return winner that elicited a collective gasp of surprise; a wide-eyed, in-the-moment look at what remains of Djokovic’s entourage after he prevailed in an extended corner-to-corner-to-corner point in the first set. But clay-court tennis is a marathon, not a sprint, and by the end of this French Open quarterfinal, Djokovic was out of trump cards, out of belief and out of the tournament where he experienced what may turn out to be his crowning tennis moment. Was it really only a year ago? It felt longer on Wednesday in the Paris sunshine as Thiem accelerated to the finish of his 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-0 quarterfinal victory, with Djokovic looking surprisingly resigned to that outcome. “I obviously always expect a lot from myself, but it’s a fact that I’m not playing close to my best, and I know that,” Djokovic said, his self-analysis under duress more accurate than his two-handed backhand was.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday announced that he had selected Christopher A. Wray to be his F.B.I. director, turning to a former federal prosecutor who recently defended Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey in the so-called Bridgegate scandal to lead an agency under a harsh political spotlight. The president revealed his decision in an early-morning tweet without alerting members of Congress in advance. It came on the eve of a blockbuster congressional hearing scheduled for Thursday in which James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he ousted abruptly last month, was to testify about what he interpreted as improper attempts by Mr. Trump to pressure him. Hours after the Twitter post, the White House followed up with an official statement in which Mr. Trump called Mr. Wray “an impeccably qualified individual,” citing his role in major fraud investigations and antiterrorism efforts at the Justice Department after the 9/11 attacks. “I know that he will again serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity once the Senate confirms him to lead the F.B.I.,” Mr. Trump said in the statement. The selection may have been an attempt to inject credibility into an investigation of his campaign’s possible ties with Russia, one that has been rocked by accusations of presidential tampering. Mr. Wray is a safe, mainstream pick from a president who at one point was considering politicians for a job that has historically been kept outside of partisanship. A former assistant attorney general overseeing the Justice Department’s criminal division under President George W. Bush, Mr. Wray is likely to allay the fears of F.B.I. agents who worried that Mr. Trump would try to weaken or politicize the F.B.I. "
"• Four top national security officials testified on Capitol Hill on Wednesday amid a swirl of developments in the Trump administration. • The officials were pressed repeatedly about whether President Trump had asked any of them to try to curtail the F.B.I. investigation into whether his associates coordinated with the Russian effort to interfere in the election. They mostly sidestepped the questions, visibly frustrating senators. • The stated topic of the hearing was the law that authorizes the National Security Agency’s warrantless surveillance program, the FISA Amendments Act, which is set to expire at the end of 2017. Asked about surveillance, the officials revealed that it had led to the killing of an Islamic State leader last year. Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, declined to comment about a report that Mr. Trump pushed him to try to help end the federal investigation into the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Coats would not answer a question from Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee’s top Democrat, about a report in The Washington Post that the president had requested that he intervene and get James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to ease off on the investigation into Mr. Flynn. “I don’t believe it’s appropriate for me to address that in a public session,” Mr. Coats said. The panel was expected to testify in a closed-door session Wednesday afternoon. "
"WASHINGTON — James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., will be testifying in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Here is a quick breakdown of how you can follow along. What: Mr. Comey, who was fired by President Trump last month, is expected to discuss their interactions about the F.B.I.’s investigation into possible links between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russian effort to tamper in last year’s presidential election. When: The hearing starts on Thursday at 10 a.m. It will begin with prepared opening remarks and then transition into a question-and-answer period with members of the Senate panel. Mr. Comey’s testimony will take place in two parts — one open to the public in the morning and one closed-door session in the afternoon. Where: The Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. How to follow: The New York Times will be streaming the hearing on our website, offering live coverage and analysis from our reporters on Capitol Hill and around Washington.

"Gov. Sam Brownback’s leadership of Kansas came to be synonymous with a single, unyielding philosophy: Cut taxes, cut the size of government, and the state will thrive. But this week, Mr. Brownback’s deeply conservative state turned on him and his austere approach. Fed up with gaping budget shortfalls, inadequate education funding and insufficient revenue, the Republican-controlled Legislature capped months of turmoil by overriding the governor’s veto of a bill that would undo some of his tax cuts and raise $1.2 billion over two years. The move amounted to a shocking rejection of the tax-cutting experiment Mr. Brownback had held up as the centerpiece of his conservative governing. But economic growth and revenues lagged, and even his allies began to publicly criticize the tax cuts. The results were a warning of the risks for other Republican-controlled states that have tested similar approaches, and a dizzying descent for Mr. Brownback’s legacy and any future political aspirations. “Being governor was all about his tax plan,” Dinah Sykes, a state senator and fellow Republican, said of Mr. Brownback. “And he really believed it was the right step. But as many of us have seen, it was not. We had to take a vote to say no and say, ‘This is not the right direction.’ I don’t know how the governor doesn’t see that.” Ms. Sykes, who was among the moderate Republican lawmakers to vote to override Mr. Brownback’s veto, said she thought she had no choice but to push for a change. Her suburban Kansas City district had grown weary of the governor’s uncompromising fiscal approach over the last six years, she said, as had many other Kansans. "
"WASHINGTON — Lance Leggitt helped collect $400,000 in fees last year while working as a lobbyist to try to influence Medicare policy at the Department of Health and Human Services — an agency where he now serves as chief of staff. Under an executive order signed by President Trump in January, lobbyists were banned from that kind of government work. But Mr. Leggitt is among a half dozen officials across the federal government who have been granted special waivers to disregard ethics rules, according to a new set of documents released Wednesday. “Mr. Leggitt brings a unique blend of substantive health care expertise to HHS,” his waiver said. The disclosures offer additional evidence that lobbyists and industry executives who can now shape policies benefiting their former clients and companies have been allowed to work in the Trump administration, even with the president’s vow to “drain the swamp” of influence peddling. The documents were made public in response to a demand by the Office of Government Ethics for details on how the Trump administration is enforcing the ethics policies. One unexpected outcome was proof that the Obama administration, despite a much touted promise to make all of its ethics waivers public, stopped providing them to the Office of Government Ethics. As a result, three Obama-era waivers — two from the Justice Department and one from the State Department — that should already be public are being released for the first time. Karen Florini left a job at the Environmental Defense Fund to take a post as a special envoy for climate change at the State Department, and she was given special permission to interact with the environmental group, despite an ethics ban that would have otherwise prevented her from communicating with it.

"Last week, President Donald Trump tried to pit our two cities against each other when he announced, in pulling out of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” As the mayors of Pittsburgh and Paris, we’re here to say that we’re more united than ever. Though separated by an ocean and a language, we share a desire to do what is best for our citizens and our planet. That means putting aside parochial politics and embracing the global challenge of fighting climate change. In doing so, we can create a cleaner, healthier, more prosperous world for Parisians, Pittsburghers and everyone else on the planet. As the sun sets each evening on the Allegheny River, Pittsburgh’s Rachel Carson Bridge lights up with 27,000 multi-colored bulbs. This nightly display downtown in the City of Bridges is powered entirely by 16 wind turbines attached to the arches of the bridge. It’s just one example of how a city once famous for its steel mills has emerged as a trailblazer in environmental innovation. The experience of Pittsburgh in the three decades since the collapse of the steel industry reveals how a commitment to science, research and green technology can transform our cities. As late as the 1940s, the air hung heavy with pollution from steel mills. Streetlights were needed 24 hours a day to see through the smog. Today, 13,000 Pittsburghers are employed in the renewable energy industry. The city’s Phipps Conservatory is recognized as one of the world’s greenest buildings, generating all of its own energy and treating and reusing all water captured on site. Investments in smart infrastructure, bike sharing programs, new mass transit options and building efficiency means Pittsburgh is on track to meet our goal of slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2023. While the majority of electricity in the state of Pennsylvania is still generated from fossil fuels, Pittsburgh will be 100 percent powered by renewable energy by 2035. We Pittsburghers are proud of our industrial history, but we are preparing for a prosperous future. That means addressing our air quality, which remains among the worst in the nation. That means ensuring that the shift to sustainable infrastructure tackles inequality between communities. And that means taking climate change seriously. "
"To the Editor: I wanted to provide you with an unsophisticated synopsis of The New York Times and the media’s quest for the implosion of Donald Trump’s presidency from out here in the real world, in “deplorable” country. As you can imagine (or maybe you can’t quite), as a proud deplorable, I have many associates, colleagues and relatives who agree with me. Every time you and your brethren at other news organizations dream up a new scheme to get Mr. Trump, we out here in deplorable land increase our support for him. It’s quite humorous that when The Times, The Washington Post and the networks all bash Mr. Trump, our support increases. Regardless of what you dream up every day, we refuse to be sucked into your narrative. And even more humorously, there isn’t anything you can do about it! And I love it that you are having the exact opposite effect on those of us you are trying to persuade to think otherwise. I mean it is seriously an enjoyable part of my day knowing you are failing. And badly! I haven’t had this much fun watching the media stumble, bumble and fumble in years. I wonder what will happen on the day you wake up and realize how disconnected you’ve become?

"To the Editor: Re “At Amazon’s New Bookstore, No Coffee but All the Data You Can Drink,” by Francis X. Clines (Editorial Observer, May 28): The description of the new Amazon retail bookstore in Manhattan gives the feel of all the warmth of the website, with a smaller selection. I have run an independent, family-friendly, politically progressive community bookstore for the past 34 years. Our selection depends not on an algorithm at all; it relies on what we judge our readers will like or feel is important. Our store invites that cranky toddler, the person who needs a safe space to rant about the latest lies of the Trump administration, the cancer patient who needs to talk and that local teacher who knows our staff can find what she needs. I hope that we will continue to serve readers who understand that a monopoly in the book industry will not serve a country of independent thinkers. NANCY BRAUS, PUTNEY, VT. "
"Santander, the largest bank in Spain, has said that it will acquire its Spanish rival Banco Popular, after the European Central Bank determined that the smaller lender was “failing or likely to fail.” Santander will buy all of Banco Popular’s shares and debt for the symbolic price of 1 euro, or about $1.13, and raise €7 billion in capital to “reinforce the balance sheet of Banco Popular.” No taxpayer money will be used, Santander said. The rescue will test the system that the European Union created in the wake of the global financial crisis to limit the damage from bank collapses. The European Central Bank said it had contacted the Single Resolution Board, which was set up to handle the winding down of banks that fail. After an auction, the board selected Santander as the successful bidder. Uber has dismissed 20 employees over harassment, discrimination and inappropriate behavior, according to an employee who attended a staff meeting where the company disclosed the terminations. The firings were first reported by Bloomberg News. The terminations, which occurred in the past few months, were related to an internal investigation led by the law firm Perkins Coie. Bobbie Wilson, a partner at Perkins Coie, said the firm was focused on “specific” allegations raised from a confidential hotline that Uber had set up. "
"WASHINGTON — Christopher A. Wray was the government’s top criminal prosecutor in 2004 when the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, and the deputy attorney general, James B. Comey, threatened to quit the Bush administration over a controversial surveillance program. He offered to join their protest. Now, with President Trump’s selection of Mr. Wray on Wednesday to be the director of the F.B.I., all three men will be central figures in the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election that has rocked the Trump administration. Mr. Mueller is leading the investigation into Russian influence — and the inquiry led Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Comey. In choosing Mr. Wray, the president is calling on a veteran Washington lawyer who is more low key and deliberative than either Mr. Mueller or Mr. Comey but will remain independent, friends and former colleagues say. “He’s not flashy. He’s not showy. He’s understated,” said J. Michael Luttig, a former judge who hired Mr. Wray as a law clerk in 1992. Mr. Luttig, who said he counted Mr. Comey and Mr. Mueller as friends, said Mr. Wray would bring a more subtle management style to the F.B.I. Calling Mr. Wray a “man of impeccable credentials,” Mr. Trump revealed his choice in an early-morning tweet on the eve of a congressional hearing in which Mr. Comey was to testify about what he interpreted as improper attempts by Mr. Trump to pressure him.

"Hawaii on Tuesday became the first state to pass a law committing to the goals and limits of the Paris climate accord, defying President Trump, who announced last week that he would withdraw the United States from the historic agreement. The state’s governor, David Y. Ige, signed two bills at a ceremony at the state’s capitol rotunda in Honolulu. One of the bills was explicitly geared toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the landmark goals adopted by world leaders with the Paris Agreement in 2015. The other will establish a task force to help the state improve soil health and remove carbon from the atmosphere. He was joined by mayors from around the state, who signed an agreement to commit to the goals of the accord. “Many of the greatest challenges of our day hit us first, and that means that we also need to be first when it comes to creating solutions,” Mr. Ige, a Democrat in his first term as governor, said in remarks before the signing. “We are the testing grounds — as an island state, we are especially aware of the limits of our natural environment.” “Climate change is real, regardless of what others may say,” he added. Mike Gabbard, the chairman of the state senate’s agriculture and environment committee was more blunt. "
"Last week, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. But it will take more than one speech to pull out: Under the rules of the deal, which the White House says it will follow, the earliest any country can leave is Nov. 4, 2020. That means the United States will remain a party to the accord for nearly all of Mr. Trump’s current term, and it could still try to influence the climate talks during that span. So the next four years will be a busy time for climate policy. Mr. Trump’s aides plan to keep working to dismantle domestic climate programs like the Clean Power Plan. And the world’s nations will meet regularly to hash out details of the Paris agreement, even as the United States’ exit looms. Here is what comes next. Negotiators for 195 nations will meet in Bonn, Germany, to discuss how to carry out the Paris agreement. Every country has already submitted an initial pledge for curbing greenhouse gas emissions. But officials now have to write rules for monitoring and verifying those pledges. Technically, the United States is still the co-chair of a key committee on transparency measures. In the past, American officials have taken a keen interest in this topic, pushing for robust oversight of emissions. By contrast, countries like China have argued for looser scrutiny for developing nations. Mr. Trump has offered to “renegotiate” the Paris deal, because he says other countries are “laughing at us” while they renege on their pledges. While countries like France and Germany have ruled out a broad renegotiation of the agreement, the United States could nonetheless try to shape the rules from within. “The question is whether the Trump administration still shows up for those discussions,” said Andrew Light, a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under President Barack Obama. “If they really are pushing to ‘renegotiate’ the deal, as they say, I don’t see why they wouldn’t go.” "
"WASHINGTON — The House approved legislation on Thursday to erase a number of core financial regulations put in place by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, as Republicans moved a step closer to delivering on their promises to eliminate rules that they claim have strangled small businesses and stagnated the economy. The vote is a significant step for a measure that still faces long odds of becoming law because of the slim majority that Republicans hold in the Senate. Even Wall Street lobbyists and lawyers were pessimistic about the chances of the bill, the Financial Choice Act. “There is zero chance that the Choice Act survives” in its current form in the Senate, said Matthew Dyckman, a lawyer in the financial services practice at Goodwin. Yet the bill’s passage in the House, by 233 to 186, keeps alive the Republican Party’s dream of unwinding one of President Barack Obama’s signature accomplishments. The vote quickly drew the ire of Democrats who argued that Republicans were giving a handout to Wall Street while putting everyday investors at risk. The bill has maintained a low profile compared with Republican plans on health care and taxes, but rolling back Dodd-Frank represents a major part of the Republican agenda. The Trump administration hopes that by unshackling businesses from burdensome regulations, renegotiating trade deals and cutting tax rates, it can help the economy grow faster and well-paying jobs will become more plentiful.

"WASHINGTON — To be a Senate Republican in President Trump’s Washington is to moonlight as a sort of executive life coach, coaxing the commander in chief toward discipline and conservative policy in the face of 140-character headwinds. And perhaps no lawmaker is more committed to this difficult work than the chamber’s youngest member: Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a gangly, 40-year-old Iraq war veteran with two Harvard degrees, abundant ambition and, it often seems, a more coherent vision than the president for how to assemble policy scaffolding around loosely defined “Trumpism.” “It’s not a matter of the president changing,” Mr. Cotton said of recent White House stumbles, offering more hopeful spin in an interview than some fellow Republicans these days. “It’s a matter of the president being his best self.” For months now, as much as any high-profile lawmaker navigating the Trump era, Mr. Cotton has strained to guide Mr. Trump toward his best self. He has worked quietly with the White House to apply a conservative policy structure to the unorthodox brand of Republicanism that elevated Mr. Trump to power, urging fellow senators to be mindful of the anti-free-trade, anti-open-immigration energy that will color the lawmakers’ own elections. He has been a critical back-channel resource on personnel decisions for the administration, recommending Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster as national security adviser. "
"A
month after the 2016 election, the stock trader Andrew Left went out to the Madison Club in La Quinta, Calif., to lick his wounds and play golf. The way Left invests, he can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers. But in December, even dubious stocks were rising, lifted by the promise of incipient deregulation. Reading the news on his phone between holes, Left happened upon an interview with President-elect Donald Trump, the purveyor of all this optimism, in Time magazine. “I’m going to bring down drug prices,” Trump said. “I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.” Left hurried back to the clubhouse and gave his ticket to the valet. In the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an “activist” short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company’s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries — Tesla, Valeant, GoPro — and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate. For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line. By rights, then, Trump’s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts’ stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left’s claims, noting that “roughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.”) Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong. Left heard “rebates” and thought “kickbacks.” Express Scripts was, in Left’s mind, “the man behind the man”; it was “the mob.” If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street’s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills. "
"At least five assailants in the deadly Tehran attacks were recruited by the Islamic State from inside Iran, the government said Thursday, a strong indication they were Iranian citizens. The new detail about the assailants, who were killed during the attacks on Wednesday, came as the Iranian news media reported that the civilian casualty toll had risen to 17 dead and 52 wounded, and as the police presence in the Iranian capital increased noticeably. The assaults’ aftermath also was punctuated by new acrimony between Iranian leaders and the Trump administration, which expressed condolences on Wednesday coupled with an assertion that their country had fallen “victim to the evil they promote.” The assaults also coincided with Senate action advancing new sanctions on Iran. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described the American response in a Twitter message as “repugnant.” Five men and a woman armed with rifles and explosives carried out simultaneous assaults on Tehran’s Parliament building and the tomb of Iran’s revolutionary founder in broad daylight, surprising security forces and causing panic and mayhem that lasted for hours. The Islamic State, the Sunni extremist group, asserted responsibility. "
"Sifting through the wreckage of the 2016 election, Democratic pollsters, strategists and sympathetic academics have reached some unnerving conclusions. What the autopsy reveals is that Democratic losses among working class voters were not limited to whites; that crucial constituencies within the party see its leaders as alien; and that unity over economic populism may not be able to turn back the conservative tide. Equally disturbing, winning back former party loyalists who switched to Trump will be tough: these white voters’ views on immigration and race are in direct conflict with fundamental Democratic tenets. Some of these post-mortem conclusions are based on polling and focus groups conducted by the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA; others are drawn from a collection of 13 essays published by The American Prospect. A consistent theme is that the focus on white defections from the Democratic Party masks an even more threatening trend: declining turnout among key elements of the so-called Rising American Electorate — minority, young and single voters. Turnout among African-Americans, for example, fell by 7 points, from 66.6 percent in 2012 to 59.6 percent in 2016. Priorities USA, in surveys and focus groups, studied “drop off voters,” those who lean Democratic but failed to vote in either 2014 or 2016. By and large, these voters were members of the coalition that elected and re-elected Barack Obama: Priorities found that drop off voters were distinctly lukewarm toward Hillary Clinton: Priorities also studied Obama-to-Trump voters. Estimates of the number of such voters range from 6.7 to 9.2 million, far more than enough to provide Trump his Electoral College victory. The counties that switched from Obama to Trump were heavily concentrated in the Midwest and other Rust Belt states. "
"Happy Infrastructure Week! O.K., I know some of you are distracted by competing current events. But the Trump administration would prefer that we all concentrate on the president’s plans for improving the nation’s roads and bridges. Trump promised he’d be discussing infrastructure with all the major players “in great depth next week.” This was right before he went into a meeting with legislative leaders on Tuesday. You may be wondering why he didn’t discuss it with them in great depth right at that moment. Since this is, you know, Infrastructure Week. One possible answer is that the president likes promising to discuss important policy matters in the future much more than he likes working on them in the present. But to be fair, one of the Republican leaders did report later that Trump had mentioned the wall along the Mexican border, which would definitely be a structure. The president revealed he wants to pay for it by putting solar panels along the top. Wait a minute, I thought he hated renewable energy! Where did you come from? No, he doesn’t hate renewable energy. Just wind power, and that’s just because the Scottish government put some turbines near one of his golf courses. But let me tell you a little more about Infrastructure Week. While the whole world was talking about James Comey, Trump launched it with a plug for privatization of part of the Federal Aviation Administration. He sat down in front of the cameras and signed what might have looked, to the uninitiated, like a law, or a program, or at least a calendar of events. But it was really just a letter to Congress encouraging everyone to take up the F.A.A. idea. Which they have already made pretty clear they probably won’t. Why would we want to privatize the F.A.A.? It’s not going to make flying safer. If they wanted to make it better, they could tell the airlines to put in more leg room. "
"The tone is dry and unemotional, the language is simple and clear — but make no mistake: The prepared remarks of James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, which the Senate released in advance of his sworn testimony before the Intelligence Committee on Thursday, tell a shocking story. Starting days after the inauguration and continuing until mid-April, President Trump made multiple attempts to secure Mr. Comey’s personal loyalty and to interfere with the F.B.I.’s investigations into contacts between Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser and the Russian government, as well as a broader inquiry into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Russian efforts to swing the 2016 election to Mr. Trump. After a meeting in the Oval Office in February, the president asked everyone but Mr. Comey to leave. Then, according to Mr. Comey, he asked him to drop his investigation into Michael Flynn, who had just resigned as national security adviser after his lies about contacts with the Russian ambassador became public. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” he said, according to notes Mr. Comey made immediately afterward. Mr. Comey was so unnerved, he said, he told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with Mr. Trump again. (Mr. Sessions reportedly would not guarantee that the president would respect that request.) The president went further the next month, asking Mr. Comey to “lift the cloud” of the broader investigation into the campaign’s Russia ties. When Mr. Comey told Mr. Trump that he was not personally under investigation, the president pleaded that he make that public. More entreaties followed in April and then, in May, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey. Anyone left wondering how to connect the dots got some help from the president, who a few days after the firing said on national TV: “When I decided to just do it, I said to myself ... this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.” "
"Sixty-eight years ago, in Watts v. State of Indiana, the Supreme Court overturned a murder conviction on the ground that the defendant’s confession had been coerced. The case is not much known today because it was overtaken two decades later by Miranda v. Arizona. That landmark decision gave criminal suspects the right to the presence of a lawyer and meant that a six-day interrogation like the one Robert Watts endured on his own would thereafter be considered flatly unconstitutional, without the need for the detailed parsing of the facts that the court undertook. The Watts case nevertheless lives on for a single line in Justice Felix Frankfurter’s opinion for the court. “There comes a point,” Frankfurter wrote, “where this court should not be ignorant as judges of what we know as men.” For weeks this spring, that line rattled around in my mind. I had never read the Watts opinion until the other day, when I finally traced the line to its source. But I’d read several recent judicial opinions for which the line is highly pertinent, even revelatory. The most recent was Chief Judge Roger Gregory’s majority opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit two weeks ago, upholding a nationwide injunction against President Trump’s Muslim travel ban. The president’s executive order “in text speaks with vague words of national security,” Judge Gregory wrote, “but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.” Drawing on candidate Donald Trump’s professed goal of keeping Muslims out of the country, the judge observed that the order “cannot be divorced from the cohesive narrative linking it to the animus that inspired it.” What we know as men. There’s been a good deal of commentary about the negative impact the president’s intemperate remarks on Twitter about the travel ban early this week might have on the Supreme Court’s response to the administration’s appeal of the Fourth Circuit’s decision. It’s hard not to feel empathy for Jeffrey B. Wall, a respected Washington lawyer now serving as acting solicitor general. In the administration’s Supreme Court petition, filed last Thursday before the latest Twitter storm, he wrote that “the few post-inauguration remarks by the president and aides do not demonstrate an impermissible purpose.” "

"It was the black outfit in Episode 1 that made me sit up in surprise. That is to say, the black outfit that the first lady Claire Underwood wears to the funeral of the civilian beheaded by American Islamic extremists in the opening salvo of “House of Cards,” Season 5, the streaming drama that dropped last week. The single-breasted black Dolce & Gabbana neat-collared jacket atop the black Dolce & Gabbana dress that together looked eerily like a certain black Dolce & Gabbana coat recently worn during an official trip abroad by another first lady. Then it was the buttons on the majority of Claire’s clothing throughout the series marching up her garments with an almost military precision. The pussy bow blouse. The long white inaugural gown. The epaulets on a burgundy trench coat. The pencil skirts. The belts. The sharp shoulders. The high necks. The stilettos. Halfway through my binge-watching, I was scratching my head and thinking: Does the current first lady of the United States take her dressing cues from the first lady of Netflix programming? It’s not a giant leap of imagination to think the answer may be yes. Consider not only the clear similarity in their chosen silhouettes, but also the designer names: Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Dolce, Derek Lam. Consider that President Trump himself seems so much a product of his own television experience and obsession (though, sadly, Frank Underwood, whose Boss and Armani suits are always perfectly tailored, shirts custom-made and ties tied just so, does not seem to have had much impact). We live in a world where the line between reality and TV is increasingly, eerily fluid. And though there has been much debate about the parallels between the story line of Season 5 and the story line of the Trump administration thus far (Russian interference! A desire to use the office to benefit oneself!), for point or farce, the image associations are hard to ignore. "

"In developed capitalist democracies, financial, media and energy companies are private enterprises that don’t report to presidents. In Russia, things are different. Most of those businesses are majority-state-owned corporations, virtual branches of the government. And that means when you talk to the head of a Russian bank or oil company, you are effectively talking to the Kremlin. In 2000, when Vladimir Putin assumed the presidency, he consolidated competing power centers — media, business, local government, opposition parties and the Parliament — under his authority. He called it “a vertical of power.” This system now includes organized crime and cybercriminals. Today the top management of these enterprises are Putin allies, and many, like Mr. Putin himself, have worked in the security services, specifically in the K.G.B. and its successor organization, the F.S.B. The Russian government owns the major television outlets and, according to Russian journalists, sets the daily news agenda. The head of Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, is Igor Sechin, a former K.G.B. and F.S.B. security officer who served as a top lieutenant to Mr. Putin. Gazprom, the state gas company, is run by Alexei Miller, another former St. Petersburg associate of Mr. Putin. With exclusive rights to export gas, Gazprom controls prices, pipelines and energy diplomacy in Russia. It also owns the country’s largest media holding company, Gazprom Media. The deal Mr. Putin made with these companies, oligarchs and banks was that they would be free to make money with state help (often to the detriment of the Russian people) as long as Mr. Putin and his cronies got their cut of the profits — and the Kremlin and security forces were free to govern without interference. Failure to comply could lead to loss of one’s company or worse: The oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky challenged Mr. Putin on corruption in 2003 and was stripped of his company and put in jail. Oligarchs once close to Mr. Putin have died under suspicious circumstances. There was one more part of this arrangement: Since the government facilitated the moneymaking, the Kremlin could also demand in return payments or loans to favored individuals and institutions — no questions asked.

"Is Donald Trump a Kanamit? The Kanamits are the space aliens who come to Earth in an old “Twilight Zone” episode. “We ask only that you trust us, only that you simply trust us,” the benevolent-seeming Kanamit emissary tells United Nations delegates while promising to foster the general uplift of the human race. The emissary leaves behind a book in the Kanamit language. A team of analysts translates the title as “To Serve Man,” but they get no further. Only as masses of credulous people board spaceships for what they think will be a wonderful visit to the Kanamit planet does the real nature of the book become clear. “Don’t get on that ship!” cries the analyst who figures out the book’s true purpose. “The rest of the book, ‘To Serve Man,’ it’s… it’s a cookbook!” Welcome to the Trump presidency. If you’re Jeff Sessions, Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, or H. R. McMaster, you will have learned by now what it means to have been served by your boss. If you are a less senior member of the administration, consider that your seasoning in government service has its own culinary contronym. The attorney general was reminded on Monday of how ill-fated his voyage to Planet Trump is destined to be, after the president blasted the Justice Department for its “watered down, politically correct” travel ban. “These tweets may make some ppl feel better,” lawyer George Conway tweeted Monday, “but they certainly won’t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad.” OSG is the Office of the Solicitor General, SCOTUS is the Supreme Court, and George is Kellyanne’s better half. "

"Don’t be surprised if work appears to stop at 10 a.m. Eastern time. That’s when James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, testifies in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and millions of Americans are expected to pause what they are doing and tune in. The New York Times will be providing live coverage of the proceedings. Investors are already on edge as they monitor the British national elections and the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting — making for a day that some analysts have called Triple-Threat Thursday. So far, markets have been relatively calm. American stock markets ended higher on Wednesday after Mr. Comey’s prepared remarks for the Senate committee revealed no surprises. The Lawfare blog, however, contends in its preview to  Mr. Comey’s appearance that his testimony will be significant, even if there aren’t any bombshell revelations. And, of course, many will be watching President Trump’s Twitter account for his reactions. As for events in Britain, Politico has a guide: “How to Watch the British Election Like a Pro.” Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party is expected to win, but its lead has narrowed in recent weeks.

"WASHINGTON — An American warplane shot down a “pro-Syria regime” drone on Thursday after the drone attacked United States-backed fighters in southern Syria, the American military said. The confrontation was the latest clash in a potential proxy war in Syria that pits Iranian-backed militias that support President Bashar al-Assad against Syrian fighters who have been trained by American, British and other coalition military advisers. Their ultimate goal, many analysts say, is to link up with Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and establish a supply corridor that runs from Syria to Iraq and, eventually, to Iran. The episode occurred when the drone, which United States officials said appeared to be Iranian-made, dropped a munition near the Syrian fighters, who were accompanied at the time by advisers from the American-led coalition. The ordnance missed, and an F-15E fighter shot down the drone, which was similar in size to an American Predator and was still armed with other weapons. The area in southeastern Syria is becoming increasingly crowded as Iranian-backed militias, including the Lebanese group Hezbollah, have moved to extend their reach. Their initial goal appears to be to seize the area around the city of Deir al-Zour, which has been held by the Islamic State. "
"A man is being publicly grilled about why he was alone in a room with someone he felt was threatening him. Why didn’t he simply resign if he felt uncomfortable with what his boss was asking him to do? Why did he keep taking calls from that boss, even if he thought they were inappropriate? Why didn’t he just come out and say he would not do what the boss was asking for? Sound familiar? As dozens of people noted immediately on Twitter, if you switch genders, that is the experience of many women in sexual harassment cases. James Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., explained to senators during today’s hearing that he felt acutely uneasy and hesitant to directly confront his boss, the president of the United States. That’s right, even a savvy Washington insider, the same height as LeBron James and no stranger to the cut and thrust of power, seemed slightly ashamed that he had not been able to do so. “Maybe if I were stronger, I would have,” he said, trying to answer a question about why he didn’t speak his mind. “I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in.” These are the emotions that many women have struggled to explain in the face of sexual harassment, and the ones that have often given defense attorneys grist for what appear to be inconsistencies. Imbalance of power often lies at the heart of sexual harassment or assault cases, from those of Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly at Fox News to the trial of Bill Cosby, underway the same day as the hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. On Wednesday, Andrea Constand, Mr. Cosby’s accuser, concluded two days on the witness stand, with defense attorneys suggesting that her continued contacts with Mr. Cosby undermined her credibility. Unsurprisingly enough, today’s hearing shows that power can discomfit and silence men as well as women. The parallels provoked a lively online conversation: Critics of President Trump were not the only ones drawing parallels. Mr. Trump’s son, Donald Jr., echoed the question posed in the Senate that Mr. Comey had tried to answer, and defenders of Mr. Trump suggested he should no more be believed than women who level charges of sexual harassment: Sexual harassment and assault often provoke debates about credibility, fairness and bias. But at least for today, the tables were turned, and men could glimpse what women have often endured. "
"WASHINGTON — James B. Comey, the recently fired F.B.I. director, said Thursday in an extraordinary Senate hearing that he believed President Trump had tried to derail an investigation into his national security adviser, and accused the president of lying and defaming him and the F.B.I. Mr. Comey, no longer constrained by the formalities of a government job, offered a blunt, plain-spoken assessment of a president whose conversations unnerved him from the day they met, weeks before Mr. Trump took office. The James Comey who emerged during the hearing was by turns humble, folksy and matter-of-fact. But at the same time, he proved that underneath was a Washington veteran who understood how to tell his story for maximum effect. In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he provided an unflattering back story to his abrupt dismissal and raised the question of whether Mr. Trump had tried to obstruct justice. Answering that falls to the Justice Department special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Comey said he had given all of his memos about his interactions with the president to Mr. Mueller, who he believed would look into the possibility of obstruction. It was the first public suggestion that prosecutors would investigate the president. "
"Nordstrom insiders have chosen a good time to consider taking the business out of the public eye. A modestly leveraged buyout of the department store chain – recently famous for dropping first daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line – looks doable with members of the eponymous family rolling over their stakes. The growing list of retailers struggling with debt should sound a note of caution, though. The shopkeeping sector’s troubles, including dwindling foot traffic in malls, have taken their toll, and before Thursday’s pop after news of the family’s take-private interest, shares of Nordstrom were down 16 percent this year. Still, the company is in better shape than Macy’s, for example, which is closing a raft of stores. Tough action to weather the downturn could be easier to put into effect without the quarterly earnings treadmill. And the weakened share price helps the numbers add up for the Nordstrom family and any partners they bring in. Suppose they offer a 30 percent premium to Wednesday’s closing price of $40.48 a share. That would value the existing equity at $8.7 billion. Add $2.1 billion of net debt, and the total buyout value would be $10.8 billion. A ratio of debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of four times would be fairly restrained for a buyout. Assume that’s doable. Using the just over $1.6 billion consensus estimate from Thomas Reuters Eikon for Ebitda in the financial year to next January, debt could cover $6.5 billion of the deal price. That leaves $4.3 billion of needed equity. But with family members owning more than 30 percent of Nordstrom’s stock at present, rolling over their stakes at the buyout price would account for more than 60 percent of that, Reuters Breakingviews calculates. They would need about $1.6 billion of additional cash, a manageable check for a private equity partner to write provided the family’s plans for the company over the coming years look lucrative enough. Though a leveraged deal is feasible, the Nordstroms need to play it carefully. Many retailers, including J. Crew and Neiman Marcus, are running into financial difficulties after years of private equity ownership and burdensome borrowing that have stripped them of cash reserves and operational flexibility. An aggressively tailored structure would be risky. That aside, though, Nordstrom could be well suited for a buyout. "
"ATLANTA — Their first debate was polite and predictable. The second, not so much. Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel clashed on Thursday in their second debate for the vacant seat in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District ahead of the June 20 special election. After sparring lightly in their first encounter on Tuesday, Mr. Ossoff, a Democrat, and Ms. Handel, a Republican, attacked each other in sharper and more personal terms. Here’s our speed-read version: The morning debate took place before James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, appeared in front of Congress on Thursday, but after he issued his prepared testimony – putting Ms. Handel, who has appeared with President Trump, in the delicate position of responding. Her approach was mainly to reiterate her support for an independent investigation, and to declare that she was “not an extension of the White House.” But Ms. Handel also declined to offer unconditional support for the president: She said it was currently unclear if Mr. Trump tried to obstruct an investigation, and declined to rule out impeachment proceedings if he did. “I will look at the facts and let the facts take us to where the appropriate action should be,” she said. Mr. Ossoff, who is a darling of Democratic donors and activists, has taken steps throughout the race to separate himself from the national party. He drew stark policy distinctions with the left on Thursday, even as he seeks a strong turnout from the Democratic base. Mr. Ossoff said unambiguously that he would not join other Democrats in voting to raise taxes, even on the wealthy (“I don’t support any increase in income tax rates”), and that he did not support pushing for a single-payer health care system, an increasingly central preoccupation of the Democratic base.

"Here’s the latest sign of how far we’ve passed through the looking glass since Donald Trump moved into the White House: James Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday that he actually would be happy if the president had been covertly recording their conversations on the phone, in the Oval Office, at dinner and in Trump Tower. When he told his top aides that the president had asked him to drop the investigation into National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s lying about his contacts with Russian officials, the other F.B.I. officials were “as shocked and troubled by it as I was,” Comey testified on Thursday. At that moment, Comey said, he was glad that he’d continued writing memos after every conversation he had with Trump, a practice he started after their first meeting in Trump Tower before the inauguration. “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting,” he told the Senate. But Comey said he and his aides knew that there was no way to corroborate his account of Trump’s request to drop the Flynn case because he and the president were alone together: It would be Comey’s word against Trump’s. “My view of that changed when the prospect of tapes was raised,” Comey said, referring to a tweet in which Mr. Trump seemed to threaten Comey with recordings that would contradict his version of events. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Comey said at another point in his testimony. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, asked Comey why he didn’t tell the president that he was acting inappropriately when he cleared the Oval Office to ambush him about the Flynn probe. Comey, who was stone-faced at almost every other moment in the hearing, permitted himself a tiny smile. "
"Who are the people who questioned James Comey? Mr. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., testified in front of the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Here’s a brief list of the senators on the committee, their backgrounds and their history with Mr. Comey. Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina The chairman of the committee, which he joined in 2007, Mr. Burr embraced President Trump during the campaign. But he has earned praise from his peers in both parties in recent weeks for the seriousness with which he has taken his role in leading the Senate’s investigation. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia Mr. Warner, the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, has thrived in the spotlight that the investigation brings. He has in the past expressed presidential ambitions and has praised Mr. Burr, whom he calls a friend, for his leadership of the committee. Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho Mr. Risch was elected to the Senate in 2009 and has been a member of the committee since then. He is one of Mr. Trump’s strongest supporters in Congress and has expressed significant concern about leaks to the news media. He is a former governor of Idaho. Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California Ms. Feinstein, who was once the head of the committee, has in the past criticized Mr. Comey for his actions in the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server. But she expressed concern after he was fired in May and said then that she believed he should “absolutely” testify before the other committee on which she sits, the Senate Judiciary Committee. Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida A candidate for president in 2016, Mr. Rubio joined the Intelligence Committee in 2011. Mr. Rubio has been willing to criticize Mr. Trump, his former campaign rival, and has been dismissive of the president’s complaints that the Russia investigation is a “witch hunt.” "
"At the outset of the prison hostage situation that occupies Season 5 of Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black,” Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Leyva) implores her fellow inmates to stand down. “It’s not too late,” she says. “Nobody’s dead. We can still pull back.” This feels, in a way, like the series talking to itself. If you commit to this story, it’s saying, if you see this situation through to its logical conclusion, things will be done that can’t be undone, and this will be a different show than it began as. Do you really want to do this? Yes, this audacious if sometimes out-of-control season answers. “Orange Is the New Black” really wants to do this. The uprising was set in motion at the end of Season 4, when a guard killed Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) during a riot at Litchfield, a women’s prison in upstate New York. In the chaos afterward, Thomas Humphrey (Michael Torpey), a sadistic prison guard, loses control of a gun that he sneaked into the prison. Dayanara Diaz (Dascha Polanco) finds herself pointing it at him. Season 5, which arrives on Friday, picks up there. The situation becomes a hostage siege in the way that many crimes happen: an opportunity, a heated decision in the moment. Just as Dayanara, a soft-spoken amateur cartoonist, has suddenly become an armed rebel, “Orange,” an acerbic comedy-drama, is instantly pushed hard to the drama end of the spectrum. "

"HONG KONG — A temperature increase of less than one degree Fahrenheit over half a century raised the probability of mass heat-related deaths in India by two and a half times, a new study has found, in the latest sign that even a slight rise can have a grave effect on health. The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, found that as the mean summer temperature and the annual number of heat-wave days increased in India from 1960 to 2009, there was a “substantial increase” in related mortality rates. The climate change researchers also warned that future increases in global temperatures — which are projected to be far greater than those analyzed in the study — could take a “relatively drastic human toll” in India and many other low-latitude countries in the developing world. The study “provides evidence of not only warming in India, with some parts warming more than others, but also that as warming progresses heat waves become more frequent and more intense,” said David Mark Taylor, a professor of tropical environmental change at the National University of Singapore. (He was not involved in the study.) With the problem expected to worsen, he added, the challenge is “finding a comprehensive solution rather than a temporary fix that benefits some at the expense of the majority.” Parts of Asia have experienced record-breaking heat waves in recent years, with temperatures well above 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius). In 2015, more than 2,400 people, mostly laborers and farmhands, died from heat-related illness in India, according to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority. "

The following is the full transcript of that hearing, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For further coverage, follow our live briefing. — BURR: I’d like to call this hearing to order. Director Comey, I appreciate your willingness to appear before the committee today, and more importantly, I thank you for your dedicated service and leadership to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Your appearance today speaks to the trust we have built over the years, and I’m looking forward to a very open and candid discussion today.BURR: I’d like to remind my colleagues that we will reconvene in closed session at 1 PM today and I ask that you reserve for that venue any questions that might get into classified information. The director has been very gracious with his time, but the vice chairman and I have worked out a very specific timeline for his commitment to be on the Hill, so we will do everything we can to meet that agreement. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence exists to certify for the other 85 members of the United States Senate and the American people that the intelligence community is operating lawfully and has the necessary authorities and tools to accomplish its mission and keep America safe. Part of our mission, beyond the oversight we continue to provide to the intelligence community and its activities, is to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. The committee’s work continues. This hearing represents part of that effort. Jim, allegations have been swirling in the press for the last several weeks, and today’s your opportunity to set the record straight. Yesterday, I read with interest your statement for the record. And I think it provides some helpful details surrounding your interactions with the president. It clearly lays out your understanding of those discussions, actions you took following each conversation and your state of mind. I very much appreciate your candor, and I think it’s helpful as we work through to determine the ultimate truth behind possible Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Your statement also provides texture and context to your interactions with the president, from your vantage point, and outlines a strained relationship. The American people need to hear your side of the story just as they need to hear the president’s descriptions of events. "
"The two actors were sopping wet, their clothes sticking to their skin. In a dinghy onstage at 3LD Art & Technology Center in Lower Manhattan, they were rehearsing a scene from Sheila Callaghan’s immersive new eco-play, “(Not) Water” — guzzling water ever more sloppily from a succession of increasingly large plastic containers, then throwing their empties overboard. They talked. They drank. The liquid spilled out and drenched them. The bottom of the boat sloshed with runoff. “Act like you’re not wet at all,” their director, Daniella Topol, called from a few yards away on a recent afternoon, and the performers stopped wiping their eyes. Letting the water course over them, they just kept on going. It’s a tricky element, water — messy, difficult to contain and, for Ms. Callaghan and Ms. Topol, who conceived “(Not) Water” together, elusive as a dramatic subject. It has taken nearly a dozen years for the play, which began in 2005 with a monologue about Hurricane Katrina, to find its shape. “It’s about water quality, which we have control over, and water quantity, which we don’t have control over,” Ms. Callaghan said from Los Angeles, where she writes for the Showtime comedy “Shameless,” and where the yearslong drought informed her thinking about water. Yet it is such an enormous topic that it was not only hard to grasp but also exhausting to confront. The hyperawareness of details concerning any number of issues (climate change, safe drinking water, use of natural resources) periodically led to what she called “urgency fatigue.” “We’re trying to hold a storm in our hands,” a character named Not Sheila says in the play — or did in a recent draft, which has been updated since. Because that’s the thing about this show: Its state of flux has been a constant. Hurricane Sandy, the lead-tainted water in Flint, Mich., even President Trump’s announcement this month that the United States would pull out of the Paris climate accord — with each significant event, the play has morphed anew. Waist-deep in “(Not) Water,” Ms. Callaghan, 44, and Ms. Topol, 42, just keep on fording. "
"WASHINGTON — This story was updated on Dec. 4, 2017. Read on for further explanation about obstruction of justice and how it relates to President Trump’s actions. The testimony by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey that President Trump, before firing him last month, demanded loyalty, urged him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser and pressed him to “lift the cloud” of the Russia inquiry is fueling accusations that the president obstructed justice. Mr. Comey’s prepared testimony, which the Senate Intelligence Committee released on Wednesday, corroborates prior reports by The New York Times about how Mr. Comey’s strained relationship with the president evolved, which had already prompted Democrats to raise the specter of the obstruction crime. Moreover, Mr. Trump himself told NBC News last month that when he fired Mr. Comey, he had been thinking about the F.B.I.’s investigation into whether his associates coordinated with Russia in its interference in the 2016 election. The Times has reported that the day after the firing, Mr. Trump told Russian diplomats in the Oval Office that firing Mr. Comey had relieved “great pressure because of Russia.” In a statement last month after The Times’s report about the conversation over Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, the White House said, “The president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn.” “The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations,” the White House statement said. “This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.” "
"Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and the Truman Capote Fellow at Yale Law School, and Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan center, watched James B. Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee today, where the former F.B.I. director discussed the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. Emily Bazelon: Now that the public hearing is over, let’s think about what Comey accomplished today. His probity and patriotism and commitment to public service were on full display. He backed up his growing and, eventually, deep-seated suspicion of the president. He refrained from drawing a conclusion about obstruction of justice, while underscoring the gravity of what’s at stake for the Russia investigation and for the rule of law. I know Trump defenders will continue trying to wave it all away — it’s already becoming clear how they want to do so — but Comey keeps making it harder for them. Elizabeth Goitein: Emily, I agree with you that Comey acquitted himself well, especially given that some aspects of how he handled matters are hard to explain. I didn’t see any senators who were eager to tackle him on credibility. Moving forward, if this hearing is any indication, Trump’s defenders will be trying to portray Trump’s pressuring Comey to drop the Flynn investigation as an isolated incident, a president who simply didn’t know any better going a bit too far trying to get a friend off the hook. It will be up to lawmakers, journalists and others to keep the focus on the bigger picture and keep pushing for answers on the nature of Trump associates’ ties to Russia. But let’s take a real step back to the very beginning: Last summer and fall, a hostile foreign power used hackers to try to get a candidate, Donald Trump, elected. The F.B.I. determined there was sufficient evidence that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in this effort to open an investigation, which continues to this day. The president asked Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to pledge his loyalty and to shut down one part of the investigation. When the director didn’t comply, he was fired. And the intelligence committee hearing on all of this proceeded like it was just another partisan fight about tax cuts. The word “surreal” comes to mind. Emily: For me, the specific takeaway is actually something we already knew: Comey said: “I take the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve.” Comey was clear Trump didn’t ask him to stop the Russia investigation. But the president wanted to change the course of what the F.B.I. was doing. In this context, whatever his rationale, and whether or not he broke the law, is that acceptable conduct for an American president? It’s a serious question. It should transcend politics. "
"Sixty-four years ago the Korean War, which raged from 1950 to 1953 and killed more than 36,000 American soldiers, was suspended with a cease-fire agreement. A peace treaty, however, was never signed. The war never came to a formal end. North Korean leaders have long attached importance to formally ending the war. Over the years they have repeatedly raised the prospect of a peace treaty to resolve the many issues that the 1953 armistice left unaddressed, most notably agreement on the permanent division of the Korean Peninsula. At various times the North Koreans have proposed negotiating a treaty with the United States, at other times with South Korea. In recent years, China has also urged the opening of such negotiations. The North Koreans want a definitive declaration of peace, not just a truce, as reassurance that they won’t be attacked and as recognition by the United States, South Korea and the rest of the world that their country is a sovereign state and legitimate power. Successive American presidents have insisted on a number of preconditions before any serious peace negotiations could start, including a commitment to denuclearization and the halting of further missile tests. But North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jung-un, is unlikely to agree to give up his country’s nuclear and missile programs without receiving convincing assurances that he will not suffer the fate of Saddam Hussein of Iraq or Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya.

James Comey’s testimony today will reveal President Trump’s blatant disregard for the rule of law, and Nick Kristof’s column offers an excellent preview. I realize it will be hard to pay attention to any other political story this week, but I urge you to find the extra attention span, because there is another important, disturbing story developing: The chances of the Senate taking away health insurance from millions of people seem to be rising. On Wednesday, Mitch McConnell formally started a fast-track process for the Senate to consider the House’s health care bill. It’s true that Senate Republicans continue to poor-mouth their prospects for passing a bill, but that may actually be part of their strategy to do so. They know that their health care plan is extremely unpopular. It’s a reverse Robin Hood plan that would take insurance away from or worsen coverage for the middle class, poor, sick and elderly and use the savings to cut taxes for the affluent. That’s why the plan is opposed by experts across the ideological spectrum, as well as groups representing doctors, nurses, hospitals, cancer patients, heart-disease patients and many others. "
"Mackinac Island has a permanent population of about 500 people and just as many horses, but no cars. From May to October, the picturesque Michigan getaway relies on about 3,000 workers to power its economic engine: summer tourism. Historically, up to a third of those workers are foreigners, including Mexicans, Filipinos, Canadians and Jamaicans, who are hired on seasonal visas. But when many of the island’s business owners applied for those visas this year, they heard from the government that none were left. So at the Iroquois Hotel, a Victorian property on the waterfront where rooms command up to $1,200 a night, the owner is trying to figure out how to maintain its high standards without 30 Jamaican housekeepers. Other hotels are contemplating closing off whole sections. Even those who own the ubiquitous horses are wondering if they will have enough workers. “It’s urgent for us to get more visas to save the season,” Brad Chambers, who operates horse tours and taxis, said. The island whose selling point is being stuck in time is now suffering because it is stuck in the middle of a modern-day struggle over jobs and who should be doing them. So, too, are a number of the regional industries that define the American summer but have increasingly relied on non-American workers, from vacation spots in Maine and Minnesota to Gulf Coast shrimpers and the salmon fisheries of Alaska.

"When Season 4 of Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black” ended, no one — save, perhaps, Jenji Kohan, the show’s creator, and her writers — could be certain where the series was headed. But wherever it was, it didn’t look good. Poussey Washington, the soulful wisp of an inmate played by Samira Wiley, had died an episode earlier — agonizingly, in a scene echoing the 2014 death of Eric Garner — when a corrections officer pinned her to the floor with his knee. Then another corrections officer lost control of his gun, which a furious Daya (Dascha Polanco) picked up and pointed at his head. Season 5, beginning Friday, June 9, steps off with Daya and that gun and then segues into what Ms. Kohan called “a natural progression”: a riot in which the inmates seek justice for Poussey’s killing by taking hostages and demanding what the privatization of their facility took from them, including G.E.D. classes, adequate health care and even tampons. The action, covering three days, unfurls across 13 episodes. “We wanted to slow down to really get into the riot, and also to slow down in general and get into some of the detail work that’s hard to do if you’re skipping through time,” Ms. Kohan said. In a phone interview from Los Angeles, she spoke about the loss of Poussey; the real-life prison system; and her latest Netflix project, “Glow,” starring Alison Brie, about women’s professional wrestling. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.  So just how fast are we skipping? In real life, Piper Kerman, whose story inspired the series, spent 13 months at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn. Our Piper was sentenced to 18. I think we’re at about 10 months.  There’s a point where the riot evolves from chaos to a near utopia — baristas serving cold brew, bloggers offering beautification seminars — before devolving. What’s the message? I think it reflects humanity. We can be beautiful, and we can be incredibly destructive. And sometimes we’re our own worst enemy, and be careful what you wish for, and all those clichés. We wanted to follow what we thought would be a natural progression of the riot, and we had done research into other ones. They were mostly men’s riots. But we were going to take the information and see how it would be different in our environment and how it would be the same. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. James Comey’s scheduled appearance before a Senate panel on Thursday has the political world in a state of breathless anticipation. But Christmas came a day early, at least for late-night hosts, with the release of the former F.B.I. director’s written testimony, full of detail about his meetings with President Trump. Jimmy Kimmel said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump was probably blindsided. Mr. Kimmel sounded a little envious of Mr. Comey. Stephen Colbert reveled in the statement’s details, quoting from it at length. On this week’s “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee expressed outrage at Mr. Trump for his Twitter attacks on London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. Soon after the attack in London last weekend, the president accused Mr. Khan of not taking terrorism seriously enough. "
"To the Editor: Re “From ‘a Proud Deplorable,’ ” a June 8 letter from a Trump supporter: Dear Friend: I write as a proud liberal with an open mind. Though there is much we disagree about, there is one thing you and I agree on: We live in a dangerous world. One of the greatest risks we face is our belief that those who disagree with us have nothing of value to say. In a democracy like this country we both love, our system has worked because people with different views find a way to listen to one another and compromise. If I discount everything positive you say about President Trump, then I lose what I can learn from you. If you dismiss every question I raise about him, then you lose, too. Let’s not “deplore” one another, and maybe we can both learn something that will make us all safer by making Mr. Trump a better president of the whole country. SUSIE FRANKLIN

"To the Editor: Re “Draft Rule Makes It Far Easier to Deny Coverage for Birth Control” (front page, June 2): How ironic that President Trump thinks he is “coming to the rescue of the Little Sisters of the Poor,” a religious order that has refused to cover contraception, with his proposed rule to undermine contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration may absurdly question the causal link between contraception and unintended pregnancy, but no one can challenge the causal link between unintended pregnancy and poverty. Right now nearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and the majority of those pregnancies involve families on Medicaid living near or below the poverty line. Contraception is only partly a personal health issue; more important, it is a critical public health issue. These unintended pregnancies become the responsibility of all of us. Substantial government services exist to support these pregnant mothers and struggling families. Like access to education, access to contraception is a key ingredient for opportunity and success, and it is essential to closing the gap between rich and poor. The American people should embrace it. ELIZABETH MUNRO, WESTON, MASS. To the Editor: The other day I provided family planning services to a young mother. Both of her children were born by cesarean section. The second of these surgeries was complex and life-threatening, and the delivering obstetrician advised her never to get pregnant again, as she may not survive the delivery. Another recent patient told me the story of her third pregnancy, in which a condition called pre-eclampsia caused her to have grand mal seizures during the delivery. She and the infants (twins) almost died in the process. One remains severely handicapped. What government or employer has the right to decide whether or how these women — or any woman — should prevent future pregnancies? The fates of their lives and bodies are not subjects for anyone else’s “conscientious objections.” CHRISTINE HENNEBERG

"To the Editor: The testimony of James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday was compelling, credible and damning. What reasonable person who has followed the actions of the administration — the distortions and lies that have shamelessly been presented to the American people daily — would conclude that the president is telling the truth and that Mr. Comey has fabricated his testimony? We can reasonably conclude that the president repeatedly told the director what a fine job he was doing until Mr. Comey declined to do the president’s bidding, to “let go” of the Michael Flynn matter and to announce to the public that the president was not personally under investigation. We can also be confident that the president misused his authority in an effort to pressure the director into being loyal: serving Mr. Trump rather than the nation. It has been acknowledged on both sides of the aisle that Mr. Comey is a man of integrity and decency, and that he is not known as a liar. We now have a more clear picture, in case anyone needed it, of the character of our president. OREN SPIEGLER
UPPER ST. CLAIR, PA. To the Editor: Re “Comey Tells How Trump Persisted in Pleas to F.B.I.” (front page, June 8): Loyalty to the president is not some sort of alien concept in America. Tens of millions of people sworn into the armed services take an oath that reads in part: “I will obey the orders of the president of the United States.” Further, as a former federal prosecutor, I prosecuted a number of obstruction of justice cases and they were nowhere near what James Comey’s version of the events in question alleges. Rather, they usually involved payments of money or threats of violence to a witness or jurors. With Mr. Comey, it is the word of the president of the United States against a disgruntled, fired federal employee. Every day, federal and state prosecutors insert a memo to the file to protect themselves. Sometimes the memo is an accurate recollection of events, more or less. Sometimes it is more the work of a novelist, and sometimes it is simply the work of a disgruntled employee who has a dog in the hunt. "
"Senator John McCain became an unexpected focus of befuddlement and concern on Thursday after a line of questioning that appeared to conflate two separate F.B.I. investigations during James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. McCain, 80, Republican of Arizona, said he believed there was a “double standard” because an investigation into the use of a private email server by Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, was completed in July, while an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the presidential campaign continues. “It’s hard to reconcile: In one case you reach a complete conclusion, and the other side you have not,” he said. He added: “She’s one of the candidates, but in her case you say there will be no charges, and in the case of President Trump, the investigation continues.” Following a yearlong investigation, Mr. Comey, then the director of the F.B.I., announced on July 5 that he recommended no criminal charges for Ms. Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state.

"It’s a familiar and discomforting spectacle: A woman who alleges sexual assault is also put on trial. She is grilled on the witness stand about why she continued to speak with a famous man she now charges with abuse, someone who had the power to shape her future. The man has to defend himself against the possibility of false accusations, and so it’s open season on a woman’s credibility. Andrea Constand’s two days at the center of the Bill Cosby trial captured the dynamics that make sexual assault cases so polarizing and so resonant. Her testimony, picked over by Mr. Cosby’s lawyers, occurred at a cultural moment when accusations of sexual assault or harassment have rocked a media empire, a presidential campaign, Silicon Valley start-ups and countless college campuses. In a way, this is also a trial about how society grapples with the combustible questions of power, predation and due process that complicate he said/she said narratives. The jury is still out. Revelations about years of sexual harassment pushed out Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly at Fox News, but questions linger about how fundamentally the company’s culture will change. Uber just fired 20 people after internal investigations of harassment. Political analysts wrongly predicted that Donald J. Trump’s taped boasts about forcing himself on women would doom his candidacy. “When something is ready to become a cultural narrative, everything feeds it,” said Mark Harris, an author and the former executive editor of Entertainment Weekly, who also pointed to a 2016 HBO film about Anita Hill’s public shaming after accusing Clarence Thomas of harassment. “When people are finally willing to look something in the eye, culture almost conspires to tell them how much of it they are willing to look in the eye.” "
"If there was any last, faint hope for Richard A. Dietl, the garrulous former police detective and current mayoral hopeful, to return to the Republican Party to challenge Mayor Bill de Blasio in the November election, it faded permanently on Thursday. A day after hearing brief arguments, a state appeals court in Manhattan issued a terse statement upholding a State Supreme Court judge’s decision that Mr. Dietl, known as Bo, had been properly listed as “blank” on voter registration rolls after he tried to change his party affiliation to Democrat but mistakenly filled in two boxes. Without being registered as a Democrat or a Republican, Mr. Dietl cannot run in either party’s mayoral primary in September, relegating him to campaigning as an outsider in his quixotic quest to oust Mr. de Blasio, the incumbent. The ruling, by a five-judge panel of the First Department of the Appellate Division, came after a decision last month by county Republican officials not to grant Mr. Dietl a waiver allowing him to enter the party’s primary. And it came amid what had already been a bad week for the often vulgar candidate, beginning with a Staten Island Advance reporter’s disclosure on Tuesday of an aggressive text message exchange between Mr. Dietl and Frank Morano, the chairman of the Reform Party on Staten Island. “Lying worm,” Mr. Dietl wrote in the obscenity-laced exchange last week after the Reform Party endorsed Sal Albanese, a Democrat and former City Council member, for mayor. “Go find a can of Man.” “If I could figure out what that means, I am going to make every effort to do so,” Mr. Morano said in a telephone interview on Thursday. Mr. Morano said he never told Mr. Dietl that he was going to vote for him. After the Reform Party endorsed Mr. Albanese, Mr. Morano recalled how “Bo called me out on Twitter” using an anatomical reference. "
"WASHINGTON — At Shaw’s Tavern, a capital pub where sandwiches laden with Top Secret Sauce were cooking and Russian vodka was chilling, it was clear that regular Thursday-related responsibilities would have to wait. The former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was about to speak. The president might tweet. It was not the time to work. It was time to covfefe. “Major political events here are a bit like going to watch sports teams compete,” Brian Palladino, a computer programmer, said as he took his place in line just before the tavern opened at 9:30 a.m. “There’s a theatrical aspect to it.” Within 15 minutes, the bar was crammed to capacity. On this day — Comey Day — Washington was in full character, and thousands turned up in saloons across the city, ready to watch the latest installment of a reality show known as the Trump presidency. Thursday’s episode featured James B. Comey, the ousted F.B.I. director, who was called to a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing to explain his tense working relationship with President Trump. Mr. Trump fired him last month during an investigation into whether the president’s campaign colluded with Russians who meddled in last year’s election. Mr. Comey, a man who in recent months has been cast alternately as a hero and as a villain in the public imagination, was going to speak for himself, and the people of Washington were not going to miss it. They found ways to work from home, take the day off or otherwise play a game of mental hooky to watch the hearing. "

"Mayor Bill de Blasio has taken pleasure in noting his stark differences with President Trump, but on Thursday he admitted that they had at least one thing in common: They have both ridden between the cars on the subway. There is just one problem: What the mayor did is against the rules in New York City. Regular riders take note of signs on trains warning that moving between cars is prohibited, but Mr. de Blasio is not exactly a subway aficionado. He has been heavily criticized for favoring a chauffeured ride over mingling with New Yorkers on a system that is becoming increasingly unreliable. Asked about riders who were stuck on a steamy F train this week, Mr. de Blasio said he had taken the subway for “many years” and “always as a rider preferred to go between cars.” “I don’t like that car, it’s crowded, it’s hot and the next one is air-conditioned, whatever,” he said. “I think riders prefer the ability to move between cars.” If they do, they should be prepared to get a summons and pay a $75 fine. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways, made it illegal to move between cars in 2005 as part of a crackdown on crime. During the F train episode, riders panicked when they realized that the doors at either end of the car were locked. Mr. de Blasio added that the need to travel between cars during an emergency had to be weighed against the safety concerns of allowing movement between trains. The mayor’s comments came about two months after Mr. Trump told The New York Times that he used to stand between cars. Mr. Trump conceded that it had been “a long time” since he took the subway and that his parents did not approve of him riding between cars. “They weren’t thrilled when they heard that,” Mr. Trump told The Times. Last week, Mr. de Blasio encouraged New Yorkers to reduce their environmental footprint while declining to give up his regular 11-mile ride from Manhattan to his Brooklyn gym. The mayor, who last took the subway on April 19, said that riding the subway would be little more than “cheap symbolism.” On Thursday, Mr. de Blasio divulged more details about his subway-riding past. He said he had ridden two lines near his home — the F and R trains — from 1992 until he got a car in 1999. “For years and years and years, the F train was the way I got around,” he said. “I can absolutely relate to what people must have gone through in that horrible incident.” Gene Russianoff of the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group, said the ban on moving between cars was needed to prevent people from falling. “I respectfully disagree with the mayor,” Mr. Russianoff said. “He seems to know as much about the rules for safe travel as President Trump knows about how the Justice Department works.” "
"DOHA, Qatar — The report appeared just after midnight on the official Qatari news agency’s website, and its contents were stunning: The emir of Qatar was quoted as describing “tensions” with President Trump and speculating he may not last in office, recommending friendship with Iran, praising the Palestinian militants of Hamas, and then attesting to his own “good” relations with Israel. The contradictory statements could hardly have been better contrived to alienate the United States and Arab countries around the Gulf, and Qatar immediately began to deny the report, early on May 24. But within 20 minutes, satellite networks controlled by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had seized on the damning news flash and began interviewing long lines of well-prepared commentators to expound on the perfidy of Qatar. The Qatari government said the news agency had been hacked, a claim now supported by the F.B.I. and British law enforcement officials. Though they would not say so publicly, Qatari officials blamed the Saudis and Emiratis. Probably not coincidentally, a few days later, emails hacked from the Emirates’ ambassador to Washington began turning up in the Western news media and then the Qatari news network Al Jazeera. The cyber-intrigue was the opening skirmish in a pitched battle among ostensible Gulf allies this week. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. rallied dependent Arab states to cut off diplomatic relations, travel and trade with Qatar, and the unity of the American-backed alliance against the Islamic State and Iran has been fractured. But the dirty tricks also heralded a broader transformation in international espionage. The dust-up in the Gulf is the clearest sign yet that cyberattacks coupled with disinformation campaigns are no longer the exclusive domain of sophisticated powers like Russia. Any country can get in the game for the relatively low price of a few freelance hackers. "

"The race between Paris and Los Angeles to host the 2024 Summer Olympics may be heading for a compromise. Here’s what we know. What’s happening Friday? The International Olympic Committee board is meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, where it is expected to announce that it will simultaneously award both the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games, rather than only the first one. The presumption is that one Olympics will go to Paris and the other to Los Angeles. Does this happen often? No. The cycle of the awarding each Games is well established, with one winner at the end. There have been close losers with good credentials before, like Madrid for 2016, Paris for 2012 and Rome for 2004, but they were not awarded subsequent Games as a consolation prize. What about cities that had been targeting 2028? Although the process for those Games had not formally started, many cities had at least expressed interest. But with the increasing realization around the world that the Olympics can be a money-losing proposition, there was a chance that the final roster of candidates would shrink. Awarding both Games now, to cities eager to hold them and capable of doing so, avoids that problem for a while. Weren’t there once other candidates for 2024? Yes. Hamburg dropped out in 2015, Rome in 2016, and Budapest in February. Financial concerns were a major motive in each case. Oh, and Boston, the United States’ original official candidate city, withdrew its bid in 2015, leading Los Angeles to become a late replacement. "
"WASHINGTON — During a dramatic two and a half hours of testimony on Thursday, the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, gave new insight into his tense relationship with President Trump. Mr. Comey said he was distrustful of the president from their first meeting, in early January, and said he believed that Mr. Trump was trying to get him to end the F.B.I. investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Comey also described how Mr. Trump antagonized him on Twitter after firing him. Here are the biggest takeaways from the hearing: Mr. Trump’s Twitter account undermined him once again. Days after Mr. Comey was ousted, The New York Times reported that the two men had dined one-on-one at the White House in January and that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey for his loyalty. On the morning the story was published in the newspaper, the president tweeted, “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” A flurry of questions ensued, but the White House would not confirm whether Mr. Trump had recorded their discussions. Nevertheless, the tweet set off a series of events, some engineered by Mr. Comey, that helped prompt the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russian election interference and possible ties to Mr. Trump’s associates, a blow to a White House that has tried to shake off the investigation. Mr. Comey said that three days after Mr. Trump’s tweet, he woke up in the middle of the night and realized that any possible tapes could corroborate his conversations with Mr. Trump — particularly one in February in which the president asked him to end the investigation into Mr. Flynn. Mr. Comey said he decided at that point that he “needed to get that out into the public square,” adding that he had asked a friend to share contents of a memo he had written about the meeting. The Times reported on that memo, and on Mr. Trump’s request that the Flynn investigation be ended, on May 16. Mr. Comey said that he asked his friend to disclose the memo’s contents in the hope that a special counsel would be appointed. The next day, the Justice Department announced one: Robert S. Mueller III, the former F.B.I. director. "
"WASHINGTON — A powerful House Republican said Thursday that Congress should immediately provide money for subsidy payments to health insurance companies, which have been demanding big rate increases or fleeing from Affordable Care Act markets because of President Trump’s threat to cut off the funds. The Republican, Kevin Brady of Texas, who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, went out of his way to make clear that he now believes that Congress should continue the subsidies, which compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for seven million low-income people. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals on the issue, as the president seeks leverage to win legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That has destabilized insurance markets and jeopardized a health law that Mr. Trump says is collapsing. Mr. Trump has said he can stop the payments “anytime I want,” and his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, refers to the subsidies as “Obamacare bailout payments.” But at a budget hearing on Thursday, Mr. Brady said the payments were needed “to help stabilize the insurance market and help lower premiums for Americans trapped in Obamacare.” “We should act within our constitutional authority now to temporarily and legally fund cost-sharing reduction payments as we move away from Obamacare,” Mr. Brady said. “Insurers have made clear the lack of certainty is causing 2018 proposed premiums to rise significantly.” "
"Speaking at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Thursday, not far from her presidential campaign headquarters, Hillary Clinton did not beat around the bush. “I wish I had flown in from the White House,” she told graduates of Medgar Evers College, a Brooklyn school that is part of the City University of New York. “But I’m just as happy to be here anyway.” It was the only explicit reference to Washington in her 20-minute address, though the commencement coincided with dramatic events unfolding there that day: James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, was testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Her speech, however, was still pointedly political. Acknowledging the diversity of the Medgar Evers student body and of Brooklyn, Mrs. Clinton called on graduates to uphold the legacy of figures like the slain civil rights leader for whom the school is named, by fighting for voting rights and standing up against the rise of hate crimes. “Never let anyone silence your voices,” she said. “Make your voices heard every single day. And when they even try to dismiss your lived experiences, maybe they’ll call it ‘identity politics,’ stand up and say your identity is as important and valuable as the identity of anybody else who lives in the United States of America.” Though she never named President Trump, her address was filled with thinly veiled references to his administration, its policies and its controversies. Speaking of Medgar Evers College, which was founded in 1970 in the Crown Heights neighborhood, she said: “It opened during a period of tumultuous change in America. The Selma and Montgomery marches had taken placed just five years earlier. We were facing assassinations, political turmoil, investigations.” Here she paused for effect. "
"For some people who watched James B. Comey’s Senate testimony on Thursday, the questions that Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, faced and the situations he described brought to mind a seemingly unrelated topic: sexual harassment. As members of the Senate Intelligence Committee questioned Mr. Comey, sometimes sharply, asking why he did not immediately report any behavior by President Trump that he thought was inappropriate, why he did not quit as F.B.I. director and why he continued to take private calls from Mr. Trump even after he was unnerved by their one-on-one interactions, commentators on social media made comparisons to the difficulties and doubts faced by women who have been sexually harassed or abused. Emily Nussbaum, The New Yorker’s television critic, said that the situation reminded her of the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News that led to the ouster of Roger Ailes, the network’s former chairman, and Bill O’Reilly, the former Fox News host. And for some who were watching, the testimony underscored how sexual harassment is more about power than sex. Not all of whose who watched Mr. Comey testify were comfortable with the comparison, saying that it trivialized victims of harassment and abuse. "
"Weeks after being described by Donald Trump as a “nut job,” James Comey on Thursday deftly recast his confrontation with the president as a clash between the legal principles at the foundation of American democracy, and a venal, self-interested politician who does not recognize, let alone uphold, them. In sworn testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, made clear that he had no confidence in the president’s integrity. Why? “The nature of the person,” he said. Confronted with low presidential character for the first time in his career, Mr. Comey began writing meticulous notes of every conversation with Mr. Trump. “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting,” he said. Mr. Comey said he was stunned during one Oval Office meeting by Mr. Trump’s request — which he very reasonably understood as an order — to drop the F.B.I. investigation into Michael Flynn. Mr. Flynn had been forced to resign as national security adviser the day before, after lying about his contacts with Russia. And Russia, Mr. Comey usefully reminded the senators, had gone to unprecedented lengths to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, using “overwhelming” technological firepower. “This is about America,” Mr. Comey kept saying. Russia “tried to shape the way we think, we vote, we act — that is a big deal,” he added. “They’re coming after America. ... They want to undermine our credibility in the face of the world.” And yet Mr. Trump, the beneficiary of Moscow’s meddling, has never appeared even slightly concerned by this Russian attack. He told Mr. Comey to stand down and fired him when he refused. “I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Mr. Comey testified. “That is a very big deal.” As he decried Russia’s attempt to “dirty” American democratic institutions, Mr. Comey could as well have been talking about Mr. Trump’s behavior.

"LONDON — In a global economy amply stocked with anxiety-provoking variables, Britain just added another. An election designed to bolster the government’s mandate instead yielded fundamental confusion over who is in charge as the nation prepares for fraught negotiations in its pending divorce from the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May had called the election on the assumption that her Conservative Party would emerge stronger, solidifying her negotiating position. Instead, the electorate’s stunning rebuke of her leadership has left her relying on the support of a small, socially conservative right-wing party in Northern Ireland in order to form a government, intensifying uncertainty about future commercial dealings across the English Channel. Investors took the latest turmoil in Britain as a prompt to unload the British pound. As European markets began trading on Friday, the currency slipped as much as 2 percent against the dollar. The country’s benchmark stock index, however, gained around 1 percent. Analysts said that rise occurred because many of the companies that make up the index do a majority of their business overseas and therefore benefit from a cheaper pound. And yet the shocking electoral outcome also has the potential to diminish the looming economic costs of Britain’s exit from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit. "
"In bars, V.F.W. halls, offices and living rooms, Americans were riveted by the testimony of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, a moment of high drama about the conduct of President Trump, the workings of American democracy and the threats of Russian involvement in the presidential election. For some the proceedings were seen through the prism of the partisan divide. For others, they were less about Democrats and Republicans than about a dystopian sense that American governance has veered off the rails. Here are four accounts from around the country. DENVER — The televisions at the Park Tavern in a leafy neighborhood near the Colorado State Capitol are usually tuned to sports, but on Thursday morning, it was wall-to-wall Comey as breakfast regulars sipped late-morning beers and aired their frustration and disgust with a political scandal that had dimmed their views of the president. “He’s causing his own demise,” said Chad Cunningham, 45, an Air Force veteran who has voted for Republicans and Democrats but sat out the last presidential election. “He’s not doing anything for this country except embarrassing us.” Mr. Cunningham said the former F.B.I. director seemed honest and forthright, a man with little to hide and little reason to lie. To him, Mr. Comey’s steady, detailed delivery made Mr. Trump’s shoot-from-the-phone Twitter habit seem especially intemperate and cavalier. He said he would be perfectly happy if Vice President Mike Pence took over for Mr. Trump. “Because this is not working,” he said. As the testimony unfolded on the TV screens, Michael O’Brien, 55, a retired teacher, hunched over his tablet, earbuds inserted, because he said the livestream from PBS was arriving just a few seconds earlier than the cable news feed. "
"WASHINGTON — On the 140th day of the Trump presidency — one for each allotted character on the executive Twitter feed that stayed conspicuously silent all Thursday morning — a very tall man with a very strange place in this very bewildering moment in American history strolled into Hart Senate Office Building 216, shot a quick glance at the masses arrayed behind him and presented a seen-it-all city with something unusual. In a capital accustomed to overcooked spectacle and insufferable congressional testimony, James B. Comey delivered on the hype. For about two and a half hours, the room fell into an anxious hush, punctured sporadically by audible emissions of surprise at the remarks of a deposed F.B.I. director with a collection of Trump-branded knives in his reputational torso. Senators settled into their telegenic gazes, steely but approachable, often whispering to one another as the witness held forth. Photographers clicked with impunity, descending on every twitch: a wave of the hand, a cock of the head, a woman delivering glasses of ice water to Mr. Comey’s table before he arrived. "
"The filmmaker Bill Morrison customarily constructs his movies with footage from other films that are very old and whose prints are very worn. No matter the ostensible subject of his individual pictures, the overarching theme is impermanence; his best-known work, “Decasia” (2002), is an artfully edited assemblage of found footage whose visual appeal is the crumbling of the film emulsion itself. So it’s a bit of a shock that “Dawson City: Frozen Time” begins with a brightly colored, completely intact clip from a television show about baseball in which Mr. Morrison appears, talking to an enthusiastic host about newly discovered footage related to the Black Sox baseball-betting scandal of 1919. Mr. Morrison’s film tells the story of how that footage, and several hundred other reels of volatile nitrate film from the 1910s and ’20s, were discovered decades after they were presumed to be permanently lost. But part of the point of “Dawson City” is that the film prints had actually been forgotten — buried underground in an era when not much thought was given to their artistic or historical value. The discovery was made in 1978 in Dawson, also known as Dawson City, a Yukon River town in northwestern Canada. A local man who was clearing a lot with a backhoe suddenly found himself digging up film reels, and he paused. The story of the finding unfolds via television news clips from the late 1970s; then Mr. Morrison goes further back, using a wide variety of much older footage. “Dawson City” tells a number of stories: about how the addition of certain chemicals to cotton created an explosive (nicknamed gun cotton) that was developed into celluloid motion picture film; about a settlement of Native Americans that was muscled out of existence by white settlers trekking north during the gold rushes of the mid- and late-19th centuries; about the boom and bust cycles of Dawson City itself, which burned to the ground once a year for the first nine years of its existence. It tells the stories of famous fortunes made in this vicinity, including that of one Frederick Trump, the president’s grandfather. Future pioneers of Hollywood, such as the actor-director William Desmond Taylor and the theater entrepreneurs Alexander Pantages and Sid Grauman, somehow got their starts in this remote locale. As silent motion pictures became a worldwide attraction, Dawson City became the end of the line for film distribution routes. And after a given picture’s run, individual distributors balked at paying for return shipment. The town inadvertently came to house a huge film library, which was eventually sent floating down the Yukon. Except, that is, for a portion that was buried, for an unusual and arguably hilarious reason. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Must-see TV.” Americans across the nation watched the live broadcast of James Comey, the fired F.B.I. director, testifying at an extraordinary Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Above, Times Square. Mr. Comey accused President Trump of lying and trying to derail the inquiry into his former adviser, Michael Flynn, squarely raising the question of whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. Here are the highlights of the hearing, and the video and transcript. _____ 2. President Trump’s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, above, shot back that Mr. Trump had never tried to end the Flynn investigation. He denied that Mr. Trump ever sought a loyalty pledge from Mr. Comey, as we had reported. "
"Two topically daring, emotionally moving and wholly original shows, “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Come From Away,” are locked in an unusually tight race for the sought-after prize of best new musical in this year’s Tony Awards, with just hours to go before the deadline for 839 theater industry insiders to submit their ballots. During the past few days, The New York Times interviewed 67 Tony voters about their ballots. Here’s what we learned: There is an apparent consensus about the season’s four best performances (Kevin Kline and Bette Midler, in particular, can write their acceptance speeches now), as well as the season’s best revivals (12 years after his death, August Wilson’s stature is growing ever-stronger). But Tony voters are deeply divided about the season’s new work, with the race for best new play, as well as the one for best new musical, far too close to call. The Tonys, formally named the Antoinette Perry Awards and presented by the American Theater Wing and the Broadway League, are the biggest event of the Broadway season — the night when the industry honors the best work presented in the 41 theaters in and around Times Square, each with at least 500 seats, that make up Broadway. Voters have until 6 p.m. on Friday to submit their ballots; the ceremony begins at 8 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, and most of it will be broadcast on CBS. (Some design and writing categories are awarded off air during commercial breaks.) The voters we interviewed, with a promise of anonymity for discussion of their secret ballots, were evenly divided between “Dear Evan Hansen,” which many called heart-wrenching but some found morally off-putting, and “Come From Away,” which many declared inspiring but some said was treacly. The dead heat makes this year’s Tony Awards strikingly different from last year’s, when the universally acclaimed “Hamilton” swept the awards as well as the box office. Both of this year’s top contenders are unlikely subjects for musical theater: “Dear Evan Hansen,” by Steven Levenson, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, is a fictive story about a high school student with social anxiety whose life improves when he pretends to have been friendly with a classmate who killed himself, while “Come From Away,” by David Hein and Irene Sankoff, is a true story about the encounter between small-town Canadians and thousands of airline passengers when 38 planes were diverted to Gander, Newfoundland, during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

"As I listened to James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, tell the Senate Intelligence Committee about his personal meetings and phone calls with President Trump, I was reminded of something: the experience of a woman being harassed by her powerful, predatory boss. There was precisely that sinister air of coercion, of an employee helpless to avoid unsavory contact with an employer who is trying to grab what he wants. After reading Mr. Comey’s earlier statement, I tweeted about this Wednesday night, and immediately heard from other women who had seen that narrative emerge. How recognizable it was that Mr. Comey was “stunned” to find himself in these potentially compromising positions. His incredulity, mixed with President Trump’s circling attempts to get his way, were poignant. For a woman who has spent a lifetime wrestling with situations where men have power they can abuse, this was disturbingly familiar. On Jan. 27, Mr. Comey received a last-minute dinner invitation from the president, and then learned it would be “just the two of us.” On Thursday, Mr. Comey revealed that he had had to break a date with his wife in order to dine with Mr. Trump. Already, something about this “setup” made him “uneasy.” The central business of this intimate dinner was Mr. Trump’s insistence: “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” Mr. Comey immediately recognized that this was a press for something he did not want to give. He froze: “I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed.” That reaction — the choice of stillness, responses calculated to neither encourage nor offend that characterized so many of his dealings with Mr. Trump — is so relatable for any woman. During his testimony, Mr. Comey was asked why he had not responded more robustly, why he had not told Mr. Trump that he, the president, was acting inappropriately or reported his behavior immediately to others in authority. Mr. Comey expressed regret that he had not been “stronger” about it, but explained that it was all he could do to focus on not saying the wrong thing. In other words, he wanted to avoid granting any favor while avoiding the risk of direct confrontation — a problem so deeply resonant for women. "
“Every day when you wake up and see the news you feel like you’re in a kind of nightmare.” 
"James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, on Thursday disputed an article that appeared in February in The New York Times about contacts between President Trump’s advisers and Russian intelligence officials. Answering a question about the Times article during an appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Comey said that “in the main, it was not true.” The article was the first to reveal direct contacts between Trump advisers and Russian officials before the election — contacts that are now at the heart of F.B.I. and congressional investigations. Multiple news outlets have since published accounts that support the main elements of The Times’s article, including information about phone calls and in-person meetings between Mr. Trump’s advisers and Russians, some believed to be connected to Russian intelligence. Mr. Comey did not say exactly what he believed was incorrect about the article, which was based on information from four current and former American officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was classified. The original sources could not immediately be reached after Mr. Comey’s remarks, but in the months since the article was published, they have indicated that they believed the account was solid. One possible area of dispute is the description of the Russians involved. Some law enforcement officials took issue with the Times account in the days after it was published, saying that the intelligence was still murky, and that the Russians who were in contact with Mr. Trump’s advisers did not meet the F.B.I.’s black-and-white standard of who can be considered an “intelligence officer.” "
"In recent weeks, some have suggested that President Trump’s controversial interactions with James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, did not constitute wrongdoing. As an ex-criminal defense lawyer and a former federal corruption prosecutor, now joined together as government watchdogs, we beg to differ. Mr. Comey’s sworn statement and answers before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee now provide strong evidence that President Trump committed obstruction of justice. But we have miles to go before that case is legally resolved one way or the other — if it ever is. The crime of obstruction requires an attempt to block an investigation with corrupt intent. Mr. Comey has now given us direct witness testimony of obstruction by the president in the form of the already famous statement “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” Mr. Comey repeatedly added in today’s questioning that “I took it as a direction” that “this is what he wants me to do.” In a system governed by the rule of law, shutting down an investigation to benefit a friend — or perhaps, to keep damaging information that friend may know from emerging — is corrupt. Importantly, Mr. Comey also confirmed the existence of an open investigation at the time of Mr. Trump’s statement — a legal predicate for an obstruction offense. And he added detail to the obstruction pattern that began with President Trump’s demand for “loyalty” and culminated in Mr. Comey’s firing and events immediately thereafter. After the past 24 hours, there can no longer be any doubt that President Trump should be investigated for obstruction. Indeed, Mr. Comey suggested that such an investigation may already have begun: “That’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work toward, to try and understand what the intention was there and whether that’s an offense.” Mr. Comey’s testimony also further undercuts the claim by some commentators that the law was not violated because there was no “proceeding” for President Trump to obstruct. F.B.I. investigations are proceedings, and a number of courts have found them to be so in the obstruction context, though the matter is not fully settled. The bureau is also working in connection with a grand jury investigation, as is common in major criminal matters, and the law is crystal clear that obstruction of a grand jury is a crime, as is obstruction of congressional proceedings like the one here. It also doesn’t make sense to suggest that Mr. Trump’s unquestioned legal right to fire Mr. Comey allows him to do so corruptly. Mr. Trump could not, for example, take a bribe from Vladimir Putin to fire Mr. Comey; neither can he do so to benefit a friend or protect himself. But strong initial evidence is not the same as a slam-dunk case, and Mr. Comey’s testimony also made clear how far we have to go before the question is definitively resolved. Under probing questioning, with much less senatorial filibustering than is usual, Mr. Comey began answering the many questions that Congress and the special counsel will be grappling with for some time to come. He had to explain how he could be positive the president was giving him a direction (he conceded that was his interpretation). He had to justify why he didn’t tell the president the Flynn request was wrong (he was “stunned”). At one point, Mr. Comey even forgot the exact words the president said to him about Mr. Flynn. "
"Chris Christie, a native son of Newark and the governor of New Jersey, suggested on Wednesday that President Trump’s remarks to his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, including demands of loyalty, were “normal New York City conversation.” On Thursday, New Yorkers of various stripes begged to differ. “I couldn’t imagine what normal is to him,” said Rodney Sterling, 29, eating lunch in Flatbush-Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. In the experience of Mr. Sterling, who is a chef, a normal New York City conversation is “always complaints.” His lunch companion, Nicole Boonjakuakul, corrected him: “I’ve seen conversations where they’re commiserating.” Normal conversation here, as most New Yorkers know, consists of a garbled public address message that “downtown local trains are making express stops on the local track; for bypassed stations take the uptown express train making local stops on the express track,” followed by unprintable language, followed by someone yelling, “What time is it?” and his friends yelling “It’s show time!” followed by someone saying, “Are you getting a signal?” If a panhandler says, “This isn’t Congress, people, you can pass a bill,” that’s a normal New York City conversation.
