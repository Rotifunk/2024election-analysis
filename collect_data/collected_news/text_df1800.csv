"To the Editor: As an old white guy, I would like to offer the 13 old white guys (and one woman, added later after an outcry) charged with developing the Senate’s legislative response to the American Health Care Act a sure-to-please plan for success. First, hold a very serious news conference to announce your intent to fix the House bill. Be sure to mention that you will pay particular attention to women’s health care issues. Next hold a series of meetings — in private, of course — to review the House bill. Then, hold a series of very collegial public meetings with various groups of stakeholders, including doctors, nurses, patients, insurance industry executives and drug companies. Ask simple questions and appear to listen intently and with empathy to the answers. Finally, disappear for several months. Leak a few pithy quotes about progress. Finally, with great hoopla, roll out the new Senate American Health Care Act, which will bear an uncanny resemblance to Obamacare, but with at least a few of the problem areas revised and improved. Give the House lots of credit for putting you on the path to a better plan. Most important, praise President Trump for insisting that the plan preserve all of the things he said it should preserve. I’m betting that this just might work. RICHARD GREEN, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: While your coverage of the American Health Care Act has been thorough and informative, significant risks are associated with public awareness of this bill. Side effects may include headache, anxiety, upset stomach, tremors, palpitations, nausea, dry mouth, disgust, anger, sadness, panic and insomnia. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away. Then call your senators daily to defend the health care access that all Americans deserve. SARAH SQUIRE

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • More details emerged about the Manchester bombing. Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old who died during his attack on Monday that killed 22 people, was a soccer fan who smoked pot and had recently dropped out of school. Last month, he went to Libya to see his parents, and may have visited Syria. The British police are hunting for what they called his “network.” Four men were arrested on Wednesday, including Mr. Abedi’s older brother. Preliminary evidence revealed that Mr. Abedi carried a powerful bomb in a metal container concealed either within a vest or backpack, and held a detonator in hand. Here’s the latest information from Manchester, and a look at the homeless men who became heroes and the parents who were victims. "
"As two would-be Republican challengers to Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York addressed dozens of Republican Party members and well-heeled donors at a political club in Midtown Manhattan, the specter of President Trump loomed large, in every sense. Official portraits of Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, were projected on the wall, the two-story-high images sandwiching the two candidates, Paul J. Massey Jr. and Nicole Malliotakis. For Ms. Malliotakis, an assemblywoman and a late entrant into the mayoral contest, the scene on Monday night embodied her biggest challenge: to distance herself from Mr. Trump — for whom she voted — and appeal to moderate Democratic voters while sticking to her aggressive opposition to Mr. de Blasio’s policies on immigration and public safety. “I want to be judged for me,” she said after the event, in which she emphasized her middle-class roots and tried to draw a contrast with Mr. Massey, a millionaire real estate sales executive who has shown a prodigious ability to raise money. Ms. Malliotakis, 36, has positioned herself as the antithesis to Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat she accuses of neglecting average New Yorkers and letting quality of life deteriorate in the city, and as a more formidable candidate than Mr. Massey, who she has suggested is bland and less capable of courting Democrats in a general election. For any Republican to win, he or she would need a considerable number of city voters to cross party lines, given that Democrats hold a six-to-one registration advantage. “I’m somebody who the Republican Party has never offered before,” she said on Monday, citing her personal biography as a product of Staten Island public schools and the daughter of a Cuban mother and a Greek father.

"At our best, being a great nation has always meant a commitment to building a better, safer world — not just for ourselves, but for our children and grandchildren. This has meant leading the world in advancing the cause of peace, responding when disease and disaster strike, lifting millions out of poverty and inspiring those yearning for freedom. This calling is under threat. The administration’s proposal, announced Tuesday, to slash approximately 30 percent from the State Department and foreign assistance budget signals an American retreat, leaving a vacuum that would make us far less safe and prosperous. While it may sound penny-wise, it is pound-foolish. This proposal would bring resources for our civilian forces to a third of what we spent at the height of Ronald Reagan’s “peace through strength” years, as a percentage of the gross domestic product. It would be internationally irresponsible, distressing our friends, encouraging our enemies and undermining our own economic and national security interests. The idea that putting Americans “first” requires a withdrawal from the world is simply wrongheaded, because a retreat would achieve exactly the opposite for our citizens. I learned that lesson the hard way when I became secretary of state after a decade of budget cuts that hollowed out our civilian foreign policy tools. Many had assumed the Cold War’s end would allow us to retreat from the world, but cuts that may have looked logical at the time came back to haunt us as tensions rose in the Middle East, Africa, the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere. Confronting such challenges requires not just a military that is second to none, but also well-resourced, effective and empowered diplomats and aid workers. Indeed, we’re strongest when the face of America isn’t only a soldier carrying a gun but also a diplomat negotiating peace, a Peace Corps volunteer bringing clean water to a village or a relief worker stepping off a cargo plane as floodwaters rise. While I am all for reviewing, reforming and strengthening the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, proposals to zero out economic and development assistance in more than 35 countries would effectively lower our flag at our outposts around the world and make us far less safe. "
"The United Nations said on Wednesday that the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts would “simply make it impossible” for the global organization to maintain essential operations. The statement, by a United Nations spokesman, added to the growing criticism of a budget submission for the 2018 fiscal year that would reduce funding of the State Department by roughly a third and cut foreign assistance by about 29 percent. The spending proposal, which was released on Tuesday, would reduce American financial support for the United Nations, including for its peacekeeping operations and international aid programs. The United States is the organization’s biggest single donor. “The figures presented would simply make it impossible for the U.N. to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance,” Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for Secretary General António Guterres, said in response to queries about the budget proposal. Republicans and Democrats have criticized the proposed budget’s cuts to foreign assistance, saying that such reductions would undercut national security and send the wrong message about American generosity as humanitarian crises are escalating in the Middle East and Africa. The United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, has said the United States wants the United Nations to use American taxpayer money more efficiently. But she has also expressed opposition to what she has called a slash-and-burn approach to budget reductions and has suggested that final allocations will not be as austere as what has been proposed. “I was a governor; I had to do an executive budget,” Ms. Haley said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal during a visit to the Middle East this week. “What an executive budget is is the start of a conversation.” Mr. Dujarric acknowledged that the “budgetary process in the U.S. is complex and lengthy, and it needs to be completed.” He also said, “We are indeed very grateful for the support the United States has given to the United Nations over the years as the organization’s largest financial contributor.” The United States contributes 22 percent of the United Nations’ core operating budget of $5.4 billion. That share is set by an international agreement and is based on the size of the American economy. The United States has also been a leading provider of aid to United Nations organizations that rely on voluntary contributions. Twenty-eight percent of the United Nations’ peacekeeping budget of nearly $8 billion has been paid by the United States. The Trump administration’s budget proposal would reduce the American portion to about 25 percent. "
"As Donald J. Trump prepared to assume the presidency, he unveiled an ethics plan promising that his company would donate to the United States Treasury “all profits” from foreign government patronage of his hotels. Several months later, the Trump Organization is finding that pledge daunting to keep. The company told Congress in a recent submission that it was all but impossible to identify every foreign government official who walked through the doors of its hotels. And investigating all its patrons, the organization argued, would interfere with its business and ask too much of customers. “To fully and completely identify all patronage at our properties by customer type is impractical in the service industry,” the company wrote in a nine-page pamphlet outlining its policy. “Putting forth a policy that requires all guests to identify themselves would impede upon personal privacy and diminish the guest experience of our brand.” The Trump Organization shared the document this month with members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in response to a request for information about how the policy would be put into effect. The committee’s top Democrat, Elijah E. Cummings, released the document publicly on Wednesday, along with a letter to the Trump Organization in which he said he had “grave concerns” about the policy, and “deficiencies in this approach are obvious.” The public disclosure of the document has now set off new questions about whether the president could potentially run afoul of a provision in the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause, which essentially prohibits federal government officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments. The clause has become a cudgel for Mr. Trump’s critics, who argue that the presidency of a businessman raises a host of potential conflicts of interest, leading some groups to sue. “Complying with the United States Constitution is not an optional exercise, but a requirement for serving as our nation’s president,” Mr. Cummings wrote in a letter to George Sorial, the Trump Organization’s chief compliance counsel. “If President Trump believes that identifying all of the prohibited foreign emoluments he is currently receiving would be too challenging or would harm his business ventures, his options are to divest his ownership or submit a proposal to Congress to ask for our consent.” "
"Phony math is a time-honored tradition in the Washington world of budget making, but the first full fiscal plan from the Trump administration breaks new ground. The bottom line: A budget that the White House says will be in balance by 2027 would, in reality, remain deeply in red ink throughout the coming decade and ultimately add trillions of dollars to the national debt. Of course, as John Maynard Keynes wrote, in the long run, we are all dead. But this budget will also inflict enormous short-term damage. While the administration asserts that if the government would just get out of the way, business investment and worker productivity would rise substantially, I don’t buy the argument. Indeed, the proposed enormous cuts to spending would make increasing efficiency harder, not easier. The impact of even more staggering reductions in social welfare spending will hurt millions of needy Americans, perhaps many of the same voters who elected President Trump, as the wealthy receive a vast preponderance of the benefits from a proposed $5.5 trillion in tax reductions (none of which is accounted for in the proposal). All in all, the Office of Management and Budget has bestowed upon us 62 pages of fantasy. Let’s take, for example, the White House’s insistence that the economic-growth forecast of 2.2 percent a year that the O.M.B. had been using can be turbocharged by nearly a full percentage point to 3 percent by 2021. That indeed would be wonderful, but every mainstream economist I know says it ain’t going to happen. For example, the Congressional Budget Office, the legislative branch’s scorekeeper and — despite what you might have heard — an honest broker, projects annual growth of 1.9 percent. "
"To the Editor: Re “Budget Proposal Curtails Efforts Against Poverty” (front page, May 22): President Trump has presented a budget that will decimate social services such as health care and food stamps in order to lower taxes, principally for people who can well afford to pay them. To him, making America great evidently means trampling millions of its citizens into the dust. In the early 1950s, the highest tax bracket was 91 percent. As a nation, we seemed to grasp the idea that part of the American dream was that everyone was entitled to a piece of the pie, and an equitable society was a happy one. Today, the richest among us pay less than half that rate, and conservative Republicans have persuaded the average American that “entitlement” is a dirty word and taxes are a way of picking their pockets. Have we really degenerated into a nation so lacking in compassion and mercy that those of us who have more than we need are no longer willing to extend a hand to those who don’t have enough? How have we so quickly turned away from President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s optimistic New Deal for all Americans to President Trump’s mean and miserly Raw Deal for all but the top 1 percent? LOUISE T. GUINTHER
FOREST HILLS, QUEENS To the Editor: “Cuts, Hurtful to the Poor, Spare Many Older People” (news article, May 23) refers to “unprecedented cuts to programs for poor and working-class families, effectively pitting them against older Americans who would largely escape the budget ax.” The budget proposes massive cuts in the Medicaid program. While Medicaid is viewed as a program providing health insurance for poor folks, it’s important to realize that two-thirds of people in nursing homes rely primarily on Medicaid. Thus a more accurate portrayal of the administration’s budget proposal would be “the Trump budget ax bludgeons the poor, working class, disabled and the elderly.” "
"WASHINGTON — A bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act that narrowly passed the House this month would leave 14 million more people uninsured next year than under President Barack Obama’s health law — and 23 million more in 2026, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday. Some of the nation’s sickest would pay much more for health care. Under the House bill, the number of uninsured would be slightly lower, but deficits would be somewhat higher, than the budget office estimated before Republican leaders made a series of changes to win enough votes for passage. Beneath the headline-grabbing numbers, those legislative tweaks would bring huge changes to the American health care system. In many states, insurance costs could soar for consumers who are sick or have pre-existing conditions, while premiums would fall for the healthy, the new estimate concludes. The forecast by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Capitol Hill’s official scorekeeper, is another potential blow to efforts to undo Mr. Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Republican senators have said they will make substantial changes to the measure passed by the House, but even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, sounds uncertain about his chances of finding a majority to repeal and replace the health law. “I don’t know how we get to 50 at the moment,” Mr. McConnell told Reuters on Wednesday. “But that’s the goal.” "
"To many American Jews, it is a truism that Barack Obama was the anti-Israel president. It was Mr. Obama who signed the Iran deal, which Israel portrayed as a mortal danger. It was Mr. Obama whose most contentious relationship with a foreign leader was with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And it was Mr. Obama who made outreach to the Muslim world a centerpiece of his presidency, while putting more than a little daylight between Washington and Jerusalem. All this means that President Trump still enjoys a deep well of support among many pro-Israel voters, Jewish and otherwise, who see him as an antidote to all things Obama. Mr. Trump may be a boor, goes the logic, but didn’t he promise to tear up the Iran deal? Wouldn’t the man who called himself Israel’s “biggest friend” finally move the United States embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem? And wouldn’t the straight-talker buck the stalemated peace process and acknowledge the truth about the conflict — namely, that Palestinian recalcitrance, not settlements, is the real obstacle to peace? To paraphrase the country singer Toby Keith: How do you like him now? That’s a question that Mr. Trump’s pro-Israel supporters ought to begin asking themselves in the wake of the president’s visit this week to Jerusalem. On the plus side: an exceptionally warm and well-received speech by the president at the Israel Museum; a call for the Palestinian Authority to stop funding the families of terrorists; and a reaffirmation of the ancient Jewish connection to the land and of the enduring American commitment to the modern state. Then there was the substance. "
"WASHINGTON — American spies collected information last summer revealing that senior Russian intelligence and political officials were discussing how to exert influence over Donald J. Trump through his advisers, according to three current and former American officials familiar with the intelligence. The conversations focused on Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman at the time, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who was advising Mr. Trump, the officials said. Both men had indirect ties to Russian officials, who appeared confident that each could be used to help shape Mr. Trump’s opinions on Russia. Some Russians boasted about how well they knew Mr. Flynn. Others discussed leveraging their ties to Viktor F. Yanukovych, the deposed president of Ukraine living in exile in Russia, who at one time had worked closely with Mr. Manafort. The intelligence was among the clues — which also included information about direct communications between Mr. Trump’s advisers and Russian officials — that American officials received last year as they began investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates were assisting Moscow in the effort. Details of the conversations, some of which have not been previously reported, add to an increasing understanding of the alarm inside the American government last year about the Russian disruption campaign. The information collected last summer was considered credible enough for intelligence agencies to pass to the F.B.I., which during that period opened a counterintelligence investigation that is continuing. It is unclear, however, whether Russian officials actually tried to directly influence Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Both have denied any collusion with the Russian government on the campaign to disrupt the election. John O. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., testified Tuesday about a tense period last year when he came to believe that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was trying to steer the outcome of the election. He said he saw intelligence suggesting that Russia wanted to use Trump campaign officials, wittingly or not, to help in that effort. He spoke vaguely about contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, without giving names, saying they “raised questions in my mind about whether Russia was able to gain the cooperation of those individuals.” "
"To the Editor: You report that for the Trump entourage’s meeting with Pope Francis, Melania Trump, the first lady, was “wearing a black dress and with her hair covered by a veil,” and Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, was “also wearing a veil over her hair and in a black dress with lace hem and pearls” (nytimes.com, May 24). What’s fascinating about that is that just a few days earlier the same two women made a point of not wearing head coverings in Saudi Arabia, where it is customary for women to do so (news article, May 23). But in accordance with Vatican protocol, they chose to cover their hair. This is yet another example, however subtle, of the tone-deafness of President Trump and his advisers. The sartorial choices of these two women may seem like an insignificant matter, but gestures matter on the world stage. If I picked up on it, you can bet that all across the Muslim world people are nodding to themselves thinking: “You see? He really doesn’t respect us.” PAUL SCHWARTZ, UPPER NYACK, N.Y. "
"The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the House health care bill is a devastating indictment. The new report shows that millions of Americans would lose health insurance and the quality of insurance for millions more would deteriorate. The savings from that carnage — to borrow a favorite word of President Trump’s — would pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. And yet the immediate reaction to the C.B.O. report also shows why you should be worried that the Senate will nonetheless decide to pass a version of the House bill. Here’s what I mean: Much of this initial reaction has missed the point. It has focused on the modest differences between the new C.B.O. report, which analyzed the final House bill, and a C.B.O. analysis from March of an earlier version of the bill. Among the differences, the final bill would deprive an estimated 23 million people of insurance, compared with the 24 million in the March analysis. Don’t be distracted by these small differences. Distraction is a tactic of the politicians who are trying to take away health insurance from people. These politicians can’t sell their proposals on the merits. That’s why both the House and, thus far, the Senate have refused to hold any hearings. They know that virtually every expert across the ideological spectrum — including groups representing doctors, nurses, hospitals, patients and senior citizens — opposes the bill. "
"WASHINGTON — The Transportation Security Administration is testing new procedures at nearly a dozen American airports that will require passengers to place electronic items larger than a cellphone in a separate bin for X-ray screening, the agency announced on Wednesday. The new screening tests are part of heightened security at airports around the world amid fears that terrorist groups are developing plans to attack flights heading to the United States or Europe. In March, American and British officials announced a ban on electronic items larger than a cellphone aboard certain direct inbound flights after intelligence reports surfaced showing that the Islamic State had developed, or would soon be able to develop, the technology to build a bomb that could be hidden in a laptop. That ban applied to 10 predominantly Muslim countries stretching from North Africa to the Middle East, including some airports in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. A similar ban is under consideration for inbound flights from Europe, Homeland Security Department officials said. There is no timetable for a final decision on the expanded ban, said David Lapan, a spokesman for the department. Passengers at the airports where the tests are occurring are being asked to place items like e-readers and tablets in a separate bin, similar to the way laptops are screened. Officials said the new screening procedures had been in the works for nearly two years and were not in response to an imminent threat, but rather part of continuing counterterrorism efforts. “T.S.A.’s top priority is to protect the traveling public, and every policy and security procedure in place is designed to mitigate threats to passengers and the aviation sector — which we know our adversaries continue to target,” said Darby LaJoye, the transportation agency’s assistant administrator for security operations. Officials said that while the new screening would lead to more bag checks, the agency was testing quicker and more targeted procedures that should keep security lines from becoming backed up. The screening will not apply to all lanes at the airports and will not be used for PreCheck, the expedited screening lanes, officials said. T.S.A. officers will be available in front of X-ray machines to guide passengers through the screening process and advise what items will need to be removed from carry-on baggage and placed in a bin for separate X-ray screening, the agency said. The agency said it had no immediate plans to roll out the new screening procedures at all airports. The test locations include airports of varying sizes, the agency said. Among them are midsize airports in Colorado Springs and Boise, Idaho, as well as Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport in Texas. Larger airports include Detroit Metropolitan; Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International in Florida; Logan International in Boston; Los Angeles International; Luis Muñoz Marín International in San Juan, P.R.; and McCarran International in Las Vegas.

"After the bombing in Manchester, England, this week that killed 22, internet users and publishers have spread rumors and hoaxes, and miscast blame. How much of this false information is intentional trickery or well-meaning confusion is difficult to know. But below we look at some themes of misinformation, along with context and sourcing to verifiable information. Prominent defenders of President Trump are arguing that the Manchester attack would have been prevented by a travel ban, but neither of the two executive orders barring immigration from Muslim countries would have applied to the 22-year-old who carried out the attack, Salman Abedi, who was born in Britain and held a British passport. Last month Mr. Abedi visited Libya, one of the countries targeted in Mr. Trump’s executive orders, which barred foreign nationals from six nations (the first version included a seventh, Iraq) from entering the United States. But the orders did not apply to United States citizens, nor did they prohibit Americans from traveling to or from Libya or the other targeted countries. And, of course, Mr. Abedi is a British national. So even if Britain had enacted the same policies, Mr. Abedi’s visit to Libya would not have been prevented. "

Three of our Washington reporters found a major reason for the alarm bells about Russian election meddling. Months before the election, officials told them, U.S. agents learned that top Russian officials were strategizing about how to exert influence over Donald Trump through his advisers. The effort focused on Paul Manafort, above, who was Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman at the time, and Michael Flynn. Mr. Flynn is coming under sharply increased pressure to provide lawmakers with documents related to his Russia contacts. _____ "
"Several things have been credited with driving Stephen Colbert’s recent ratings surge: liberals craving a safe space, a backlash to his rival Jimmy Fallon’s hair tousle of Donald J. Trump, and Mr. Colbert simply being more comfortable as the host of his late-night show on CBS. But when the September-to-May TV season ends on Wednesday night, Mr. Colbert will be the victor in total viewers over Mr. Fallon because of an unlikely reason: the DVR. Mr. Colbert’s remarkable comeback is one of the biggest stories in TV, and it is the first time in 22 years that CBS will best NBC in the time slot other than 2010, when Conan O’Brien was removed from “The Tonight Show” in favor of a return to Jay Leno. And though Mr. Colbert has been winning in total viewers on an almost nightly basis for some time — he’s had more total viewers than Mr. Fallon for 16 consecutive weeks — those victories alone would not have been enough to narrow the enormous deficit he faced over all just a few months ago. Nielsen’s season-to-date data includes seven days of delayed viewing, and it is there where Mr. Colbert has made up tremendous ground on Mr. Fallon, racking up big numbers in an area where nightly network talk shows are usually not a factor. Viewers are fine with catching up on a scripted comedy or drama a week after it originally aired, but who wants to watch Monday night’s talk show on a Friday when most of the jokes will have gone stale? Primetime shows often depend on significant DVR and on-demand views to goose their numbers. The top-rated show in broadcast, “The Big Bang Theory,” sees its ratings jump 35 percent when seven days of delayed viewing is factored in. Advertisers examine three-day and seven-day delayed data when considering how much to pay for commercial time on a show. "
"In promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, many Republicans cited headlines from last year such as “Obamacare Premiums to Soar 22 Percent” and “As Obamacare Choices Dwindle, Feds Face Consumer, Political Backlash.” Yet based on a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, headlines would be even worse under the health care bill to repeal Obamacare, which was passed by the House this month. If the Senate makes this flawed bill law, Republicans will have the chance to watch, all the way up to the midterm elections, as Americans pay higher premiums and lose coverage. By the time the bill’s full changes went into effect in 2020, many of those who voted for it could be long gone. Here are the types of headlines Republicans can expect. “Trumpcare Premiums to Soar by 26 Percent.” The Trump administration will release average premium increases in late October, before the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1. The C.B.O. estimated that the new health care bill would add an average of about 20 percent to individual market premiums next year, on top of the projected 6.5 percent annual increase under the current law. “60-Year-Olds to Pay Over 50 Percent More Under Trumpcare.” The new bill would let insurers charge older Americans five times more than they charge young adults (up from the three times more allowed under Obamacare) and decrease their tax credits starting in 2018. This means that certain older enrollees’ premiums could increase by at least 50 percent if implemented on time. And their insurance will get even more expensive after the credits shrink further starting in 2020. "
"When news began to break on Monday of a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people, including children, internet users turned to Twitter for updates and to vent grief and sympathy. David Leavitt took a different tack. He logged on to Twitter, where he now has more than 60,000 followers, and wrote: “MULTIPLE CONFIRMED FATALITIES at Manchester Arena. The last time I listened to Ariana Grande I almost died too.” He followed up a few minutes later: “Honestly, for over a year I thought an Ariana Grande was something you ordered at Starbucks.” The response was swift, widespread and almost uniformly one of disgust. “Your friends and family are ashamed of you right now,” Matt Lucas, the English comedian with 950,000 Twitter followers, posted in reply.“I actually think that shared contempt for you might turn out to be the truly bipartisan issue that starts the national healing process,” remarked another Twitter user.

"LONDON — I come from Manchester. I went to school there; I attended countless music gigs in the city. I have a teenage daughter who is just beginning to attend gigs herself. So of all the terror attacks of recent years, the suicide bombing of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on Monday night, a concert filled largely with teenage fans, cut to my heart in a particularly distressing way. Many parents must be feeling the same way. Every terror attack is barbarous. To set out deliberately to inflict mass murder upon a group of children is truly unconscionable. The Islamic State statement claiming responsibility for the attack boasted of “placing explosive devices in the midst of the gatherings of Crusaders.” It would seem surreally absurd were it not so painfully raw. Terrorist groups in the past, such as the Irish Republican Army, which bombed Manchester’s main shopping center in 1996, used terror as a means to a political end. Not so with today’s jihadists. For them, terror is an end in itself, whose sole aim is to inflict pain and instill fear. What else was the Manchester attack? I have written before about the increasingly blurred lines between ideological violence and sociopathic rage. There is now what we might call a “jihadi state of mind,” in which some mixture of social disengagement, moral dissolution, unleavened misanthropy and inchoate rage drives some to see the most abhorrent expressions of violence as a kind of revolt. It is a state of mind that finds its most vicious, barbaric form in Islamist terror. But it’s not only in Islamist terror that it finds expression. Earlier this month, a 20-year-old Briton named Damon Smith was found guilty of planting a homemade bomb filled with ball bearings on a London Underground train. Police discovered in his flat shredded pages of an article from the Qaeda-linked magazine Inspire, “Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.” Yet there was nothing to connect Mr. Smith to any extremist network.

"For decades, therapists, patient advocates and countless families have worked to elevate mental health care in the political conversation. Their cause recently received a big boost when a new law created a federal mental health “czar” to help overhaul the system and bridge more than 100 federal agencies concerned with mental health. But the White House’s choice for the first person to fill that position has already been divisive, exposing longstanding rifts within the field that may be difficult to mend. President Trump has announced his intention to nominate Elinore F. McCance-Katz for the new position, assistant secretary for mental health and substance use. Dr. McCance-Katz is a psychiatrist whose long career has been focused on treating drug addiction, in particular opioid abuse. She has the support of several prominent groups, including the American Psychiatric Association and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, but others, including the Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health Care, are skeptical. A central tension in the debate is between the medical model of psychiatry, which emphasizes drug and hospital treatment and which Dr. McCance-Katz has promoted, and the so-called psychosocial, which puts more emphasis on community care and support from family and peers. “I feel like I died and went to heaven,” a prominent backer of the medical approach, Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, associate director of the Stanley Research Institute, said of the new position and Dr. McCance-Katz as its nominee. “I honestly didn’t think I’d see something like this happen in my lifetime.” Dr. Torrey and an organization he co-founded, the Treatment Advocacy Center, has been pushing to expand medical psychiatric services for more than 20 years. But Harvey Rosenthal, executive director of the New York Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services, which is funded in small part by Samhsa, said he was concerned about the potential direction the appointment of Dr. McCance-Katz could signal. “I fear that in this political environment it could denigrate and unravel some of the great progress we’ve made in person-centered recovery and rehabilitation services and peer support.” "
"ALBANY — The call for a breakaway faction of Democrats in the State Senate to abandon its Republican allies and rejoin the party’s fold picked up a surprising supporter on Wednesday: Senator Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat who also sides with the Republicans. Mr. Felder sent a letter urging Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the faction, the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference, to “unconditionally and publicly rejoin the Democrats.” The letter, dated Wednesday, was all the more striking because it came from Mr. Felder, who, within days of being elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 2012, declared that he would caucus with the Republicans. It was unclear whether Mr. Felder’s call for the Independent Democratic Conference to reunite with the mainline Democrats would mean that he, too, would consider leaving the Republican conference. But his letter articulated a frustration with the tactics of the Independent Democratic Conference, which has grown in size and influence in recent months. “Who are you to decide what the legislative priorities are for loyal Democrats across New York State?” Mr. Felder wrote, urging Mr. Klein to “unify with your Democrat colleagues and not just highlight a handful of issues that attempt to distinguish you from the Republican conference.” Mr. Felder’s letter may further complicate the perplexing political calculus in the Senate, which has been the scene of high drama in the last decade and simmering tension during the tenure of Gov.

"BEIJING — A United States Navy warship sailed within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island claimed by China in the South China Sea on Wednesday, an operation that showed a new firmness by the Trump administration in its dealings with Beijing. The warship, the guided missile destroyer Dewey, passed near Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, not far from the Philippines, American military officials said. The operation may tamp down concerns among allies of the United States that the Trump administration has been unwilling to confront China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea as it seeks Beijing’s cooperation on issues like halting North Korea’s nuclear program. Until the operation on Wednesday, the Pentagon had turned down requests from the United States Pacific Command in Hawaii, under the command of Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., for such maneuvers. It was the first freedom of navigation operation since President Trump took office. The United States does not recognize China’s claims of sovereignty over the 12 nautical miles surrounding the artificial islands, the conventional limit for territorial waters. A Pentagon official involved in the operation said the American warship did a “man overboard” rescue drill while passing by the island. The particular exercise was intended to show China that the United States would operate anywhere on the high seas in accordance with international law, the official said. "
"JERUSALEM — Three old men who are better known for being young men stood on Wednesday morning where they had 50 years earlier: in Jerusalem’s Old City, at the limestone retaining wall that is one of the holiest places for Jews. In a moment frozen in a famous photo, the three men, who were among the paratroopers who had pushed through Jerusalem until they stood at the Western Wall itself in 1967, looked up in awe at a holy site that had been barred to Jews for almost two decades. “We will never give back Jerusalem,” one of the three, Zion Karasenti, now 74, said as the anniversary arrived Wednesday, at 10:08 a.m. “If they have to capture it again, we will be in the front line.” This year marks half a century since the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, in which Israel defied annihilation by its Arab neighbors and also came to rule over Palestinian Arabs in captured areas, including in the Old City. Predictably, there is profound disagreement over what the anniversary means, and even over the date: Wednesday was exactly 50 years since the Western Wall’s capture from Jordan, along with the rest of the Old City, but by the Jewish lunar calendar. The date on a standard calendar is June 7, 1967. The anniversary has been celebrated as a seminal modern moment for Jews, their return to rule over a united Jerusalem for the first time in about 2,000 years. But in recent years, the day itself has become favored more by the religious right. On Wednesday, as they do each year, young nationalist Jews paraded through the Arab Quarter singing and waving flags in front of stone-faced Palestinians, most of whom closed their shops in protest and fear.

"After becoming the first team to secure a series win at Camden Yards this season, Minnesota wanted more. Beating the Baltimore Orioles twice was not good enough for the Twins, who entered Wednesday’s series finale determined to complete a sweep. With a strong pitching performance by Jose Berrios, the Twins, the American League Central leaders, churned out a 4-3 victory. Minnesota’s mind-set after Tuesday’s 2-0 victory was “don’t settle on two,” said the Twins’ Brian Dozier, who added, “From the very first inning, it showed.” Berrios took a two-hitter into the seventh inning, and Kennys Vargas drove in two runs for the Twins, who have won six of seven and are a major-league-best 14-5 on the road. Minnesota bolted to a 4-0 lead and withstood solo home runs by J. J. Hardy, Chris Davis and Jonathan Schoop to complete its fourth sweep of the season — matching its total from all of last season. RED SOX WIN THIRD STRAIGHT Dustin Pedroia waved home the tiebreaking run on a wild pitch and then singled in two more during Boston’s seven-run seventh inning as the Red Sox won their third straight by beating the Texas Rangers, 9-4, at Fenway Park. Boston’s Chris Sale struck out six, falling short in his attempt to become the first pitcher in baseball’s modern era to strike out at least 10 batters in nine straight games in one season. ROCKIES STIFLE THE PHILLIES Tyler Chatwood allowed just one hit in seven scoreless innings, Carlos Gonzalez homered, and the Colorado Rockies beat the Phillies, 7-2, in Philadelphia. Chatwood struck out a season-high eight batters and allowed only a single, by Andrew Knapp in the fifth. "
"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — In a fierce, sometimes personal speech, Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general fired by President Trump for refusing to defend his travel ban, told the graduating class at Harvard Law School on Wednesday that her decision was a surprising but crucial moment when “law and conscience intersected.” Ms. Yates has become a hero to many Democrats for standing up to the president on one of his first and most contentious policy initiatives. Mr. Trump’s supporters regard her as just one of many holdovers from the Obama administration who have publicly and privately tried to sabotage his agenda. Her tenure as acting attorney general was supposed to be uneventful, Ms. Yates said during ceremonies the day before commencement. “Everything was to stay status quo.” Her former chief of staff had jokingly told her there would be time for, in her words, “a lot of long, boozy lunches.” But “the defining moments in our lives often don’t come with advance warning,” she said. “They can arise in scenarios we would have never expected, and don’t come with the luxury of a lot of time for you to go inside yourself for some serious introspection.” She was on her way to the airport to catch a flight home to Atlanta on a Friday in January, she said, when she heard news reports that the president had signed an executive order restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. “This was the first we had even heard of it,” Ms. Yates said of the ban. Within hours, the Justice Department was going to have to defend the executive order in courts around the country. By Monday, she realized that she had to take a position on the order’s constitutionality. "
"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions failed to disclose meetings with Russian officials when he applied for security clearance because he was told not to do so by advisers and the F.B.I., a Justice Department spokesman said Wednesday. Mr. Sessions met with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, at least twice in 2016. But asked on an official government form to note any contact he or family members had with foreign governments or their representatives over the past seven years, Mr. Sessions did not include his encounters with Mr. Kislyak. It is a federal crime to make false statements or withhold relevant information on the background check form. “As a United States senator, the attorney general met hundreds — if not thousands — of foreign dignitaries and their staff,” Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said in a statement. “The attorney general’s staff consulted with those familiar with the process, as well as the F.B.I. investigator handling the background check, and was instructed not to list meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his Senate activities.” Mr. Sessions filled out two such forms, Mr. Prior said, one last July, as he was first formally vetted by the Trump campaign, and one after the election in November. The news, first reported by CNN, renewed questions about Mr. Sessions and the Russia issue. Mr. Sessions, who represented Alabama until his confirmation as the nation’s top law enforcement officer this year, was the first United States senator to endorse Mr. Trump, backing him in February 2016. He recused himself from the Russia inquiry in March, after it was reported he had met with Mr. Kislyak in 2016. Last week, Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, appointed a special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whether Russia colluded with associates of Mr. Trump’s campaign. Democratic lawmakers demanded Mr. Sessions’s resignation on Wednesday. “He’s lied under oath,” Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, wrote on Twitter. “He’s misled on security clearance forms. It’s simple — he should not be the Attorney General.” Mr. Sessions was traveling to Memphis, where he was expected to address law enforcement officers on Thursday morning. "

"How long should it take to write a political play? I don’t mean to ask how speedily it should be written — though if I did, Robert Schenkkan’s “Building the Wall” would surely win a prize. It was drafted, Mr. Schenkkan told The New York Times, in a weeklong “white-hot fury” after the election of President Trump in November, and has already been produced, or will be imminently, at theaters around the country. Here in New York, it opened on Wednesday at New World Stages, where I found it to be slick and dispiriting. But put that aside for a moment. What I really mean to ask is how long it takes for a specific political situation to become ripe for dramatization. Eager critics, and audiences, too, now seem to be asking for a turnaround that all but prohibits introspection. Yet without introspection, how valuable is the result? It is a very rare political work that speaks directly to its time from its time, and also deeply and lastingly. “The Normal Heart” and “Angels in America” come to mind. More typically, the names of actual presidents and the details of their terrible mistakes sit awkwardly in otherwise imaginary accounts of our world. In their all-too-realness, they tear at the fabric of fiction. That’s why expressly political playwrights like Brecht and Shaw often saw fit to set their works in the deep past. During the Hundred Years’ War, say. In “Building the Wall,” Mr. Schenkkan instead takes a current war — the war on immigrants, whether here legally or not — and projects it into the near future. After a terrorist event leaves two square blocks of Times Square “irradiated,” Mr. Trump declares martial law, restricting the press and curtailing civil liberties. Muslims and Mexicans and other suspect groups, regardless of any connection to the attack, are rounded up in containment camps run by private prison companies. When conditions worsen, the camps morph into killing chambers. By the time of the play’s setting, in 2019, this has all ended. Mr. Trump has been impeached and “exiled to Palm Beach.” A former security officer named Rick, one of the men who helped carry out the atrocities, is now in prison, awaiting what may be a death sentence. In an interview with Gloria, a history professor who has offered to tell his story unfiltered, he describes himself, inevitably, as a scapegoat for his employers and the national security apparatus that directed them. If he had resigned instead of carrying out orders, Rick says, “somebody else would have just taken my place.” "
"MISSOULA, Mont. — The Republican candidate in a hotly contested special House election in Montana was charged with assaulting a journalist on Wednesday at what was to be a final rally in Bozeman on the eve of the vote. The attack brought police officers to the event and sent the reporter to the hospital for X-rays. In a statement late on Wednesday, the office of the Gallatin County sheriff, Brian Gootkin, said that there was enough evidence to charge the candidate, Greg Gianforte, with misdemeanor assault. Mr. Gianforte, the Republican candidate for the state’s lone House seat, is scheduled to appear in court before June 7. It was an extraordinary development in a race that was being closely watched for clues about the national political environment in the tumultuous first months of the Trump presidency. In a sign of the considerable Republican frustration with Mr. Gianforte, Speaker Paul D. Ryan publicly scolded the candidate and said he should apologize. Mr. Ryan said that the “physical altercation” was inappropriate and “should not have happened.” “Should the gentleman apologize? Yeah, I think he should apologize,” Mr. Ryan said. “I know he has his own version and I’m sure he’s going to have more to say, but there’s no call for this, no matter what — on any circumstance.” But Mr. Ryan indicated that he would not seek to block Mr. Gianforte from taking office in the event that he wins. Should that happen, Mr. Ryan said, then “he has been chosen by the people of Montana.” "
"ALBANY — There were two special legislative elections in New York on Tuesday, both won by Democrats. The outcome of one was a foregone conclusion, the other an utter surprise — especially given the convincing margin of victory by the Democrat, Christine Pellegrino. Ms. Pellegrino defeated her Republican opponent, Tom Gargiulo, in the Ninth Assembly District on Long Island, 58 percent to 42 percent, even though the district is heavily Republican and President Trump won it with 60 percent of the vote. Political observers are paying close attention to special elections across the nation this year as potential harbingers of what may happen in the midterm contests in 2018. Ms. Pellegrino’s success appears to have drawn that kind of attention, at least in New York. “This sends a strong message to Democrats and Republicans,” said Bill Lipton, the director of the New York Working Families Party, which endorsed her. “To Democrats, it says that they can win in Trump country when they support bold, populist champions who put working people’s issues front and center. “To Republicans,” he continued, “it says Donald Trump is a huge ball and chain around their necks at this moment as more working people see the federal government trying to take away their health care and their rights. The progressive base is fired up.” The result may embolden Democrats in New York to put more money and resources in races across the board, or possibly to encourage neophytes to run. "
"WASHINGTON — After American Navy destroyers fired dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield last month, fears emerged that Russia would respond by cutting off communications designed to prevent unintended confrontations in the skies over Syria, where both countries are conducting air campaigns. More than six weeks later, however, the American and Russian militaries are still using a shared hotline to avoid conflicts involving their air operations over Syria. In fact, the number of calls has been on the rise. “In the pure quantity of phone calls, it increased,” Lt. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, the top American air commander in the Middle East, told Pentagon reporters on Wednesday. This does not signal that American and Russian diplomats are anywhere near agreement on how to end the conflict in Syria or on the future of President Bashar al-Assad. Rather, it indicates that both nations’ military officers are trying to manage the risks of an inadvertent conflict in the increasingly crowded airspace over Syria, which American and allied warplanes have shared with Syrian, Russian, Turkish and Israeli planes. American and Russian officers started talking to each other after the Russian intervention in Syria began in 2015. The two sides do not coordinate strategy, but they have shared information to prevent midair collisions and other problems using a phone line that connects Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the command center of the American-led air war coalition, with the Russian base in Latakia, Syria. The United States used the hotline to alert the Russians shortly before the April 7 attack on an airfield that Syrian planes had used to mount a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 civilians. As many as 100 Russian troops were believed to be at the airfield, though the Americans took pains not to target them, and none were hurt. "
"WASHINGTON — Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, on Wednesday fiercely defended budget plans to spend $1.4 billion on the Trump administration’s expanded school choice agenda, but refused to say whether her office would withhold funds from private schools that discriminate against students. In her first testimony to Congress since a bruising confirmation hearing in January, Ms. DeVos appeared unflappable as she told members of a House Appropriations subcommittee that the budget sought to empower states and parents to make decisions about students’ educations. “We cannot allow any parent to feel their child is trapped in a school that isn’t meeting his or her unique needs,” Ms. DeVos told lawmakers. But Democrats derided the education spending blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year as tone deaf to low-income and working-class Americans. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the panel, called it “cruel” and “inhumane.” The budget plan would eliminate more than 20 education programs and redirect funding to expanding school choice initiatives. Those include a $250 million program to give students publicly funded scholarships to attend private schools. But Ms. DeVos said states, not the Education Department, would decide whether to withhold federal money from private schools that are neither required to serve a diverse pool of students nor held publicly accountable for doing so.

"WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, the committee’s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn’s troubles with Congress. The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel’s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election. “Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. “And I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.” Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess. It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynn’s testimony, or both. The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee. A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Conaway has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of the investigation while it is continuing. "
"ABCD … G? Glencore, a mining and energy giant based in Baar, Switzerland, is hoping to join the ranks of firms that dominate the trading of agricultural products, known as the ABCD companies (Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus). Glencore’s agriculture joint venture, Glencore Agriculture Limited, made an informal takeover approach to one of those companies — Bunge, which is based in White Plains. The offer comes as swaths of the industry are being reshaped by deals: • China National Chemical Corporation, known as ChemChina, is closing in on a $43 billion takeover of Syngenta, the Swiss farm chemical and seed company. • ChemChina is also said to be in talks to merge with Sinochem, a fellow Chinese state-owned chemicals company, in a deal that would create the world’s biggest industrial chemicals entity, according to Reuters and The Financial Times. Reuters cited people with knowledge of the negotiations and The Financial Times cited several unnamed senior bankers in Asia. • Dow Chemicals and DuPont are working to close their merger. • Bayer is trying to complete its takeover of Monsanto. Glencore, which merged with its rival Xstrata in 2013, has been hit by a slump in commodity prices, and it sold a stake in its agriculture business to Canadian pension funds to enhance its ability to pursue acquisitions.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. President Trump’s first budget has two themes: redistribution and innumeracy. Let’s start with the redistribution. The budget calls for shifting many billions of dollars a year from the middle class and the poor to the very richest Americans. The very rich would receive this money through tax cuts. The rest of the country would lose out thanks to cuts in government programs that touch almost every citizen, including Social Security, Medicaid and food stamps. “On top of all of this,” Jamelle Bouie of Slate writes, “Trump’s budget makes substantial cuts to job-training programs, rental assistance, heating assistance for the elderly, education, and projects at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as funding for rural health and substance-abuse programs.” As for the innumeracy: The budget commits a jaw-dropping error of economic logic. Proponents of tax cuts have long argued that, while they may cause a short-term deficit, they pay for themselves in the long run by pushing economic growth (an argument not borne out by history). The Trump budget goes even further. It imagines that the tax cuts won’t even have any short-term costs. When affluent families start paying less in taxes, the shortfall will magically, and immediately, be made up. “This is a mistake no serious business person would make,” Lawrence Summers, the former treasury secretary, explains in The Financial Times. “It appears to be the most egregious accounting error in a presidential budget in the nearly 40 years I have been tracking them.” In an Op-Ed in The Times, Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calls the assumption “at odds with everything the administration has proposed and said on the issue.” In The Upshot, Susan Chira and Quoctrung Bui look at the effects of Trump’s budget on women. When a president releases his budget, as journalists like to point out, the proposals do not become law. They are wish lists. Congress, not the White House, writes the more meaningful draft of the federal budget. But a president’s budget still matters. It’s a sign of how an administration plans to govern. It is a statement of his administration’s values and, apparently, attitude toward reality. "
"CAIRO — Just over a week after Dina Ali Lasloom, a 24-year-old Saudi Arabian, was dragged onto a plane from Manila to Riyadh with her mouth taped shut and her arms and legs bound, the United Nations voted to appoint Saudi Arabia to a four-year term on its Commission on the Status of Women. So much for the status of this Saudi woman. On April 10, the authorities at the Manila airport — her stopover in the Philippines between Kuwait, from where she’d escaped a forced marriage, and Australia, where she’d planned on applying for asylum — confiscated Ms. Lasloom’s passport and boarding pass to Sydney and held her at an airport hotel until her uncles arrived. When they did, they beat her and forcibly repatriated her. Saudi feminists believe Ms. Lasloom is being held at a women’s prison. She certainly was not present when Ivanka Trump told a group of Saudi women she met on Sunday that Saudi Arabia has made “encouraging” progress in empowering women. The round table discussion was led by Princess Reema Bint Bandar al-Saud, the vice president of Women’s Affairs at the General Sports Authority, a largely moot title in a country where girls and women are not allowed to participate in sports. In response, a Saudi woman called Ghada tweeted: “Ivanka Trump only met and saw some of chosen puppets who are from the royal or high class, and they don’t represent the majority of us!” Saudi women must be accustomed to seeing women who are protected by wealth and proximity to power exercise rights that the majority of them are denied. Such is the bargain: Ms. Trump’s father, President Donald Trump, sealed a $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia during his visit to Riyadh. Meanwhile, the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates pledged to donate $100 million to a women’s fund proposed by Ms. Trump. During the election campaign, her father criticized the Clinton Foundation for accepting money from precisely those two countries, which he said “want women as slaves and to kill gays.” Selling out Saudi women is an old-established tradition. The day Ms. Lasloom landed in Riyadh, the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, also arrived in the Saudi capital for an official visit. Was the calculation that simple to make? Apparently so, since the freedom from abuse of one Saudi woman was worth sacrificing to curry favor with a country where 760,000 Filipinos work. Indeed, Saudi Arabia — the second-largest foreign employer of Filipinos — told Mr. Duterte it needed more Filipino workers. "
"LONDON — Brexit. Failing hospitals. Shoddy schools. Social care for the aged. Islamic State. Donald Trump. Fox hunting. Fox hunting? In what seemed at first to be a throwaway line on the campaign trail in advance of the general election on June 8, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain let it be known recently that she has “always been in favor of fox hunting,” which has been outlawed if pursued with packs of dogs in England and Wales since 2004. Of all the issues confronting her, fox hunting seemed barely to rise to the surface of a troubled world in which Britain finds itself. The country is scrambling to find a new niche after the decision to leave the European Union and the rise of an unpredictable new administration in Washington. So what was the point? Her avowal followed a tabloid newspaper’s disclosure that fox hunting’s supporters are hoping to use a projected victory by Mrs. May’s Conservative Party to press for the repeal of legislation that consigned centuries of hunting with dogs to the history books, along with bear baiting, cock fighting and other pursuits once deemed totemic of a bucolic, rural England. With last week’s publication of her party’s manifesto, Mrs. May has confirmed her pledge to hold a vote on a pursuit that Oscar Wilde was said to have termed “the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible.” But repeal may not be all plain sailing. Her original remarks to a restricted audience in Yorkshire — before the Manchester bombing this week raised grislier challenges — drew reactions that showed the somber depths of passions associated with a debate that consumed much energy in the Labour administration of Tony Blair. For some, the hunt represents the class struggle waged by those outside the privileged loop of riders in their scarlet coats atop glistening steeds, pounding across the countryside with packs of hounds baying for the blood of a hapless fellow quadruped. Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, for instance, consorted with his longtime love (and now his wife), Camilla Parker-Bowles, before his marriage to Princess Diana, at the prestigious Beaufort Hunt in Gloucestershire, according to a new biography of the prince. "
"ROME — President Trump is expected to publicly endorse NATO’s mutual defense commitment at a ceremony on Thursday at the alliance’s headquarters, an administration official said, breaking months of silence about whether the United States would automatically come to the aid of an ally under attack. Mr. Trump will make the promise in Brussels at the start of three days of meetings with European heads of state, according to the official, who was briefed on the president’s planned remarks. The speech will come as Mr. Trump unveils a memorial to the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the only time in the 28-nation military alliance’s history that the mutual defense pledge, known as Article 5, has been invoked. Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump had repeatedly refused to endorse Article 5, a thunderous silence that rattled American allies and raised fears about NATO’s future at a time of increasing tension with Russia and terrorist attacks like the one in Manchester, England, on Monday. Even before taking office, Mr. Trump expressed skepticism about NATO’s role in ensuring security on the European continent, and the financial costs that the United States bears in maintaining the alliance’s military might. In an interview with The New York Times just before officially claiming the Republican nomination last July, Mr. Trump said that if he were elected, the United States would come to the defense of the Baltic States against a Russian invasion only if those small countries spent more on their military and contributed more to the alliance. “If they fulfill their obligations to us,” Mr. Trump said in the interview, “the answer is yes.” Mr. Trump’s speeches often remain in flux until the last minute, and he is well known for deviating from his prepared text by adding, removing or changing passages even as he reads them on the prompter. So he may yet change his mind and omit an explicit statement of support for Article 5. "
"Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its rating of China’s sovereign debt one notch on Wednesday, citing concerns over growing debt in the country, which has the world’s second-largest economy. In recent years, as China’s stunning economic performance of past decades has become difficult to sustain, the country has used debt to fuel growth. Now, Moody’s says, China will have to borrow more and more to maintain the levels of economic growth the government wants. The concerns Moody’s raises will sound familiar to those who follow the Chinese economy closely. Expressed by one of the world’s top credit ratings agencies, however, the misgivings will be harder to ignore. In short: China doesn’t just have debt; it has a lot, and has accumulated it very fast. When it comes to pumping money into a financial system, China has made the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank look almost lackadaisical. It has expanded its broadly measured money supply by more than the rest of the world combined since the global financial crisis. Now it has 70 percent more money sloshing around its economy than the United States does, even though the American economy is bigger. China has accumulated its towering debt remarkably quickly. Goldman Sachs looked last year at how fast debt had accumulated relative to the size of the economy in 55 countries since 1960. It found that by the end of 2015, China was already in the top 2 percent of all credit expansions — and its debt shot up even higher last year. All of the other large expansions occurred in very small economies, some of which essentially lost control of their finances. The incredible part is that Goldman Sachs acknowledges that its calculations may underestimate the extent of China’s debt buildup. "
"President Trump’s budget is here, and it contains serious cuts to the social safety net. One of the big changes is a plan to slash more than $800 billion over the next 10 years from Medicaid. You may think of Medicaid as a program for the poor, but it also helps a variety of other vulnerable populations. Children with special health care needs rely on the program for services not typically covered by private health insurance, which helps them stay at home with their families. There are about five million children with special health care needs who receive benefits through public health insurance programs, including Medicaid. Proposed limits on a per-person basis are expected to disproportionately affect these children and their families, limiting access to costly but necessary services. My sweet son is in this category. He had three different evaluations around the age of 2, to confirm the autism diagnosis I first suspected when he was 15 months old. There were many more evaluations after that, to assess the scope of his needs and strengths. Autism is a spectrum disorder, so where would he fall? It was hard to tell in the beginning. Lots of well-meaning people would make comments: “He looks fine!” “That seems like typical kid behavior,” and an autism mom favorite, “You know, Einstein didn’t talk until he was 4!” I was lucky to be able to switch to a part-time schedule at work. Moving to weekend shifts eliminated child-care costs, making the difference in my take-home pay negligible. I focused on my son’s progress in crucial areas: getting him talking, interacting and smiling; moving him out of diapers; teaching him to read. Therapists did wonders. They also gave lots of advice. “Try to cut down on his arm flapping.” “Redirect him when he looks out of the corners of eyes.” “Don’t let him spin objects.” I drove myself to tears trying. At nap time I resorted to climbing into his crib to snuggle and sing because it was the only way I could get him to stop waving his hands in front of his eyes. "
"• The hunt continued for the “network” that might have helped Salman Abedi in the Manchester bombing. Eight men were in custody and the authorities scrambled to find a possible bomb maker who might have helped Mr. Abedi assemble the device he used. • The New York Times was given access to photographs of materials found at the scene of the bombing. Other news organizations, like CBS and NBC, had been among the first to reveal Mr. Abedi’s name. • Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said she would confront President Trump over leaks by American intelligence officials about the bombing investigation. Mr. Trump called the leaks “deeply troubling.” • Five more victims have been identified: a young couple, a Scottish schoolgirl, an off-duty police officer and a teacher. • The American pop singer Ariana Grande is suspending her tour until at least June 5.

The arrests took place in Manchester; in the town of Wigan to the northwest; and to the south, in the town of Nuneaton, which is near the city of Birmingham. A woman who was arrested on Wednesday has been released. "
"For hedge funds, information is a valuable currency. A scrap of insight about a coming change in government policy can be as precious as any market data, potentially making the difference between a profit or loss on a trade. As a result, political intelligence firms have proliferated inside the Beltway. But among the firms that traffic in information between Washington and Wall Street, one political insider’s tips to a New York hedge fund crossed a bright line, the authorities said on Wednesday. The Washington consultant, David Blaszczak, and four other men were charged in an insider-trading scheme, accused of using confidential information about government financing to trade shares in the health care companies that would be affected by the changes. Three current and former partners at Deerfield Management, a health care hedge fund firm, paid Mr. Blaszczak to provide inside information about policy decisions at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, leading to millions of dollars in illegal profits, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and securities regulators said. While federal prosecutors have been investigating the case for more than a year, it is the most prominent insider-trading case to be filed by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan since its chief, Preet Bharara, was fired by President Trump in March. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spend more than $1 trillion a year on health care programs for the elderly, disabled and lower income families and are major buyers of medical instruments, drugs and medical services. Mr. Blaszczak, a former employee at the agency and founder of Precipio Health Strategies, was accused of pumping a friend at the agency for market-moving information that he passed to his clients at Deerfield, an unsealed indictment said.

"If we can learn anything from the latest triple-bank-shot of a conspiracy theory coursing through the alt-reality media — this one involving the unsolved murder of a Democratic National Committee staff member named Seth Rich — it’s this: Fake news dies hard. God knows people have tried. In the last few months, journalists, academics, technology experts, civic-minded foundations and well-intentioned politicos have devoted decades of collective brain hours to an all-hands effort to stanch the conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods roiling our democracy. Facebook and Google have worked up new computer formulas and dispatched dedicated teams of humans to push the corrosive stuff off their platforms or, at the very least, to let readers know when something doesn’t look right. Ad makers are pulling their advertising from sites that run false items. And educators are working up “news literacy” programs to teach students how to tell the difference between real, corroborated journalism and naked lies dressed in the colors of veracity. But as the Seth Rich story shows, we’re going to need a bigger algorithm. In case you haven’t been following it, the Seth Rich conspiracy holds that before his death (or, in this version of events, assassination) in July Mr. Rich had been involved in the leaking of Clinton campaign emails to WikiLeaks, which the United States intelligence community has attributed to Russian-sponsored hackers. You can see the partisan appeal. If you don’t want to believe American intelligence assessments that the Russians were behind the breach — supposedly to help the electoral prospects of President Trump — and if you don’t like all the news about the investigations into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, well, there’s an alternative fact set to grab onto: Mr. Rich did it and paid for it with his life. The problem, of course, is that there’s no real evidence for the notion. The police in Washington have theorized that a thief may have killed Mr. Rich in a botched robbery attempt. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The life sciences industry is one of California’s strongest economic engines — and it’s growing. A new report by Biocom, a trade group based in San Diego, found that in the last five years, employment in the state’s industry grew by 10 percent to more than 360,000 jobs, many of them high-paying. In the life sciences, research labs and the companies that spin out of them turn science into commercial applications such as gene-editing tools, medicines and fuels derived from plants. Some other takeaways from the report: — California’s life sciences industry has commonly been identified with San Diego and the Bay Area, but they are rivaled by two other hubs. Los Angeles County hosts more than 2,400 businesses and labs, about as many as in all of Northern California. In Orange County, the figure is about 1,300. — In 2016, California’s life sciences were propelled by nearly $3.6 billion in funding from the National Institutes of Health. (President Trump has now created uncertainty by pushing to cut the agency’s budget by nearly a fifth.) — The average life sciences salary in California is considerable: more than $108,000. — Job growth may begin to taper in coming years as companies increasingly rely on automation. Joe Panetta, Biocom’s chief executive, drew a comparison with California’s winemaking industry, which generates roughly $60 billion in annual economic activity. "
"Ken Kurson, a close friend of President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, said on Wednesday that he will leave his job as editor of the Observer, the cheeky chronicler of New York City media and politics that Mr. Kushner purchased in 2006. In a move rich with political intrigue, Mr. Kurson said he would begin a new job next week as a senior managing director at Teneo Strategy, a division of the corporate advisory firm run by allies of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Teneo has highlighted its ties to the Clintons’ inner circle and recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors. Its team has expanded to include allies of the Clintons’ political adversaries: the firm recently hired Jason Miller, a top communications aide to President Trump’s campaign and a frequent defender of his administration. Mr. Kurson’s tenure at the Observer started in 2013 and was marked by questions about his ties to Mr. Kushner and the Trump campaign, particularly when he acknowledged that he had worked on a speech delivered by Mr. Trump to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. After criticism, Mr. Kurson said that he would no longer offer input to the Trump campaign. He remains close with Mr. Kushner. In a memo to his staff on Wednesday, he said Mr. Kushner has “never received the credit he deserves for supporting independent journalism.” “People can snark it up all they like — they certainly will — but at the end of the day this guy spent a ton of money and mostly let us do what we thought was best,” Mr. Kurson wrote. A one-time aide to the former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Kurson is a contrarian who relishes making mischief. At the Observer, he ran an essay that lobbed bombs at the world of high-fashion and a piece that attacked the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, which was criticized as a hit job. But he also published an essay by a staff writer, Dana Schwartz, during the presidential campaign that accused Mr. Kushner of abetting anti-Semitism by supporting Mr. Trump. That essay prompted Mr. Kushner to write a response in his own newspaper. Mr. Kurson also oversaw the Observer’s decision last year to end its print edition and drop “New York” from its title, severing a link to its glory days as a pink-hued broadsheet led by the famed editor Peter W. Kaplan. Observer Media, the outlet’s parent company, which is run by Mr. Kushner’s brother-in-law, Joseph Meyer, is now focused on increasing its online audience. The company said that it had begun a search for Mr. Kurson’s successor. "
"Plenty of political intelligence firms make money exchanging information between Washington and Wall Street — the data is, after all, valuable stuff for hedge funds. But one hedge fund crossed the line into insider trading, the authorities in the United States have said. David Blaszczak, a Washington consultant, and four other men were accused Wednesday of using confidential information about government financing to trade shares in health care companies that would be affected by the changes. Three current and former partners at Deerfield Management, a health care hedge fund firm, paid Mr. Blaszczak to provide inside information about policy decisions at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, leading to millions of dollars in illegal profits, prosecutors and regulators said. Two of the partners, Rob Olan and Ted Huber, were named in the indictment on Wednesday. Jordan Fogel, who worked at Deerfield from 2006 until last year, was charged separately and pleaded guilty this month. Federal prosecutors have been investigating for more than a year, and it is the most prominent insider-trading case to be filed by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan since its chief, Preet Bharara, was fired in March.

"For those concerned about press freedom, the first months of the Trump administration have been troubling. Journalists have been yelled at, pepper-sprayed, pinned by security and even arrested on the job. Now, one reporter has accused a Republican candidate of assault. Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said the recent episodes were not enough to make any sweeping statements about the way journalists are being treated since President Trump took office. “But what’s certainly unprecedented in modern American history is the rhetoric: the way that Trump talks about the media, the constant verbal attacks and the framing of journalists as enemies and purveyors of fake news,” he said. Mr. Simon said the committee was gathering data to identify trends and patterns. He said the assault case was particularly alarming. “This incident in Montana — I mean, just based on what we know at this point — I can’t recall anything quite like that,” he said. On Wednesday night, Ben Jacobs, a journalist for The Guardian, said he was “body slammed” by Greg Gianforte, a Republican candidate in a special House election, at a campaign event in Montana. It was the last night of a closely watched campaign, and Mr. Jacobs pressed Mr. Gianforte to answer a question about health care. In a recording of the exchange, the sounds of a physical struggle and a crash can be heard, followed by Mr. Gianforte saying: “I’m sick and tired of you guys!” "
"WASHINGTON — Describing President Trump’s revised travel ban as intolerant and discriminatory, a federal appeals court on Thursday rejected government efforts to limit travel to the United States from six predominantly Muslim nations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions quickly vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision was the first from a federal appeals court on the revised travel ban, which was an effort to make good on a campaign centerpiece of the president’s national security agenda. It echoed earlier skepticism by lower federal courts about the legal underpinnings for Mr. Trump’s executive order, which sought to halt travelers for up to 90 days while the government imposed stricter vetting processes. The revised order, issued on March 6, “speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination,” the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., concluded in its 205-page ruling. The White House derided the court decision as a danger to the nation’s security. And Mr. Sessions, in pledging to appeal to the nation’s highest court, said the government “will continue to vigorously defend the power and duty of the executive branch to protect the people of this country from danger.” At almost every turn since Mr. Trump ordered the travel ban — first in January, when it was halted by judicial objections, and again in March — federal courts have blocked it. Initially, the order suspended entry for travelers from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and banned refugees from Syria. The revised order sought to soften the original ban, which was almost immediately blocked after foreign travelers found themselves stranded at chaotic airports and protesters nationwide called the policy un-American. The second order allowed case-by-case exceptions for incoming travelers and lifted the ban against Iraqi visitors. It also deleted explicit references to religion. "
"WASHINGTON — Former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, once President Trump’s preferred candidate for F.B.I. director, has withdrawn his name from consideration, citing his law firm’s central role in Mr. Trump’s legal defense team. Mr. Lieberman, who has no federal law enforcement experience, said it was a “great honor” to be considered but pulled out after the president tapped Marc E. Kasowitz, a partner in the Manhattan firm that employs Mr. Lieberman, as his counsel in “various” investigations. “I do believe it would be best to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, given my role as senior counsel,” Mr. Lieberman, who was Al Gore’s running mate in 2000, wrote in a letter to the White House dated Wednesday and provided by his firm, Kasowitz Benson Torres. Mr. Lieberman is the latest of several candidates to take themselves out of consideration, including Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Alice Fisher, a former Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration. Another candidate still in the mix who has received less attention is Kenneth L. Wainstein, another former Bush administration official. He was interviewed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, last week, after a higher-profile series of interviews they did with an initial slate of candidates, according to several people familiar with the matter. "
"What does it mean to win a war? This question is never asked outright in “War Machine,” a new Netflix original movie starring Brad Pitt and written and directed by David Michôd, but it’s a substantial thematic undercarriage of this satire. The movie, which has its theatrical and TV premiere on Friday, May 26, is adapted from Michael Hastings’s 2012 book, “The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan.” Mr. Pitt plays Gen. Glen McMahon, an arguably brilliant career soldier whose first words on touching down in Afghanistan, where he has a new mission circa 2009, are “Let’s go win this thing!” McMahon approaches the task of transforming Afghan hearts and minds with enthusiasm and boundless ignorance. The terrifying hubris depicted in the movie is ever more pertinent given that President Trump has recently signaled an intention to increase the American military presence in Afghanistan. Mr. Hastings’s book is about the misadventures of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, whose brief tenure as the commander of United States and international forces in Afghanistan came to an end after a notorious profile Mr. Hastings wrote for Rolling Stone (in which, among other things, the general and his cadre were quoted making remarks sorely critical of the Obama administration). Mr. Hastings’s book (he died in a car accident in 2013) came Mr. Michôd’s way at an opportune time. “I had been looking for a way in to a theme: the two modern theaters of American war, Iraq and Afghanistan,” recalled Mr. Michôd, an Australian whose 2010 debut, the intense crime drama “Animal Kingdom,” found an enthusiastic albeit indie-size audience here, and also attracted the notice of adventurous Hollywood deal makers. “I had assumed that given the nature of my first two movies that what I would come up with would be another dark, brutal movie. And I was resisting delving into those depths.” The answer came when Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner, the presidents of Plan B, Mr. Pitt’s production company, sent him “The Operators.” “It showed me the way in, which is satire,” Mr. Michôd said. “The book has a kind of gonzo levity and a group of characters who either by virtue of hubris or the simple insanity of war seem to be larger than life.” While he wanted to respect the reality of the war, Mr. Michôd also wanted the freedom to be loose with his vision, so early on he made the decision to fictionalize the characters. (One of the few real-life figures to retain a real name is the former president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, played here by Ben Kingsley, who portrays him as almost touchingly distracted.) "
"Six new paperbacks to check out this week. Beer Money: A Memoir of Privilege and Loss, by Frances Stroh. (Harper Perennial, $16.99.) As a fifth-generation heir to the Stroh Brewing Company, once the third-largest brewery in the country, the author glimpsed some of her family’s former splendor growing up in Grosse Pointe, Mich. She tells a story of squandered wealth and her family’s decline while attempting to link the Strohs’ fortunes to those of Detroit. Still Here, by Lara Vapnyar. (Hogarth, $16.) Four friends from Russia attempt to forge new paths in New York, but end up transposing old dynamics, romances and jealousies to their adopted city. Vica pushes her husband to pitch an app with an ill-omened name — the Virtual Grave — to their wealthier friends, inspiring questions about immortality that follow the characters throughout the novel. The Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse, by Mohamed A. El-Erian. (Random House, $18.) In this edition, updated to reflect such geopolitical shifts as the election of President Trump and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, the author outlines the challenges to the global economy and prescribes solutions to avoid falling back into stagnation — or having sluggish growth become the new standard. The Sport of Kings, by C. E. Morgan. (Picador, $18.) The descendants of three Kentucky families — one wealthy and white, one African-American, and one equine — converge in this story, where questions of lineage, breeding and the past commingle on the Forge family plantation. Henrietta, a fiercely independent Forge heir, defies her father by hiring a black groom, and soon falls in love with him. Our reviewer, Jaimy Gordon, praised the “fire, virtuosity and spiritual imagination with which Morgan conjures” her subjects. Enter Helen: The Invention of Helen Gurley Brown and the Rise of the Modern Single Woman, by Brooke Hauser. (Harper, $16.99.) Brown, the longtime editor of Cosmopolitan and the author of the best-selling “Sex and the Single Girl,” helped stoke a revolution. Hauser’s biography examines how Brown used her own insecurities to speak to a range of women, and shows how many of her life’s conflicts still resonate today. All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr. (Scribner, $17.) The lives of a blind Resistance fighter in France and a brilliant orphan recruited by the Nazis intersect in this imaginative novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2015. The narrative confronts the role of morality and obligation during wartime, while performing an exemplary feat of storytelling. "
"The Trump administration’s deepest impact on domestic climate policy might have little to do with its efforts to dismantle the Clean Power Plan or its decision on the Paris accord. Instead, the coming battle over the future of the Energy Department could prove far more significant for the United States’ long-term efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Among energy experts, there is broad agreement that the world still needs major technological advances to halt global warming, like better batteries to integrate larger shares of solar and wind power into the grid, or carbon capture to curb pollution from cement plants. Historically, the Energy Department has nurtured these kinds of innovations, conducting basic research in its network of 17 national laboratories and aiding private firms struggling to bring risky technologies to market. But those efforts would be drastically scaled back under President Trump’s fiscal 2018 budget proposal, released on Tuesday, which proposes to cut the agency’s energy programs by $3.1 billion, or 18 percent below last year’s levels. The agency’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which has helped nudge down the cost of solar power, faces a 69 percent cut. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, a program that funds research into long-shot energy technologies, like algae biofuels or advanced batteries, would face elimination. And, despite Mr. Trump’s stated desire to promote “clean coal,” the Office of Fossil Energy, which invests in techniques to scrub carbon dioxide from coal plants and bury it underground, faces an 85 percent cut to its carbon-capture efforts.

"See all our Reader Ideas. This semester, we’ve heard from many teachers, especially those in United States schools with diverse populations, about the need to help their students grapple with the implications of President Trump’s immigration ban and crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The Reader Idea we present below, by Amanda Tobier, takes on this topic, but in such a warm, community-building way that we thought it was a perfect pick for our final lesson of the 2016-17 academic year. We end the post with a poem by an undocumented teenager. The poem comes not from Ms. Tobier’s class, but from the class of another New York City teacher who wishes to remain anonymous. Do you teach, or learn, with The New York Times? Tell us about it here. We’ll be posting another round of great ideas from our readers in August. _________ Teacher: Amanda Tobier, high school English teacher Idea: Once every week during the school year, Ms. Tobier invited the students in her advisory to read, watch videos and discuss what they learned from a different Times article. From that practice grew a schoolwide immigration project. School: Bronx Lab School, a public high school in the Bronx. The school’s website describes it this way: Grade level: Ninth-grade advisory class Why we chose it: We love how Ms. Tobier’s lesson uses The New York Times to help students respond to the news and use that response to explore cultural identity, celebrate heritage and create intergenerational bonds within a school community.

"WASHINGTON — An American airstrike in March killed more than 100 Iraqi civilians by inadvertently setting off a large amount of explosives that Islamic State fighters had placed in a building in Mosul, according to a long-awaited military investigation made public on Thursday. Critics have said the March 17 airstrike demonstrated that the United States has been too quick to use air power in a congested city filled with hundreds of thousands of civilians. But the Pentagon investigation put the primary blame on the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, while asserting that the American-led coalition that is fighting the militants has drawn some lessons from the episode and has adjusted its tactics and procedures. “This investigation determined that ISIS deliberately staged explosives and snipers to harm civilians,” said Brig. Gen. Matthew C. Isler, who oversaw the investigation. The investigation concluded that 105 civilians were killed: 101 in the building that was bombed, which was owned by a respected elder who invited people in the neighborhood to shelter there, and four in an adjacent structure. Thirty-six civilians who were believed to have been in the area have not been accounted for. The toll is one of the highest in the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, though the investigation asserts that jihadists’ explosives were mainly at fault. "
"To witness a suicide bombing up close is to understand, at its etymological root, the meaning of the word “carnage.” A bomb packed with nails, ball bearings and metal scraps — the sort that Salman Abedi detonated in Manchester on Monday night — doesn’t just kill. It shreds. Human beings are turned, instantly, into scraps of bone, organ and flesh. The smell of explosives mingles horribly with that of charred skin, burned metal, melted plastic and enormous quantities of blood. Cafes, buses, markets and concert halls become abattoirs, public and obscene. The bomber dies, too. The act turns the perpetrator into somebody’s martyr while denying his victims the possibility of justice. Mockery from beyond the grave thus compounds the nihilism of the act: “I got you; you can never get me.” Thirteen years ago, on Azza Street in Jerusalem, I saw a man’s body on a blown-up bus swaying back and forth, as if reciting a final prayer. He was one of 11 victims that day, in a bombing that took place a block from where I lived. It’s a sight that’s never left me. I offer this description to make the point that our intellectual understanding of terrorism will be stunted if we lack a visceral understanding of it. The standard definition of terrorism — “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims” — anesthetizes reality. "
"The United States stock market shuddered last week on a report that President Trump had tried to stop an F.B.I. investigation of his former national security adviser, with the Dow Jones industrials falling 373 points in one day and drawing comparisons to the Watergate-era bear market. If you think politics is roiling United States markets, consider Brazil: The day after the Trump-induced turmoil on United States exchanges, the Brazilian market fell 10 percent and trading had to be halted after news of a bribery scandal engulfed its relatively new president, Michel Temer. In France, investors were relieved that the centrist Emmanuel Macron decisively defeated the far-right National Front leader, Marine Le Pen. An upset Le Pen victory would very likely have made the market reaction to Britain’s decision to leave the European Union last summer look tame. The so-called Brexit vote sent European stocks down 7 percent the day after the surprise outcome. In a period of otherwise extended market calm, geopolitics have been driving periodic bouts of volatility. Even small investors have been making bets on the impact politics can have on stocks and other asset classes. After last week’s sell-off, I got a wave of questions from people asking whether Mr. Trump might be impeached and if they should sell stocks. I obviously can’t answer the first question. As for selling stocks, my answer, as it has been consistently since the election, is “no,” at least not because of the troubles swirling around the president. Consider what has happened in the days since the headline-making news. By the middle of this week, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index had recovered virtually everything it lost after the Trump-Russia news broke, and on Thursday it closed at a new high. "
"BRUSSELS — President Trump condemned “leaks of sensitive information,” responding on Thursday to a complaint by Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, over disclosures of details from the investigation into Britain’s deadliest terrorist attack since 2005. “The alleged leaks coming out of government agencies are deeply troubling,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “These leaks have been going on for a long time, and my administration will get to the bottom of this. The leaks of sensitive information pose a grave threat to our national security.” He added, “I am asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review of this matter, and, if appropriate, the culprit should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Mr. Trump has angrily criticized leaks from his government, many of them revealing information that has been embarrassing or politically damaging to him. In his first month in office, he called for a Justice Department investigation into what he said were “criminal leaks.” Just as he left Washington to start his nine-day overseas trip and again while he has been traveling, more leaks disclosed details about his private conversations. But two dimensions of the latest controversy are new: The disclosures in this case are about a terrorism investigation led by a foreign ally, and the British government has brought its complaints to a receptive audience. In a statement, Mrs. May’s office said she would bring up the matter at a NATO gathering in Brussels on Thursday evening and would “make clear to President Trump that intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure.” "
"BRUSSELS — President Trump on Thursday punctured any illusions that he was on a fence-mending tour of Europe, declining to explicitly endorse NATO’s mutual defense pledge and lashing out at fellow members for what he called their “chronic underpayments” to the alliance. On a tense day when Mr. Trump brought the “America first” themes of his presidential campaign to the very heart of Europe, he left European leaders visibly unsettled, with some openly lamenting divisions with the United States on trade, climate and the best way to confront Russia. The discord was palpable even in body language. When Mr. Trump greeted Emmanuel Macron, France’s new president, they grabbed each other’s hands, jaws clenched, in an extended grip that turned Mr. Trump’s knuckles white. When the leaders lined up to pose for the traditional photograph at NATO headquarters, Mr. Trump appeared to push aside the Montenegrin prime minister, Dusko Markovic, to get to his assigned place in the front. The split was starkest at NATO headquarters, where Mr. Trump used the dedication of a soaring new building to lecture allies on their financial contributions. Far from robustly reaffirming NATO’s mutual defense commitment in the way that many members hoped he would, Mr. Trump repeated his complaint that the United States was shouldering an unfair burden. “Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they’re supposed to be paying for their defense,” Mr. Trump declared, as the leaders shifted uncomfortably behind him, shooting one another sidelong glances. “This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,” he added. “And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Nagourney, Los Angeles bureau chief. It’s not as if this came as a big surprise to California, considering the sheer size of this state, the number of its citizens who rely on federal assistance for everything from food stamps to health care, and the outcome of November’s presidential election. Still, the severity of the cuts contained in the $4.1 trillion spending plan proposed by President Trump this week was a staggering reminder that there is a new regime in charge in Washington, and one that could make life difficult for California for the next four years at least. “It’s very bad for states generally, and it’s particularly bad for California,” said Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget & Policy Center, a nonprofit organization that advocates for low-income people. “The Trump budget is targeting services for low-income communities, and California has more low-income people, both in overall numbers and proportionately.” Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, called it “unconscionable and un-American.” Stipulated: The cuts in Mr. Trump’s budget were so sharp that Republicans in Congress were dismissing the budget even as it landed on their doorsteps. And Mr. Trump is also proposing deep tax cuts, particularly for the wealthy, that will no doubt be welcome by many people in a state that is renowned for its high taxes, particularly on upper-income residents. That said, given Republican control of Congress — and a long push by the party to cut domestic spending and taxes — at least some of them seem likely to make it into law. "
"Greg Gianforte, a wealthy former software executive who was charged with assaulting a reporter on Wednesday, won a special election on Thursday for Montana’s seat in the House of Representatives. Mr. Gianforte, a Republican, had been the front-runner against the Democratic candidate, Rob Quist, but his campaign was plunged into crisis by his confrontation with the journalist. Mr. Gianforte, 56, who has never held public office, amassed a personal fortune as a technology entrepreneur: He founded a software company, RightNow Technologies, that he later sold to Oracle for about $1.5 billion. He has put his business background at the center of his campaign, promising to use his private-sector sensibilities to help create jobs. Mr. Gianforte ran for governor of Montana in 2016, unsuccessfully challenging the incumbent, Steve Bullock, a Democrat. Mr. Bullock defeated Mr. Gianforte by about four percentage points, even as Donald J. Trump carried the state over Hillary Clinton by 20 percentage points. Many of the attacks Democrats used against Mr. Gianforte last year lingered in the House race, forcing national Republicans to spend millions to bolster his campaign. And Mr. Gianforte made new, unforced errors, in one instance announcing his support for the American Health Care Act in a phone call with Washington lobbyists before stating a public position in Montana. Mr. Gianforte entered the week as a clear favorite over Mr. Quist, a country music singer. Then Ben Jacobs of The Guardian asked him about the American Health Care Act. According to an audio recording and the accounts of witnesses, Mr. Jacobs asked Mr. Gianforte for his reaction to a Congressional Budget Office report showing that the bill would cause some 23 million people to lose health insurance coverage, and Mr. Gianforte erupted.

"The Trump administration has made it clear that the United States will take a more aggressive approach to battling al-Shabaab extremists in Somalia. In March, President Trump granted the military expanded authorities to operate in Somalia, paving the way for an accelerated military campaign. By declaring parts of Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” Mr. Trump gave the Department of Defense authority to approve strikes without going through an Obama-era vetting process, which potentially lowers the bar for tolerance of civilian casualties. And the head of American forces in Africa, who advocated the change, said this would “allow us to prosecute targets in a more rapid fashion.” The United States also recently sent several dozen additional troops to Somalia and reportedly requested information on the locations of aid groups there, possibly to ensure they are out of the way of airstrikes. One American soldier was killed in Somalia this month, the first combat death there since 1993. There is little to be gained by making intensified military engagement the dominant policy approach to Somalia. The absence of an effective state is the fundamental problem there. When and where there is some semblance of governance, it is often profoundly corrupt and subservient to a deeply ingrained clan system. Al-Shabaab capitalizes on resentment of government ineptitude, corruption and lack of economic opportunity to recruit, especially among Somalia’s youth. Airstrikes do nothing to address these failures. Instead, they may create more problems by allowing African Union forces to retreat, further militarize American policy, sideline diplomatic engagement and undercut the newly elected Somali president.

"American democracy remains healthy, but its health has worsened for the first time in recent history, according to a new survey of 1,126 political scientists. Three-quarters of respondents said the quality of United States democracy had declined in the last two years, after four decades of stability. Twenty-one percent said there had been no change, and 4 percent said it was healthier. The survey was the second by Bright Line Watch, a group formed by academics after the presidential election to study democratic performance in the United States over time. Compared with the first survey, conducted in February, a month into Donald J. Trump’s presidency, they said the country was doing worse on a few core democratic principles. Between February and May, there was a decrease in the share of respondents who thought the United States was meeting or fully meeting the standard that the Constitution and Congress could effectively limit executive power. They thought the country was not doing as well at giving citizens equal legal and political rights, or keeping elections free from foreign influence. Also, fewer thought the judicial branch was sufficiently independent, though more than half still said it was. Bright Line Watch, which includes professors from Dartmouth, Yale and the University of Rochester, conducted the survey by contacting 9,500 political science faculty members at the 511 institutions represented at the American Political Science Association, of which 1,126 responded. It is not a representative sample, and academics tend to be left-leaning, including some of the organizers of the survey who publicly criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign. It nonetheless provides perspective on the political moment from a large number of experts in political science and history. "
"To the Editor: Re “Russians Talked of Ways to Sway Trump Advisers” (front page, May 25): We now have the intelligence agencies, as well as committees in both houses of Congress, trying to ascertain not only how the Russians tried to influence the election, but also whether they tried, through contact with members of Donald Trump’s staff, to gain influence with Mr. Trump himself. Wouldn’t it be more informative if the investigations focused on the possibility of direct influence on Mr. Trump by the Russian government and other Russian entities by the use of investments, deals, favors and financial incentives that would tie them together to mutual benefit, and, perhaps, obligation? Wouldn’t subpoenas of his tax records and business dealings in Russia be a better way to clarify these issues? Everything Mr. Trump has done, from his odd favoring of all matters Russian, to his refusal to submit his tax records or be open about his business dealings, to his continuing to promote his business interests through family surrogates, suggests that this is the more illuminating direction to take. ARNOLD MITCHELL, SCARSDALE, N.Y. To the Editor: Just because both the Russians and Donald Trump wanted him to win doesn’t mean they colluded to make it happen. I can’t even imagine how, exactly, such collusion could work. Mr. Trump’s aides telling the Russians what to hack and when to leak it? The Russians were plenty smart to figure that out on their own. The Democrats are wasting their credibility on Russia conspiracy theories. If the Democrats lose credibility, who will keep Mr. Trump in check? ILYA SHLYAKHTER
CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: "
"Of the many foreign policy pledges that President Trump made as a candidate, one of the few worth keeping is to improve relations with Russia. Fueled most recently by Russian interference in the American election and differences over Syria, tensions between Washington and Moscow compromise American interests in Europe, the Middle East and beyond. While Mr. Trump used his speech in Brussels on Thursday to justifiably criticize NATO members on burden sharing (and pointedly refused to endorse the alliance’s mutual defense pledge), going forward he should get serious about mending ties with the Kremlin by calling for a halt to NATO enlargement. As is his style, Mr. Trump would be breaking with foreign policy orthodoxy — except this time, it would be fully warranted. Since the Cold War’s end, American and European governments have agreed that admitting Europe’s new democracies to NATO is the best way to anchor them in the Atlantic community and protect them against a potential resurgence of Russian adventurism. The policy has backfired. From Moscow’s perspective, NATO has ignored its vociferous objections and expanded eastward in successive waves since the 1990s, bringing the world’s most formidable military alliance up to Russia’s borders. The Kremlin may well have returned to its bullying ways whether or not NATO’s frontier moved Russia’s way. But Moscow perceives a threat from NATO’s advance and resents its effort to peel away Russia’s traditional sphere of influence, helping fuel the confrontational turn in the Kremlin’s foreign policy and renewed rivalry with the West. Indeed, Russia militarily occupied chunks of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 in no small part to block their path to NATO. That NATO opened its doors to former members of the Soviet bloc is understandable. They suffered Moscow’s coercion for decades, and the West felt a moral and strategic obligation to attach them to the community of Atlantic democracies. But Russia’s reaction is equally understandable. The United States would not sit idly by if Russia concluded a military alliance with Canada and Mexico and deployed Russian troops in those countries. For NATO to keep moving eastward and eventually offer membership to Georgia and Ukraine — as promised at NATO’s 2008 summit — is a recipe for a strategic train wreck. Getting out of this geopolitical impasse requires shutting down NATO enlargement. Rather than doing so arbitrarily, NATO should aim for a natural strategic boundary. The Balkans offer just that. "
"Good morning on this wet Thursday. This Memorial Day is a milestone in our presidential history: It would have been the 100th birthday of John F. Kennedy. The 35th president, though born in Massachusetts, was a New Yorker in many ways. “New Yorkers just accept him as an honorary New Yorker because he was here so much,” said David Nasaw, a history professor at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center and the author of a biography on the Kennedy family. “And because he had this sophistication, this humor, this glamour, this wit and these smarts.” (Just like we city folk do, right?) Kennedy spent some of his formative years living in Riverdale and Bronxville. Later, in 1954, he stayed for several months at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Midtown Manhattan, where he underwent major spinal surgery and nearly died. But Kennedy’s more positive moments in New York — his best ones, according to Mr. Nasaw — were during the years that followed, while he was campaigning ahead of the 1960 election. “We overlook the fact that he wouldn’t have been president without New York City,” Mr. Nasaw said. “Everybody thinks that New York is this staunch, always-Democratic state.” "
"Ben Carson, the head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, faced an intense backlash on Wednesday for calling poverty “a state of mind.” Mr. Carson, who oversees a department that handles housing for millions of low-income Americans, made the comments during a radio interview on Tuesday with Armstrong Williams, a friend and conservative media personality. During the talk, Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said he thought some people were poor because of their outlook on life. “I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind,” he said, according to a transcript of the interview that was released on Wednesday. “You take somebody that has the right mind-set, you can take everything from them and put them on the street, and I guarantee in a little while they’ll be right back up there.” He added that helping people may not better their lives. “You take somebody with the wrong mind-set, you can give them everything in the world — they’ll work their way right back down to the bottom,” he said. The remarks caused an immediate uproar on Twitter, with the former top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett and the actor and rights activist George Takei, among others, taking sharp aim at him. Mr. Carson has often credited his mother for helping him focus on his education and rise out of poverty. During the interview, he reiterated her influence on him. “If everybody had a mother like mine, nobody would be in poverty,” Mr. Carson said. “She was a person who absolutely would not accept the status of victim.” When Mr. Carson assumed the helm of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, he had no government experience and no political experience beyond a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination and said he had no burning desire to run a major federal bureaucracy. His views on alleviating poverty were informed by his childhood in Detroit and his own journey to become a renowned brain surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. "
"It takes a serious commitment to incompetence and deception to spawn as many ethical and legal concerns as the Trump administration has in just four months. The misbehavior by White House officials in the past few days has been impressive even by Trumpian standards. They’ve tried to raise doubts about the independence of the special counsel investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. And they’ve stonewalled efforts by the Office of Government Ethics to identify conflicts of interest in the administration. Take first the ethics issue. In January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order banning appointees who had been lobbyists or lawyers from working on policy or regulatory issues they were once paid to influence, for two years. Unfortunately, that order allowed the president or a designee to secretly waive these restrictions. In the Obama administration, any such waivers were made public, with a detailed explanation. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the public to know who was violating the lobbying rules, and who received permission to ignore them. Confronted with multiple examples of former lobbyists working on the exact issues they once lobbied on, the ethics office last month directed the White House and federal agencies to provide, by June 1, copies of any waivers. In a letter to Walter Shaub Jr., who directs the office, and to ethics officers in federal agencies, the White House challenged Mr. Shaub’s legal authority to make the request. The letter came from Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, which has no jurisdiction over the government ethics program. His effort centers on whether the White House is a “federal agency,” subject to ethics rules. But Mr. Mulvaney went further, maintaining, contrary to the Ethics in Government Act, that the ethics office has no authority to demand information on waivers from federal agencies. Since his office helps control the agencies’ funding, some interpreted that as an effort to intimidate them into keeping their waivers secret, too. The ethics office was created after Watergate. A White House has never actively worked against it in this way. Mr. Shaub, whose five-year term ends in January, refuses to back down. He told agency ethics officers that contrary to what the White House says, they are legally required to provide details of the waivers to his office. Late on Monday, he sent a rocket of a letter to Mr. Mulvaney. His office’s job, he wrote, is “to lead the executive branch ethics program with independence, free from political pressure. Accordingly, OGE declines your request to suspend its ethics inquiry and reiterates its expectation that agencies will fully comply with its directive by June 1, 2017. Public confidence in the integrity of government decision-making demands no less.” So will the White House bend? Or will Mr. Trump fire another independent official for excess loyalty to the law? "
"We’re now getting a feel for what it was like to work in a business run by Donald Trump. His budget is out, and it predicts we will have super-duper, excellent, great — no, huge — economic growth based on monster tax cuts for the rich and cuts in spending that will leave the poor with no money to buy anything. It was produced in concert with that great health care bill, which the Congressional Budget Office now estimates would cost 23 million Americans their insurance coverage over the next 10 years. On the plus side, in 10 years Trump will definitely not be president. Unless there’s a coup. We’re being run like a bad Atlantic City casino. It’s only a matter of time before the government will be trying to make ends meet by selling its name to golf course developers and marketing USA Steaks. The budget came out while Trump was overseas, talking about peace with Pope Francis, who occasionally looked as cheerful as if he was watching his car being towed away. Meanwhile at home, the detailed presidential spending plan was being unveiled, like the magic show at a mismanaged gambling house tottering toward bankruptcy court. There were a few, um, flaws. For one thing, the budget appeared to count the same $2 trillion twice. We hate when a government does that. It also presumes that a country with an aging population is going to spur economic growth by battling immigration. And the big tax-cutting plan that is the basis of said explosive growth is still just that one-page summary the administration handed out to catcalls last month. "
"Obamacare is not “collapsing under its own weight,” as Republicans are so fond of saying. It was sabotaged from the day it was enacted. And now the Republican Party should be held accountable not only for any potential replacement of the law, but also for having tried to starve it to death. The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday released its accounting of the House Republicans’ replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act, and the numbers are not pretty: It is projected to leave 23 million more Americans uninsured over 10 years, through deep cuts to insurance subsidies and Medicaid. The report underscores how the bill would cut taxes for the rich to take health care away from the less well-off. The A.C.A. is not perfect, and improvements to it would be welcome. But it worked in many respects and would have worked much better had Congress been a faithful guardian of the law. It is worth making a record of those Republican saboteurs’ efforts. The A.C.A.’s opponents brought a lawsuit against its requirement that people buy insurance — a Republican idea — the very day the statute was signed into law. The Supreme Court rejected that claim. But the court gave opponents a major victory on another front, ruling that Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid was optional for states. Yet another lawsuit seized on some sloppy language in the law to make the implausible argument that Congress did not provide for the insurance subsidies on which the law depends. The Supreme Court also rejected that challenge. But if the Republicans lost those cases, they succeeded in sowing the insurance markets with doubt and forcing states to slow down implementation while awaiting the court’s decisions. That in turn may have reduced sign-ups, further destabilizing the insurance market. The second case challenging the subsidies was not decided until 2015, more than a year after the statute’s critical 2014 deadline for implementation. Even worse, these lawsuits helped make the A.C.A. the salient partisan issue of the Obama administration, turning the law into the ultimate Republican litmus test: Implementing a state insurance exchange or expanding Medicaid, even when it seemed in a state’s interest, became treasonous for the party. Nevertheless, about a dozen principled Republican governors bucked their party and expanded their programs. "
"While it’s been obvious for years that election law — the rules by which votes are counted, district lines are drawn and campaigns are paid for — represents a front in the culture wars, we don’t usually think of it that way. That’s because the term culture war signifies the politicization of competing belief systems — over abortion, for example, or religion or the appropriate social roles for men and women. (I use the word “belief” advisedly, recognizing that an anti-abortion position is purely opportunistic for a fair number of the Republican politicians who embrace it, including but not limited to President Trump.) The election-law wars, by contrast, aren’t about belief. They are about power: who has it, who gets to keep it. And as underscored by this week’s Supreme Court decision invalidating two North Carolina congressional districts as unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, the justices are as fully engaged in combat as anyone else. There was something delicious about the warning in the dissenting opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. about the danger that “the federal courts will be transformed into weapons of political warfare” if they remain open to deciding such cases. He said that by being too casually receptive to complaints like those brought by African-American voters in this case, courts “will invite the losers in the redistricting process to seek to obtain in court what they could not achieve in the political arena.” Please. When did the Supreme Court acquire such diffidence about offering a forum for electoral struggle? Am I the only one to recall the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s explanation for why the Supreme Court had to intervene to stop the recount of Florida’s votes in the 2000 presidential election? Permitting the recount to go forward, Justice Scalia wrote then, would cause “irreparable harm” to George W. Bush by “casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election.” Note that Justice Alito’s dissenting opinion this week in Cooper v. Harris was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who as a private lawyer was a member of the Bush legal team in Palm Beach County, and by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a prime mover in the court’s eventual decision in what became Bush v. Gore. Ironies abound in the North Carolina decision. Not so many years ago, it was Republicans, in states that had not sent an African-American to Congress since Reconstruction, who were complaining that the Voting Rights Act was being misused by a heavy-handed federal government to create majority-black districts where state legislatures had not seen fit to create any. Now that Republicans have control of Southern state legislatures, they seek cover from the Voting Rights Act, claiming that it gives them no choice but to pack ever-greater black majorities into those very districts — which just happens to make the surrounding districts ever more white and safely Republican. It’s not race, it’s politics, the states say. "
"We certainly don’t want leading Republicans to tumble into hypocrisy, so let’s refresh their memories. Patriots like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have eloquently warned of the importance of ferreting out the truth and holding politicians accountable, including for leaking classified information. Thank God for their insistence on truth-seeking! As McConnell warned, for example: “The president did not value the sacred oath. He was interested in saving his hide, not truth and justice. I submit to my colleagues that if we have no truth and we have no justice, then we have no nation of laws. No public official, no president, no man or no woman is important enough to sacrifice the founding principles of our legal system.” Such passion for justice and accountability (expressed in 1999, during the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton) inspires us all. And at this historic moment when timid or myopic politicians balk at congressional oversight and resist an independent commission to investigate President Trump and possible collusion with the Kremlin, it behooves us to cherish the wisdom of such honest souls. They’re busy, but no problem! I’ve helpfully dug out their brilliant insights: “Extreme carelessness with classified material … is still totally disqualifying.” — Donald Trump, July 11, 2016 “It’s simple: Individuals who are ‘extremely careless’ w/ classified info should be denied further access to it.” — House Speaker Paul Ryan, tweet, July 7, 2016 "
"Add cholera to the famine threat and other crises that are devastating Yemen. More than 360 people have died of the disease in recent weeks, and thousands more are at risk. All that is unfolding against a civil war that has killed 10,000 people in two years and come to a grim stalemate in which President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his Saudi and United Arab Emirates backers continue to fight Houthi rebels, an indigenous Shiite group with loose ties to Iran. President Trump could have used his trip to Saudi Arabia this week to spotlight the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen and push for a political solution to the conflict. Instead, he basked in the adulation of King Salman and his court, uncritically embraced the country’s foreign and domestic policies, and then sold the Saudis $110 billion in arms. The package includes precision-guided munitions, which President Barack Obama withheld last year in an effort to pressure Saudi Arabia to halt attacks that have killed thousands of civilians and struck hospitals, schools, markets and mosques. He also worried about possible Saudi war crimes in which America could be implicated. Mr. Trump made perfunctory references to Yemen on his trip, but mostly to praise the Saudi war effort and condemn Iran for supporting militant groups. He could be using the leverage he has with his new Saudi friends to push for a resolution to the fighting. After all, Saudi Arabia and its gulf allies depend heavily on Washington for aircraft, munitions, training and in-flight refueling. The United States also helps Saudi Arabia guard its borders. "
"Summer television has improved more than that of any other season, but it’s still a time for escapist pleasures — they’re just smarter and better made than they used to be. Here are 13 choices for summer fun (on American television or streaming services) that won’t starve your brain of oxygen. All premiere dates are subject to change. Season 1, Comedy Central, June 6 The Australian comedian Jim Jefferies takes on John Oliver and Samantha Bee on their own turf, the weekly, topical, host-centric late-night (10:30 p.m.) show. Mr. Jefferies probably got the gig on the strength of his popular gun-control routine and his caustic exchange with Piers Morgan about Donald J. Trump, but for the full range of his talent check out his tenderly abrasive 2013-14 sitcom, “Legit.” Season 1, TNT, June 11 The increasingly crowded category of the quirky Southern crime drama with a dark-comic edge — Elmore Leonard-Carl Hiaasen country — adds this series that was originally in the works at HBO. Niecy Nash, Carrie Preston and Judy Reyes star as Florida manicurists who do a little money laundering on the side. Season 1, Netflix, June 23 Period dramas about pop-culture scenes have generally come attached to men with big swinging reputations: Baz Luhrmann (“The Get Down”), Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger (“Vinyl”), Jim Carrey (“I’m Dying Up Here”). Now we get one from a female perspective: “Glow,” a comic drama about a women’s professional wrestling circuit in the 1980s, was created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, and its executive producers include Jenji Kohan of “Orange Is the New Black.” It’s refreshingly free of the bombast and fatuousness that often come with the genre and features a winning performance by Alison Brie as an actress who finds work doing chokeslams and piledrivers. Season 3, BBC America, June 28 There’s no “‘Broadchurch’ will return” after the closing credits this time — the show’s third season of languid seaside menace, hyper-procedural police work and squabbling-partner dramedy is by all accounts its last. Miller and Hardy (the dream team of Olivia Colman and David Tennant) are still working together three years after the turgid events of Season 2. The final eight-episode arc begins with a quiet, horrible, mesmerizing 15-minute scene of the examining and questioning of a rape victim (Julie Hesmondhalgh, who’s terrific), and over the course of the season that crime is investigated while the Broadchurch townies deal with other crises, including the decline of the town newspaper and the continuing repercussions of the death of Danny Latimer in Season 1.

"In September of 2006, nearly six years into the presidency of George W. Bush, 29 percent of voters — nearly all Democrats — thought that he should be impeached. Similarly, in November, 2014, six years after Barack Obama won office, 30 percent of voters — mostly Republicans — thought that he, too, deserved that fate. President Trump, reached the 30 percent level in February 2017, one month into his presidency, the Public Religion Research Institute found. That after six years three in ten voters favored the impeachment of Bush and Obama was a reflection of the depth of polarization in the country. The speed at which Trump reached that number is something else altogether. A May 16 survey by Public Policy Polling, a partisan Democratic firm generally rated as credible, found that the pro-impeachment numbers for Trump had shot up to 48 percent, with 41 percent opposed. What does the future hold? As long as Republicans and Democrats are “pulling with roughly equal force,” Nate Silver observes at the website FiveThirtyEight, Although Democrats are by no means unified on the issue, much of the activist base of the Democratic Party smells blood. At least 23 House Democrats and three Senators have signaled that they are receptive to impeachment, most prominently Representatives Al Green of Texas and Maxine Waters of California, who have called for the start of formal proceedings. Matthew Yglesias, a liberal columnist, wrote “The case for impeaching Trump — and fast” on May 22 on Vox. Brian Buetler wrote in the New Republic on the same day, “Democrats Should Proudly Call for Trump’s Impeachment.” "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday, and things mostly went according to script. But the photo opportunity was a bit of a letdown: The pope’s chagrined look drew peals of laughter across the late-night TV circuit. “Back during the campaign, Trump butted heads with the pope over immigration, so people were expecting this first meeting to be a bit tense,” Stephen Colbert said. “And we saw this picture: It was.” He imagined the pope’s internal monologue during the photo shoot: “I was wrong — there is no God.” The hosts had quips galore about other aspects of the visit, too. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert entered Day 2 of his assault on President Trump’s proposed budget, which the White House released on Tuesday. He noted the recent revelation that the administration had overstated incomes in its budget. Paul Simon teamed up with Mr. Colbert for the bleakest version of “The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy)” you’ll ever hear. "
"T
he amount of time I waste finding and consuming alternative-medicine supplements for “brain function” has made me at least 10 percent dumber, and that paradox is not lost on me. It was this impulse that made me pause last year at a fancy store in Brooklyn when I spotted a glass jar labeled “Brain Dust.” It had the kind of packaging that signals discreet luxury: minimalist matte label, custom type, the word “organic.” A 2.2-ounce jar cost $55. “This adaptogenic potion lights up your brain and increases mental flow,” the label said. “Neuron velocity and vision are fine tuned by toning the brain waves, in particular the alpha waves that connect to creativity.” It seemed like the kind of item that might be a prop in a comedy sketch about millennial idiots, or something a person would be duped into buying on a hidden-camera prank show. I did not buy the Brain Dust, but I looked it up online, because I will pursue anything that claims to make me smarter. The product’s ingredients were mysterious: lion’s mane, shilajit, astragalus, rhodiola, stevia, maca. It was sold by a company named Moon Juice, which called itself “a healing force, an etheric potion, a cosmic beacon for those seeking out beauty, wellness and longevity.” In other words, a chain of juice stores in Los Angeles. I thought about Brain Dust for weeks. The name alone seemed precision-calibrated to reel me in. It wasn’t “Brain Powder,” which sounds unappealingly man-made — protein powder, baby powder, foot powder — but “Dust,” which suggests that the ingredients assembled themselves with the spontaneity of snowflakes on a twig. Then there was the label, with its “alpha waves” and “adaptogenic potion” and “neuron velocity.” This was language as Impressionist paint daub; not a signifier of meaning but a blurry, mood-inducing gesture. Questions lingered. Can brain waves be toned? Who is the Brain Dust customer? Does she have no grasp on reality, or does she simply aspire to have no grasp on reality? Why do I assume it’s a woman? A short time later, a news release touting a Moon Juice cookbook appeared in my inbox. It described the book’s author and Moon Juice’s founder, Amanda Chantal Bacon, as “a powerful influencer in the wellness space,” which struck me as the most penetratingly of-the-moment group of words I’d ever read. The release noted that Moon Juice had been featured on Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle platform, Goop, and was beloved by celebrities like Shailene Woodley, who is herself known for dispensing peculiar wellness advice (like eating clay and sunbathing the vagina). The words “Eastern healing,” “glowing skin,” “nationwide following” and “social media” made their way onto the page. In the space of roughly 500 words, someone — a junior book publicist, probably — had managed to concentrate the zeitgeist of contemporary female celebrity into its purest form. Amanda Chantal Bacon, whoever she was, was like a superextract distilled from a combination of Paltrow, Jessica Alba, Miranda Kerr, Ayesha Curry and every other contemporary lifestyle guru. Unlike the others, she didn’t have an acting or a modeling career (or a famous husband) to vault her into the public sphere. But she had all the right nouns and adjectives: a robust Instagram following, a line of signature products, an aspirational and photogenic home and enough branding talent to ensnare my gaze and capture my imagination, even if I was ashamed of its capture. She had also gone viral. In May 2015, Elle featured Bacon’s daily diet, which included items like ho shou wu, silver needle tea, pearl, reishi, cordyceps, quinton shots, bee pollen and chaga. These foods — substances? — were unfamiliar to most readers. “I Have Never Heard of, Much Less Eaten, Any of the Foods in This Juice Lady’s Food Diary” was the title of a sneering Jezebel article that followed. Another site estimated Bacon’s grocery tab to be $709.75, or about 4.5 times what a typical American spends on food a week. Here was proof of the extent to which our nascent wellness culture had finally matured: a woman whose lifestyle was extreme to the point of inscrutability and expensive to the point of implausibility. It’s not surprising that Bacon was mocked; the internet backlash practically wrote itself. The amazing thing was that she was also embraced. She expanded her business, published a cookbook, spoke at conferences and appeared in Vogue. As her fame has rippled outward, so has her influence. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s first budget offers up dramatic policy shifts and hundreds of millions of dollars to clamp down on undocumented immigrants living in the United States, denying them tax credits, jobs and haven while funding a deportation force and flights home for those being removed. The proposals, part of the $4.1 trillion blueprint the White House released Tuesday, offer the clearest indication yet of how Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to build a southern border wall to keep immigrants from illegally entering the United States and hunt down and banish those who are already here, intends to carry out his crackdown. In a budget marked by steep cuts to social safety net programs, it is one of the few areas besides the military where the president proposes to increase funding. “In these dangerous times, our increased attention to public safety and national security sends a clear message to the world — a message of American strength and resolve,” Mr. Trump said in the message accompanying the document. “It follows through on my promise to focus on keeping Americans safe, keeping terrorists out of our nation, and putting violent offenders behind bars.” To carry out the changes, Mr. Trump has requested a $2.7 billion increase for border security and immigration enforcement, part of a nearly 7 percent increase for the Department of Homeland Security. But his targeting of immigrants reaches beyond spending freely to track and deport them. The proposal also calls for new steps to bar undocumented immigrants from receiving tax credits, including adding a new requirement that those claiming the child tax credit provide a verifiable Social Security Number valid for employment, and tightening current rules that mandate that a Social Security number be furnished to claim the earned-income tax credit. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said the change — which has long been sought by Republican immigration hard-liners in Congress — was in keeping with the administration’s determination to spare taxpayers from supporting people undeserving of federal help.

"The Yankees are, at the moment, a marketer’s dream. With a spirited start to the season, they can boast of having one of baseball’s best records, bask in the captivating presence of the Bunyanesque outfielder Aaron Judge and nod in approval at some popular changes to their ballpark — with all of these developments wrapped in the team’s rich history. But even those selling points have yet to turn around attendance at Yankee Stadium, where ticket and suite revenues through last season had fallen by a staggering $166 million since the end of 2009, the year the Yankees christened the new ballpark with their last World Series title. The financial figures, from the public filings the Yankees are required to make on their stadium bonds, represent a 42 percent loss in ticket and suite revenues over the last seven seasons. And despite the team’s compelling play this season, attendance through the first quarter of their home schedule is down from the same point last year. The ticket and suite revenues are only a portion of the Yankees’ overall income, which also includes television and radio broadcast fees, advertising and licensing, and a portfolio of ancillary businesses. And indeed, the decline in ticket and suite income has offered some relief from baseball’s revenue-sharing system, allowing the Yankees to pay less into the pot that is distributed among all 30 teams. But the losses do provide a window into how even the blue-blooded Yankees, who have been largely impervious to the market forces that have affected the rest of baseball, have had difficulty maintaining their audience. The challenge confronting the team comes at a time when the entire sports industry is feeling the ground move beneath its feet as consumer behavior shifts drastically, with the changes even rattling the broadcasting titan ESPN.

"MISSOULA, Mont. — The altercation that led the Republican nominee in a special House election here to be charged with assault just hours before the polls opened has upended a hard-fought race that was already being watched for clues about the country’s political environment. The costly campaign for Montana’s at-large House seat had evolved into a referendum on decidedly national issues even before fisticuffs broke out. But the question on Thursday morning was whether the misdemeanor assault charges filed against the Republican candidate, Greg Gianforte, after a heated run-in with a reporter, would affect his race against the Democrat Rob Quist. The story of the encounter between Mr. Gianforte and the reporter, Ben Jacobs of The Guardian — who went to a Bozeman emergency room after he said he was “body-slammed” by the Republican candidate — exploded on social media after Mr. Jacobs posted an audio recording of the episode. Within hours, newspapers in Missoula, Billings and Helena had rescinded their endorsements of Mr. Gianforte, House Democrats released a digital ad featuring the audio recording, and Republicans were in a state of paralysis about what to do with a candidate who suddenly had a court date next month. At a final rally for Mr. Quist in a brewpub in Missoula, activists were electrified by the news, and some of them said they intended to play the tape for those yet to vote when canvassing for Mr. Quist.

"• On the fourth leg of a grueling overseas trip, President Trump lectured NATO allies in Brussels on not spending enough for collective defense, and declined to plainly endorse Article 5 of the alliance’s founding treaty, which states that an attack on any member is an attack on all. • For some of the European leaders, testing Mr. Trump seemed to be as important as finding common ground with him, amid anxiety about their relationship with a leader who had dismissed the alliance as “obsolete” and called the Belgian capital a “hellhole” after a terrorist attack. • Earlier, Mr. Trump met with Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. Mr. Tusk said afterward that there were differences of opinion over Russia, but that when it came to Ukraine, “it seems that we were on the same line.” • Analysts said expectations were low that Mr. Trump and European leaders would agree on issues like climate change, trade and terrorism. (He also shared an eyebrow-raising handshake with President Emmanuel Macron of France.) • In the wake of Mr. Trump’s suggestions that the alliance was not doing enough against terrorism, NATO announced that it would formally join the fight against the Islamic State.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The British authorities are investigating a “network” behind Monday’s deadly bombing in Manchester. Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old suicide attacker, had recently visited his parents in Libya and had probably traveled to Syria. The British police have arrested his older brother and four others, and in Libya his younger brother and father were taken into custody. Here’s the latest from Manchester, and a look at the homeless men who became heroes, the parents who were victims and how the attack affects Britain’s parliamentary vote on June 8. _____ • We obtained photos that suggest the bomb was skillfully constructed. British officials reacted angrily to the leak. We also fact-checked rumors and hoaxes. And in our podcast, The Daily, our correspondent discusses what happened within ISIS in the hours after the attack. "
"A year ago, over Memorial Day weekend, Donald J. Trump’s campaign team was in disarray, Hillary Clinton had yet to lock down the Democratic nomination, and Peter Thiel was outed as the secret benefactor of a lawsuit against Gawker. What could well-informed Hamptonites possibly be talking about this summer? Here are six topics that are percolating on the East End. Talk amongst yourselves. The war over the most precious of Hamptons real estate — the magazine coffee table — continues. Cristina Cuomo (the sister-in-law of Gov. Andrew Cuomo) is starting a magazine, Hamptons Purist, devoted to health and wellness. Previously, Ms. Cuomo was the editor of Beach and Manhattan magazines, both published by Modern Luxury, until she was fired in November. “I came up with the concept after Christmas break in Costa Rica,” she said of Purist. “I was sitting on my surfboard, and I was like, if I could capture this feeling in print, that would be great.” Only problem is, her previous boss, Michael Dickey, the chief executive of Modern Luxury, said he was revamping Beach to focus on wellness, too. “For over a year, Modern Luxury has been working toward expanding Beach magazine’s focus on health and wellness,” Mr. Dickey said. “We wish Cristina the best in her new endeavors.” "
"MANCHESTER, England — The British authorities intensified their search on Thursday for possible accomplices of the Manchester bomber, as questions emerged about whether more could have been done to prevent the country’s deadliest terrorist attack since 2005. As early as 2011, Salman Abedi, the 22-year-old Briton identified as the bomber, had raised such serious concerns among acquaintances that they called an antiterrorism hotline to report that he held extremist views. The government has said that MI5, the domestic intelligence agency, was aware of Mr. Abedi — but only as a peripheral figure, and not someone whose behavior would have warranted immediate action. Mr. Abedi set off a bomb Monday night as fans left a concert by the pop singer Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena, killing 22 people and injuring 64, many of them critically. As the police conducted a series of house raids on Thursday in the Manchester area, the chief investigator said they were making headway in the investigation into the plot and had amassed important evidence. A man was arrested in the Moss Side area early Friday, according the police. Eight suspects were in custody. Two other people were released after being detained. “I want to reassure people that the arrests that we have made are significant, and initial searches of premises have revealed items that we believe are very important to the investigation,” Manchester’s top police official, Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, said at a news conference. “These searches will take several days to complete, as you would expect. Therefore, there will be some disruption. However, it is very important that we continue with these searches.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved on Thursday the most sweeping sanctions against Iran since the United States and five other nations reached an agreement with Tehran in 2015 to sharply limit that nation’s nuclear capability, and the committee warned Russia that it was almost certain to be the next target. Because Iran has complied with the nuclear accord, the Senate committee had to find other reasons to impose the sanctions, and linked the penalties to Iran’s continued support for terrorism and its human rights violations, among other concerns. But the timing of the long-planned punishment was awkward, coming right after Iranians overwhelmingly re-elected President Hassan Rouhani, who has moved to expand personal freedoms in the country and integrate its economy with the West. The Trump administration has supported new sanctions against Iran, which were approved 18 to 3 by the committee and could receive a full Senate vote as early as next month. But Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had pleaded for more time before new sanctions were imposed on Russia, hoping to use the first few months of the Trump administration to fundamentally change a relationship he recently said had hit its lowest point in years. Lawmakers on Thursday strongly hinted that they were no longer interested in giving Mr. Tillerson much additional rope, and the drive in both parties to impose sanctions is a clear outgrowth of the investigations into whether President Trump’s associates had improper connections to Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee — the committee’s Republican chairman and often a defender of Mr. Tillerson’s approach, to the chagrin of lawmakers in both parties who had hoped to pursue sanctions sooner — said he had seen “no difference whatsoever” in Russia’s conduct, citing its “work against our interest” in Syria.

"The United States can expect an Atlantic hurricane season with more than the usual number of storms, government forecasters said Thursday. The season, which begins June 1 and runs to Nov. 30, is likely to produce 11 to 17 named storms, experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. As many as nine of those could become hurricanes, with winds of 74 miles per hour or higher, and as many as four could be major hurricanes with winds of 111 m.p.h. or greater, also known as Category 3 or higher. In an average season, 12 named storms develop, and three of them become major hurricanes. The agency said there was only a 20 percent chance of a below-normal season this year. The Atlantic season is off to an early start with the brief appearance of a rare preseason tropical storm, Arlene, in April. Gerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said the agency anticipated warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, which can increase the power of storms. But forecasters expect weak or even nonexistent El Niño conditions; that weather phenomenon, which warms the waters of the Pacific Ocean, tends to suppress Atlantic storms. In 2016, NOAA forecast 10 to 16 named storms; fifteen storms developed, including four hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. Kerry A. Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that publicizing the annual hurricane forecasts can be “inadvertently misleading.” Whatever the number of named storms, he said, the real concern is the number of damaging storms that actually reach land and affect people and property — and “no one pretends to be able to forecast the incidence of dangerous, landfalling storms.” An active season might not include any storms that strike the United States, while a quiet season can still produce hurricanes like Andrew in 1992, one of the most destructive to hit the country. Regardless of the forecast, being ready for storms — knowing one’s personal risk, buying flood insurance, discussing an evacuation plan and storing emergency supplies — is vitally important, said Mary Erickson, the deputy director of the National Weather Service. “Preparedness saves lives,” she said. NOAA said it was offering new tools online to help people determine their risk from approaching storms, including more precise predictions of a storm’s arrival time than have previously been available. This year’s hurricane outlook arrives as the White House is proposing budget cuts for NOAA programs, which could undermine initiatives intended to strengthen the agency’s forecasts. David W. Titley, a former chief operating officer at NOAA, said the proposal would be dead on arrival in Congress. Lawmakers recently passed a bill calling for more funding for forecasting, so “there’s no way they’re going to approve this,” he said. The forecasting bill, he noted, was signed last month by President Trump. "
"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — In March, Mark Zuckerberg visited the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., the site of a mass murder by a white supremacist. Last month, he went to Dayton, Ohio, to sit down with recovering opioid addicts at a rehabilitation center. And he spent an afternoon in Blanchardville, Wis., with Jed Gant, whose family has owned a dairy and beef cattle farm for six generations. These were all stops along a road trip by Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, across the United States this year. His goal: to visit every state in the union and learn more about a sliver of the nearly two billion people who regularly use the social network. On Thursday, in a commencement speech at Harvard, from which he dropped out in 2005, Mr. Zuckerberg discussed how his views on how people live and work with one another had broadened, partly as a result of what he has seen on the tour. He said he had come to realize that churches, civic centers and other organized meeting places are integral to building and maintaining a strong sense of community. "
"BERLIN — The contrast could not have been more stark. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany started Thursday in Berlin with the 44th president — the one she has called “dear Barack.” She spent the afternoon in Brussels with the 45th, Donald J. Trump, whose election she greeted with a stern reminder to respect shared values like equality and freedom. Mr. Obama was in Berlin to help celebrate 500 years since Martin Luther’s Reformation, and received a rock-star welcome from tens of thousands at the Brandenburg Gate. It was all bonhomie, waves and warm words, as the former president praised Ms. Merkel’s “outstanding work, not just here but around the world,” particularly with refugees. Barely two hours later, Ms. Merkel was among the European leaders who greeted Mr. Trump coolly at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where few casual words, let alone warm ones, were exchanged, as the new American president once again castigated allies for not paying their fair share of bills. For Europeans, the juxtaposition served as an unavoidable reminder of the contrasts between the men — their personal styles, their relations with America’s allies and the values and priorities they embody. It was also a demonstration, however coincidental, of the political shadow boxing that has found an unlikely arena in Europe, the new center of the contest between liberal democracy and far-right populism. While Mr. Obama is the leader Europe prefers, Mr. Trump’s sudden ascendance has been seen as a challenge to America’s commitment to Europe, both its unity and its security, as well as the values that underpin the Western alliance.

"Through June 30. Meredith Ward Fine Art, 44 East 74th Street, Suite G, Manhattan; 212-744-7306, meredithwardfineart.com. The history of art is full of surprises. The latest is “Flora Crockett: Works From the 1940s and 1950s” at Meredith Ward Fine Art on the Upper East Side. In 2015 I reviewed this forgotten painter’s first solo show in New York since 1946 (also at Meredith Ward), and wondered how many more female artists awaited rediscovery. I should have wondered what further revelations Ms. Crockett’s work held. One is certainly Meredith Ward’s second Crockett exhibition; it is even better than the first, which focused on works from the ’60s and ’70s. As seen here, Ms. Crockett’s earlier works are even more confident and witty than what she produced later. They pull together several strands — Surrealism, biomorphism, a prescient Pop Art buoyancy — in ways that almost always seem just right, supported by an unerring color sense and broad knowledge of the various ways oil paint can be applied to canvas. This all seems remarkably up-to-date: Several paintings could easily be from our new century. Smoke and clouds are a thing. In one painting, smoke rings of white and celadon float above a dark-purple femurlike form against a beautiful red-on-cream crosshatch pattern startlingly similar to that which Jasper Johns employed in the 1970s. In another, a current of smoke wafts across the painting like a lazy jet stream, through a levitating circle seemingly made of shiny red ribbon, while the background pattern is green-on-green, a camouflagelike brocade. Sometimes Ms. Crockett, who died in 1979, seems to respond to her contemporaries. There are signs of Hans Hofmann’s push-pull forms and rectilinear compositions reminiscent of Myron Stout and Burgoyne Diller. But these allusions don’t detract; in fact, they indicate a compelling, unthreatened awareness. This show is a must-see, not least for budding art historians seeking a thesis subject. ROBERTA SMITH Through June 4. Reena Spaulings, 165 East Broadway, Manhattan; 212-477-5006, reenaspaulings.com. Juliana Huxtable is a transgender model, D.J., writer and artist whose most prominent art world exposure to date has been as the nude subject of an iridescent 3-D sculpture by Frank Benson at the 2015 New Museum Triennial, where her photographs were also on display. Ms. Huxtable’s current show, “A Split During Laughter at the Rally,” at Reena Spaulings on the Lower East Side, reverses that dynamic: Rather than her body, Ms. Huxtable’s voice — funny, acerbic, malicious even — is on display.

"Remember when Ronald Reagan body slammed a reporter to the cheers of the conservative grassroots? Neither do I. Yet in the aftermath of the assault on Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian, by Greg Gianforte, the Republican candidate for a special House election in Montana, too many conservatives are either doubting the event occurred, despite audio evidence and witness testimony by a Fox News crew, or praising Mr. Gianforte for giving the press what it deserves. Ben is a friend of mine, who stood up for me when I was grabbed and bruised by one of Donald Trump’s campaign managers, Corey Lewandowski, during the Republican primary. His assault was far more brutal than mine — and given the report from Fox News journalists in the room, he understated the violence. But like Ben, I faced skepticism and accusations. Despite the fact that there was audio evidence of my attack and a Washington Post reporter had witnessed the incident, many conservatives said I was lying. When video came out proving my account, those who labeled me a hoaxer changed their tune to suggest I deserved what I got. From the age of the Gipper to our era of the Groper, the state of our politics has declined drastically. It’s hard to imagine the late, great William F. Buckley cheering on a politician who assaulted a reporter. But Buckley’s nephew, Brent Bozell, did just that on Twitter in the aftermath of the Jacobs’s incident. “Jacobs is an obnoxious, dishonest first class jerk. I’m not surprised he got smacked,” Mr. Bozell, who runs the conservative Media Research Institute, tweeted. In the United States today, it seems all politics has become entirely situational, and Republicans have put party over civility. Had Ben been attacked by a Democrat, many on the right who are refusing to believe the assault occurred — or outright praising it — would be hailing him as a victim of liberal rage. Had Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, rather than Mr. Trump’s, grabbed my arm, I would not have been abandoned by many of my friends and mentors at Fox News, or my employer, Breitbart News. But I was inconvenient to their political narrative. Will Republican politicians condemn Mr. Gianforte? If not, we’ll have many more people to blame for the delegitimization of the press than President Trump. "
"As soon as it was released, President Trump’s budget, titled “A New Foundation for American Greatness,” was characterized by politicians and ordinary human beings of various leanings as the manifesto of someone who seemed to wish he were running a Victorian orphanage. Greatness, in the context of the administration’s economic ideology, is built on a ground laid thick with self-abnegation. It is demanded not on the part of the well off, who are mandated instead to indulge themselves — spending the money they might have otherwise paid in taxes on Jet Skis and lake houses — but from those who are not typically in a position to decide whether it’s wild Alaskan salmon or a grass-fed rib-eye for dinner tonight. Food is something we expect to enjoy every day, though of course many poor people lack that kind of access. The proposed budget would make it considerably more difficult for them, cutting the country’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) by 25 percent; $192 billion over 10 years. While the budget has little chance of passing in its current form, even a meager reduction to the program — a fraction of that astronomical sum, reached as a compromise — would have enormous consequences in major cities, where rising housing costs the past several years have made food insecurity an increasingly daunting issue. In San Francisco, for instance, though it is the birthplace of the modern culinary revolution, one in four residents struggles with hunger. Monitoring activity at food pantries and soup kitchens is often a good way of gauging whether SNAP is meeting the needs of a particular community, because recipients typically avail themselves of these services after their monthly benefits have run out. In fall 2013, SNAP was cut by $5 billion, returning it, roughly, to its funding level before the recession. Those dealing with food insecurity in New York were already facing an annual shortfall of 241 million meals, according to a paper by the Food Bank of New York City, the city’s largest hunger relief organization, which supplies food to pantries. Margarette Purvis, its president, explained recently that the impact then was nearly immediate, with patrons arriving, for the most part, two weeks into the month rather than three. Their SNAP dollars were getting them only so far. “And it is not as if we have seen a reduction in the number of poor people since then,” Ms. Purvis qualified. “There is a lot of anxiety.” Many food pantries are already undersupplied and don’t have adequate staffing. A recent study conducted by the Food Bank found that 79 percent of the pantries and soup kitchens it surveyed were still grappling to fill the gaps inherited since the 2013 federal cuts. At one of the biggest food pantries in the city, the BedStuy Campaign Against Hunger in Brooklyn, Melony Samuels, the executive director, has observed two disturbing trends. For many months, need has been on an upward trajectory, even as fewer immigrants have come in since the presidential election, a result, she said, of a fear that immigration officials will raid the place. She has also seen a significant increase in the use of the organization’s mobile units, she told me, because more people feel they can’t absorb the cost of transportation to the pantry itself. At the same time, her stocks have been running consistently low on produce, and the group doesn’t have the resources to buy as much as it needs. "
"BOZEMAN, Mont. — Greg Gianforte, a wealthy Montana Republican who was charged with assaulting a reporter on Wednesday, nonetheless won the state’s lone seat in the House of Representatives on Thursday, according to The Associated Press, in a special election held up as a test of the country’s political climate. Mr. Gianforte, 56, was widely seen as a favorite to win against Rob Quist, a Democrat and country music singer. But he seemed to imperil his own candidacy in the final hours of the race after he manhandled a journalist for The Guardian. Addressing the altercation for the first time late Thursday night, Mr. Gianforte apologized to the Guardian reporter, Ben Jacobs, by name, acknowledged he “made a mistake” and vowed to the state’s voters that he would not embarrass them again. “You deserve a congressman who stays out of the limelight and just gets the job done,” he said to a group of supporters at a hotel in Bozeman, who repeatedly yelled out that they forgave him. Voters here shrugged off the episode and handed Republicans a convincing victory. Mr. Gianforte took slightly more than 50 percent of the vote to about 44 percent for Mr. Quist. (President Trump won Montana by about 20 percentage points.) Mr. Gianforte’s success underscored the limitations of the Democrats’ strategy of highlighting the House’s health insurance overhaul and relying on liberal anger toward the president, at least in red-leaning states. “Montana sent a strong message tonight that we want a congressman who will work with President Trump to make America and Montana great again,” Mr. Gianforte said in remarks shortly after he was declared the winner.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump condemned “leaks of sensitive information” after Britain implied that U.S. officials disclosed details from the Manchester terror inquiry. “My administration will get to the bottom of this,” Mr. Trump vowed. The New York Times responded to criticism for publishing crime scene photographs of the bomb and reporting where it had been placed: “Our coverage of Monday’s horrific attack has been both comprehensive and responsible.” (The full statement is embedded in the article.) Here’s the latest on the bombing investigation. Above, the scene in Manchester today. _____ 2. In Brussels, President Trump again backed away from endorsing NATO’s mutual defense policy, which has been the foundation of the alliance since World War II. "
"Around midday on Wednesday, The New York Times published several photographs showing, in eerie detail, the makeshift shrapnel, shredded blue backpack and powerful lead acid battery used by the Manchester bomber who killed 22 people. The story accompanying the photos, describing the forensic evidence and crime scene found by investigators, said the bomber’s torso had been heaved toward the entrance of the Manchester Arena. Nothing in the story directly states the source of the material but it says the evidence was photographed and distributed by British authorities. Now, British officials are accusing U.S. intelligence of leaking the material, saying it could seriously impede an investigation into the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain in more than a decade. Following complaints by Prime Minister Theresa May, President Trump has called for a Justice Department investigation into the “alleged leaks.” Why did The Times publish the evidence and how did it weigh the public interest in the information against any potential damage to the investigation? Dean Baquet, the executive editor, said he understands why some readers are concerned but he stands by the decision. It is rarely an easy decision when editors are weighing the public’s right to know against government concerns that publishing certain information might jeopardize investigations. In this case, the decision to publish has generated hundreds of emails from readers expressing a mix of fury and disappointment at The Times’s decision. “In many instances there is a strong public interest case for publishing information leaked by government officials, and in a number of those, a justification for doing so rapidly,” wrote Charles Worringham of Queensland, Australia. “I cannot immediately see any such justification for the NYT’s rapid publication of photos of the Manchester bombing (forensic close-ups of the detonator, backpack) that have apparently been leaked by U.S. officials, while police investigations are still at an early stage and their publication could potentially hinder or disrupt those investigations. While the blame could be laid at the feet of the leakers, I would ask the NYT to respond to the position that running the story so quickly potentially damages the broader public interest (i.e. avoiding the possibility of compromising investigations), rather than serving it.” Here’s another from Bradley Tice of Orange, Conn.: “The photos are virtually meaningless to people, but appeal to prurient interests. The New York Times has shared evidence that is meaningful to people who have aided and abetted these terrorists and may help them evade capture.” "

"One of the greatest political mysteries of our time is why President Trump has clung — and continues to cling — so steadfastly to the perfidious Michael Flynn. Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, is at the nexus of Trump’s problems. There was Flynn’s lobbying on behalf of Turkey and his contacts with Russia. There was Trump’s dismissal of all warnings to steer clear of Flynn; his refusal to fire Flynn as soon as he was alerted to the fact that Flynn posed a security risk; his efforts to impede or even terminate the investigations of Flynn. Not only has Trump staunchly defended Flynn — even after firing him — he is apparently still in contact with him, sending him encouraging messages. As Michael Isikoff reported last week for Yahoo News about a dinner Flynn convened with “a small group of loyalists”: This level of extreme fealty is puzzling. It extends beyond basic loyalty to an early supporter. It seems to me that there is something else at play here, something as yet unknown. Trump’s attachment to Flynn strikes me less as an act of fidelity and more as an exercise in fear. What does Flynn know that Trump doesn’t want the world to know? What are the dirty details of what could only be called The Flynn Affair? Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, who served as head of the Trump transition team before being brushed aside for Vice President Mike Pence, said he warned Trump about Flynn. As Christie said earlier this week: “I didn’t think that he was someone who would bring benefit to the president or to the administration, and I made that very clear to candidate Trump, and I made it very clear to President-elect Trump.” Christie continued: “If I were president-elect of the United States, I wouldn’t let General Flynn into the White House, let alone give him a job.” Trump apparently ignored the warning. Barack Obama warned Trump not to hire Flynn. As The New York Times reported earlier this month: Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, warned Trump about Flynn. As The Times reported earlier this month, when she delivered mesmerizing testimony before a Senate subcommittee, Yates informed the White House, less than a week into the Trump administration, that Flynn had lied to Pence about his Russian contacts and was vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow.
