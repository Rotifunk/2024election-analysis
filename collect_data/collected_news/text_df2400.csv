"LONDON — Much of the world’s attention at the Group of 20 economic summit on Friday and Saturday will be on President Trump’s first meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, with strenuous efforts to decipher the nature of the long-distance bromance between them. But the leader of the world’s other superpower, Xi Jinping of China, will also be in Hamburg, Germany, ready to slip quietly into the widening gap between Mr. Trump and longtime European allies and to position Beijing as the globe’s newest, biggest defender of a multilateral, rules-based system. Mr. Xi will have just concluded a state visit with Germany, including bilateral meetings and a small dinner Tuesday night in Berlin with the summit host, Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has made no secret of her differences with Mr. Trump. Having helped Ms. Merkel open the Berlin Zoo’s new $10 million panda garden (complete with two new Chinese pandas), and watched a German-Chinese youth soccer match, Mr. Xi will have already made a mark. He has cemented his closeness to Germany and Ms. Merkel, the woman many consider not just the most important leader in Europe, but also the reluctant, de facto leader of the West. “The election of Trump has facilitated China’s aims in Europe,” said Angela Stanzel, an Asia scholar at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Only “self-restraint” is keeping war at bay on the Korean Peninsula. That blunt assessment by the top American general in South Korea underscores the gravity of tensions over North Korea’s test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. The U.S. and South Korea responded with a missile drill, and the U.N. Security Council met. A surgical strike against North Korea would risk “staggering casualties,” our correspondent writes. Frustrated that China has not reined in the North, President Trump seemed to threaten the U.S. trade relationship. But our analysis suggests that China is likely to do little, or nothing, to restrain its troublesome ally. Markets in Asia appeared to shrug off the situation, closing mostly higher. _____ • North Korea is hardly the only pressing issue as China’s president, Xi Jinping, met for a second day with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany ahead of the G-20 summit meeting beginning tomorrow in Hamburg.

"WASHINGTON — Somewhere on the road between here and Pennsylvania, the idea began to take root for Chrissy Houlahan: “I can’t not run.” The daughter and granddaughter of Navy pilots, Ms. Houlahan had served 16 years as an Air Force engineer on active duty and in the Reserves. But in January, between conversations on a bus bound for the Women’s March and thoughts about her father, a Holocaust survivor rattled by the presidential election, she felt it was time to serve again. In April, Ms. Houlahan, 50, who most recently worked as head of a nonprofit organization devoted to childhood literacy, entered the Democratic primary to challenge Representative Ryan A. Costello, a second-term Republican from the suburbs northwest of Philadelphia. “I really do believe that we are in dangerous times,” she said. Ms. Houlahan is among about 20 military veterans who have announced that they will run as Democrats for the House of Representatives next year. Democratic Party leaders are aggressively seeking former members of the military in hopes of increasing their appeal among the sort of frustrated voters who elected President Trump — and winning back the 24 seats they need to regain the Republican-controlled House. In many cases, those veterans say they feel called to run for public office in response to Mr. Trump himself, whose policies they see as a threat to the country’s values and security. Democratic officials also see candidates with a military pedigree as an appealing contrast to entrenched, career politicians. And they believe that candidates with military service help the party counter Republican claims that Democrats are weak on national security. "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — An American soldier was killed and two others were wounded in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, the United States military said in a statement on Wednesday. Pfc. Hansen B. Kirkpatrick, 19, of Wasilla, Alaska, died on Monday in the Nawa District of Helmand, the United States military said. Capt. Bill Salvin, a spokesman for the military, said that the death was the result of indirect fire, and that Private Kirkpatrick was part of a counterterrorism unit that was carrying out a mission in Nawa. The wounds of the other two soldiers were not considered life-threatening, the military said. Private Kirkpatrick became the eighth American service member to die in Afghanistan so far this year, according to the site iCasualties, which tracks military casualties. Around 8,800 American troops are now in Afghanistan, serving a dual mission of training and advising Afghan forces against a resurgent Taliban and carrying out counterterrorism missions. President Trump is expected to announce in coming weeks the addition of a few thousand more troops to the mission as part of a new strategy. In Helmand, long a center of Taliban strength, about 300 American Marines are advising Afghan security forces and trying to prevent the loss of more territory to the insurgents. The insurgents have pushed as far as the gates of the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, which is protected by a heavy belt of security. Nawa District, just outside Lashkar Gah, fell to the Taliban last year, and the Afghan forces advised by the Marines have been preparing an operation to retake the district. Officials in Helmand said that Private Kirkpatrick died during efforts by Afghan commandos, supported by American air power and Special Operations forces, to target Taliban fighters who were preparing to launch further attacks on Lashkar Gah. “Over the past three days, a joint effort is underway to disrupt the momentum of the Taliban in Nawa District, because Nawa is becoming a growing threat for the capital of Helmand,” said Abdul Karim Attal, head of the Helmand provincial council.

"To the Editor: Re “The Way Forward on North Korea” (editorial, July 5): North Korea’s successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially reach Alaska has reduced to ashes the United States policy of the last three presidents. We have tried turning on the screws, joint military exercises, sanctions and relying on China, and this finely tuned strategy has failed. Talking to Kim Jong-un’s government is, and has long been, the only reasonable solution. Otherwise, the options are narrow: continuation of an outdated policy or war. ROBERT CAMBRIA, NEW YORK The writer is former coordinator of the Committee for a New Korea Policy. To the Editor: This editorial rightly points out that relying on China and sanctions have not worked with regard to North Korea. But diplomatic measures simply will not work. North Korea has continuously refined and improved its nuclear program. The Agreed Framework signed in 1994 merely froze the North’s plutonium program. In 2002, we discovered evidence that the North had been advancing a separate highly enriched uranium program all along. The idea that engaging with the North this time will lead to a better result is, to me, the definition of insanity. It’s time to take military action and rid North Korea of all its nuclear capabilities. The alternative, doing nothing, is far more dangerous. DANIEL S. SMITH
NORTHVILLE, MICH. To the Editor: "
"Heathcote Williams, a poet, playwright, actor, lyricist, painter, sculptor, magician and relentless scourge of the British establishment for half a century, died on Saturday in Oxford. He was 75. His daughter Lily Williams said the cause was lung disease. Mr. Williams, a radical in the tradition of Blake and Shelley, vented his outrage at royal privilege, private property, environmental degradation and a host of other targets, using every artistic means available. He took dead aim at enforced conformity, the stupefying effects of television and the malign intentions of mental health professionals in plays like “AC/DC.” “If you were to take the exploding typewriter of William Burroughs, add a soupçon of sophistication from Marshall McLuhan, a little popular science, a few comic books and a dash of popular psychology, and then stew the whole thing up with hate, then I suppose you might come out with a play such as Heathcote Williams’s ‘AC/DC,’ ” Clive Barnes of The New York Times wrote in 1970, reviewing a production of Mr. Williams’s play at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In the 1960s, Mr. Williams wrote for the radical vegetarian publication The Seed and the animal-rights magazine The Beast. In 1969, he joined with the feminist Germaine Greer and his girlfriend at the time, the model Jean Shrimpton, to found the alternative sex magazine Suck. He became a leader of the squatter movement in the 1970s, directing homeless Londoners to available space through his agency Ruff Tuff Cream Puff. He also helped create the Free and Independent Republic of Frestonia, an anarchist country within a country, named after a nearby street, Freston Road. Located in the Notting Hill neighborhood, it issued its own passports and stamps and applied to the United Nations for full membership. Geoffrey Howe, then the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer, named Mr. Williams Frestonia’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. "
"Even amid the cacophony of Times Square, the sounds of telephones ringing every seven to nine minutes are hard to miss. No, it’s not coming from your pocket or your purse, and no, you’re not imagining things. The source of the calls — and of the curiosity of passers-by — is three phone booths in Duffy Square, between 45th and 47th Streets. Yes, phone booths: They may be reminiscent of a yesteryear largely confined to the movies, but they are now back for public use. Well, sort of. Salvaged from LinkNYC, the city program replacing pay phones with Wi-Fi kiosks, the booths are part of the latest installation from Times Square Arts, the public art program of the Times Square Alliance. The project, “Once Upon a Place,” by Aman Mojadidi and on view through Sept. 5, examines the immigrant experience through oral histories presented in the form of phone calls, broadly touching on themes of belonging and displacement. “The idea of the stories and use of the phone booths were conceived together,” said Mr. Mojadidi, an Afghan-American artist. “I was already fascinated with the removal of phone booths and the fact that they were dying out. I’ve used them quite a bit before mobile phones came, so to see them start to go away, I figured you could imagine all the stories that have already been told through phone booths.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Self-restraint” is the only thing stopping the U.S. and South Korea from going to war with the North — so says the highest-ranking American general on the peninsula. As the two nations conducted a rare joint missile exercise, above, the South’s defense minister said that the intercontinental ballistic missile that the North tested this week had the potential to reach Hawaii. Our correspondent took a close look at the military options to confront the North. Her verdict: “more grim than ever.” _____ "
"Jeffrey A. Zucker hasn’t been getting a lot of sleep lately. But he says that’s nothing new. “I don’t sleep that much anyway,” Mr. Zucker, the president of CNN, said on Wednesday in his fifth-floor office, just off the network’s glassy Midtown Manhattan newsroom. A television executive with a reputation for pugilism — a plaque above his desk reads “Punch Today in the Face” — Mr. Zucker, 52, has weathered decades of battles in his industry. But he and CNN are in the middle of their most intense bout yet: an unlikely public fight with the leader of the free world. It is rare that a single news organization attracts the level of ire mustered by President Trump, who over the weekend posted on Twitter a video that portrayed him wrestling a figure with the logo of CNN for a head. But the president’s denunciations — in stinging tweets and slashing speeches, in phrases like “fraud news” and “garbage journalism” — have far outstripped his criticisms of other prominent news outlets, like The New York Times or The Washington Post. And his attacks have spawned a cottage industry of Trump supporters who have declared a digital war of sorts against CNN, including gotcha videos of network employees and threatening messages sent to anchors’ cellphones. The onslaught has contributed to a foxhole-like mentality inside CNN’s offices, where security measures have been tightened and some hosts have considered abandoning their social media accounts because of abuse. Other employees, like Chris Cuomo, co-anchor of the morning show “New Day,” insist that the scrutiny has only galvanized them further. “I’m comfortable going to work in Thunderdome every day,” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview, referring to the steel-cage fighting venue of the “Mad Max” movies.

"ALBANY — Every 20 years, New Yorkers have the chance to vote whether they want to hold a constitutional convention to amend, tweak or otherwise improve the founding document of the state. For the past half-century, voters have demurred. This year, however, academics, good-government groups and others believe the outcome of the ballot question in November may be different. And — perhaps no surprise — it has something to do with the current occupant of the White House. “Trump’s election emphasizes how valuable it is for states to chart their own course,” said Peter J. Galie, author of “Ordered Liberty: A Constitutional History of New York” and a professor of political science at Canisius College in Buffalo. “We can put a right to clean air and water in our Constitution. If we want to add more labor protections, we can do it. That’s the beauty of federalism.” But before voters confront the ballot question, they will no doubt be barraged by campaigns for and against a constitutional convention, affectionately called Con-Con. Nonprofit groups interested in issues including campaign finance reform, redistricting, term limits and the legalization of marijuana have come out in favor of a convention. They argue that the state Legislature is unlikely to take up these thorny, politically treacherous topics. At the same time, unions like the United Federation of Teachers and state legislative leaders have argued against a convention, saying it could repeal hallowed protections. There are some offbeat — some might say flaky — positions that advocates say could come about only during a constitutional convention. They include calls for a unicameral Legislature — doing away with the Assembly or Senate — and the division of the state into autonomous regions, with separate regional governors and legislatures. "
"DOHA, Qatar — A deadline passed and nobody blinked, so now a high-stakes geopolitical feud in the Middle East looks set to stretch further into the summer. The confrontation between Qatar and its neighbors worsened on Wednesday as four Arab nations vowed to press ahead with the punishing air, sea and diplomatic blockade they imposed one month ago after they accused Qatar of financing terrorism and working too closely with Iran. Qatar rejected an ultimatum that expired on Tuesday to meet a long list of demands. Meeting in Cairo, foreign ministers from the four blockading countries — Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain — said they were “disappointed” by the response to their demands, and stepped up their criticism of Qatar, which they say is meddling in the affairs of their countries. “Qatar’s role as a saboteur can no longer be forgiven,” said Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry. The four countries have issued 13 demands, including the closing of Al Jazeera, Qatar’s influential television channel, and, more broadly, the abandonment of Qatar’s foreign policy, which includes support for a wide variety of Islamist factions. In London, Qatar’s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, accused his country’s foes of “clear aggression” and said Qatar was ready for a lengthy standoff, having developed new supply routes for food, construction materials and other imports. He singled out Saudi Arabia and the Emirates as the main foes of Qatar, accusing them of seeking to make it surrender its sovereignty. "
"A new president inexperienced in the intricacies of superpower politics meets his Russian rival for the first time. There are disputes over Crimea, nuclear weapons and completely different conceptions of an acceptable status quo as Washington and Moscow vie for global influence. The Americans arrive with an unclear agenda; the Russians have a very clear one. While it sounds like the coming encounter between President Trump and the current Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin — scheduled for Friday — this actually was a description of President John F. Kennedy’s first face-to-face session with Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev of the Soviet Union in June 1961. “You know, Mr. Kennedy, we voted for you,” Khrushchev said, as he recalled in his 1970 memoir. It is a line that, if one believes American intelligence reports, Mr. Putin could repeat, but probably will not. But it is the other lessons of that meeting in Vienna — which stretched over two days, three meals, a clumsy effort by Khrushchev to charm Jackie Kennedy and a tough one to threaten her husband — that might be useful to the Trump White House. It was one of the most remarkable leader-to-leader encounters of the Cold War, a story of caution about the dangers of walking into such a session without clear strategic goals. Minutes after the meeting was over, Kennedy told James Reston of The New York Times that it had been an incredibly rough session, for which he had been ill-prepared. “Worst thing in my life,” Kennedy said, according to later histories of the event. “He savaged me.” (Mr. Reston, perhaps protecting the background nature of the conversation even long after Kennedy’s death, did not quote the conversation directly in his memoir, “Deadline.”) "
"WASHINGTON — The White House is backing a health care proposal that would make it easier for insurance companies to avoid complying with consumer protection standards, siding with some of the most conservative senators, though Senate Republican leaders remain leery of the idea. The proposal, advanced by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, is one of many being analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office as Senate Republicans try to muster votes for their bill to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. It could help bring balking conservatives, such as Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, aboard, but it may do little to ease the concerns of moderates like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Under the proposal, insurers could sell almost any kind of health plan they wanted as long as they also offered at least one plan that complied with federal mandates like those in the Affordable Care Act, including coverage for maternity care and mental health services. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Marc Short, President Trump’s director of legislative affairs, said over the weekend that they supported the proposal. On Wednesday, Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said on Twitter that he would back the Senate’s health bill if it included the Cruz plan. The proposal would guarantee access to “at least one Obamacare-compliant plan,” Mr. Lee said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” And, he said, consumers would also have less expensive options. Mr. Cruz says his plan would fix a problem he sees in the Affordable Care Act. “Obamacare’s insurance mandates caused premiums to skyrocket,” he said in a summary given to Republican senators. One of those mandates requires insurers to cover 10 types of benefits, including drug abuse treatment, prescription drugs and pediatric care. "
"BEIJING — North Korea is not a problem that can be solved. As much as the West may engage in wishful thinking about a revolution, the Kim family regime has survived far longer than almost anyone predicted. Even today, it shows no signs of collapsing, and the North Koreans show no signs of rebelling en masse. Does anyone actually think that with another round of sanctions the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, will suddenly give up power and North Koreans will all become liberal democrats? Or that somehow Washington could brandish enough aircraft carriers that the North Korean military and political establishment will surrender? The widespread mocking of Kim Jong-un as a freakish buffoon is a sign of our misguided approach. Viewing him as a joke is a mistake not because it’s rude, but because it contributes to a dangerous underestimation of his power. Mr. Kim has managed to rule for almost six years as a brutal totalitarian dictator. He may be many things, but he is not a lightweight. Leaders do not survive under such circumstances without being superb politicians. Sanctions and threats haven’t worked in the past, and more of the same most certainly will not work in the future. As his father and grandfather did, Mr. Kim meets pressure with pressure. It is no surprise that a surge in missile tests came as the Trump administration has made threats about sending aircraft carriers and potential pre-emptive strikes. North Korea isn’t unpredictable; rather, it is the most predictable country on earth. The North Koreans are also very calculating. By aiming test missiles at Japan, Pyongyang is sending a clear signal: Take a preventive shot at our missile sites, and we will take a shot at Japan, most likely at the roughly 50,000 American military personnel stationed at United States bases there. It would not be the start of a second Korean War, but rather a poke for a poke. Would the United States really want to up the ante a second time? Would Japan, China and South Korea want to? "
"Immigration lawyers in Miami-Dade County are challenging its practice of jailing people on behalf of federal immigration authorities, in a case that could test the Trump administration’s attempts to pressure so-called sanctuary cities and counties. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Federal District Court in Miami, lawyers representing a local resident, Garland Creedle, argued that the county had violated his Fourth Amendment right against unlawful seizure. The practice at issue is one in which federal immigration authorities send requests, known as detainers, to local police departments or jails asking them to hold people they are about to release so that immigration authorities can go arrest them. During his first week in office, President Trump signed an executive order threatening to withhold billions of federal dollars from cities and counties that ignored detainers, saying that such places, sometimes known as sanctuary cities, were helping to harbor dangerous criminals. Shortly after Mr. Trump signed the order, the Miami-Dade mayor, Carlos A. Giménez, directed his corrections department to honor the requests, saying the county could not afford to lose funding. So after Mr. Creedle, 18, posted bail in March in a domestic dispute case, which was later dropped, he was held in custody overnight on the suspicion that he was an undocumented immigrant. The detainer was not only unconstitutional, Mr. Creedle’s lawyers said, but also uncalled for. Mr. Creedle was born in Honduras but gained United States citizenship through his father, who is also a citizen. The government let him go once it realized the mistake. “It goes to show just how sloppy this is,” said Rebecca Sharpless, a lawyer representing Mr. Creedle and the head of the University of Miami Law School’s immigration clinic. “What immigration does is check a box on a boilerplate form saying they have probable cause to hold someone in custody, and that is supposed to be constitutionally sufficient to detain them.” "
"LONDON — By inserting itself on Sunday into the case of a brain-damaged, terminally ill British infant, the Vatican drew attention to the precarious intersection of ethics and biomedicine, an area in which both theology and regulation have struggled to keep pace with technological advances. The infant, Charlie Gard, is on life support in a London hospital. He has a rare genetic disorder that prevents his cells from producing the energy needed to sustain his organs. He cannot move or breathe on his own. The hospital has won a series of court rulings — the final one was last week — allowing it to turn off the ventilation and feeding machines that keep Charlie alive. Charlie’s parents, however, have fought a battle to prolong his life, maintaining that an experimental therapy in the United States might possibly save him, even though courts have reviewed the evidence and decided that terminating life support is the only humane option. Although the parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, exhausted their legal appeals last week, they found new allies in Pope Francis and President Trump, who offered statements of support. “My sense is that Pope Francis first objects to the state usurping the role of the parents to determine their child’s best interests,” O. Carter Snead, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame and the director of its Center for Ethics and Culture, said in an email. “Pope Francis believes, along with Charlie’s parents, that his life — all life — is worth fighting for, regardless of the presence of disability.” But John M. Haas, the president of the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, who has counseled dozens of Catholic parents with children suffering from incurable diseases or on life support, said the church teaching was clear that it was not morally necessary to provide life-sustaining treatment if there was no hope of improvement.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on schedule during the first half of 2017, but its plans for the second half of the year are less clear, according to minutes of the Fed’s most recent meeting in June. Officials debated how soon to start reducing the Fed’s securities portfolio, as the sluggishness of inflation and the exuberance of investors continued to concern them. At the June meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate for the third consecutive quarter, to a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. It also published a plan for paring its substantial holdings of $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, acquired after the financial crisis to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The Fed has said that it wants to begin the balance sheet plan this year. The minutes of the June meeting said several officials wanted to start “within a couple of months,” while others favored waiting, suggesting that officials are debating whether to begin in September or wait until December. The Fed published the meeting account Wednesday after a standard three-week delay. Officials also disagreed about the likely impact of the plan. Some argued that balance sheet reductions were effectively the same as rate increases, while others predicted the plan would have only a modest economic effect. The differences are narrow because Fed officials remain confident in the strength of the economy. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, and other Fed officials have made clear that they are committed to reducing the Fed’s support for economic growth after years of hesitation. The Fed plans to raise its benchmark rate once more this year, which it says would push the rate to a neutral level that neither encourages nor discourages growth. "
"As Americans relaxed over a long Fourth of July weekend, the pro-Trump meme factories were gearing up for war. These online communities, which churn out lo-fi, shareable images and videos meant to amuse and energize President Trump’s social media supporters while provoking his enemies, were spurred to action by what, in their world, qualified as a series of seismic events. The first shock came on Sunday morning, when President Trump tweeted a video that depicted him in a professional wrestling arena attacking a man with a CNN logo superimposed on his head. The meme, or one very similar to it, had been created by a user on Reddit, the popular internet forum, and posted days earlier on /r/The_Donald, an active pro-Trump forum there, before making its way to the wider internet and, finally, to the 33.3 million Twitter followers of the leader of the free world. In the world of meme creators, where getting a presidential tweet is akin to having your artwork hung on the wall of the Smithsonian, President Trump’s post was cause for celebration. “Wow!! I never expected my meme to be retweeted by the God Emperor himself!!!” wrote the creator, a frequent poster on Reddit whose user name combines a vulgarity with the Star Wars character Han Solo. Days later, that Reddit user himself became a figure of national interest as news organizations checked his posting history and discovered that he had a record of creating memes that were racist and anti-Semitic. On Monday, a CNN reporter tracked down the identity of the user, who quickly deleted his posts, renounced his meme-creating ways, and apologized in a long, seemingly sincere post to /r/The_Donald. CNN declined to name the user, but said, somewhat mysteriously, that it “reserves the right” to publish his identity in the future if he continued to create offensive content. "
"CORPUS CHRISTI, Tex. — In a twist that would have been unthinkable only two years ago, the oil tanker that arrives in China today may be carrying crude that left the South Texas port of Corpus Christi instead of Saudi Arabia. Chinese drivers most certainly don’t care where their fuel comes from, but the export of American crude oil to dozens of countries over the last year is the latest chapter in a remarkable turnaround for the American oil and gas industry, about the only good news in three years of plummeting commodity prices, bankruptcies and layoffs. For 40 years it was virtually impossible to sell American oil to any country except Canada because of an export ban that was a bedrock of United States energy policy. The Obama administration slowly loosened the ban and Congress finally ended it in late 2015 in a compromise that also extended tax credits for renewable energy. Oil exports grew slowly through most of 2016, but this year there has been a surge reaching 1.3 million barrels a day — roughly 15 percent of domestic production — which even at today’s depressed prices is worth more than $1.5 billion a month. That may be only the beginning. In a test a few weeks ago, the French-flagged supertanker Anne, empty but capable of holding more than two million barrels of oil, docked safely at Occidental Petroleum’s year-old export terminal here. The docking of the 1,093-foot vessel, larger than any tanker to come into port previously in the Gulf of Mexico, is seen as the herald of an export boom, lifting the spirits of American oil executives despondent over the crumbling price of crude and sending ripples across global energy markets.

"When President Trump tweeted a video of himself wrestling a man with the logo of CNN for a head, he unintentionally gave the American people a window into the psychology of online trolling. The White House has not confirmed the origin of the video, which the president tweeted on Sunday with the message “#FraudNewsCNN #FNN.” But a Reddit user going by “HanAssholeSolo,” who had also posted racist and anti-Semitic images, claimed credit for creating a GIF that formed the basis of the video. On Sunday, the user wrote on Reddit that he was “honored” to have his work appropriated by the president, whom he called “the MAGA EMPORER [sic] himself.” But on Tuesday, after reporters at CNN had figured out his identity and attempted to contact him, he posted an apology on Reddit. “I was trolling and posting things to get a reaction,” he wrote, “and never meant any of the hateful things I said in those posts. I would never support any kind of violence or actions against others simply for what they believe in, their religion, or the lifestyle they choose to have.” He added that the GIF “was not meant to be a call to violence against CNN or any other news affiliation” and that “I have the highest respect for the journalist community and they put their lives on the line every day with the jobs that they do in reporting the news.” In his telling, Solo allowed himself to be corrupted and corroded by the attention he got on Reddit, posting bigoted, violent images just “to get a reaction.” This isn’t an excuse — the person who says something racist “as a joke” (a common defense) still commits a racist act. But if Mr. Solo’s apology is genuine, then at least he’s capable of seeing that what he did was wrong, and perhaps he’s capable of changing. "

"WARSAW — President Trump criticized China on Wednesday for failing to do more to pressure North Korea on its nuclear program, suggesting as he prepares for a high-stakes meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, this week that he is re-evaluating the United States trade relationship with Beijing in light of the growing provocations from Pyongyang. Mr. Trump vented his displeasure with China in a pair of early-morning tweets as he was departing on a trip to Warsaw, and to Hamburg, Germany, for the Group of 20 gathering of major world economies, where discussions about how to deal with the North Korean threat will be high on the agenda. He plans to hold meetings on the sidelines with Mr. Xi, as well as with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. “Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter,” Mr. Trump said in one of the tweets on Wednesday. “So much for China working with us — but we had to give it a try!” A few minutes earlier, he suggested that American trade agreements should be contingent on such cooperation. “The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history,” he wrote. “Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?” "
"A CNN story on Tuesday about an anonymous Reddit user who created a widely circulated video of President Trump wrestling the network’s logo to the ground has inspired multiple backlashes. Some criticized it as a form of blackmail. Others raised issues of journalism ethics over the network granting conditional anonymity to the user. The 28-second video and its source have been the subject of questions since Sunday morning, when the president tweeted it as he continued his attacks on the news media. The tweet, which was retweeted by the official presidential account, has become Mr. Trump’s most-shared post on Twitter, The Associated Press reported. CNN said on Tuesday that it had found and spoken to the Reddit user, who had apologized for creating the video and other posts that were racist and anti-Semitic, including one that added Jewish stars to photos of CNN personalities. A CNN reporter, Andrew Kaczynski, said he had confirmed the user’s identity and had spoken to him by phone. But the article by Mr. Kaczynski did not identify the user as anything more than a “private citizen.” Mr. Kaczynski later said on Twitter that the Reddit user was a “middle-aged man.” CNN wrote in the article that it was not publishing the user’s name “because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.” It continued: “CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.” The last line struck critics as sinister or as a veiled threat, a characterization Mr. Kaczynski strongly denied on Twitter. A hashtag, #CNNBlackmail, lit up among people, especially on the right, claiming CNN was pressuring the Reddit user not to mock the network again. "
"Seven years ago, a BP oil well blew out off Louisiana, causing the Deepwater Horizon drill rig to explode, killing 11 workers and releasing several million barrels of toxic crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. As co-chairmen of the bipartisan National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, we investigated the causes of the disaster and examined the offshore drilling industry to identify ways to reduce the risks it poses to workers, the public and the environment. Although Congress has refused to enact any of the commission’s safety recommendations, the Department of the Interior adopted many of them after extensive input from industry, government and the public. President Trump’s April 28 executive order on offshore energy threatens to abolish these safety improvements and, as he put it, start “the process of opening offshore areas” to energy exploration. He took a further step last week to expand oil and gas extraction in the environmentally sensitive outer continental shelf. The commission members are unanimous in their view that the actions proposed in the president’s executive order are unwise. As Americans flock to the nation’s beaches this summer, it is important to understand what Mr. Trump’s recent moves portend. Specifically, his executive order calls for the reconsideration of a critical safeguard that is the most important action the government has taken to reduce offshore drilling hazards. This safeguard, the well control rule, tightened controls on blowout preventers designed to stop explosions in undersea oil and gas wells. The rule was based in part on lessons the commission learned about the root cause of the BP disaster. Had this common-sense rule been in place on April 20, 2010, that calamity might well have been averted. Weakening or rescinding this rule would increase the risks of offshore operations, put workers in harm’s way and imperil marine waters and coastlines. "
"LOS ANGELES — Undocumented immigrant children detained by federal authorities are entitled to hearings to determine whether they should remain confined, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday. A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled that immigration authorities must abide by a 1997 legal settlement that established a policy for the detention, release and treatment of minors in immigration custody. That agreement, named the Flores settlement after the teenage girl who brought the original case, stipulated that a child in deportation proceedings be afforded a bond hearing before an immigration judge. The federal government had argued that Congress passed laws in 2002 and 2008 that abrogated the settlement, terminating the minors’ right to a bond hearing. The Ninth Circuit panel disagreed, saying that neither law abolished the bond-hearing requirement for unaccompanied minors. “Rather, the statutes leave ample room for immigration judges to conduct bond hearings for these children,” Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court.

"If getting rich is hard for individuals, it is harder still for nations. Of more than 190 countries tracked by the International Monetary Fund, fewer than 40 count as wealthy or advanced economies. The rest are known as emerging nations, and many of them have been emerging forever. The last large country to make it into the advanced class was South Korea, 20 years ago. The next major nation likely to join that club could be Poland, an under-the-radar economic star that President Trump will visit this week on his second overseas trip in office. Mr. Trump will meet with leaders of the ruling Law and Justice party, who are thrilled that he has chosen to visit Warsaw before Berlin, Paris or Brussels, and participate in a meeting to promote regional economic ties in Eastern Europe. Other European leaders are unnerved by how Mr. Trump’s populism echoes the right-wing nationalism of his Polish hosts — both have been attacked as illiberal threats to the postwar Western order. But so far, two years of populism has not derailed a quarter-century of steady economic progress in Poland. The I.M.F. has a complex definition of “advanced,” but a common thread is that all the nations have a per-capita income of at least around $15,000. Since Poland completed the transition from Communism to democracy in 1991, its economy has been growing at an average annual rate of 4 percent and, remarkably, has not suffered a single year of negative growth. In those 25 years, Poland’s average income has risen to near $13,000, from $2,300, and it is now on pace to pass the $15,000 mark by the turn of this decade. This is testimony to the long-term fiscal sobriety of Poland’s leaders, and its sharp break with Communism. After the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Poland set out to distance itself as far as possible from Russia, and adopted the financial discipline and institutional reforms required to join the European Union. In the last decade, Warsaw emerged as the conservative opposite of decadent Moscow. Its staid tycoons are almost incapable of the flashy self-promotion common among the Russian oligarchs, and they have embraced American-style entrepreneurship with an enthusiasm rarely found elsewhere in Europe. This pro-American, anti-Russian streak runs deeper than the current populist mood, making Poland a natural and increasingly potent American ally. In the past the relationship has focused on military ties and geopolitics, but Poland is already one of the few NATO members meeting its commitment to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. This meeting shifts the focus to the regional economy at its breakout moment. "
"UNITED NATIONS — The United States toughened its military pressure and invective against nuclear-armed North Korea on Wednesday, conducting a missile maneuver with South Korea, hinting of a possible return to war with the North and proposing wider United Nations sanctions against “any country that does business with this outlaw regime.” The American actions came a day after North Korea conducted a successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appeared capable of hitting Alaska and Hawaii and was described by the United States as a “dangerous escalation” in what has become a crisis for the Trump administration. Claiming the test had been timed to America’s July 4 holiday, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, described the missile as a “gift package” to the United States. The proposal for broader sanctions appeared aimed especially at China, North Korea’s most important trading partner. It was part of a vocal public effort by the Trump administration to push President Xi Jinping of China by linking improved American-Chinese trade relations to solving the North Korea problem — and threatening worse trade relations if China does not help more. “There are countries that are allowing, even encouraging, trade with North Korea,” the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, told the Security Council at an emergency session on the North Korean missile test. If such countries want good trade relations with the United States, Ms. Haley said, “that’s not going to happen.” “We will not look exclusively at North Korea,” Ms. Haley said in outlining the toughened American position. “We will look at any country that does business with this outlaw regime.” Ms. Haley did not specifically threaten China, but she emphasized that 90 percent of North Korea’s trade is with the Chinese and that “much of the burden of enforcing U.N. sanctions rests with China.” "
"‘R
ead this, what he writes,’’ Jay Goldberg instructed, pointing at a typewritten letter hanging inside a large frame on the living-­room wall of his Upper East Side penthouse. I read out loud: ‘‘Dear Jay, Thank you for the wonderful note you sent me over the Christmas holiday. I truly appreciate your great words and support. There has never been a lawyer more important to me than you. It is very important to me that you know that.’’ Goldberg cut me off. ‘‘He underlined that,’’ he said, referring to the last sentence. The letter was signed, ‘‘Donald Trump.’’ ‘‘Now read this,’’ Goldberg continued, pointing at another keepsake inside the same frame, a clipping from a magazine. I read: A survey of New York lawyers and judges had named Goldberg ‘‘the best pure trial lawyer in town.’’ ‘‘Look at what our boy writes,’’ Goldberg said, pointing a finger at Trump’s annotation, handwritten with a black Sharpie. ‘‘I agree 100%. Donald.’’ Goldberg, a tall, slender 84-year-old in a blue dress shirt and gray slacks, was Trump’s exclusive litigator from 1990 to 2005. In the timeline of go-to Trump attorneys, he follows Roy Cohn, who served as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy’s Communist-­hunting subcommittee before representing — and mentoring — Trump, and precedes Marc Kasowitz, the New York City lawyer who made his name in product-­liability litigation and is now running the president’s Russia-­investigation defense team. I had come to Goldberg’s apartment, with its sweeping views, gold-­framed paintings and ‘‘Harvard’’-­embroidered throw pillows, to get a closer look at a species that is rapidly proliferating in Washington: the Trump Lawyer. Reality-­bending litigators who favor bold claims over careful persuasion, Trump Lawyers enabled — and in many ways, defined — Trump’s surreal New York rise. Now, operating in a new and hostile environment, it’s up to them to prevent his fall. Trump’s entire career has effectively been one long legal entanglement. He filed his first major lawsuit more than 40 years ago, and it was, in fact, a countersuit. The government sued him for housing discrimination; he sued the government back for $100 million, charging defamation. (The countersuit, which Trump announced at a news conference, was dismissed, and Trump eventually signed a consent decree in which he agreed to take various steps to desegregate his properties.) Thousands of legal actions followed. Before the election, USA Today tallied up all the lawsuits that Trump and his companies were involved in over just the last 30 years. The final count was 4,095. ‘‘Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?’’ Trump said of himself at a campaign rally in January 2016. ‘‘I’m like a Ph.D. in litigation.’’ "
"‘‘Liberal’’ has long been a dirty word to the American political right. It may be shortened, in the parlance of the Limbaugh Belt, to ‘‘libs,’’ or expanded to the offensive portmanteau ‘‘libtards.’’ But its target is always clear. For the people who use these epithets, liberals are, basically, everyone who leans to the left: big-spending Democrats with their unisex bathrooms and elaborate coffee. This is still how polls classify people, placing them on a neat spectrum from ‘‘extremely conservative’’ to ‘‘extremely liberal.’’ Over the last few years, though — and especially 2016 — there has been a surge of the opposite phenomenon: Now the political left is expressing its hatred of liberals, too. For the committed leftist, the ‘‘liberal’’ is a weak-minded, market-friendly centrist, wonky and technocratic and condescending to the working class. The liberal is pious about diversity but ready to abandon any belief at the slightest drop in poll numbers — a person who is, as the folk singer Phil Ochs once said, ‘‘10 degrees to the left of center in good times, 10 degrees to the right of center if it affects them personally.’’ The anonymous Twitter account ‘‘liberalism.txt’’ is a relentless stream of images and retweets that supposedly illustrate this liberal vacuousness: say, the chief executive of Patagonia’s being hailed as a leader of ‘‘corporate resistance to Trump,’’ or Chelsea Clinton’s accusing Steve Bannon of ‘‘fat shaming’’ Sean Spicer. This shift in terminology can be confusing, both politically and generationally — as when baby boomers describe fervent supporters of Bernie Sanders as ‘‘very liberal,’’ unaware that young Sanders­istas might find this vomit-inducing. It can also create common ground. Last year, the young (and left-leaning) writer Emmett Rensin published a widely read piece on Vox deriding liberals for their ‘‘smug style’’; soon enough, one longtime adept of the right, National Review’s Ramesh Ponnuru, was expressing his partial approval, writing in Bloomberg View that what contemporary liberalism lacked most was humility. Here was a perspective common to both sides of the old spectrum: that liberals suffered from a serene, self-ratifying belief in their own reasonableness, and that it would spell their inevitable defeat. When it comes to diagnosing liberalism, both left and right focus on this same set of debilitating traits: arrogance, hypocrisy, pusillanimity, the insulated superiority of what, in 1969, a New York mayoral candidate called the ‘‘limousine liberal.’’ In other words, the features they use to distinguish liberals aren’t policies so much as attitudes. The profane hosts of the popular podcast ‘‘Chapo Trap House,’’ prime originators of the left’s liberal-bashing, spend a good deal of airtime making fun of liberal cultural life, with one common target being fervor for the musical ‘‘Hamilton.’’ ‘‘Nothing has represented them more: a hagiographical musical where they can pretend to be intersectional and pretend to be multicultural,’’ said Felix Biederman, a co-host, on the second episode of the show. ‘‘They have no policy. They’re all cultural signifiers.’’ To be a ‘‘liberal,’’ in this account, is in some sense to be a fake. It’s to shroud an ambiguous, even reactionary agenda under a superficial commitment to social justice and moderate, incremental change. American liberalism was once associated with something far more robust, with immoderate presidents and spectacular waves of legislation like Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. Today’s liberals stand accused of forsaking the clarity and ambition of even that flawed legacy. To call someone a liberal now, in other words, is often to denounce him or her as having abandoned liberalism. Liberal-bashing on social media has reached a kind of apogee, but its targets have not yet produced much real defense of the ideology. This means the word ‘‘liberal’’ is, for the moment, almost entirely one of abuse. It is hard to think of an American politician who has embraced it, even going back two or three generations. If liberalism is dead, then, it’s a strange sort of demise: Here is an ideology that has many accused sympathizers, but no champions, no defenders. "
"WARSAW — President Trump arrived in Europe on Wednesday for three days of diplomacy that will culminate in a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which has the potential for global repercussions and political fallout back home. Even his top aides do not know precisely what Mr. Trump will decide to say or do when he and Mr. Putin meet face to face on Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 economic summit gathering in Hamburg, Germany. And that is what most worries those advisers as well as officials across his administration as Mr. Trump begins his second foreign trip as president, stopping first in Warsaw to give an address on Thursday and then heading to Hamburg. The highly anticipated conversation with Mr. Putin is in many ways a necessity, given the critical disputes separating the United States and Russia. But it also poses risks for Mr. Trump, who faces a web of investigations into his campaign’s possible links to Russia, as well as questions about his willingness to take on Moscow for its military aggression and election meddling on his behalf. The air of uncertainty about the meeting is only heightened by the president’s propensity for unpredictable utterances and awkward optics. And it is not the only charged encounter awaiting Mr. Trump this week. Following North Korea’s launch on Tuesday of an intercontinental ballistic missile, he also faces new pressure to act on a threat from Pyongyang that has long confounded American presidents, and that he has few appealing ways to address. He is scheduled to meet in Hamburg with President Xi Jinping of China, as he complains that Beijing has not done enough to rein in North Korea. If Mr. Trump’s first foreign trip, in May, was a chance for him to escape turmoil at home — staff infighting, a stalled agenda and the Russia-related investigations — his second will thrust him into the maelstrom. And at the center of it, Mr. Putin awaits. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Tensions rise over North Korea. The U.S. and South Korea fired ballistic missiles off the Korean Peninsula this morning, after the Trump administration confirmed that Pyongyang had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile. President Trump has expressed optimism that China will help curb the North’s nuclear ambitions, but Beijing has so far fallen short of those hopes. That leaves the American president with few good options, our national security correspondent says. • Different approaches to trade. The European Union and Japan appear ready to announce a broad agreement that could create a free-trade zone to rival the North American Free Trade Agreement. The deal, expected on Thursday, would be a pointed challenge to President Trump’s protectionist stance at a time when growth in the American auto industry, for example, is slowing. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — The standoff over North Korea’s nuclear program has long been shaped by the view that the United States has no viable military option to destroy it. Any attempt to do so, many say, would provoke a brutal counterattack against South Korea too bloody and damaging to risk. That remains a major constraint on the Trump administration’s response even as North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, approaches his goal of a nuclear arsenal capable of striking the United States. On Tuesday, the North appeared to cross a new threshold, testing a weapon that it described as an intercontinental ballistic missile and that analysts said could potentially hit Alaska. Over the years, as it does for potential crises around the world, the Pentagon has drafted and refined multiple war plans, including an enormous retaliatory invasion and limited pre-emptive attacks, and it holds annual military exercises with South Korean forces based on them. On Wednesday, the Trump administration made a point of threatening a military response. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, commander of the American forces that conducted a missile exercise with South Korea, said the United States had chosen “self-restraint” with the North. Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said her country’s “considerable military forces” were an option. “We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction,” she told the Security Council. But the military options are more grim than ever. Even the most limited strike risks staggering casualties, because North Korea could retaliate with the thousands of artillery pieces it has positioned along its border with the South. Though the arsenal is of limited range and could be destroyed in days, the United States defense secretary, Jim Mattis, recently warned that if North Korea used it, it “would be probably the worst kind of fighting in most people’s lifetimes.” Beyond that, there is no historical precedent for a military attack aimed at destroying a country’s nuclear arsenal.

"WASHINGTON — An iffy health care vote. An unresolved budget resolution. A heavy debt ceiling lift. And, of course, there is that tax overhaul plan. Congress has a lot to do, and it doesn’t have much time. So much for a lazy July in Washington. When members of Congress return next week from their Fourth of July break, they will be greeted by a mammoth legislative logjam. Republicans are increasingly skeptical that they can get everything done. There are even calls from some to forgo their sacred August recess — a respite from the capital in its swampiest month. “Our current Senate calendar shows only 33 potential working days remaining before the end of the fiscal year,” a group of 10 Republican senators wrote on Friday in a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, highlighting the deadline at the end of September. “This does not appear to give us enough time to adequately address the issues that demand immediate attention.” The Republican Party is under intense pressure to achieve something of consequence in that limited time in order to legitimately claim that the first year of the Trump administration has been a success. So far, the ambitious agenda has stagnated without a signature achievement. President Trump’s unpredictability has only made matters more complicated. “Everyone is coming to the realization that Republicans are going to need to sprint to the end of the year,” said Ken Spain, a former spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee who now lobbies for companies on tax issues. “A lot of the legislative maneuvering in July will lay the groundwork for them to do so.” The first order of business when lawmakers return remains reaching a swift conclusion to the debate over how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, an ambition that has bedeviled Republicans since Mr. Trump entered the White House. The grappling over how to proceed has laid bare deep divisions within the party and stalled progress for the next items on the agenda, a federal budget deal and a tax overhaul. A vote on health care could drag on until mid-July or later depending on when Senate Republicans deliver a new bill to the Congressional Budget Office for scoring. "
"WASHINGTON — As a Peace Corps volunteer assigned to a school in Gostivar, Macedonia, Sarah Blake would listen, waiting for the English words that began to puncture the conversations during the first months of 2017. Trump. Ban. Ms. Blake, in her third year as a Peace Corps volunteer, was often the only American in the city of about 80,000 in the Macedonian foothills, where the predominantly Muslim population speaks Albanian. She began to stress about having to explain the Trump administration’s new travel policy and the president’s own statements about Islam. Shoulders hunched, head down, she would conjure reasons to step away in case these questions came up, she said. Too much work. A meeting to attend. “There hasn’t been a really perfect president,” said Ms. Blake, a Maryland native who now lives in Istanbul after completing her Peace Corps service in May. “But when the president of your country is saying horrible, horrible things, I felt embarrassed.” While the Peace Corps has been nonpartisan since its creation in 1961, politics are always entangled with the educational and developmental work the organization does abroad. Under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, volunteers were accused of being Cold War-era spies for the C.I.A. Volunteers working during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama fielded questions about American military involvement in the Middle East and gun violence at home. "
"Emirates and Turkish Airlines said on Wednesday that they were the latest carriers to have been exempted from an American ban on laptops and other electronic devices in the passenger cabins of flights from eight predominantly Muslim countries. The restrictions were introduced in March after intelligence reports suggested that Islamic State militants were developing explosives that could be hidden in the batteries that power portable electronics, including laptops, iPads and other devices larger than cellphones. The lifting of the laptop ban for some airlines coincided with President Trump’s efforts to bar all visitors from countries he views as a threat. In late June, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to enforce a limited travel ban for six predominantly Muslim countries while the court reviews the case. The United Arab Emirates and Turkey are not among the countries affected by the order. The announcements from Emirates, which is based in Dubai, and Turkish Airlines, based in Istanbul, came after the Transportation Security Administration said on Sunday that Etihad Airlines had been approved after introducing more rigorous screening procedures at its base, Abu Dhabi International Airport. A spokesman for the T.S.A. confirmed that Emirates had met the requirements for lifting the ban on its flights to the United States from Dubai International Airport, while Turkish Airlines received permission to lift it on flights from Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. He declined to discuss how the airlines had changed their security procedures at the airports. The agency wants all carriers and airports with flights to the United States to increase the use of canine screening, install devices to detect trace amounts of explosives, and start interviewing passengers, if they are not doing so already.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California has swung between Republican and Democratic governors for decades. With Gov. Jerry Brown set to depart in 18 months, Republican leaders now hope voters are ready to give their side another go. The latest conservative to jump in the race is Travis Allen, a three-term assemblyman from Huntington Beach who has pledged to cut taxes and get tough on crime. Mr. Allen, 43, made national headlines last December after claiming that California had legalized child prostitution, a contention that multiple fact-checkers concluded was misleading at best. Lately, he’s been leading an effort to repeal an unpopular gas tax increase. We caught up with Mr. Allen by phone. Some excerpts: Q. How have things gone astray under Gov. Brown? A. Jerry Brown is a four-term governor who has absolutely no legacy. He’s built nothing of note in the state and is most famous for his bullet train to nowhere, bursting dams and crumbling infrastructure. "
"The vocally brilliant and dramatically fearless countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo, working with the innovative opera director Christopher Alden, comes to National Sawdust in Brooklyn with a staged version of a Handel rarity: the 1708 dramatic serenata “Aci, Galatea e Polifemo.” Perhaps courting controversy, the production apparently finds parallels between Handel’s telling of Ovid’s mythological tale and the current American era under President Trump, roiling with issues of class, power and crudeness. This production, a four-performance run that begins Wednesday, July 12, employs multidimensional video and reimagined recitatives by the composer and sound designer Mark Grey. As adapted here, the story tells of two servants, Aci and Galatea, who tend to and bathe a sexually aggressive lord, Polifemo (the Cyclops). The performance also features the vocalists Ambur Braid and Devóne Tines and Ruckus, a period instrument ensemble. This venture follows upon National Sawdust’s inventive operatic presentation “Orphic Moments” last year, featuring a triumphant Mr. Costanzo. (Also July 13, 19 and 20; nationalsawdust.org.) "
"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Two nights before the inauguration, Katherine Gonzalez Morgan was watching TV with her nine-year-old son when police showed up at her door. They had received an email saying there was a bomb at her address, they said. She and her family would have to leave immediately. Ms. Morgan lives with her husband, their son and her parents on a five-acre farm in an unincorporated area outside the town of Pace, in the Florida Panhandle. The police evacuated the Morgans and their nearest neighbors to a soccer complex nearby while they searched the farm. Ms. Morgan was worried that someone might have placed a bomb in the horse barn or one of the sheds on the property. Her son was terrified. She and her mother both have a form of muscular dystrophy, and both were still recovering from recent surgeries when they were forced to leave their home. About two hours later, the Morgans were able to return; the officers had found no bomb at the farm. The Morgans were one of three families in Florida, in three different cities hundreds of miles apart, whose addresses had been mentioned in a bomb threat emailed to a detective. The only connection police could find among the three was that all had the surname Gonzalez, which is Ms. Morgan’s parents’ name and her maiden name. Reports of threats and harassment, especially directed at people perceived to be immigrants, spiked after the election of President Trump, according to many advocacy groups. But a threat against three families with the same last name is unusual, even unique. Although two of the three Gonzalez families targeted are Latino, there’s no clear evidence that the crime was motivated by racism. In fact, more than six months later, no one knows who targeted the families, or why. "

"A review recently commissioned by the German Parliament has determined that the country could legally finance the British or French nuclear weapons programs in exchange for their protection. The European Union could do the same if it changed its budgeting rules, the study found. The German assessment comes after months of discussion in Berlin over whether Europe can still rely on American security assurances, which President Trump has called into question. Some have called for considering, as a replacement, a pan-European nuclear umbrella of existing French and British warheads. The assessment provides a legal framework for such a plan. Britain or France, it finds, could legally base nuclear warheads on German soil. The document states that “President Trump and his contradictory statements on NATO” have led to fears “that the U.S. could reduce its nuclear commitment” to Europe. While the review is only an endorsement of the plan’s legality — not a determination to take action — it is the first indication that such an idea has escalated from informal discussion to official policy-making channels. Few analysts believe that Germany or the European Union is on the verge of pursuing a replacement nuclear umbrella. Most German officials still oppose such a plan, which would face steep public opposition and diplomatic hurdles. Even proponents consider it a last resort. "
"BEIJING — Xi Jinping, China’s leader, is known as the Chairman of Everything. He makes decisions daily on the economy, the military, foreign policy, human rights and more. Yet on North Korea he is stuck. A strongman who usually acts with precision and boldness, Mr. Xi has been reluctant to take on the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, ostensibly a Chinese ally, whom he privately disparages to Western leaders as young and reckless. The July 4 test of the North’s first intercontinental ballistic missile has raised the question of what is China’s red line for its ally, and whether the test will force Mr. Xi to act decisively against North Korea as the Trump administration is asking him to do. The answer? He will probably do little, if anything. As much as Mr. Xi disapproves of North Korea’s nuclear program, he fears even more the end of Mr. Kim’s regime, a unified Korea with American troops on his border and a flood of refugees from the North into China. And despite North Korea’s missile advancement on Tuesday, Mr. Xi still has some breathing room, Chinese military and strategic experts said. Chinese military experts are assessing the launch more conservatively than their American counterparts, saying they were not convinced the missile was actually an intercontinental ballistic missile. “This test may or may not be an ICBM,” said Wu Riqiang, associate professor of international affairs at Renmin University. He said the missile was “probably unable to hit Alaska.” "
"To the Editor: Re “E.P.A. Moves to Rescind Contested Water Pollution Regulation” (news article, nytimes.com, June 27): The Environmental Protection Agency just proposed to repeal critical protections for the drinking water of 117 million Americans. After tragedies like Flint, Mich., the toxic algal bloom in Ohio, and countless other tales of polluted waterways, it’s hard to overstate the importance of safe drinking water for all. In 2015, the Clean Water Rule clarified the streams and rivers protected by the Clean Water Act, our bedrock clean water legislation. The rule also protects wetlands, which help filter out pollutants and provide wildlife habitat, as well as serve as buffers against the fiercest storms. More than 800,000 Americans, including doctors and nurses, mayors, and businesses, urged the E.P.A. to adopt the Clean Water Rule. Yet the new E.P.A. is proposing to dismantle it to make way for industry. Repealing this rule turns the mission of the agency upside down: The agency charged with protecting our water has instead chosen to leave it open to pollution. The E.P.A. should reconsider this reckless repeal and stand up for our drinking water. NICOLE LARSON, WASHINGTON The writer is a campaign associate at Environment America. "
"Western European efforts to isolate President Trump for rejecting the Paris climate change agreement appear to be faltering as leaders gather for a summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, at the end of the week. The gulf between Mr. Trump’s worldview and that of most European leaders on topics from trade to immigration will be on display in the coming days. But nowhere is the difference as stark as it is on climate change, which Mr. Trump has mocked as a hoax. In announcing last month that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, the president portrayed the pact signed by 194 nations to cut planet-warming emissions as a bad deal for America. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has cast the agenda of the Group of 20 summit meeting as a stark contrast to Mr. Trump’s America First approach, particularly on climate change. She has called the Paris accord “irreversible,” and diplomats have expressed hope that the 19 other countries would make it clear that their support is unwavering. Environmental activists, hoping to highlight America’s status as an outlier, also are pushing hard for a united front against Mr. Trump. In recent days, however, those aiming to isolate the United States on climate issues have softened their language to say they hope an “overwhelming majority” embrace the Paris agreement. Saudi Arabia has indicated it is unlikely to climb on board and Russia, Turkey and Indonesia are sending mixed signals about how forcefully they will declare their support for the Paris deal. "
"Representative Steve Scalise, who was critically injured last month by a gunman who opened fire at a congressional baseball practice, was readmitted on Wednesday to a Washington hospital’s intensive care unit over concerns about infection, his office announced. The condition of Mr. Scalise, 51, who has been hospitalized at MedStar Washington Hospital Center since the shooting on June 14, was also downgraded to serious from fair. The hospital said in a statement that Mr. Scalise faced “new concerns for infection,” but it did not detail those concerns. The hospital said it would provide another update on Thursday. Mr. Scalise has undergone several surgeries and was moved out of the intensive care unit on June 22. Of the four people shot at the baseball field in Virginia, he was the most seriously wounded. A bullet entered his left hip, shattering bones and ripping through organs and blood vessels, doctors said. The gunman was killed in a shootout with the police. Wednesday’s news was the first update provided about Mr. Scalise’s condition since June 23, when his staff announced on Twitter that he was improving and undergoing “an extensive period of healing and rehabilitation.” In the days after the shooting, doctors worked to control internal bleeding and prepare him for operations to repair abdominal injuries. Doctors said in mid-June that they were unable to predict how long Mr. Scalise, who is from Louisiana and is the No. 3 Republican in the House, would remain in the hospital. A stream of well-wishers, including President Trump, have visited him. Representative John Shimkus of Illinois, who shares a home with Mr. Scalise and two other representatives near the Capitol, said last month that he realized during a hospital visit that Mr. Scalise’s wounds were far more serious than he initially thought. “It’s going to be a tough rest of the year for us,” Mr. Shimkus said.

"Volvo Cars on Wednesday became the first mainstream automaker to sound the death knell of the internal combustion engine, saying that all the models it introduces starting in 2019 will be either hybrids or powered solely by batteries. The decision is the boldest commitment by any major car company to technologies that currently represent a small share of the total vehicle market but are increasingly viewed as essential to combating climate change and urban pollution. While most major automakers offer hybrids and battery-powered options, none of them have been willing to forsake cars powered solely by gasoline or diesel fuel. On the contrary, United States automakers have continued to churn out S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, whose sales have surged because of relatively low fuel prices. Yet Volvo’s move may be the latest sign that the era of the gas guzzler is slowly coming to an end. Tesla, which makes only limited numbers of electric cars, surpassed Ford and General Motors this year in terms of stock market value, despite making significantly fewer cars than those automotive giants — a clear indication of where investors think the industry is headed. “Our customers are asking more and more about electric cars,” Hakan Samuelsson, the chief executive of Volvo, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. While Volvo’s strategy has risks, Mr. Samuelsson acknowledged, “a much bigger risk would be to stick with internal combustion engines.” Though based in Sweden, Volvo is owned by Geely Automobile Holdings of China, which already produces battery-powered cars for the Chinese market. The decision by Volvo to focus on electric vehicles could ultimately give it and Geely a head start if, as many analysts expect, sales of battery powered cars begin to take off. China is already the largest market for electric vehicles. "
"To the Editor: Re “Memories of a Real ‘Witch Hunt’ ” (Op-Ed, July 5): Julie Garfield, the daughter of the movie star John Garfield, who was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s, eloquently expressed what many of us whose parents were investigated during the McCarthy era experienced and still bear to this day. I am about the same age as Ms. Garfield and was followed home from school by F.B.I. agents. It was a terrifying and confusing time for us, the children of suspected “Reds.” Donald Trump has no idea what it feels like to be the target of a witch hunt. I think of today’s children who have to live with similar fears about their parents. Now, the children of undocumented immigrants must be as terrified as we were. They have to live with the fear that something frightening and horrifying may happen to their parents. Do they look behind them when they walk home from school? Do they dread a knock at the door? If there is a witch hunt, then we should ask, Who is the hunter, and who is being hunted today? SUSAN F. AVERY, POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump cast himself as a defender of Western values in a confrontational speech in Warsaw. He attacked his own country’s leaders and institutions — the media, Barack Obama and U.S. intelligence agencies — in front of an appreciative Polish audience. Now he’s in Hamburg, Germany, for the G-20 summit meeting, where he’ll have a highly anticipated face-to-face with Vladimir Putin. Leftist protesters and the police clashed in the streets, above, ahead of the meeting. But let’s back up a minute: What is the G-20, and what happens when its members meet?

"In a bygone analog era, lawmakers and corporate chiefs traveled great distances to swap secrets, to the smoke-filled back rooms of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or the watering holes at the annual Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. But these days, entering the corridors of power is as easy as opening an app. Secure messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal and Confide are making inroads among lawmakers, corporate executives and other prominent communicators. Spooked by surveillance and wary of being exposed by hackers, they are switching from phone calls and emails to apps that allow them to send encrypted and self-destructing texts. These apps have obvious benefits, but their use is causing problems in heavily regulated industries, where careful record-keeping is standard procedure. “By and large, email is still used for formal conversations,” said Juleanna Glover, a corporate consultant based in Washington. “But for quick shots, texting is the medium of choice.” Texting apps are already creating headaches on Wall Street, where financial regulations require firms to preserve emails, instant messages and other business-related correspondence. In March, Christopher Niehaus, an investment banker with the Jefferies Group in London, resigned from his job and was fined nearly $50,000 by British regulators after disclosing confidential client information to a friend over WhatsApp. Deutsche Bank barred its employees from texting and using WhatsApp on their work phones in an effort to curtail underground communication. And last year, prosecutors charged Navnoor Kang, a portfolio manager at the New York State Common Retirement Fund, with securities fraud, accusing him of taking bribes as part of a pay-to-play scheme. According to the indictment, Mr. Kang and his co-conspirators plotted their deeds over, you guessed it, WhatsApp. The appeal of these apps is no big mystery. Cyberattacks on prominent people — like the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures executives and the WikiLeaks release of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chairman — have put the Davos class on high alert. And President Trump’s election in November led to a boom in business for encrypted texting apps among those who feared he would intensify surveillance tactics. Whether they are trying to evade the law, arrange fragile deals or just talk candidly without fear of being snooped on, business executives and other leaders have many reasons for wanting a private back channel.

"It’s the ultimate man-off: Vladimir V. Putin and Donald J. Trump, two leaders who have staked their appeal on projecting masculinity, face off on Friday with the world judging who prevails. Each is almost a cartoonish version of hyper-masculinity. Mr. Putin is frequently photographed shirtless on horseback, shooting tigers or flipping judo opponents. President Trump takes pains to glower at the camera, boasts about the size of his hands (and not just his hands) and recently tweeted a mock video of himself wrestling CNN. And in a telling irony, the fear is that the American leader so invested in proving he’s a real man will not prove to be tough enough. Each leader built his following partly on unmanning his predecessor, on restoring strength to a country that each successfully portrayed as weakened by past policy concessions. Mr. Trump ridiculed President Barack Obama for degrading the American military, failing to defeat ISIS and failing to punish Syria when it crossed his red line. “A real man acts, a soft man talks and makes nice,” said Jackson Katz, the author of “Man Enough? Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and the Politics of Presidential Masculinity.” “Diplomacy in Trumpland is femininity and unilateral action is masculine.” For his part, Mr. Putin called the dissolution of the Soviet Union the 20th century’s worst catastrophe. His appeal to a Russian public hungering to restore its rightful superpower status has withstood economic privations caused by sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. William Taubman, an expert in Soviet history, said that Mr. Putin tapped into a long Russian preoccupation with being perceived as strong. “When they get drunk, Russians will often say, ‘You respect me, don’t you?’” said Professor Taubman, the author of “Khrushchev: The Man and His Era” and a forthcoming book about Mikhail Gorbachev.

"Since May, hackers have been penetrating the computer networks of companies that operate nuclear power stations and other energy facilities, as well as manufacturing plants in the United States and other countries. Among the companies targeted was the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan., according to security consultants and an urgent joint report issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week. The joint report was obtained by The New York Times and confirmed by security specialists who have been responding to the attacks. It carried an urgent amber warning, the second-highest rating for the sensitivity of the threat. The report did not indicate whether the cyberattacks were an attempt at espionage — such as stealing industrial secrets — or part of a plan to cause destruction. There is no indication that hackers were able to jump from their victims’ computers into the control systems of the facilities, nor is it clear how many facilities were breached. Wolf Creek officials said that while they could not comment on cyberattacks or security issues, no “operations systems” had been affected and that their corporate network and the internet were separate from the network that runs the plant. In a joint statement with the F.B.I., a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said, “There is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks.” "
"Last month, you released a documentary called ‘‘Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop’’ about your label, Bad Boy, putting together a reunion tour. A lot of music movies these days have been biopics. Why did you choose to make a documentary instead? I mean, without disrespect, it’s not a documentary. It started out as a documentary, and then it turned into a feature film. You wouldn’t say Madonna’s ‘‘Truth or Dare’’ is a documentary. One moment in the movie I enjoyed was Mase talking about how he’d resisted wearing a shiny suit back in the ’90s. But you told him you had a plan and a vision. Do you think that the shiny suits were important to Bad Boy’s success? Yeah. I think it showed that we were trying to have fun, we were trying to entertain and we were trying to take risks. I love my shiny suit. You have a reputation for hosting incredible parties: the White Party, Daddy’s House. What’s the craziest thing that ever happened at one of your parties? The night we made ‘‘Hypnotize,’’ which I don’t remember a lot of. That was the craziest night. Imagine hearing ‘‘Hypnotize’’ for the first time after, like, two bottles of Cristal. That was so good! A lot of people have made the leap from artist to record executive, but it’s much rarer to do the reverse. You released an album in 1997 after running Bad Boy for a few years. Was that hard? We all have our dreams. I was Biggie’s hype man, and I would perform with him, and he would tell me I need to start making music. Nobody knows this, but Biggie was my manager. Really? We made a deal. I was supposed to be on the ‘‘Player’s Anthem’’ remix in 1995, but then I got nervous. I just wasn’t ready yet. When ‘‘Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down’’ and ‘‘It’s All About the Benjamins’’ came around, I felt ready. "
"PARIS — “We are in a moment where everything is visible, where everything is said, so what becomes special is what you don’t see.” This was Pierpaolo Piccioli, the creative director of Valentino, speaking backstage before his fall couture show as around him models half-dressed in white robes were chased by makeup artists, cameramen jostled, and clothes hung shrouded on racks. He was talking about the ritual work of the couture — the “sacredness” of the hand (his word) — but his words had a broader resonance. Well, President Trump did arrive in Poland around the same time. Paris was already gearing up for his Bastille Day visit. Fashion is not often presented as an antidote to uncontrolled social media use, but as an argument for the truth of Mr. Piccioli’s words, there were no better examples than the final three shows of the haute couture season. Quietly, out of the invisible, magic was made. It began with Valentino, where Mr. Piccioli not only largely eschewed the obvious, but many of the conventional rules of couture itself, treating daywear in a rainbow of colors with the throwaway mix-and-match ease of sportswear. He paired a long tuxedo shirt in blush chiffon with some slouchy trousers and a cape-cum-tabard; another louche pair of black pants with an oversize white shirt and an elaborately pieced cape flowing from a cropped vest tossed on top — oh, this old thing?; and a leaf-green pleated skirt with a bronze chiffon sweatshirt banded in burgundy topped with a bubblegum-pink cashmere coat tied together by a yellow ribbon.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump in Warsaw. The American leader, visiting Poland before heading to a Group of 20 summit meeting in Germany, cast the West’s battle against “radical Islamic terrorism” as a way to protect “our civilization and our way of life.” Mr. Trump also signaled a tougher line against Russia, a day before a sit-down with President Vladimir Putin, but he still refused to concede that Moscow was solely responsible for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The meeting with Mr. Putin will be watched closely — not least by Mr. Trump’s aides, who don’t know what the American president plans to say. Follow our live briefing for the latest updates, and test your knowledge of the G-20 with our quiz. • Calls for tougher action on North Korea. The U.S. is hinting at a possible return to war with North Korea after Pyongyang tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, and it is proposing wider U.N. sanctions against “any country that does business with this outlaw regime.” Even a so-called surgical strike against North Korea would risk staggering civilian casualties, complicating matters for the U.S. and South Korea. The Chinese leader also has limited options, our Beijing bureau chief notes. The nuclear push is just one sign of how, despite sanctions, the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been trying to project a strong image with a string of infrastructure projects. "

"The promise of faster economic growth has become a study in the triumph of hope over experience. While the June jobs report, coming on Friday, is expected to show that hiring continued at a healthy pace last month, other recent indicators in areas like consumer spending, construction and auto sales have been decidedly less robust. As a result, Wall Street forecasters have been busy lowering their growth estimates for the second quarter, which ended last Friday, much as they were forced to do over the first three months of the year. Economic expansion for the full year now appears unlikely to be much greater than 2 percent — about the average for the current recovery, which celebrates its eighth year this month. While hardly terrible, it is not the burst of growth — a “Trump bump” — that many expected to result from an upturn in consumer and business sentiment after President Trump’s election. Mr. Trump himself declared upon taking office that his policies would produce 4 percent annual growth, and just this week said on Twitter to affirm that “things are starting to kick in now.” But the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s widely followed GDP Now expects the second-quarter growth figure to come in at 2.7 percent, more than a full percentage point below where it was in May, and a decline even since the beginning of the week. The New York Fed’s Nowcast is even more bearish, with an estimate of 1.9 percent for the quarter just ended and 1.6 percent for the current quarter. "
"To the Editor: Re “For Abused Gay Iraqi in Turkey, U.S. Refugee Freeze Is Cruelest Blow” (news article, July 2): Last fall, I traveled to the Middle East to undertake research for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and met a number of gay and transgender refugees from Syria and Iraq. Like Mohammed, featured in your article, many of these refugees have undergone terrible violence — including sexual violence and torture — in their home countries. Fleeing to a neighboring country brought little relief: They continued to experience violence and victimization by the police, employers, neighbors and even taxi drivers. Securing adequate protection for L.G.B.T. refugees is often extremely difficult. For many of them, the only real option to ensure safety is resettlement to a more progressive country like the United States. The Trump administration’s new “refugee freeze” will condemn many L.G.B.T. refugees around the world to continuing pain and suffering. SARAH CHYNOWETH

"Age 31 Hometown San Jose, Calif. Now Lives In a “big floor-through brownstone flat” in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which she shares with a roommate. Claim to Fame Ms. Dimayuga is the executive chef of Mission Chinese Food New York, the cool temple of Sichuan cuisine on the Lower East Side known for its ferocious, tongue-numbing fare. “We’ve created our own language with wok-fired food,” she said. Ms. Dimayuga was named one of the best new chefs of 2015 by Grub Street and earned a James Beard nomination last year. Her taste-making influence extends outside the kitchen. She helped design the restaurant’s retro interior and art installations, and oversees its streetwear merchandise. Big Break At 22, she was a cook at Vinegar Hill House in Brooklyn, alongside such foodie notables as Jean Adamson of Freemans Restaurant and Chris Parachini of Roberta’s. “I didn’t really tell anyone how young I was at the time,” she said. “But slowly my reputation was growing in an insider way, and a lot of options ended up on the table.” The most enticing offer came in 2012 with a cold call from Danny Bowien, the founder of Mission Chinese. “We had an instant connection, even though I had never even had Sichuan peppercorns before meeting him,” she said. Latest Project In May, Ms. Dimayuga catered the annual gala for Creative Time, a nonprofit public arts organization that honored Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony. “I’ve been to Humberto’s house many times where his mom has cooked amazing dinners for us, so it always feels organic coming up with crazy ideas together,” she said. To create the gala’s globe-spanning menu, which included a salt-encrusted fish and mango chow, Ms. Dimayuga teamed up with the League of Kitchens, a group that offers intimate culinary classes taught by immigrant cooks in their own homes. Next Thing An art-food collaboration between Ms. Dimayuga and her friend, the conceptual artist Anicka Yi, will run in the September issue of A Magazine Curated By. Fire Starter In April, Ms. Dimayuga caused a minor political stir when a writer for IvankaTrump.com reached out to her to do a profile. Ms. Dimayuga posted her fiery reply on Instagram, saying that “as a queer person of color and daughter of immigrant parents” she could not support “a brand and a president that slyly disparages female empowerment.” The exchange was picked up by Elle, HuffPost and others. Five days after her post went viral, Ivanka Trump’s Instagram account began following her. “I thought, uh-oh, I probably have an F.B.I. profile now,” she said. "
"PALCO, Kan. — Cheryl Hofstetter Duffy began by telling Senator Jerry Moran that she was a breast cancer survivor. Then she asked why the debate over the Affordable Care Act was focused on repealing and replacing the law, rather than simply making it better. When she finished, the crowd jammed into a community center on Thursday applauded. Mr. Moran, a Kansas Republican who came out last week against the Senate leadership’s repeal bill, picked up on the sentiment, lamenting that both parties were locked in opposition over health care, with Republicans pursuing repeal and Democrats saying, he said, “Not one inch are we giving.” “And so the rhetoric puts us into the corners of the ring,” he said, “and never a meeting of the minds.” For about 90 minutes on a hot summer day, this tiny town in northwest Kansas, with fewer than 300 people, took on an improbable role at the center of the national debate over the future of health care. Mr. Moran did something that almost none of his Republican colleagues are doing over the Fourth of July recess: He stood in front of his constituents at a town hall-style meeting. Mr. Moran faced probing questions about health care, exposing constituents’ deep concerns about the bill, though the gathering was notably polite. Dressed crisply in a suit, white shirt and red tie, Mr. Moran stood at the front of the packed room with the crowd of more than 100 spilling outdoors through an open doorway in the back. A few feet from the senator, a woman in a pink Planned Parenthood T-shirt held a poster that offered a reminder of the backlash Mr. Moran and his colleagues risk: “When you lose your health care remember who took it away,” it said, showing caricatures of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is pushing the bill; President Trump; and Speaker Paul D. Ryan. "
"Gov. Jerry Brown of California on Thursday reinforced his reputation as America’s de facto leader on climate change, announcing to cheering crowds in Hamburg, Germany that his state would gather leaders from around the world for a global warming summit next year. Speaking by videoconference to the Global Citizens Festival in Hamburg, where President Donald Trump is joining other world leaders for the Group of 20 economic summit, Governor Brown said the president “doesn’t speak for the rest of America” in pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change. “Look, it’s up to you and it’s up to me and tens of millions of other people to get it together to roll back the forces of carbonization and join together to combat the existential threat of climate change. That is why we’re having the Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, September 2018,” Governor Brown told the crowd. “Yes, I know President Trump is trying to get out of the Paris agreement, but he doesn’t speak for the rest of America,” he said. “We in California and in states all across America believe it’s time to act.” Mr. Trump declared in June that the United States would withdraw from the 2015 pact, in which nearly 200 nations pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions and support poor countries’ plans to develop clean energy and protections against climate-related disasters. The California summit meeting will bring together the leaders of states, cities, businesses and others who made pledges to curb heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions as part of the Paris accord and the thousands of others who were galvanized by Mr. Trump’s decision. Days after his announcement, the former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg published a letter to the United Nations signed by more than 1,200 mayors, business leaders, university presidents and others declaring “we are still in” the climate deal.

"In the sleepier days of summer TV, turn to movies: “First Wives Club” and “Titanic” were recently added to streaming platforms, and “Selena” and “Closer” are on cable channels. Classical music fans can also see the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato perform on medici.tv. FIRST WIVES CLUB (1996) on Amazon. Among this month’s additions to Amazon’s catalog is this ensemble comedy about friendship, empowerment and, above all, getting revenge on boorish ex-husbands. Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn play the three schemers. Other cast members include Sarah Jessica Parker, as well as celebrities used as punch lines. “In party scenes, the film’s well-known walk-ons contribute to its general aura of comic glitz,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “Donald Trump has become de rigueur as a celebrity cameo in such circumstances, but he isn’t here. ‘The First Wives Club’ gets — and deserves — Ivana.” JOYCE DiDONATO on medici.tv. Watch a performance from the tour inspired by this star mezzo-soprano’s album “In War & Peace: Harmony Through Music,” which was released last fall. In this taped concert at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, she performs works by Handel, Purcell and other Baroque composers with the early-music ensemble Il Pomo d’Oro and the conductor (and harpsichordist) Maxim Emelyanichev. TITANIC (1997) on Netflix. James Cameron’s enormous (one might say titanic) blockbuster about love, class and the famous tragedy of 1912 has returned to Netflix. Like the hubristic makers of the ship, the movie is “a presumptuous reach for greatness” that “gambles everything on visual splendor and technological accomplishment,” Ms. Maslin wrote in The Times, adding that “its extravagance is fully justified onscreen.” She continued, “If Mr. Cameron’s own brazenness echoes that seen in his story, remember the essential difference. This ‘Titanic’ is too good to sink.” SELENA (1997) 8 p.m. on HBO. Jennifer Lopez stars as Selena, the Spanish-to-English-language pop star who was shot dead by her fan club manager at 23. But Stephen Holden of The Times wrote that this biopic is, more than anything, hagiography. “The movie is so insistently nice that it refuses to show the star’s murder,” he wrote. “Maybe that’s appropriate in a movie that treats its central character as a saint, for by the end of the film, Selena has been all but canonized.” CLOSER (2004) 7:14 p.m. on Starz. Mike Nichols’s film about sex and the city (which exists on a much higher plane than “Sex and the City”) stars Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Jude Law as intertwined, emotive lovers. “In the past, Mr. Nichols has usually addressed sexuality with an elegant mixture of candor and discretion, and his intention in ‘Closer,’ which brings him back to the raw, needy emotions of ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’ and ‘Carnal Knowledge,’ seems to be to show very little while saying a great deal,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. "
"Stopping over in Poland on his way to the Group of 20 summit meeting in Germany gives President Trump a chance to briefly bask in the acclaim of a right-wing, illiberal Polish leadership before he starts taking flak from more powerful allies like Germany and France. The host of the gathering, Chancellor Angela Merkel, has made clear that she intends to focus on issues on which Mr. Trump has sharply parted ways with much of the European Union, including trade, climate change and migration. Mr. Trump’s first visit to Europe in May left plenty of bruises, raising serious doubts among European leaders about his commitment not only to old and valued alliances but also to America’s traditional leadership role in the world, and it will be interesting to see whether he is in healing mode this time around. In Brussels, speaking at NATO headquarters, Mr. Trump lectured allies on their financial contributions and failed to reaffirm NATO’s mutual defense pledge. The Group of 7 meeting in Sicily shortly thereafter exposed further divisions over policy, and a week later Mr. Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris agreement on fighting global warming. Ms. Merkel, who declared after the G-7 meeting that American leadership can no longer be relied on, has been marshaling her forces, in tandem with President Emmanuel Macron of France, for the meeting of the G-20, a larger and more powerful grouping consisting of the leaders of 19 major powers and the European Union. In a speech to her Parliament last week she declared, in an unmistakable allusion to Mr. Trump, that “anybody who believes the problems of the world can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is making a big mistake.” There could well be fireworks outside the meeting halls as well. Thousands of protesters have descended on Hamburg — a city with a long history of protests and riots, where the meeting will be held Friday and Saturday — to demonstrate against everything from globalization and capitalism to the controversial leaders who will be there, most notably Mr. Trump, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.

"The path back to power for the Democratic Party today, as it was in the 1990s, is unquestionably to move to the center and reject the siren calls of the left, whose policies and ideas have weakened the party. In the early 1990s, the Democrats relied on identity politics, promoted equality of outcomes instead of equality of opportunity and looked to find a government solution for every problem. After years of leftward drift by the Democrats culminated in Republican control of the House under Speaker Newt Gingrich, President Bill Clinton moved the party back to the center in 1995 by supporting a balanced budget, welfare reform, a crime bill that called for providing 100,000 new police officers and a step-by-step approach to broadening health care. Mr. Clinton won a resounding re-election victory in 1996 and Democrats were back. But the last few years of the Obama administration and the 2016 primary season once again created a rush to the left. Identity politics, class warfare and big government all made comebacks. Candidates inspired by Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren and a host of well-funded groups have embraced sharply leftist ideas. But the results at the voting booth have been anything but positive: Democrats lost over 1,000 legislative seats across the country and control of both houses of Congress during the Obama years. And in special elections for Congress this year, they failed to take back any seats held by Republicans. Central to the Democrats’ diminishment has been their loss of support among working-class voters, who feel abandoned by the party’s shift away from moderate positions on trade and immigration, from backing police and tough anti-crime measures, from trying to restore manufacturing jobs. They saw the party being mired too often in political correctness, transgender bathroom issues and policies offering more help to undocumented immigrants than to the heartland. Bigger government handouts won’t win working-class voters back. This is the fallacy of the left, believing that voters just need to be shown how much they are getting in government benefits. In reality, these voters see themselves as being penalized for maintaining the basic values of hard work, religion and family. It’s also not all about guns and abortion. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both won working-class voters despite relatively progressive views on those issues. Today, identity politics and disdain for religion are creating a new social divide that the Democrats need to bridge by embracing free speech on college campuses and respect for Catholics and people of other faiths who feel marginalized within the party.

"On the subject of cycles, Warren Buffett likes to talk about “the natural progression, the three I’s.” As he put it to Charlie Rose in 2008, those I’s are “the innovators, the imitators and the idiots.” One creates, one enhances — and one screws it all up. Then, presumably, the cycle starts afresh. Buffett was describing the process that led to the 2008 housing and financial crises. But he might as well have been talking about the decline of the conservative movement in America. I was reminded of this again last week, on news that the Fox News host Sean Hannity will receive the William F. Buckley Jr. Award for Media Excellence later this year at a gala dinner in Washington, D.C. As honors go, neither the award nor the organization bestowing it — the Media Research Center — is particularly noteworthy. But sometimes symbolism is more potent than fact. If we have reached the point where rank-and-file conservatives see nothing amiss with giving Hannity an award named for Buckley, then surely there’s a Milton Friedman Prize awaiting Steve Bannon for his insights on free trade. And maybe Sean Spicer can receive the Vaclav Havel International Prize for Creative Dissent for his role in exposing “fake news.” The floor’s the limit. Or, in Hannity’s case, the crawl space beneath it. In 1950, Lionel Trilling wrote that there were no conservative ideas “in general circulation,” only “irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.” By the time Trilling died 25 years later the opposite was true: The only consequential ideas at the time were conservative, while it was liberalism that had been reduced to an irritable mental gesture. This was largely Buckley’s doing. Through National Review, his magazine, he gave a hidden American intelligentsia a platform to develop conservative ideas. Through “Firing Line,” his TV show, he gave an unsuspecting American public a chance to sample conservative wit. Not all of the ideas were right, but they were usually smart. And as they evolved, they went in the right direction. "
"Good news has been in such very short supply lately. Beyoncé did have twins. Joey Chestnut set a new record at the Coney Island hot-dog eating contest. Kentucky sold a billion dollars in lottery tickets for the first time … O.K., here’s a real one: Women’s involvement in politics seems to be skyrocketing — they’re doing everything from petitioning Congress to planning their own campaigns. Groups that help prepare women to run for office are reporting an unprecedented number of website visits, training-school sign-ups and meeting attendance. Everything is going to get better! There’ll be more bipartisanship in Congress, more rationality in foreign affairs and better government on the state and local levels. Corruption will drop, voter satisfaction will soar and never again will the governor of a major state spend a holiday sunbathing on a public beach that’s closed to the rest of the public due to a budget crisis. All right, we’re only totally positive about the last one. Still, more gender equality in politics is a great goal. While there have been some really terrible, truly awful women elected to public office over the years, as a group women seem to be better at working with others. For instance, female senators have regular bipartisan dinners in Washington. There was a time when this would not have been a big deal, but in the current climate it’s akin to Nixon in China. Women also tend to bring a mood of reform, since they’re often coming from the outside. “It’s the women who in many ways feel — if you’re not at the table, you’re probably on the menu,” said Debbie Walsh at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.

"My country, Qatar, is a nation under siege. For the past month, its borders and airline routes have been closed off by a regional bloc consisting of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. The authorities in the neighboring Gulf states have forced the repatriation of Qatari citizens, regardless of age and health. The bloc has issued a list of wild accusations against Qatar. They include the hosting of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps in our capital, Doha; the funding of the pro-Iranian Lebanese militia organization Hezbollah; and support for the Islamic State terrorist group. This hardly makes sense since Hezbollah and the Islamic State are sworn enemies, at war with each other in Syria. Other claims are equally spurious. Qatar stands accused of supporting the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Yet, until this blockade started, my country participated in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and lost soldiers fighting the Houthi rebels. This accusation is an insult to their memory. The Gulf bloc also came up with a list of purported terrorist groups and individuals whom Qatar supposedly hosts or sponsors. One of them is, in fact, a Yemeni Salafist leader who lives in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Others named do not live in Qatar and have no connection to Doha. Just as in 1914, when the Austro-Hungarian government came up with a list of impossible and unjustifiable demands as a pretext to attack Serbia, so Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Egypt and Bahrain have given my country a demeaning and insulting list of conditions to be met to get this unwarranted siege lifted. Qatar received no previous notice of these demands. Despite our membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council, we were never even asked to discuss them. With the expiry of the bloc’s ultimatum, the Saudi alliance is threatening additional sanctions. "
"So Neil M. Gorsuch, the aw-shucks humble servant of the law whom the country encountered during his mind-numbing confirmation hearing, turns out to be a hard-right conservative. No real surprise there, and by now, no real news either, given that nearly every account of the Supreme Court term that ended last week took note of Justice Gorsuch’s budding alliance with Justice Clarence Thomas on the court’s far right. Missing from much of the commentary, however, was the sheer flamboyance of the junior justice’s behavior. To give some context: Here is a man who participated in a mere two weeks of Supreme Court arguments — 13 cases — amid eight colleagues whose collective Supreme Court tenure comes to 140 years. Maybe all those years have brought wisdom, maybe not. But what they have brought, surely, are habits, norms, unwritten rules that enable people to go home after a hard day, show up again the next morning, look one another in the eye and get back to business. I don’t know whether Justice Gorsuch has adhered to certain of the Supreme Court’s unwritten rules. But we don’t need inside sources in order to read the story that his votes and separate opinions tell. Whether out of ignorance or by deliberate choice, Neil Gorsuch is a norm breaker. He’s the new kid in class with his hand always up, the boy on the playground who snatches the ball out of turn. He is in his colleagues’ faces pointing out the error of their ways, his snarky tone oozing disrespect toward those who might, just might, know what they are talking about. It’s hard to ascribe this behavior to ignorance — he was, after all, like three of his colleagues, once a Supreme Court law clerk. But if it’s not ignorance, what is it? How could the folksy “Mr. Smith Goes to the Senate Judiciary Committee” morph so quickly into Donald Trump’s life-tenured judicial avatar? The most widely noticed Gorsuch opinion came on the term’s final day, June 26, in a case the court hadn’t even accepted for argument. The question in Pavan v. Smith was whether the state of Arkansas could refuse to put the name of a birth-mother’s same-sex spouse on their child’s birth certificate. A husband’s name is automatically listed on an Arkansas birth certificate without inquiry into his biological relationship to the child his wife bears. Two legally married lesbian couples, parents by means of anonymous sperm donations, claimed a constitutional right to equal treatment. A majority of the Supreme Court agreed, overturning a contrary ruling by the Arkansas Supreme Court. Quoting from the decision that established the constitutional right to same-sex marriage — Obergefell v. Hodges, decided two years earlier to the day — the justices’ unsigned opinion declared that “the Constitution entitles same-sex couples to civil marriage ‘on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples,’ ” and noted that the Obergefell decision itself named birth and death certificates as among the rights and benefits of marriage “to which same-sex couples, no less than opposite-sex couples, must have access.” "
"ATHENS — The recent elections in France and Britain have confirmed the political establishment’s simultaneous vulnerability and vigor in the face of a nationalist insurgency. This contradiction is the motif of the moment — personified by the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, whose résumé made him a darling of the elites but who rode a wave of anti-establishment enthusiasm to power. A similar paradox is visible in Britain in the surprising electoral success of the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in depriving Theresa May’s Conservatives of an outright governing majority — not least because the resulting hung Parliament seemingly gives the establishment some hope of a change in approach from Mrs. May’s initial recalcitrant stance toward the European Union on the Brexit negotiations that have just begun. Outsiders are having a field day almost everywhere in the West — not necessarily in a manner that weakens the insiders, but neither also in a way that helps consolidate the insiders’ position. The result is a situation in which the political establishment’s once unassailable authority has died, but before any credible replacement has been born. The cloud of uncertainty and volatility that envelops us today is the product of this gap. For too long, the political establishment in the West saw no threat on the horizon to its political monopoly. Just as with asset markets, in which price stability begets instability by encouraging excessive risk-taking, so, too, in Western politics the insiders took absurd risks, convinced that outsiders were never a real threat. One example of the establishment’s recklessness was releasing the financial sector from the restrictions that the New Deal and the postwar Bretton Woods agreement had imposed upon financiers to prevent them from repeating the damage seen with the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Another was building a system of world trade and credit that depended on the booming United States trade deficit to stabilize global aggregate demand. It is a measure of the sheer hubris of the Western establishment that it portrayed these steps as “riskless.” When the ensuing financialization of Western economies led to the great financial crisis of 2007-8, leaders on both sides of the Atlantic showed no compunction about practicing welfare socialism for bankers. Meanwhile, more vulnerable citizens were abandoned to the mercy of unfettered markets, which saw them as too expensive to hire at a decent wage and too indebted to court otherwise. "
"President Trump’s review of American policy in Afghanistan should involve adopting a tougher approach to Pakistan. Although the Taliban are said to control or contest 40 percent of Afghanistan’s territory, Taliban leaders operate from the safety of Pakistan. United States incentives since the Sept. 11 attacks have failed to dissuade Pakistan from supporting the Taliban, and Mr. Trump must now consider alternatives. Reading Pakistan correctly has not always been easy for American officials. Pakistan was a key American ally during the Cold War, the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan and the post-Sept. 11 operations against Al Qaeda. But for Pakistan the alliance has been more about securing weapons, economic aid and diplomatic support in its confrontation with India. The United States and Pakistan have both disappointed each other because of divergence in their interests in South Asia. The George W. Bush administration erred in ignoring the regrouping of the Taliban in Pakistan after their defeat in Afghanistan in the aftermath of Sept. 11, considering Pakistan’s cooperation in capturing some Qaeda figures as sufficient evidence of its alliance with the United States. President Barack Obama’s administration tried to deal with a resurgent Taliban with a surge in troop numbers for a specific period. Mr. Obama deployed armed drones to strike at Taliban targets inside Pakistan, but that proved insufficient in dealing with the leadership living in the Pakistani cities of Quetta and Peshawar. Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s former military dictator, had secretly authorized the drone strikes, and some of the drones operated from bases inside Pakistan — a policy that continued under his civilian successors. Under his rule, Pakistan audaciously denied having anything to do with the Afghan Taliban or its most sinister component, the Haqqani network. But the United States presented evidence of Pakistan’s links to Afghan militants just as Pakistan transitioned from military to civilian rule in 2008. As Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States for the new civilian government, I urged Pakistan’s civil and military leaders to engage with Americans honestly instead of sticking to blanket denials.

"Right Now: President Trump met with Chancellor Angela Merkel after he arrived in Hamburg, Germany, where thousands of protesters converged before a Group of 20 summit meeting with leaders of other major economies. • About 12,000 protesters gathered Thursday night in Hamburg. There were reports that dozens of police officers suffered minor injuries as a small group of protesters attacked them with bottles, poles and iron bars in running clashes that lasted until midnight. • Mr. Trump held a low-key private meeting with Ms. Merkel, who perhaps best symbolizes the deep skepticism shared by Western leaders toward Mr. Trump’s policies. • Earlier on Thursday, during a speech in Warsaw, Mr. Trump said, “The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,” and he explicitly expressed support for NATO. • Mr. Trump’s trip to Europe is expected to culminate with a high-stakes meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Friday. In what may be a preview of the scene in Hamburg during the meetings between the leaders of the world’s 20 leading economies, protesters converged Thursday night for a demonstration called “Welcome to Hell.” Up to 100,000 protesters were expected in the coming days, and 20,000 police officers from across Germany and neighboring countries were dispatched to provide security.

"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — On the first day of summer, two days before the release of his new album, “Grateful,” the hip-hop producer DJ Khaled was sitting in a powder room in his mansion here: a turreted affair across the street from the home of Slash, the Guns N’ Roses guitarist. Befitting a superhero (of social media, at least), the man born as Khaled Mohamed Khaled was wearing a black polyester cape — but it was merely for that most mortal of obligations, a haircut. As a barber circled him, brushing black dye into his buzz cut and beard, Mr. Khaled scrolled through the infinite stream of comments from his 6.7 million Instagram followers; fist-bumped guests that Kiko, his personal assistant, let into the house; debated whether to turn on the pool heater before punting the decision to his fiancée, Nicole Tuck, who was in New York; and waxed poetic about gardening, the pastime that has kept him grounded during his ascent from Miami disc jockey to auteur of ubiquitous club bangers like “Wild Thoughts” (his song featuring Rihanna and a Carlos Santana sample that is currently high on the charts) and “I Got the Keys.” “Don’t forget, if we didn’t have this house built, these streets, what would be here?” he said, gesturing at the cobblestone driveway, where two uniformed workers were cleaning the interior of his bright blue Rolls-Royce. “Trees, flowers, Mother Nature.” As hair must be pruned, so must flowers and plants. Mr. Khaled, 41, has loved the outdoors since he grew up in Florida, playing soccer and basketball and fishing in open waters. His parents, Palestinian immigrants, worked in the clothing business, but when suits fell out of fashion and his father had to close down his men’s formal wear store, Mr. Khaled turned to D.J.ing and used the money he made from various gigs to support his family. Aligning himself with marquee M.C.s and singers (Jay-Z, Rihanna, Drake) and avoiding dis tracks in favor of coining positive catchphrases like “bless up” have given Mr. Khaled a golden reputation, even if some critics seem unclear about what, exactly, he does. (He samples beats from various artists and blends them together to create infectious anthems.) Often, he yells out a motto — “We the best!” It’s embroidered on his bathrobes. "

Here’s what you need to know: • White House advisers are nervous about President Trump’s first sit-down with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, which is scheduled for tomorrow at the G-20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany. European efforts to isolate Mr. Trump for rejecting the Paris climate change agreement appear to be faltering as other participants, including Russia and Turkey, could side with the U.S. Meanwhile, policy makers in Berlin are mulling whether the Continent can still rely on American security assurances. Some have called for a pan-European nuclear umbrella. _____ "
"One of the savviest, wisest, most revealing museum exhibitions of the summer may not have much actual art in it. But it circles the subject relentlessly like a satellite around a planet, wobbling in and out of art’s force field. We’re along for the ride, courtesy of a series of often riveting, mostly wordless visual dialogues between artists, conducted entirely by cellphone. In each of these dozen pictorial tête-à-têtes, two artists share images — scores, sometimes hundreds — and the occasional brief video. They tap moments of beauty or strangeness; of everyday life or travel; of buildings, streets and weather. We see flashes of wit, poetry and even genius and observe momentous events, both private and presidential. Everywhere puzzles are set in motion for us to contemplate and parse, making our own meaning. As museum shows go, “Talking Pictures: Camera-Phone Conversations Between Artists” was a relatively loose, even risky, proposition undertaken where you might least expect it: the august Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Fifth Avenue building, even). It was cooked up by Mia Fineman, associate curator of the Met’s photography department, who was intrigued by how the camera phone had transformed photography, giving it a diaristic, real-time intimacy and turning it, she says in a wall text, into “a fluid, instantaneous, ephemeral medium, closer to speaking than to writing.” Ms. Fineman wanted to examine the speechlike nature of cellphone photo-chat through a finer lens: artists’ longstanding habit of communing with others of their kind. So last fall she selected a dozen artists of varying ages, origins and sensibilities, working in photography, painting, illustration or multimedia. Each was asked to invite another artist to communicate through a shared iCloud album for several months, however often they liked but without typed messages. (Ms. Fineman could check in, taking the project’s pulse, but not comment.) The museum would exhibit each exchange unabridged; images would be labeled with only the sender’s name and the date sent. "
"WASHINGTON — The casting call came early — the first of many unwelcome interruptions for Kamala Harris since November — consuming the Los Angeles nightclub where she was supposed to be celebrating an uncomplicated Senate victory. With the polls closed in nearly every other corner of the country, the giant TV above the dance floor left little doubt: Donald J. Trump was almost certainly going to be president. A vacancy — standard-bearer of the Democratic Party, or at least one of them — had come open four to eight years ahead of schedule. And people had questions. “Literally everyone was essentially turning to her and asking,” said Juan Rodriguez, Ms. Harris’s campaign manager, recalling the scene backstage on election night. “What does this mean? What do we do?” The sensation has perhaps grown familiar for Ms. Harris. Less than eight months later, California’s very junior senator has emerged as the latest iteration of a bipartisan archetype: the Great Freshman Hope, a telegenic object of daydreaming projection — justified or not — for a party adrift and removed from executive power. “Do we retreat or do we fight?” she thundered in Los Angeles that evening. “I say we fight.” Like the Senate newcomers Barack Obama or Marco Rubio before her, Ms. Harris — a 52-year-old former prosecutor with a profane streak, a lawyerly aversion to “false choices” and an affection for the rapper Too Short — has insisted that national aspirations are far from her mind. Like those men, she has not exactly ruled out the possibility, either. Unlike those men, she is not a man, a fact that has figured prominently in her introduction to mass audiences in a recurring (and highly rated) television series: Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing Into Possible Trump Ties to Russia.

"In the latest example of a real-life crime’s being dramatized for television, Netflix announced on Thursday that it was turning the Central Park jogger case into a five-episode series. The streaming service has struck a deal with Ava DuVernay, the director of “Selma,” to write and direct the series. Ms. DuVernay, one of the most sought-after filmmakers in Hollywood, also worked with Netflix on the documentary “13th” and is a producer on the television show “Queen Sugar” on Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network. Ms. Winfrey’s Harpo Films will have a production credit on the new Netflix series. The series will explore the notorious case involving five black and Hispanic teenagers who were charged with beating and raping a woman jogging in the park in 1989. All five of the accused were convicted and sentenced to prison in a case that was fraught with racial tension. But after another man confessed to the crime years later, the five were released from jail and their sentences were vacated. They ultimately received a settlement from New York City for about $40 million. Netflix said on Thursday that the series would begin with the events of the spring of 1989, when the teenagers were first questioned by the police, and continue until the point when they received the settlement from the city three years ago. The case resurfaced in the news during the 2016 presidential election. Donald J. Trump, who was outspoken about the case when it became a tabloid obsession in 1989, asserted just weeks before the election that the five men were guilty. In a statement, Ms. DuVernay said the story of the defendants had riveted her for more than two decades. “In their journey, we witness five innocent young men of color who were met with injustice at every turn — from coerced confessions to unjust incarceration to public calls for their execution by the man who would go on to be the president of the United States,” she said. The Central Park jogger case joins several other infamous criminal cases in receiving television dramatizations: the O. J. Simpson case (FX’s “The People vs. O.J. Simpson”), the Menendez brothers (NBC’s forthcoming “Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders”) and the murder of Gianni Versace (a coming FX limited series by Ryan Murphy). "
"Building a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and fixing the existing one could cost nearly $13 billion — a steep increase over an earlier estimate of $7.7 billion, according to a report released on Thursday. Transit officials are proceeding with planning for the project, which would improve a critical link between New York and New Jersey. The tunnel proposal is considered one of the most important infrastructure projects in the country, but its fate is unclear under the Trump administration. The new report, by the Federal Railroad Administration and New Jersey Transit, evaluated the plan’s environmental and economic impacts. The study was a major step before detailed design work and construction could begin, said John D. Porcari, the interim executive director of the Gateway Program Development Corporation, which was created to oversee the project. “As of today, the tunnel is moving rapidly toward construction,” Mr. Porcari said at a news conference at Pennsylvania Station in New York. Despite his optimism, the Trump administration has not committed to providing federal financing for the tunnel, raising questions about whether it supports the project. The federal Transportation Department recently withdrew from the Gateway corporation board, saying that it did not want to appear to favor the tunnel over projects elsewhere in the country. Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, has said that she and President Trump understand the tunnel’s importance, but the administration has proposed cutting a grant program that could have helped pay for the project. The Obama administration strongly supported building a new tunnel and had agreed to join with Amtrak to cover half of the project’s cost. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey have agreed to finance the other half. "
"More than two million marriages take place each year in the United States and, increasingly, they are uniting people of different races and ethnicities. Today, according to the Pew Research Center, one in six newlyweds in the United States is involved in a mixed marriage. That is a fivefold increase from 1967, when the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in Loving v. Virginia, the decision that made interracial marriage legal across the nation. Last month, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Loving decision, The New York Times asked readers the question: Has being in an interracial relationship united or divided your family? Nearly 200 people — not only couples, but children of intermarried parents — responded. In those responses, several themes emerged. Mixed marriage in 2017 goes far beyond black and white, and might more aptly be called multicultural marriage. Children also tend to unite families; many couples wrote in to say that once they became parents, relations with their own parents improved. One interracial marriage tends to beget another; the children of intermarried couples tend to intermarry, if our readers are any guide. We heard tales of hope and disappointment, fear and hurt feelings, struggles for acceptance, but most of all, love. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Matt Flegenheimer, a reporter based in Washington. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, seems to consider herself a stickler for precision in language. A former prosecutor, she has infused the Senate hearings into possible Trump administration ties to Russia with surgical, aggressive questioning. As one of many Democrats hoping to stop the Senate health care bill, she has chafed at the euphemism that Americans would “lose” their coverage under the plan. “It’s not like we left our health care on the bus or at the club or in an Uber,” she said at a home-state rally in Torrance on Monday. “This is not about losing something. They’re trying to take our health care.” So when Ms. Harris ducks questions about her national ambitions — she has been rumored as one of many Democrats considering a presidential run in 2020 — the implication is quite clear.

"WARSAW — President Trump said on Thursday that Western civilization was at risk of decline, bringing a message about “radical Islamic terrorism” and “the creep of government bureaucracy” to a European capital he views as hospitable to his nationalist message. Mr. Trump, who broke with tradition by attacking American leaders and his country’s intelligence services while abroad, delivered his message in a speech to a friendly Polish crowd before a two-day summit meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Hamburg, Germany. Hours later, he flew from Warsaw to Hamburg, where he held a low-key private meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. She perhaps best symbolizes the deep skepticism shared by Western leaders toward Mr. Trump’s persona and his policies, ranging from addressing climate change to confronting Russia. In what may be a foretaste of the scene during the gathering, 12,000 protesters vowing to disrupt the G-20 summit meeting converged for a demonstration in Hamburg on Thursday night called “Welcome to Hell.” There were reports that dozens of police officers had sustained minor injuries as a small group of protesters attacked them with bottles, poles and iron bars in clashes that lasted until midnight. Up to 100,000 protesters were expected in the coming days. Mr. Trump roused his Polish hosts by recounting the country’s history of resistance to invaders, including Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. But he said nothing about the right-wing government’s crackdown on judges and journalists and its refusal to accept more migrants, policies that have upset European Union leaders. He instead praised Poland as a defender of liberty in the face of existential threats. “The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,” he said. “Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?” "
"BRUSSELS — The European Union and Japan announced a broad agreement on Thursday that would lower barriers on virtually all the goods traded between them, a pointed challenge to President Trump on the eve of a summit meeting of world leaders in Germany. Though the deal still needs further negotiation and approval before it can take effect, it represents an act of geopolitical theater, a day before a Group of 20 summit meeting begins in Hamburg. At a meeting of G-20 finance ministers in March, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, pointedly declined to endorse a statement in favor of free trade. “Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said at a news conference in Brussels. “The world really doesn’t need to go a hundred years back in time. Quite the opposite.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said the deal signified the creation of “the world’s largest free, advanced, industrialized economic zone.” Here’s what you need to know about the deal: The core of the agreement aims to increase the flow of Japanese cars to Europe and of European food to Japan. The Europeans are expected to scrap a 10 percent tariff on passenger cars made in Japan, over a period of seven years. Duties would come down more rapidly for some car components. "

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. It’s often difficult to distinguish between what you want to happen and what is likely to happen. I’m going to use today’s newsletter to disagree partially with an op-ed in which I think the authors muddy this distinction. It’s written by Mark Penn, the former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Andrew Stein, the former Manhattan borough president. Penn is a longtime centrist Democrat who played an important role in shifting the party to the center in the early 1990s. And his and Stein’s piece argues for a similar shift today. Democrats, they write, must “reject the siren calls of the left, whose policies and ideas have weakened the party.” They list a series of issues on which the party should move to the right in order to attract working-class votes: trade, immigration, crime, jobs and social issues. To me, this diagnosis is too simple. There are indeed several issues (like immigration, guns and religion) in which polling suggests a more conservative stance — or at least more of a big-tent approach — could help Democrats. But whatever your own ideology, it’s hard to find much evidence that the working class wants Democrats to move to the right on economic matters. Donald Trump, after all, won the Republican nomination and the presidency partly thanks to moving his party to the left — albeit only rhetorically — on economic issues. Ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage keep passing, even in red states. Government health care programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, are so popular that Congressional Republicans can’t figure out how to repeal Obamacare. My view is that the answer for the Democratic Party is more complicated than either a Clinton-esque “third way” centrism or a pure Sanders-esque leftism. But I also encourage you to read the piece by Penn and Stein. "
"TAIPEI, Taiwan — Over the past year, China has doubled down on its campaign to reduce Taiwan’s presence on the world stage, whether by luring away its few remaining diplomatic allies — most recently Panama — or blocking its participation in international organizations like Interpol and the World Health Organization. Now President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan is trying to tweet the island back into the global conversation. Ms. Tsai had her first encounter with Twitter’s reach in December, when Donald J. Trump, newly elected to the White House, wrote on Twitter that she had called to congratulate him. His announcement made headlines around the world. It was believed to have been the first time an American president or president-elect had spoken with a leader of the island since at least 1979, when the United States broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China, as part of its recognition of the People’s Republic of China. Weeks later, Ms. Tsai revived her moribund Twitter account, posting regularly in English and sometimes in Japanese. Since then, her followers have nearly tripled. Her office says her rekindled interest was spurred by outreach from Twitter itself, not by the Trump episode. But there are certain parallels between Ms. Tsai and President Trump. Where Mr. Trump uses the service to bypass what he considers a biased news establishment and to address the public directly, Ms. Tsai appears to see it as a means to circumvent the diplomatic isolation imposed by China.

"Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the Education Department and its secretary, Betsy DeVos, challenging the department’s move last month to freeze new rules for erasing the federal loan debt of student borrowers who were cheated by colleges that acted fraudulently. The rules, known as borrower defense, were finalized in October by the Obama administration after years of negotiation and review, and they had been scheduled to take effect on July 1. But after President Trump took office, Ms. DeVos paused the planned changes, citing a federal lawsuit filed in May by an association of for-profit colleges in California that sought to block the rules. Ms. DeVos also criticized the rules, calling them “a muddled process that’s unfair to students and schools,” and she said she would establish a new rule-making committee to reconsider the matter from scratch. In their lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, the states called the agency’s rationale for the delay — the California lawsuit — a “mere pretext” for repealing and replacing rules that had already been finalized. The states are seeking to have the rules restored. “Since Day 1, Secretary DeVos has sided with for-profit school executives against students and families drowning in unaffordable student loans,” said Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, who led the multistate coalition. “Her decision to cancel vital protections for students and taxpayers is a betrayal of her office’s responsibility and a violation of federal law.” Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, criticized the states’ lawsuit, calling it “ideologically driven.” The California lawsuit “makes serious and credible charges” from institutions that would be affected by the new rules, she said.

"LONDON — In the master plan advanced by President Trump, an unabashedly aggressive United States is supposed to reclaim its rightful perch as the center of the commercial universe, wielding its economic dominance to dictate the rules of global trade. As it turns out, the rest of the planet has its own ideas. Major economies show no inclination to accept American designs on trade — an attitude on display on Thursday as the European Union and Japan agreed to the broad outlines of a free trade deal before a summit meeting of world leaders. If completed, the deal would further the exchange of goods and services between their two markets while, in relative terms, diminishing opportunities for American companies. These two trading powers, both bedrock American allies, are effectively proceeding with plans to bolster globalization just as the United States is turning to protectionism. Large areas of the global economy are now on divergent paths, creating more uncertainty for multinational companies. Last fall, Canada and the European Union struck a mammoth trade deal, establishing the rules for a significant chunk of commerce across the Atlantic. The bloc’s latest deal tethers its fortunes closer to Asia and to Japan, which has the world’s third-largest economy. By contrast, the United States debates the merits of erecting a wall along its southern border, argues about the legality of barring immigrants from several predominantly Muslim nations, and contemplates imposing tariffs on steel imports. “We were able to demonstrate a strong political will to the effect that Japan and the E.U. will hoist the flag of free trade high amidst protectionist trends,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said at a news conference in Brussels announcing the agreement. “This is an achievement we should be proud of which also sends a strong message to the world.” "

"For almost a year, Connie Yates and Chris Gard have experienced every parent’s worst nightmare: They have watched their infant son move inexorably toward death. Charlie was born with an extremely rare genetic disorder called mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. It’s a complicated-sounding name, but the symptoms are straightforward and brutal. They include generalized weakness, the inability to eat and breathe, and, ultimately, death. Doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London have done everything possible to support Charlie from his birth, despite the steady progression of his underlying condition. When he was unable to eat and swallow, they began feeding him through a tube. When he was unable to breathe on his own they supported him through mechanical ventilation. But with no actual cure available, Charlie’s condition continued to deteriorate to the point where clinicians worried that continued use of life-prolonging therapies was no longer in his best interest, providing little benefit while protracting his suffering. Charlie’s parents searched desperately for a treatment that could prolong their baby’s life. They were heartened this winter when they found a neurologist at an American medical center who agreed to accept Charlie for an experimental treatment called nucleoside bypass therapy. Initial excitement cooled somewhat when the neurologist clarified that the oral treatment, at best, would provide a small chance of improvement in brain function, perhaps allowing Charlie to smile. Nevertheless, Charlie’s parents began a fundraising campaign to try to get him to the United States. Despite the Gards’ express desire to continue life-sustaining measures and to travel abroad, the Great Ormond Street Hospital went to the British courts in April seeking permission to remove life support. The court ruled in favor of the hospital, a ruling that was reaffirmed in May after an appeal by the parents to the British Supreme Court. “How can they do this to us?” Charlie’s mother screamed after the decision was handed down. Charlie’s parents appealed further to the European Court of Human Rights, which on June 27 concurred that the hospital could legally remove life-sustaining therapies. In the meantime, Charlie became something of a celebrity. Pope Francis said that he is “praying” for the parents “in the hope that their desire to accompany and care for their own child until the end will be respected” and the Vatican hospital has even offered to take Charlie in. President Trump weighed in on Monday, tweeting that he would be “delighted” to help Charlie, though it’s unclear to what extent he had been briefed on Charlie’s condition. Now the Gards are trapped: They face the absolute certainty that their child will die. At the same time, they are living with terrible uncertainty about how and when that will happen. Legally, the hospital can remove Charlie’s life-supporting therapies at any time. "

EXIT WEST
By Mohsin Hamid
231 pp. Riverhead Books. (2017) We find the protagonists of this novel, Nadia and Saeed, at a tipping point: Their unnamed city is “swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace,” and their love affair progresses as the atmosphere devolves into open warfare. Mohsin Hamid writes affectingly about how the casualties of war and violence can creep slowly into people’s lives. Nadia and Saeed are upwardly mobile young professionals living cosmopolitan lives — they meet one evening at a corporate identity and product branding class — when they are forced to uproot in order to escape the truck bombs and armed soldiers overtaking their hometown. In a stroke of magic realism, the pair escape through a portal that transports them to a foreign, safer country. Hamid deftly captures the refugee experience and also imagines a near future when migration becomes the norm, exploring how the “natives” of the host country learn to forge a new society with the incoming strangers.

"Like most great romances, theirs borrows from others. It’s “Sleepless in Seattle,” except they’re both blonds — sort of. Their feelings bloom long before they ever meet. They communicate across time zones, in words and wishes rather than caresses. Can reality match giddy expectation? The answer comes Friday, when they gaze into each other’s eyes for the first time. It’s “Romeo and Juliet.” Their clans have long feuded, but they won’t be denied. Vladimir, Vladimir, wherefore art thou, Vladimir? In Hamburg, Germany, looking past the duller leaders of lesser countries to his chosen one. You can regard the relationship of Putin and Donald Trump as purely odd and possibly corrupt, or you can see in it and in them a classic tale of affections strangled and at times set free. It’s irrepressible, international — part “Clueless,” part “Casablanca.” They have gone through all the usual phases of courtship. They have plumbed all the customary emotions. At least Trump has. To be brutally honest and risk bruising his quivering heart, this has been a lopsided affair, unless you count Putin’s meddling in the 2016 election as the purest possible expression of ardor and fidelity, which I suppose you can. When did love begin to take root? As far back as a decade ago, Putin caught Trump’s eye, and Trump sent him a signal, courtesy of a little birdie named Larry King. “Whether you like him or don’t,” he told King on CNN in 2007, “he’s doing a great job in rebuilding the image of Russia and also rebuilding Russia, period.” Trump liked him all right and stopped playing coy in 2013, before he traveled to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant there. “Do you think Putin will be going?” Trump tweeted, and you could picture him poised blushingly over his keypad, like a schoolgirl scribbling in her diary. “If so, will he become my new best friend?” "
"There are plays you’re supposed to like but don’t, and plays you’re not supposed to like but do. For me, “Kim’s Convenience,” which opened on Wednesday at the Pershing Square Signature Center, is both. You’re supposed to like the play, about a Toronto variety store run by a family of Korean-Canadians, in part because it would just be darn rude not to. It is, after all, a kind of Pan-American offering, part of a monthlong New York residency by the Soulpepper Theater Company of Toronto. That residency is well timed. “Come From Away,” the celebrated Newfoundland musical I somehow disliked, has primed the pump here for Canadian theater, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada (a former drama teacher!) has basically set himself up as a shiny alternative to the arts-defunding, immigrant-dispelling Trump agenda. In a brief post-show greeting, Albert Schultz, Soulpepper’s founding artistic director, slyly acknowledged that northern halo, discerning among the evening’s audience members a bunch of Canadians — they were waving tiny maple leaf flags — and “maybe some who want to be soon.” You’re also supposed to like “Kim’s Convenience” because it is aggressively designed, by the playwright Ins Choi, to be likable. (It has been a success for Soulpepper since 2012.) In this case, likable means sentimental, familiar and generically feel-good. Mr. Kim (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) is Appa — “father” in Korean — a gruff, undemonstrative paterfamilias whose struggles as an immigrant and a provider are nevertheless valorized. In this, he may remind you of dozens of characters, from Tevye to Archie Bunker, whose assumptions and worldview are challenged by changing times and freethinking daughters. "
"For years before North Korea fired its first intercontinental ballistic missile this week, the Pentagon and intelligence experts had sounded a warning: Not only was the North making progress quickly, spy satellite coverage was so spotty that the United States might not see a missile being prepared for launch. That set off an urgent but quiet search for ways to improve America’s early-warning ability — and the capability to strike missiles while they are on the launchpad. The most intriguing solutions have come from Silicon Valley, where the Obama administration began investing in tiny, inexpensive civilian satellites developed to count cars in Target parking lots and monitor the growth of crops. Some in the Pentagon accustomed to relying on highly classified, multibillion-dollar satellites, which take years to develop, resisted the move. But as North Korea’s missile program progressed, American officials laid out an ambitious schedule for the first of the small satellites to go up at the end of this year, or the beginning of next. Launched in clusters, some staying in orbit just a year or two, the satellites would provide coverage necessary to execute a new military contingency plan called “Kill Chain.” It is the first step in a new strategy to use satellite imagery to identify North Korean launch sites, nuclear facilities and manufacturing capability and destroy them pre-emptively if a conflict seems imminent. Even a few extra minutes of warning might save the lives of tens of thousands of Americans — and millions of South Koreans and Japanese who already live within range of the North’s missiles. “Kim Jong-un is racing — literally racing — to deploy a missile capability,” Robert Cardillo, the director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which coordinates satellite-based mapping for the government, said in an interview days before North Korea’s latest launch. “His acceleration has caused us to accelerate.” "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump warned North Korea of unspecified consequences for its test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. “I don’t like to talk about what we have planned — but I have some pretty severe things that we’re thinking about,” he said in Warsaw, his first stop in Europe en route to the G-20 summit meeting in Germany. In contrast, South Korea made a conciliatory gesture, calling for cross-border family reunions. The U.S. is expected to move to tighten U.N. sanctions on North Korea — though the country has managed, despite the existing straitjacket, a construction spree that runs the gamut from a ski resort, above, to an experimental submarine, as our interactive details. _____ "
"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea called on Thursday for family reunions for older Koreans separated by war six decades ago in a conciliatory move after the North’s first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, made the proposal during an address in Germany, where he was scheduled to attend a Group of 20 summit meeting this week. In his first speech since North Korea’s missile test on Tuesday, Mr. Moon reaffirmed his policy of seeking to engage the North through negotiations even as his government vowed to join Washington in tightening sanctions against the North after its ICBM test. “What the North chose to do this time was reckless,” Mr. Moon said in a speech delivered at the Körber Foundation, a nonprofit research group based in Berlin. “It asked for punishment from the international community.” He added, “If the North doesn’t stop its nuclear pursuit, there is no other option but to enforce even stronger sanctions and pressure.” But Mr. Moon also reiterated that he was willing to meet Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, “at any time and any place” if the circumstances were right and if he saw an opportunity to reverse the military standoff on the Korean Peninsula. He said North Korea should return to the negotiating table to discuss a “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” If the North chooses that path, he said, great benefits wait for it: security guarantees like a peace treaty for Mr. Kim’s regime, as well as joint economic projects and other assistance that would help rebuild the North Korean economy.

"WARSAW — The crowd in Krasinski Square was loving it. “In the Polish people,” President Trump said, “we see the soul of Europe.” Cheers. Shouts of joy. American flags of red, white and blue waved with red and white Polish ones across the crowded square, the epicenter of the Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis in 1944 and the site of a revered monument to that battle. Aging fighters from Poland’s struggle against Communism stood alongside new mothers pushing baby carriages, and the crowd spilled into the narrow side streets on the edge of Old Town. If Mr. Trump was looking for a soft entry point for his second foray into Europe as president, after the stinging reaction of many European leaders to his first visit, he certainly found it. “Poland is the first place in his foreign voyages where he can feel fully satisfied,” Janusz Sibora, an expert in diplomatic protocol, said in an interview with Gazeta.pl, a Polish website. “If he could, he would have taken this square back with him to Washington.” As for Poland’s government, which has been repeatedly criticized by the European Union and others for moves that they say erode the rule of law, the American president’s visit was a chance to prove that Poland has powerful friends who share its nationalist vision. In his speech on Thursday, not a word of concern about respect for the rule of law escaped President Trump’s lips, to the delight of the leaders of Law and Justice, Poland’s right-wing governing party. "
"President Trump praised Poland’s democratic values in a speech on Thursday and lauded the country as a beacon. “I am here today not just to visit an old ally, but to hold it up as an example for others who seek freedom,” Mr. Trump told a crowd in Warsaw. Not everyone agrees. Since Poland’s conservative Law and Justice Party came to power in 2015, the country has been criticized by international organizations over measures that they say undermine freedom. Here are some of their concerns: Shortly after the Law and Justice Party assumed power, it took several steps to gain more control over the nation’s Constitutional Tribunal. It appointed more judges aligned with the party to the court, limited the court’s ability to overturn new laws and made it possible for the government to appoint the country’s top prosecutor directly. The European Union’s executive arm has begun an inquiry into the judicial measures over concerns that they violate the bloc’s rules. The new government moved swiftly in 2015 to replace the management at state-run television and radio outlets, and it then passed a law giving itself direct control over the hiring and firing of executives of state news media. More recently, it has discussed plans to restrict foreign investment in privately run Polish media companies and “repolonize” the industry. “The Polish government’s attacks on the media are attacks on liberal democracy,” said Michael J. Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House, an organization that monitors press freedom around the world. The group said that legislative, political and economic means were all being used to “stifle the media and limit dissent.” The government has come under fire for legislation aimed at women, especially a 2016 bill to ban nearly all abortions in the country. The bill failed after thousands of people protested in 90 Polish cities. Last month, the government passed a bill requiring a prescription for the morning-after pill for emergency contraception, which had been available over the counter to any woman over the age of 15. The health minister cited concerns about harmful health effects, even though the World Health Organization says the pill poses little to no risk. “Restricting access to the ‘morning-after pill’ will have devastating consequences for women and girls living in a country which already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe,” Anna Blus of Amnesty International said in a statement.

"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. Three families had to evacuate their homes in Florida in January after someone sent an anonymous email to a detective, claiming to have placed bombs at their addresses. The case, discussed at greater length in This Week in Hate on Wednesday, was unusual in that the only apparent connection between the victims was their surname, Gonzalez. But it was also an example of a kind of harassment that’s become disturbingly common: a practice called swatting. In a swatting, someone makes a fake report of a bomb or shooter at a victim’s address, hoping to draw law enforcement officers, such as a SWAT team, to the house. This can be terrifying and sometimes dangerous, as heavily armed officers arrive at the home of an unsuspecting person. In 2015, a 20-year-old man in Maryland was shot in the face with rubber bullets by police after someone allegedly reported a fake hostage situation at his house. The FBI has estimated that about 400 cases of swatting occur nationwide every year, but anecdotal reports suggest the numbers are far higher than that, according to Rep. Katherine Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts, who introduced an anti-swatting bill in Congress in 2015. In addition to the physical risks, swatting also wastes law enforcement time and money — some cases have cost police departments as much as $100,000, Ms. Clark said. It’s not clear why the Gonzalez families in Florida were singled out for swatting. But swatters have targeted a variety of people for a variety of reasons, going after celebrities and micro-celebrities (the creator of the “Damn Daniel” meme was swatted last year), video game developers, politicians and ordinary people they met online. Women and girls are more likely than men to be the target of severe online abuse like swatting, Ms. Clark noted. After she introduced the bill, Ms. Clark herself was the victim of swatting. She was watching TV with her husband when police cars pulled up to her house; when she walked outside, she saw officers with long guns on the lawn. Even though she knew all about swatting, she felt a “moment of terror about what was unfolding.” "
"France is joining a growing movement to force the extinction of vehicles that run on fossil fuels, saying on Thursday that it would aim to end the sale of gasoline and diesel cars by 2040. The target is less ambitious than ones set by countries like Norway and India. Still, coming from a major car-producing country, France’s declaration gave additional momentum to efforts to fight climate change and urban smog by promoting the use of electric cars. The timing of the announcement was also significant, a day after the automaker Volvo said it would phase out the internal combustion engine, and during a visit to Europe by President Trump. The announcement by Nicolas Hulot, the French environment minister, was an expression of European leaders’ determination to pursue an environmental agenda despite Mr. Trump’s repudiation of the Paris agreement on climate change. “It’s a very difficult objective,” Mr. Hulot said Thursday. “But the solutions are there.” The plan to phase out gasoline and diesel cars is part of a broader effort by France to limit global warming, which Mr. Hulot outlined Thursday. The country will also stop issuing new oil and gas exploration permits this year, and stop using coal to produce electricity by 2022, he said. Mr. Hulot’s statement was the latest sign that the century-long reign of the internal combustion engine may be slowly coming to an end. On Wednesday, Volvo said that all of its new models beginning in 2019 would be either battery-powered cars or hybrids that combined electric motors with diesel or gasoline engines. "
"MOSCOW — With the long-awaited first meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump finally in sight, the Kremlin is hoping at a minimum to inject some clarity into a relationship so far marred by contradictions, anxiety, scattered recriminations and, on occasion, astonishing bonhomie. “As for the policy of the U.S. administration, we have to understand first what it will involve,” Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, said last week in Moscow at a conference of foreign policy experts from both countries. “This is what we are actually trying to do, in an utmost active manner, right now.” Whatever the outcome of the encounter on Friday — which will be on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting of world leaders in Hamburg, Germany, but is expected to overshadow it — the Kremlin is betting that Mr. Putin can stage-manage the event so that he comes out looking like the stronger party. If nothing much emerges from the meeting, analysts said, the Kremlin can repeat the standard Russian line that Mr. Trump is weak, hamstrung by domestic politics. But if Mr. Trump agrees to work with Mr. Putin despite a list of Russian transgressions beginning with the annexation of Crimea and ending with its interference in the 2016 presidential election, he will also look weak while Mr. Putin can claim that he reconstructed the relationship.

"To the Editor: Re “Dispute Over British Baby’s Fate Draws In President and Pope” (front page, July 4): Three British courts as well as the European Court of Human Rights have agreed that it is ethically right to override the parents’ wishes and remove life support from their 11-month-old son, Charlie Gard, who has a rare, incurable and ultimately fatal neurological disease. The reason given is that it is in the child’s “best interests” to allow him to die. The Court of Human Rights said “it was most likely Charlie was being exposed to continued pain, suffering and distress” and that exposing him to futile treatment “would offer no benefit, and continue to cause him significant harm.” But this reasoning is open to serious question. It is difficult, if not impossible, to assume correctly that patients with devastating brain damage are truly suffering or in pain. Presumably, if Charlie’s physicians felt that he was in pain, they would treat it aggressively. While there might be other arguments to remove life support in this tragic case — and doing so would not be unethical if the parents chose to do so — the suffering or pain argument does not hold water. And as for what is in this infant’s best interests, society must think twice before arrogating to itself the power to override the assessment of parents and determine that their child is better off dead than alive. KENNETH PRAGER, NEW YORK The writer is director of medical ethics and a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. To the Editor: President Trump’s better angels emerged in his tweet defending Baby Charlie, who is afflicted with a terminal disease. "
"WASHINGTON — Walter M. Shaub Jr., the government’s top ethics watchdog, who has repeatedly gone head-to-head with the Trump administration over conflicts of interest, said on Thursday that he was calling it quits. Mr. Shaub’s five-year term as the director of the Office of Government Ethics is not set to expire until January, but with little chance of renewal and an appealing offer in hand from a nonpartisan advocacy group, he said the time was right to leave. “There isn’t much more I could accomplish at the Office of Government Ethics, given the current situation,” Mr. Shaub said in an interview on Thursday. “O.G.E.’s recent experiences have made it clear that the ethics program needs to be strengthened.” His new position, he said, will allow him to advocate freely for such changes. In a short letter informing President Trump of his decision, Mr. Shaub did not offer a specific reason for his departure but extolled “the principle that public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws and ethical principles above private gain.” He said he had not been pressured to resign. The White House promptly accepted Mr. Shaub’s resignation, and Lindsay E. Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the administration “appreciates his service.” Mr. Trump, she said, would nominate a successor “in short order.” "
