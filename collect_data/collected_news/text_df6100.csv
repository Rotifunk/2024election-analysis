"CHICAGO — The race for Illinois governor has come down to this: the multimillionaire versus the billionaire. Gov. Bruce Rauner, a private-equity executive seeking a second term in office, prevailed in a tough battle for the Republican nomination on Tuesday, while J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire philanthropist and venture capitalist from a prominent Chicago family, won the Democratic nomination for governor, according to the Associated Press. Their victories promise a contest that will be fiercely fought and dominated by big money, with each candidate controlling tremendous sums of personal wealth to spend on his campaign. The two men have already raised more than $150 million, on track to become one of the most expensive governor’s races in history. In the state’s most closely watched congressional primary, the longtime Chicago-area Representative Daniel Lipinski narrowly defeated a challenger from the left, Marie Newman, according to the A.P. The race became something of a proxy between moderate and progressive Democrats. In the coming general election campaign for governor, Mr. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain, is expected to present a serious threat to Mr. Rauner, who has alienated voters on both the left and the right during his rocky term. For more than three years, a frustrated Mr. Rauner has battled Michael J. Madigan, the powerful Democratic speaker of the House; struggled to implement his own agenda; and, in the process, become one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors in the nation. But Mr. Rauner, 61, survived a challenge from Jeanne Ives, a Republican legislator and Army veteran who took a hard-right stance on social issues and attacked him for being insufficiently conservative.

"Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier described as a Nazi by the Illinois Republican Party, won the Republican primary on Tuesday in the state’s Third Congressional District, a heavily Democratic district that includes part of Chicago and its suburbs, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Jones, 70, unsuccessfully sought the nomination five times before, and his victory on Tuesday was a foregone conclusion after the Republican Party failed to draft another candidate to enter the race against him. “Even if only myself and my wife voted for me, I’d win the primary because the Republican Party screwed up big time,” Mr. Jones said in an interview. The Illinois Republican Party has sought to distance itself from Mr. Jones in recent weeks, blanketing the district with campaign fliers and robocalls urging voters to “stop Illinois Nazis,” according to a robocall script provided by the party. Mr. Jones said he had received three robocalls himself. “Arthur Jones is not a real Republican — he is a Nazi whose disgusting, bigoted views have no place in our nation’s discourse,” Tim Schneider, the Illinois Republican Party chairman, said in a statement. He said the party had urged voters “to skip over his name when they go to the polls” and moving forward planned on “vehemently opposing Jones with real campaign dollars.” A spokesman for the Illinois Republican Party said those dollars would be used to support an independent candidate in the November general election. Party leaders are in talks with several potential candidates, the spokesman said, but have not yet decided which one to endorse. "
"Many years ago, the Israeli Bedouin expert Clinton Bailey told me a story about a Bedouin chief who discovered one day that his favorite turkey had been stolen. He called his sons together and told them: “Boys, we are in great danger now. My turkey’s been stolen. Find my turkey.” His boys just laughed and said, “Father, what do you need that turkey for?” and they ignored him. A few weeks later the Bedouin chief’s camel was stolen. His sons went to him and said, “Father, your camel has been stolen. What should we do?” And the chief answered, “Find my turkey.” A few weeks later the chief’s horse was stolen, and again his sons asked what they should do. “Find my turkey,” the chief said. Finally, a few weeks later his daughter was abducted, at which point he gathered his sons and told them: “It’s all because of the turkey! When they saw that they could take my turkey, we lost everything.” I retell that story today because it’s helpful in understanding how and why we failed to contain the egregious behavior of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. They each started by — metaphorically speaking — stealing a turkey. And when we didn’t respond, they kept ratcheting up their wretched behavior to the point where Trump thinks he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and Putin thinks he could poison a wayward spy in London, and get away with it.

"BRUSSELS — European authorities on Wednesday proposed revamping the way many technology companies in the region are taxed, outlining wide-ranging changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the European Union. The system would tax a company’s revenues in the countries where they are generated, rather than its profits. Regulators say so-called profit-shifting allows some businesses to use regional offices in low-tax countries to reduce payments. The plan pits the European Union against the United States as both sides battle to retain corporate tax revenue. It is one of a number of issues on which Brussels and Washington have clashed, from the broader regulation of the technology industry to a dispute over American steel and aluminum tariffs. The proposals unveiled on Wednesday also support the argument that Europe is the world’s most prominent regulator of technology and digital services. The 28-nation European Union has outsize impact not just for its market of about 500 million customers, but because officials around the world increasingly take their cue from Brussels on how to regulate the tech industry. “The digital revolution has turned our economies upside down,” said Pierre Moscovici, the European Union’s tax commissioner. “When you ‘like’ a picture, when you post a video on social media,” he said, “your click sets in motion a chain of business transactions and thus creates considerable profits.” “But under today’s rules, those profits are not taxed,” Mr. Moscovici said. “The current legal vacuum is creating a substantial shortfall in the budgetary revenues of our member states.” It also creates an uneven playing field between digital and traditional businesses, he argued.

"As a real estate executive and reality TV star, Donald J. Trump tightly controlled his image by insisting that everyone around him sign nondisclosure agreements threatening steep monetary penalties if they revealed anything about him or his company. A few months into his presidency, Mr. Trump — infuriated by leaks about everything from staff rivalries to his bathrobe-wearing, TV-viewing habits — ordered Reince Priebus, then his chief of staff, to do the same thing in the West Wing. To calm Mr. Trump, Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, drew up a broad document barring White House officials from publicly disclosing what they heard and saw at work. But he privately told senior aides that it was mainly meant to placate an agitated president, who was convinced that the people around him had to be pressured into keeping his secrets. Mr. McGahn made it clear the agreement could not ultimately be enforced, according to several people who signed. The nondisclosure agreement, presented by Mr. Priebus to the senior staff last April, did not specify any penalties — financial or otherwise — for breaking it. But it was an early indication that Mr. Trump, who spent decades using pressure tactics and secrecy in his private life, wanted to do the same thing at the White House, breaking with tradition. He would push the obsession of many of his predecessors with damaging leaks to a new level. And if the potential for punishment seemed remote to his top aides, the message from the president was clear: keep quiet. The White House declined to provide a copy of the two- to three-page document, which was described by several current and former White House officials who signed it and insisted on anonymity to discuss it. A spokesman would not say whether senior officials were required to sign such an agreement. "
"The novelist Mary Gordon, known for books like 1981’s “The Company of Women,” about a girl who escapes her sheltered upbringing to embrace rebellion in 1960s America, considers her lifelong admiration of British actor-politician Glenda Jackson a “romance.” Gordon was 16 when she first saw Jackson onstage, in the 1965 Broadway production of “Marat/Sade,” a philosophical investigation of the meaning of protest set during and after the French Revolution. In the ’70s, Gordon, now 68, graduated from college to a life in letters, and she memorized lines from “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” a 1971 film directed by John Schlesinger and starring Jackson as Alex, a woman competing with a doctor, played by Peter Finch, for the love of a young male sculptor and coming to terms with free love. As Gordon’s novels and nonfiction — including an important 1978 essay on abortion rights published in the New York Review of Books — won her increasing acclaim, she watched Jackson, now a two-time Oscar winner, make a turn to a surprising second career as a liberal member of Parliament beginning in 1992. Finally, and just as surprisingly, Jackson returned to acting. Just after turning 80 two years ago, she won raves in London as a gender-blind King Lear. This spring brings Jackson back to Broadway, starring in the revival of Edward Albee’s 1991 play “Three Tall Women,” which opens March 29, about a woman recalling her life’s great triumphs and regrets. One morning in January in Manhattan, Gordon finally met her idol for a long conversation, which covered poetry, film and theater, but most significantly the state of feminism today. MARY GORDON: My life was based on you during the ’70s, but the first time I saw you, I sneaked out of my house to see “Marat/Sade.” I knew that if I was going to be the kind of person I wanted to be, I had to go see it. And it’s still deeply disturbing. GLENDA JACKSON: It doesn’t have that effect on me at all. As a play to be in, it was extraordinary. We’d played it in London to totally silent audiences, but in New York, they applauded the songs; they shouted, “Encore!” MG: Yes, I remember it. Do you see a through line from that to your interpretation of Lear? Both touch on madness. GJ: Well, when I worked with Peter Brook it was like coming across an oasis in the desert. Like all great directors, he creates the kind of world in which everyone’s responsible for the whole play. That sense of the total being greater than the sum of the parts is very, very strong in “Lear.” Now, I wasn’t interested in the gender-bender aspect, but what I did find interesting is how age begins to fracture those absolutes which tell you what women are and what men are. MG: “Sunday Bloody Sunday” is one of my favorite movies in the world. Why do you think it hasn’t been shown more often? "
"HARTFORD — Andrew J. McDonald had been overwhelmingly approved by lawmakers five years ago when he joined the Connecticut Supreme Court. Now he has returned to the State Legislature — this time nominated to be chief justice with the backing of much of the state’s legal establishment. He was put up for the job by a Democratic governor in a state where the party has dominated for years. Still, his confirmation is anything but guaranteed and has devolved into a contentious partisan fight. Justice McDonald is not the first Supreme Court nominee in Connecticut to face significant resistance in the State Legislature. But his nomination has become marked by an unusual level of acrimony. Stiff opposition from Republicans has imperiled his confirmation, while his supporters have mounted a robust effort that borrows from the tactics of political campaigns, even using robocalls and television advertisements to pressure lawmakers. (One commercial featured an image of President Trump and urged residents to call their legislator, saying, “You can stop this smear campaign now.”) The battle, which has drawn widespread attention to what can often be a rather subdued process, has been described by legal experts as further evidence of politics seeping into the selection of judges across the country. The situation also reflects a fractured political climate in Connecticut, as Republicans, and even some Democrats, have become emboldened in challenging an unpopular governor, Dannel P. Malloy, who is in his last year in office. Justice McDonald’s critics have sought to portray him as beholden to the governor and the Democratic Party, and they have argued that he has used the court to advance political interests. Much of the opposition has been driven by his role in a Supreme Court decision over the repeal of the death penalty. Among those who voted against his nomination were Representative William A. Petit Jr., whose wife and daughters were killed in a grisly 2007 home invasion. “I do not believe he has the experience nor temperament to be the C.E.O. of the judicial branch,” Dr. Petit, who was elected to the Legislature as a Republican in 2016, said on the House floor. But his supporters have suggested that at least some of the opposition has been motivated by Justice McDonald’s sexual orientation — he would become the first openly gay chief justice in the country. They also contend that the intensity of the questioning he has faced and the rancor surrounding his confirmation suggests dubious motivations. "
"On Sept. 20, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, turning my life upside down. At the time, my two daughters and I were living in Carolina, a town on the northeastern side of the island. In just a day, my clothes were turned to rags, my home was destroyed, and I lost the few belongings I had. My mother lived in the same town but her house was still standing. For two months, we slept on a couch in her living room. But we couldn’t stay there forever. In December, the Federal Emergency Management Agency moved us to New York City. Since then, we’ve been staying in hotels provided by FEMA in the Bronx and Brooklyn, like hundreds of other families who were moved to New York after the storm. But this experience can hardly be called “living.” We’re barely surviving. Congress and the Trump administration have failed to truly address the crisis, leaving survivors stranded months after the storm. In Puerto Rico, we were told by FEMA that we were going to be welcomed in New York with open arms. But that hasn’t been our experience. When we arrived in New York, we were placed in a hotel in the Bronx. There, we had no kitchen and thus couldn’t cook. We didn’t have enough money to eat out, so I fed my children microwaved meals for nearly three months. "

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A new Communist takeover, Boris Johnson’s Hitler comment, and Mark Zuckerberg’s highly anticipated moment. Here’s what you need to know: • Party power. China issued a blueprint for shaking up its bureaucracy that vastly increases the Communist Party’s control over government and culture. The plan empowers party panels to shape policy on reform, cybersecurity, economics, finance and foreign affairs. And it merges state-run radio and television broadcasters into a “Voice of China” conglomerate answering to the party’s Department of Propaganda, which will also control film, books and magazines. This week, Shanghai briefly detained and then returned a Chinese-born Australian, John Hugh, who has been sharply critical of the party’s efforts to influence Australian politics. _____ • A three-way summit meeting? President Moon Jae-in of South Korea floated the possibility of joining the planned meeting of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump in May, which he said would be “a momentous event in world history.” Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim are planning to meet in late April at Panmunjom, the “truce village” that straddles the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.

"MILAN — In the prelude to the Italian elections this month, the far-right League party did not distinguish itself for rhetorical subtlety. Its leader, Matteo Salvini, called Islam “incompatible with our values, rights and freedoms.” He characterized the single European currency as a “crime against humanity.” And the senior League politician Attilio Fontana, after deploring that the “white race” could be “wiped out” in Italy, went on to win the presidency of Lombardy, the wealthy northern region that includes this fashionable city, in a landslide. But pull up the League’s campaign manifesto, dig past the strident anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric, and suddenly the tone turns more poetic. “Italy and its thousand cultures should be the Silicon Valley of cultural heritage,” it sings, one of many flourishes among the party’s proposals for art institutions, churches and heritage sites. Unlike the League’s American cousins — Mr. Salvini is an avowed fan of President Trump — these Italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions, and their “Make Italy Great Again” vision highlights museums as much as migration policy. For Mr. Salvini’s party, the nationalist project goes right through the history of art. They are not the first right-wingers to make promises about Italian high culture. A few days after the March 4 elections, as the papers here weighed the likelihood of a populist governing coalition or a new poll, I visited two major exhibitions examining how art and politics informed each other at previous turning points in Italy’s history: in the 1920s and ’30s, on view at Fondazione Prada in Milan; and in the ’50s and ’60s, at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. Both reaffirmed that questions of culture — who defines what it is, and who administers it — have never been far from the surface of Italian political life. The better of the two shows — a landmark, really — is at Fondazione Prada, where the immense, scholarly “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum. Art Life Politics: Italia 1918-1943” opened last month. Get past the car crash of a title (it’s a riff on an early poem by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the godfather of Futurism) and you will discover more than 600 paintings, sculptures and design objects from Italy’s Fascist era, by the likes of Giorgio di Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, Gino Severini and dozens of unknowns, displayed amid countless historical documents that map the rise and fall of the interwar art world. It is a resounding achievement in exhibition making, blending rigorous scholarship, political engagement and immaculate design. "
"Less than two days before the Trump administration plans to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, its chief trade representative said Wednesday that several of the nation’s top trading partners were in line for potential exemptions. The trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee that the administration was talking with Australia, Argentina and the European Union about excluding them from the 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent charge on aluminum. He added that there were plans to talk with Brazil about possible exemptions, and raised the possibility that South Korea could be excluded as the United States continues to hold talks with Seoul over a bilateral trade agreement. Mr. Lighthizer said he favored sparing those countries from the tariffs while talks continue, though he said that decision would be “up to the president.” Mr. Lighthizer said he expected the conversations over exclusions to conclude by the end of April. The administration has already temporarily shielded Canada and Mexico from the tariffs during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Lighthizer’s testimony came a day after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was warned by global economic leaders at a meeting in Buenos Aires that the United States was risking a trade war by initiating the tariffs. President Trump declared earlier in the month that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” "
"BERKELEY, Calif. — A few months ago, the composer Jimmy López came to the University of California, Berkeley, to hear firsthand the experiences of young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. He was hoping to talk to students as he prepared to create “Dreamer,” an oratorio designed to reflect the inspiration that fuels the experience of immigrants, and the challenges they face. No one showed up that day. The morning of his visit, word spread that a parked U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle had been spotted on campus. It may have been the first time that the composition of an oratorio — the kind of grand choral work Bach, Handel and Haydn are all famous for — was interrupted by an appearance of the border patrol. But this is no ordinary oratorio. The world has changed, and the immigration issue has become more urgent since the piece, with music by Mr. López and a libretto by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz, was first conceived a couple of years ago by Cal Performances, the university’s performing arts presenter. After President Trump was elected, he moved to end the Obama-era program that shields nearly 700,000 young immigrants, often called “Dreamers,” from deportation, leaving them in limbo while his administration, Congress and the courts debate their fates. “There was nothing on the horizon when we began that would indicate what we were going to be facing,” Mr. López said in an interview, explaining that the rapidly changing immigration landscape had forced him to reconsider his concept for the piece. As it turned out, the immigration officials who had come to campus that day earlier this year were there to discuss a program that speeds security checks at airports. But the fears their vehicle sparked underscored how anxious a time this is for undocumented students. "
"The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that the central bank is on track to raise rates twice more in 2018. ■ The Fed said it would raise its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, marking the sixth time since the financial crisis that it has raised rates. ■ The Fed said at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting that the economy continues to strengthen and that it expects to increase rates another two times this year as it pursues a return to more normal interest rate levels. Officials also increased their expectations for economic growth this year in the United States, declaring that “the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.” They said they expect to raise interest rates three times next year, an increase from the two increases in 2019 that they forecast in December. ■ Jerome H. Powell, the new Fed chairman, expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. “We’re trying to take that middle ground,” he said in a news conference following his first policy meeting as head of the central bank. Mr. Powell, a former Fed governor, succeeded Janet L. Yellen last month. The Fed, under Ms. Yellen, pursued gradual rate increases and a highly choreographed sell-off of the portfolio of bonds it bought to help prop up the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell was among the governors who voted for that approach, and the announcement on Wednesday signaled he will maintain it, particularly if economic growth continues to accelerate and unemployment remains at or below the 4.1 percent level it reached in February. The announcement underscores the Fed’s gathering confidence in the economy as well as its focus on the potential for inflation, which has remained persistently muted throughout the expansion. Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. They raised their estimate for growth in 2019 to 2.4 percent, up from 2.1 percent. They now expect the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, a low level by historical standards. In December, officials said they expected unemployment to be 3.9 percent both this year and next. "
"JERUSALEM — Israel’s government on Wednesday publicly confirmed for the first time that it had carried out an audacious 2007 strike against a reactor in Syria that could have produced nuclear weapons fuel, lifting a decade of secrecy surrounding the episode. The country’s leaders used the occasion to warn that, if necessary, Israel would not hesitate to launch similar strikes again. “The government of Israel, the IDF and the Mossad prevented Syria from developing a nuclear capability,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces and the country’s spy agency. “Israel’s policy has been and remains consistent — to prevent our enemies from arming themselves with nuclear weapons.” International tension has been mounting over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which were supposed to have been contained by a 2015 agreement with the United States and its European allies. Mr. Netanyahu has criticized that deal as a historic mistake and Israel has set off alarms about Iran’s growing influence in Syria, where it is a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in the country’s seven-year civil war. During that conflict, Israel has carried out scores of other covert strikes in Syria against advanced weapons convoys and stores. President Trump has said that unless the European nations agree to make the deal much stricter, he will back out of it on May 12, renewing suspended sanctions on Tehran. "
"WASHINGTON — With government funding set to run out this weekend, congressional leaders agreed on a voluminous $1.3 trillion spending bill on Wednesday that would beef up domestic and military programs and keep the government open through September. “Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, “but at the end of the day, we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included.” The House and Senate have until midnight Friday to pass the spending bill to avoid what would be the third government shutdown of the year. As part of the spending talks, congressional leaders worked in recent days to resolve disputes over issues like immigration, a wall on the southern border with Mexico, health care and a planned rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey that has drawn the ire of President Trump. As the negotiations wrapped up on Capitol Hill, the president himself emerged as a potential obstacle, waffling on Wednesday about whether he could support the final package in part because it lacked sufficient funding for his wall. To salvage the agreement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan went to the White House residence to meet with Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs chief, with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, joining by telephone. A White House official said the group smoothed over differences over a number of items, including the wall and other border issues, as well as transportation and military funding. Afterward, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, issued an upbeat statement making it clear that Mr. Trump had overcome his reservations, saying that he and the congressional leaders had “discussed their support for the bill.” "
"To the Editor: Frank Bruni argues that President Trump’s reluctance to attack Stormy Daniels is an extraordinary, if not unique, aberration for a man who so readily denigrates, bullies, insults and threatens others (“The Calm Before the Stormy,” column, March 21). Rather, as Mr. Bruni observes, he is the “tempered pacifist,” perhaps fearful of what will be publicly revealed. More blatant and infinitely more consequential is his treatment of Vladimir Putin. As reported in “President’s Call to Putin Dodges Talk of Foul Play” (front page, March 21), Mr. Trump made a congratulatory call to Mr. Putin for his lopsided and undemocratic victory while withholding any criticism of Russia for its interference in our political process, its cyberattacks or its alleged role in the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England. We have a right, and a responsibility, to question Mr. Trump’s motivation. Mr. Trump’s treatment of Mr. Putin serves no clear political purpose and, in fact, runs counter to all the advice he has been given by his advisers. A logical speculation — and one can only speculate — is that just as the president may be fearful of what Stormy Daniels may reveal, he fears the same with Mr. Putin. For this reason, Congress should take a clear and proactive step to ensure that the Mueller investigation is not undermined. LARRY S. SANDBERG, NEW YORK "
"When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company’s chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation. When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, released a statement that said “we fell short.” And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote a letter to the public. “I messed up,” he said. “I owe everyone an explanation.” But in the past week, as Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg, the social network’s chief executive, said, well, nothing. Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, has made any public appearances this week. Mr. Zuckerberg’s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim; Ms. Sandberg’s most recent post was a four-day-old photo from her child’s debate competition.

"During the administration of President Barack Obama, attorneys general from Republican states developed a powerful tool: They teamed up dozens of times to sue the federal government to block environmental initiatives. Now, Democrats are using the same playbook to fight the Trump administration. Blue-state attorneys general have filed more than two dozen environmental lawsuits against the Trump administration since January 2017, and the victories are piling up. This month, a court said the Environmental Protection Agency had broken the law by delaying smog protections. In February, states forced the Department of Energy to enact efficiency standards for household appliances. And in two different decisions in the past year, courts thwarted the administration’s attempts to delay regulations on emissions by the oil and gas industry. The rise of state attorneys general as partisan warriors against presidential administrations is a relatively new phenomenon, according to some who served in more amicable days. “Up until 1999, the attorneys general were very nonpartisan,” said Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general and a Republican. For instance, Republicans and Democrats in the 1990s teamed up to sue the tobacco industry over the health effects of its products and the burdens cigarette smoking placed on state Medicaid budgets. Mr. Woods recalled that, when pursuing such cases with fellow state attorneys general, he was not even sure of some colleagues’ party affiliations. “Today everyone has it branded on their forehead, like a scarlet letter,” he said. The attorneys general fighting the Trump administration have a backer in Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York. Mr. Bloomberg has contributed $6 million to cover the salaries of university law fellows willing to work for states on lawsuits, investigations, public records requests and other measures to oppose the administration’s environmental policies. Republicans also got a helping hand when fighting environmental rules during the Obama administration. Republican attorneys general who challenged Mr. Obama’s policies together took in about $16 million in campaign contributions from energy companies in 2014. And Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of Murray Energy, coordinated a lawsuit with 29 mostly Republican-led states against the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Obama’s signature effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.

"TAIPEI, Taiwan — A State Department official on Wednesday reasserted America’s commitment to Taiwan’s defense at a dinner attended by its president, a day after China’s leader issued a stern warning against any challenges to China’s claim to the island. “The aim of U.S. policy is to ensure that Taiwan’s people can continue along their chosen path, free from coercion,” the official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong, said at the banquet in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, as President Tsai Ing-wen looked on. Speaking to 700 people, including representatives of top American companies and senior Taiwanese officials, at an American Chamber of Commerce function, Mr. Wong said the United States wanted “to strengthen our ties with the Taiwan people and to bolster Taiwan’s ability to defend its democracy.” “Our commitment to those goals has never been stronger,” added Mr. Wong, whose remarks came less than week after President Trump, over China’s objection, signed the Taiwan Travel Act, a measure encouraging official, high-level visits between the United States and Taiwan. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping of China issued a thinly veiled threat to Washington and Taipei during a speech to the National People’s Congress in Beijing. “Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure,” Mr. Xi said in a stridently nationalistic speech, “and will meet with the people’s condemnation and punishment of history.” The National People’s Congress this month removed term limits on Mr. Xi’s presidency, setting up the possibility he may hold the top posts of China’s government, military and the Communist Party for life.

"When President Trump met on Tuesday with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, a year after he first hosted the prince at the White House, something was missing. Women. Photos from Tuesday’s meeting show that the dynamics at the table remained relatively unchanged since the last meeting, and persistently male. After years of American foreign policy that has pushed for human rights, such a stark absence of women — and minorities — could send a symbolic message to the ultraconservative country known for its oppression of women and religious minorities. Some in attendance on the American side: Vice President Mike Pence; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser; and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser,  joined an all-male Saudi delegation for a second consecutive year. John F. Kelly, the chief of staff; Rick Perry, the energy secretary; and Gary D. Cohn, the departing top economic adviser, also joined the president. Saudi leaders have loosened some restrictions on women in the country, including undoing a longtime ban on allowing women to drive. But the country is still considered to be heavily oppressive toward women. The foreign policy delegations for most United States administrations have been predominately male, though in recent years women including Madeleine K. Albright, Condoleezza Rice, Susan E. Rice and Hillary Clinton have played key roles in diplomatic relations as top cabinet officials. Ivanka Trump, the president’s oldest daughter and senior adviser, has represented her father at meetings with Saudi royals before, but was not in attendance this time. "
"VIENNA — As they gathered last week, perhaps for the last time, diplomats from countries that brokered the Iran nuclear accord publicly and uniformly declared it was working — despite a death watch over the deal in Washington. But behind the closed doors of the chandeliered room, complaints spilled forth about President Trump’s threats to tear up the agreement. Iranian envoys said the warnings from Washington had scared away investors who had been expected to bolster the country’s economy after the deal was negotiated in 2015, according to participants. The American delegation countered that though the deal had effectively limited Tehran’s nuclear program, it had failed to curb Iran’s support for regional terrorism. And when he emerged from the meeting, Brian H. Hook, the chief American representative to the talks, called the nuclear issue “important — but it is just one aspect of the threats from the Iranian regime.” That has been the mantra of the Trump administration as it threatens to withdraw the United States from the accord, which the Obama administration and other world powers negotiated with Iran. Without new restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile programs and nuclear fuel production by May 12, Mr. Trump has warned that the United States will impose harsh sanctions against the country — and, in doing so, scuttle the agreement for other powers that still support it. Hoping to avoid that, European diplomats have signaled that they might support an addendum to the 2015 agreement to enforce new limits on Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing.

"WASHINGTON — The House, spurred on by President Trump, passed a bill on Wednesday that would give patients with terminal illnesses a right to try unproven experimental treatments. The measure, which was approved by a vote of 267 to 149, appears to have a good chance of becoming law. The Senate approved a similar proposal last year. Supporters said the bill would give dying patients a chance to obtain potentially helpful prescription drugs without waiting for the completion of clinical trials or going through a process established by the Food and Drug Administration to allow the use of “investigational drugs” outside clinical trials. The debate took on partisan overtones. Republicans, joined by the libertarian Goldwater Institute, said the “right to try” would give patients more control over their care and their own lives. “I’m a physician and scientist with over 40 years’ experience treating patients, some of whom had the dreaded diagnosis of cancer,” said Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee. “Six months ago, I was operated on for cancer, and I — to this day — am a cancer survivor. If needed, I would like to have the right to try. A little over three years ago my beloved wife, Pam Roe, nurse and friend, died of Stage 4 colon cancer. She would have liked to have the right to try.” But many Democrats said the bill would weaken the ability of the F.D.A. to protect patients. “If you eliminate F.D.A. review, as this bill does, you are putting patients at risk,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee. “This is an unprecedented attempt to roll back F.D.A.’s oversight of investigational treatments.” "
"The former C.I.A. director John Brennan pulled no punches on Wednesday when he was asked why President Trump had congratulated his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for his victory in a rigged election, even after Mr. Trump’s national security staff warned him not to. “I think he’s afraid of the president of Russia,” Mr. Brennan said, on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program, of the phone call on Tuesday between the two presidents. “The Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump and may have things they could expose.” The possibility that Mr. Putin could have some hold on the American president has lurked in the background over the past year as Mr. Trump displayed a mystifying affection for the Russian leader and ignored or excused his aggressive behavior and nefarious activities, most important, his interference in the 2016 campaign, a subject of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Some Trump defenders noted that President Barack Obama also called Mr. Putin when he was elected president in 2012. But the circumstances are very different. In the intervening years, Mr. Putin has become an increasingly authoritarian leader who has crushed most of his political opposition and engineered a deeply lopsided re-election this week. American intelligence officials say they are certain that he meddled in the 2016 American election on behalf of Mr. Trump and is trying to meddle again in the 2018 election, as well as in many European elections. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, is waging war in other parts of Ukraine and is enabling President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. "
"WASHINGTON — John O. Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Wednesday that he thought Russia may have some kind of compromising information on President Trump, setting off furious speculation about whether the former spy chief was basing that assertion on inside information. In an appearance on Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Mr. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director from 2013 to 2017, speculated that Russians “may have something on him personally” when he was asked if he thought Mr. Trump was afraid of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “The Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump, and may have things that they could expose,” he added. Mr. Brennan was running the C.I.A. when a salacious dossier surfaced in 2016 that claimed the Russians had compromising information on Mr. Trump. If there were any current or former American officials who might know if there was truth behind the allegations in the dossier, Mr. Brennan would most likely be one of them. And his comments came the day after a phone call Mr. Trump made to Mr. Putin congratulating him for winning an election raised new questions about the president’s relationship with Russia. As C.I.A. director, Mr. Brennan was never known as particularly chatty around the news media or in public. And since leaving office, Mr. Brennan has taken to starting conversations with journalists by telling them, “I’m not going to be an anonymous source for any stories.” But last weekend, Mr. Brennan — in response to Mr. Trump’s praise for the firing of the former deputy director of the F.B.I., Andrew G. McCabe — issued a remarkable condemnation of the president. “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday plans to announce at least $50 billion worth of annual tariffs and other penalties on China for its theft of technology and trade secrets, which administration officials say has robbed American companies of billions of dollars in revenue and killed thousands of jobs. The measures would mark Mr. Trump’s most aggressive move yet against a fast-rising economic rival that he has accused of preying on the United States. The measures will be targeted at imported Chinese goods in as many as 100 categories — hitting everything from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics — and will impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, people briefed on the measures said. Mr. Trump will instruct the Treasury Department to pursue restrictions on certain types of Chinese investments to counter China’s ambitious industrial policy, which aims to dominate cutting-edge sectors like artificial intelligence and mobile technology, officials said. For Mr. Trump, the steps fulfill a frequent campaign pledge to crack down on China, which he has characterized as an “economic enemy” that has “taken advantage of us like nobody in history.” But the actions will only ratchet up tensions with the Chinese government at a moment when Mr. Trump needs its support for his campaign to curb North Korea’s nuclear program. The announcement comes hard on the heels of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which are scheduled to go into effect on Friday and are aimed at combating a flood of cheap metals into the United States, including Chinese steel.

"As Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism, even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries. Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week, as a creator of one of Facebook’s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant. “It is time. #deletefacebook,” wrote Brian Acton, one of the founders of WhatsApp, wrote on Twitter. His company was bought by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014. The deal made him a billionaire. Mr. Acton’s anti-Facebook message, retweeted more than 10,000 times, captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best-known people are publicly calling for change. The chorus has grown louder this week, as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain data on 50 million users. “The question is, ‘What are you loyal to?’” said Tristan Harris, a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology, an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture. He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions. “Are you more loyal to your company,” Mr. Harris said. “Or are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society?” "
"After having to back a man accused of being a child molester, who then lost to a Democrat in crimson-red Alabama, the Republican Party leadership is having agita because a rich former coal executive, Don Blankenship, might win the party’s primary in the West Virginia Senate race. Mr. Blankenship, you see, spent a year in prison on charges of conspiring to violate mine safety standards, after an inquiry into a mine collapse that killed 29 men. One can see how these pols might be afraid they will be saddled with a convicted criminal as a Republican nominee. Mr. Blankenship has a lot of money to spend on the campaign, and is spending it, so he could beat his two mainstream opponents in the May 8 primary. In deeply conservative West Virginia, he’s attacked one opponent for being a former Democrat and another for his wife’s ties to Planned Parenthood. Party leaders fear that the broader electorate would be less forgiving of Mr. Blankenship and vote for the otherwise beatable Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin. If that happens, it would be karma for the G.O.P. One of the powerful cons that helped the party win the 2016 election was Donald Trump’s promise that he would restore coal miners’ jobs. Since coming to office, though, he has done little to increase employment in an increasingly mechanized industry losing the competition against cheaper natural gas. But Mr. Trump has done a world of good for coal mine owners, like those of Massey Energy, the company Mr. Blankenship used to run, by gutting regulations on environmental protection and worker safety and health. Now a man with so little regard for regulation that he was convicted of violating federal mine safety standards might be the Republican standard-bearer in West Virginia — a state where miners, former miners, their relatives, friends and survivors make up much of the population. While Mr. Blankenship says his conviction is a result of a federal witch hunt, and he was not accused of direct responsibility for the April 5, 2010, explosion at Massey’s Upper Big Branch mine, state investigators blamed the company’s “culture in which wrongdoing became acceptable.” Mr. Manchin has said Mr. Blankenship “has blood on his hands,” but the Republican could win the nomination and the election. West Virginia is no longer the hotbed of labor radicalism that it was once, despite a strikingly successful statewide teachers strike, and Mr. Trump had a 61 percent approval rating there — the highest in the nation — as recently as January. There is hope, though, that this race will be another example of what’s been happening around the country, in the election of Doug Jones of Alabama to the Senate, of Ralph Northam as governor of Virginia and Conor Lamb in a special Pennsylvania House race — voters seeing through the con and demanding that candidates work in their interests, voters rejecting demagogy and demanding character.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump defended on Wednesday his decision to disregard the advice of his national security team and congratulate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on his re-election, lashing out at the news media for reporting on how he diverged from his script and attacking his predecessors for failing to improve relations with Moscow. Mr. Trump, enraged after officials leaked the contents of confidential notes he was given for the private phone call on Tuesday that exhorted him “DO NOT CONGRATULATE” Mr. Putin, argued in a pair of tweets on Wednesday afternoon that the conversation was part of his effort to foster better relations with Russia. He said such engagement could help the United States confront a host of national security challenges. “I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to President Barack Obama’s call to Mr. Putin in 2012. “The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong!” But Mr. Trump’s handling of the call and his defense of it also pointed up his aversion to confronting Mr. Putin about Moscow’s misdeeds, which has become a theme of his presidency even as a special counsel investigates Russia’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in his favor. Mr. Trump’s own advisers had warned him against congratulating Mr. Putin and, in briefing cards prepared before the call, told him to raise Moscow’s role in a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter living in Britain, an instruction he also ignored. The Washington Post first reported on the briefing cards, a leak that stunned some senior officials at the White House, where aides said on Wednesday that John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, had been deeply disappointed and frustrated by the disclosure. One senior White House official said Mr. Trump had never seen the briefing cards. Another said the president had been determined not to antagonize Mr. Putin, believing that his rapport with the Russian leader was the key to better relations between the countries. "
"“We will be greeted as liberators” upon invading Iraq, Vice President Dick Cheney counseled in 2003 on the eve of the war. He had already relayed a prediction that the streets in Basra and Baghdad are “sure to erupt in joy.” President George W. Bush declared that there was “no doubt” that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that an invasion would be largely self-financing and that it would last “five days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn’t going to last any longer.” So 15 years ago this week, the United States careered into one of the most cataclysmic, expensive and idiotic blunders of the last half-century: We invaded Iraq. The financial cost alone to the United States will top $3 trillion, according to the estimates of the economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, or about $24,000 per American household. Some 4,400 American soldiers died in Iraq, along with approximately 500,000 Iraqis, according to a survey and academic study. The war helped trigger the Syria war, the genocide against the Yazidi and Middle East Christians, the rise of the Islamic State, the strengthening of Iran and a broader Sunni-Shiite conflict in the Middle East that will claim lives for years to come. We should try to learn from these calamitous misjudgments, but I have a grim feeling in my belly, a bit like I had in the run-up to the Iraq war, that we have a president who is leading us toward reckless, catastrophic conflict.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Wednesday publicly addressed for the first time the misuse of data belonging to 50 million users of the social network and described the steps the company would take to safeguard the information of its more than two billion monthly users. Although his statement addressing a chorus of criticism fell short of a full-throated apology, Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook would contact users whose data had been harvested through a personality quiz app and passed along to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica. “We have a responsibility to protect your data,” Mr. Zuckerberg said Wednesday in a Facebook post, “and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you.” Mr. Zuckerberg, 33, was trying to quell the crisis over the disclosure last weekend that Cambridge Analytica had used data that had been improperly obtained from Facebook as the firm worked on behalf of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. “Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there?” Mr. Zuckerberg said later in an interview with The New York Times. He added, “Were there apps which could have gotten access to more information and potentially sold it without us knowing or done something that violated people’s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control.” Mr. Zuckerberg said the company would investigate apps like the third-party quiz app that had previously obtained access to “large amounts of information” from the social network. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers’ access. "
"HOUSTON — In a setback to Trump administration efforts to increase offshore oil production, the industry responded with only modest interest on Wednesday in a federal auction covering a record 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Companies bid on only 1 percent of the acreage, and the winning bids yielded a mere $125 million for the government. The results reflected broad uncertainty among oil executives that global oil prices can remain at current levels over $60 a barrel, as well as a general preference for drilling in onshore shale fields that require smaller investments and are less risky. Administration officials characterized the auction as a success since major oil companies — Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron and Total — had placed over 150 bids, and the yield tally was $3 million above a regional lease sale in August. But independent analysts said the results were modest. “Operators appear to still be in a ‘wait and see’ mentality when it comes to exploration, looking for stability in oil prices,” said William Turner, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy influential in the oil patch. Winning bids averaged just over $150 an acre, a bargain compared with what oil companies paid in recent years. The administration has been trying to revive exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico, which have been hurt by the slide in oil prices over the last four years from levels over $100 a barrel. Washington has lowered the royalty rates for deepwater oil activities and has offered larger tracts for bidding than the Obama administration did. Drilling in the gulf, and in other deep waters, slowed considerably after the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010, which killed 11 workers and soiled water and beaches with oil. But interest is slowly picking up again, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Hess starting major oil and gas projects off the coasts of Guyana, Brazil and Mexico; around Africa; and in the Mediterranean. In a recent interview, the Royal Dutch Shell chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said deepwater exploration “is back absolutely.” He said lower oil prices had served as a catalyst for advances in technology and project planning that have reduced the break-even price for deepwater development from $70 a barrel to close to $30. “You see the industry has gone through a tremendous amount of adjustment,” he added. Still, in recent years, more American investment has gone into shale fields in Texas and North Dakota, and it is mostly that production that is driving United States oil output to records levels and produced major exports for the first time in decades.

"A cooperating witness in the special counsel investigation worked for more than a year to turn a top Trump fund-raiser into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to interviews and previously undisclosed documents. Hundreds of pages of correspondence between the two men reveal an active effort to cultivate President Trump on behalf of the two oil-rich Arab monarchies, both close American allies. High on the agenda of the two men — George Nader, a political adviser to the de facto ruler of the U.A.E., and Elliott Broidy, the deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee — was pushing the White House to remove Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, backing confrontational approaches to Iran and Qatar and repeatedly pressing the president to meet privately outside the White House with the leader of the U.A.E. Mr. Tillerson was fired last week, and the president has adopted tough approaches toward both Iran and Qatar. Mr. Nader tempted the fund-raiser, Mr. Broidy, with the prospect of more than $1 billion in contracts for his private security company, Circinus, and he helped deliver deals worth more than $200 million with the United Arab Emirates. He also flattered Mr. Broidy about “how well you handle Chairman,” a reference to Mr. Trump, and repeated to his well-connected friend that he told the effective rulers of both Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. about “the Pivotal Indispensable Magical Role you are playing to help them.” Mr. Nader’s cultivation of Mr. Broidy, laid out in documents provided to The New York Times, provides a case study in the way two Persian Gulf monarchies have sought to gain influence inside the Trump White House. Mr. Nader has been granted immunity in a deal for his cooperation with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to people familiar with the matter, and his relationship with Mr. Broidy may also offer clues to the direction of that inquiry. "
"The man who oversees the Gateway rail tunnel project says a major infrastructure venture tends to be a series of near-death experiences — and Gateway appears to have survived one of those brushes with extinction this week. Despite efforts by President Trump to block federal funding for Gateway, a new link for trains under the Hudson River, the project could receive as much as $540 million from a spending bill Congress was hammering out on Wednesday, congressional aides said. That would be much less than the $900 million that previously had been intended for Gateway, but not the shutout that Mr. Trump had been pushing. A leading regional infrastructure expert expressed relief. “The idea that there’s something like half a billion dollars in there for Gateway is a bright story about bipartisan leadership,” said Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, which has advocated for Gateway as a critical bolster for the economy of the Northeast. “If they missed this, it would be at least a year and I’ve heard more like three years added to the project, which translates to billions in additional costs.” A senior administration official disputed the Democrats’ assessment, saying that most of the money they were counting toward Gateway was a result of increased spending and might not go to that project. He emphasized that the $900 million once intended for Gateway was not in the bill, fulfilling Mr. Trump’s demand. Gateway had built bipartisan support among representatives of New York and New Jersey and received the blessing of former President Barack Obama. The two states had pledged to cover half of the cost of the most critical parts of the project — the tunnel and improvements along Amtrak’s rail line between New York City and Newark. Those segments have an estimated cost of more than $11 billion. But the Trump administration reversed course late last year and declared that there was no agreement for the federal government to provide the other half of the funding. Mr. Trump pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, to leave any money for Gateway out of the spending bill that Congress is completing this week, according to people with knowledge of the conversations.

"Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years. But the news that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users.

"Since the Meredith Corporation announced its $2.8 billion deal for Time Inc. in November, the company has hinted that it might not hold on to Time magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money. Those titles, heavy with news, clashed with the company’s portfolio of lifestyle publications like Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle and Allrecipes. On Wednesday, Meredith made it official: In meetings with employees and a news release, the company said it planned to sell those four former Time Inc. titles, dealing yet another blow to the once-mighty magazine empire. “We love these brands and think they have great audiences,” Tom Harty, Meredith’s chief executive, said in an interview. But, he continued, “Our main portfolio that we built over time at Meredith has been focused on a different audience type.” The four magazines, he said, “will get more investment sooner and more management time with other potential owners.” Meredith also said on Wednesday that it was immediately laying off roughly 200 employees and that it would eliminate about 1,000 more positions over the next 10 months. The layoffs are part of the company’s plan to cut between $400 million and $500 million in costs over the next two years. The company has also said it planned to move some noneditorial Time Inc. functions to Des Moines, where Meredith is headquartered. The decision to sell Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money was widely expected. Still, the sale of what were some of Time Inc.’s most celebrated titles further signals the decline of the magazine industry. Though it had once helped shape American culture, Time Inc. has not just been swallowed up; it will soon be spit out in pieces. Mr. Harty said that multiple parties — the majority of which he called “nontraditional wealthy individuals” — had expressed interest in buying the magazines. He said that he expected to announce deals by the end of June. Meredith’s deal for Time Inc. was made possible by a $650 million infusion from Koch Equity Development, the private equity arm of the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The brothers, Mr. Harty said, “have expressed no interest” in acquiring any of the four titles. He also said the company did not plan to sell the titles to another possible suitor: David J. Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc., who is close with President Trump. Like many other magazines, Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money have battled vanishing advertising revenue and declining circulation. Sports Illustrated, once published weekly, has been reduced to every two weeks. Meredith scheduled an employee meeting in New York for March 28 and another in Des Moines on April 11, during which the company said it planned to unveil a reorganization of its sales business. In a memo, Mr. Harty and Jon Werther, the president of Meredith’s national media group, wrote, “We look forward to sharing our vision for the future and hearing what’s on your mind.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web. The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites. The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government’s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election. With passage of the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Silicon Valley’s ability to stay out of the government’s reach suffered a rare setback. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly last month, and President Trump is expected to sign it into law. “The president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote. “It’s a wake-up call,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. “This is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it’s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.” "

"A leading AIDS researcher and proponent of medication-assisted therapy for addiction was appointed Wednesday to oversee the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Alex M. Azar II, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, announced that the agency’s new director would be Dr. Robert R. Redfield, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and co-founder of the Institute for Human Virology. “Dr. Redfield has dedicated his entire life to promoting public health and providing compassionate care to his patients,” Mr. Azar said. “We are proud to welcome him as director of the world’s premier epidemiological agency.” Dr. Redfield, 66, will replace Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, who resigned in January after just six months on the job. Dr. Fitzgerald left amid criticism of her investments with her husband in tobacco and health care companies that posed potential conflicts of interest. Dr. Redfield oversees clinical care and research at the virology institute, which provides H.I.V. treatment to more than 6,000 patients in the Baltimore-Washington area and more than 1 million people in Africa and the Caribbean. The institute, with an annual budget of more than $105 million, also studies other chronic viral illnesses and cancer. In his statement, Dr. Azar called Dr. Redfield’s decades of science and clinical work — especially in the field of H.I.V./AIDS — “peerless.” He added that the treatment network Dr. Redfield operates in Baltimore for patients with H.I.V. and hepatitis C would help him “hit the ground running” on a top priority, “combating the opioid epidemic.” "
"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. investigated Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury last year over congressional testimony in which he said he had no contacts with Russians, according to three people familiar with the case. In fact, Mr. Sessions later acknowledged, he had personally met the Russian ambassador to the United States during the campaign and was aware that George Papadopoulos, a campaign adviser, had developed Russian ties, too. F.B.I. agents were aware of both inaccuracies in real time. And last March, when Congress asked the F.B.I. to investigate the attorney general, agents began doing so, two of the people said. Andrew G. McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director at the time, authorized the investigation, the two people said. Mr. McCabe himself was recently fired for showing “lack of candor” in an internal investigation. Mr. Sessions rejected Mr. McCabe’s appeal and fired him hours before his retirement was to take effect, jeopardizing his pension. The investigation into Mr. Sessions began before Robert S. Mueller III was appointed special counsel to investigate Russia-related matters. Mr. Sessions’s lawyer, Chuck Cooper, said no investigation is being conducted now. “The special counsel’s office has informed me that after interviewing the attorney general and conducting additional investigation, the attorney general is not under investigation for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and related written submissions to Congress,” Mr. Cooper said in a statement. The investigation was first reported by ABC News. Perjury investigations based on congressional referrals are common, and the F.B.I. frequently investigates but seldom charges. But the fact that the attorney general himself was a focus of the Russia investigation, even if only peripherally and temporarily, shows how entangled the Trump administration has become in the case. Mr. Sessions is recused from any aspect of the investigation. "
"For much of the past week, Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users. On Wednesday, following widespread questions about his whereabouts, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, spoke with two New York Times reporters, Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose, about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse. Below is a transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. Sheera Frenkel: Did it come as a surprise to you, the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data? Mark Zuckerberg: Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data. If you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it’s a photo or a video or a text message — whether it’s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram — and you’re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with. Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar. Frenkel: It took quite a few days for your response to come out. Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post? "
"This column has been updated to reflect news developments. Gee, we’ve been hearing a ton about the turmoil in the president’s legal team. You probably have questions. Is this something else I have to think about in the middle of the night when I’m staring at the ceiling? Because really, I’ve got enough. We’re talking about chaos and turnover among the people defending Donald Trump in his multitudinous legal battles. If that’s the kind of thing that keeps you awake at night, it’s time to prioritize.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump indirectly criticized Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, on Wednesday for the continuing investigation into Russia’s 2016 campaign meddling, even as a former C.I.A. director said during a morning news show that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia may have compromising information on Mr. Trump. After a weekend of attacking Mr. Mueller — against the advice of his own lawyers — Mr. Trump picked up again in early morning tweets when he said he was quoting a former Harvard professor stating that Mr. Mueller should never have been appointed to be the special counsel to investigate Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. That investigation has expanded into inquiries into Mr. Trump’s aides and his own business dealings. “I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council,” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post that he attributed to a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, Alan M. Dershowitz. It was not immediately clear on Wednesday which remarks of Mr. Dershowitz’s the president was quoting. An interview with Mr. Dershowitz on Fox News on Tuesday and an opinion piece by Mr. Dershowitz published on Wednesday did not include the exact phrasing that Mr. Trump used in his tweets. And the language was not found in a search of Mr. Dershowitz’s cable news appearances over the past week. "
"WASHINGTON — Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee pressured Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, on Wednesday to speed up key election security measures, even as she trumpeted the adoption of important improvements ahead of November’s midterm elections. Ms. Nielsen told the senators, who are investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, that the department made significant strides in recent months working with state and local election officials to improve communication about threats and share cybersecurity resources. Those efforts include comprehensive risk assessments and cyberscans meant to identify vulnerabilities in election systems. But under questioning, Ms. Nielsen signaled that one of those undertakings, to grant full security clearances to state election officials so they could receive classified information on cybersecurity threats in a timely way, had been slow going. Of the up to 150 state election officials designated to receive clearances, only about 20 have them, she said. In the meantime, Ms. Nielsen said, the department would share necessary threat information with relevant state officials regardless of their clearance. Republicans and Democrats on the committee made clear that they expected more. “When I listen to your testimony, I hear no sense of urgency to really get on top of this issue,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Wednesday’s session was the secretive committee’s first public hearing designed to scrutinize findings from its year-old investigation into Russia’s interference campaign. It followed the committee’s release  on Tuesday of a set of recommendations for state and federal officials to shore up the ballot box. "

"SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said on Wednesday that he and President Trump could sit down for a three-way summit meeting with Kim Jong-un if their individual meetings with the North Korean leader on denuclearizing his country proceed well in the coming weeks. Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim are planning an inter-Korean summit in late April at Peace House, a South Korean conference hall inside Panmunjom, the so-called truce village that straddles the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, separating the two Koreas. That meeting is expected to be followed by a planned Trump-Kim summit meeting by May. If that meeting takes place, Mr. Trump will be the first-ever sitting American president to meet a North Korean leader; Washington and Pyongyang are still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War was halted with a truce, rather than a peace treaty. While presiding over a meeting Wednesday of government officials preparing for the inter-Korean summit, Mr. Moon attached great significance to the venue for his coming meeting with Mr. Kim. “The North Korea-United States summit, which will follow the inter-Korean summit, will itself be a momentous event in world history,” Mr. Moon said. “Depending on where the meeting takes place, it will look even more dramatic, and depending on progress, there can be a three-way summit among South and North Korea and the United States.” Panmunjom and the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ were created in the Korean War armistice of 1953 and remain symbols of the unending hostilities on the divided Korean Peninsula. Peace House is south of the border inside the DMZ, and a visit there by Mr. Kim would make him the first North Korean leader to step across the border since the war. "
"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate increase of 2018 at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday as the United States economy continues to strengthen. ■ Wall Street analysts surveyed by CNBC unanimously expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. ■ Fed watchers are divided over how many increases to expect in 2018 as the Fed continues its steady march back toward more historically normal interest rates. Some analysts believe that Fed officials will signal they are on course for a total of three rate increases in 2018, as they did at the Fed’s December meeting. Others expect a turn toward the hawkish, with an indication of four increases. ■ This will be Jerome H. Powell’s first policy meeting and news conference as Fed chairman. Mr. Powell, a former Fed governor, succeeded Janet L. Yellen last month. Analysts do not expect him to deviate from Ms. Yellen’s preferred path of slow and steady rate increases, nor to wade too deeply into controversial topics, such as the tariffs announced by President Trump. The Fed, under Ms. Yellen, pursued gradual rate increases and a highly choreographed sell-off of the portfolio of bonds it bought to help prop up the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell was among the governors who voted for that approach, and he is expected to reaffirm it, particularly if economic growth continues to accelerate and unemployment remains at or below the 4.1 percent level it reached in February.

"MENLO PARK, Calif. — John Tenanes, Facebook’s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company’s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook’s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about. He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. “There will be housing there,” he points. “There will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.” In just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life. Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: “We want to balance our growth with the community’s needs.” Willow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley’s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office. The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers. "
"LONDON — The German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans has had a decades-long love affair with printed media. Since making his name in the 1990s taking pictures of night life in Hamburg, Germany, for the British counterculture magazine i-D, his work has appeared in countless publications — from fashion titles to newspaper supplements — as well as in galleries and museums. Mr. Tillmans has long been concerned with how his work appears on the printed page. The artist, the first photographer to win the Turner Prize, in 2000, had a large, midcareer retrospective at Tate Modern in London last year. Titled “Wolfgang Tillmans: 2017,” the exhibition delved into the photographer’s longstanding interest in the representation of truth in media and politics. Mr. Tillmans’s latest project put him in the editor’s chair. He is the guest editor of “Jahresring”, a collection of essays about art and culture published annually in Germany since 1954. This year’s edition, “What Is Different?”, explores the increasing rejection of facts in today’s political and social discourse, with a series of essays and interviews with activists, academics and politicians, interspersed with photographs by Mr. Tillmans. In an interview, Mr. Tillmans explained why he embarked on the project and spoke about the role of art in a post-truth world. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. "
"Let’s get one thing straight: I am not a fan of Facebook. I’m confident that social media is a cancer on our private lives and a source of derangement in our politics. I take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections, and that they’ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data. I take a certain mordant pleasure in watching Mark Zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late-Obama-era liberalism. But the liberal establishment’s fixation on Facebook’s 2016 sins — first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the Trump campaign or its appendages — still feels like a classic example of blaming something new because it’s new when it’s the old thing that mattered more. Or of blaming something new because you thought that “new” meant “good,” that the use of social-media data by campaigns would always help tech-savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals — and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the Trump era a reality. No doubt all the activity on Facebook and the apparent use of Facebook’s data had some impact, somewhere, on Trump’s surprise victory. But the media format that really made him president, the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited, wasn’t Zuckerberg’s unreal kingdom; it wasn’t even the Twitter platform where Trump struts and frets and rages daily. It was that old pre-internet standby, broadcast and cable television, and especially TV news. Start with the fake news that laid the foundation for Trump’s presidential campaign — not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your Facebook feed, but the sort broadcast in prime time by NBC, under the label of reality TV. Yes, as media sophisticates we’re all supposed to know that “reality” means “fake,” but in the beginning nobody marketed “The Apprentice” that way; across most of its run you saw a much-bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed, week after week and season after season, as a titan of industry, the for-serious greatest businessman in the world. Where did so many people originally get the idea that Trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government? Not from Russian bots or targeted social media ad buys, but from a prime-time show that sold itself as real, and sold him as a business genius. Forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders; forget white nationalists and birthers: The core Trump demographic might just have been Republicans who watched “The Apprentice,” who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them. That was step one in the Trump hack of television media. Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign. Yes, his fame also boosted him on social media, but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds; with television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump’s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Against aides’ advice, President Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin on Tuesday for his victory in the Russian presidential election. The White House said the call, made five days after the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russia, had focused on “shared interests.” They did not include election meddling or the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. Other leaders, foreign and American, have also congratulated Mr. Putin. But not the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell: “When I look at a Russian election, what I see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results. Calling him wouldn’t have been high on my list.” • Separately, Mr. Trump reinforced his commitment to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on Tuesday. "

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The election of Donald Trump was so shocking — and damaging to the country — that many people went looking for a scapegoat. There was a long list of candidates. Hillary’s flawed campaign. Bernie’s long campaign. The Electoral College. The media. Sexist voters. Racist voters. Economically anxious voters. Nonvoters. James Comey. Anthony Weiner. Vladimir Putin. Twitter. And Facebook. By spreading false news stories and giving a megaphone to Russian trolls, Facebook — a vastly larger social network than Twitter — played a meaningful role in the presidential campaign. Of course, so did many other suspects on the list. There was no single factor that allowed Trump to win. It was a confluence. If anything, the role of Facebook and its executives has sometimes been exaggerated. “Whatever role they played surely pales in relative importance to a whole host of other factors,” Ben Thompson, the author of the Stratechery blog, pointed out yesterday (in his subscriber-only newsletter), “and it makes sense that Facebook executives would feel persecuted on that front.” But, as Thompson explains, “The problem comes when arguing about details results in missing the big picture: fake news on Facebook may not have been the deciding factor many think it was, but Facebook’s effect on the news surely mattered.” And Facebook’s executives have indeed missed this big picture, claiming that their company played no significant role in Trump’s victory.

"Arranged marriages. Whispered warnings. Outright theft. For years, American companies have complained that the Chinese government finds ways to get them to hand over their most valuable trade secrets. Those companies — which usually complain anonymously, fearing Chinese retribution — have found a sympathetic ear in the Trump administration. American trade officials on Thursday cited those practices as a major motivation for their plans to levy tariffs and penalties on $60 billion in Chinese imports and to take a tougher stance on the vast and lucrative trade relationship between the two countries. The report outlines in blunt terms how intellectual property — everything from product designs and sensitive data to general know-how — has become a point of contention in global trade relations, joining longstanding areas of dispute like steel. The landscape is more complex than the Trump administration’s complaint suggests. American companies sometimes willingly strike deals with Chinese partners because they feel China is too profitable to miss out on. And in some cases, Chinese companies have shown they still have much to learn, even after cozying up to American partners. In some industries, like car production, China has long required foreign companies to team up with local partners. Auto giants like General Motors and Ford, for example, make cars in Chinese factories that are jointly owned by Chinese partners. Foreign companies have long complained that they are simply training future rivals. Japanese and European businesses say  Chinese rail companies used technology from joint ventures to become giants in high-speed rail. Trade rules limit how much technology the Chinese partner can get from a joint venture. But some American businesses and the Trump administration say Chinese officials often demand technology under the table. "
"WASHINGTON — The much-watched antitrust trial between the Justice Department and AT&T began on Thursday, with opening statements that presented starkly different visions for how the company’s blockbuster merger with Time Warner would fit into a media industry upturned by the internet. Before a packed courtroom with some of the industry’s leading figures, the two sides zeroed in on the case’s central question: Whether the deal would force consumers to pay more to watch their favorite shows on Time Warner cable channels like CNN and TNT. The Justice Department, which is suing to block the $85 billion deal, argued that AT&T, with its nationwide wireless and satellite TV business, could use Time Warner’s content as a “weapon” by raising the licensing fees those channels command. The government said that the merged company could charge rival cable and streaming companies more for popular channels. Those increases, the agency argued, would be passed on to consumers. “If the merger goes forward, consumers all across America will be worse off as a result,” said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department’s lead lawyer. AT&T and Time Warner said they would disprove the notion that the deal would raise prices. And they said that the combined company could compete with the giants of Silicon Valley: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google. Those companies now produce their own shows and distribute them on their popular websites. They also dominate the market for the advertisements that run with videos streamed over the internet. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump named John R. Bolton, a hard-line former American ambassador to the United Nations, as his third national security adviser on Thursday, continuing a shake-up that creates one of the most hawkish national security teams of any White House in recent history. Mr. Bolton will replace Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the battle-tested Army officer who was tapped last year to stabilize a turbulent foreign policy operation but who never developed a comfortable relationship with the president. The move, which was sudden but not unexpected, signals a more confrontational approach in American foreign policy at a time when Mr. Trump faces mounting challenges, including from Iran and North Korea. The president replaced Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson last week with the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, a former Army officer and Tea Party congressman who has spoken about regime change in Pyongyang and about ripping up the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Bolton, an outspoken advocate of military action who served in the George W. Bush administration, has called for action against Iran and North Korea. In an interview on Thursday on Fox News, soon after his appointment was announced in a presidential tweet, he declined to say whether Mr. Trump should go through with a planned meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. General McMaster will retire from the military, ending a career that included senior commands in Iraq and Afghanistan. He had discussed his departure with Mr. Trump for several weeks, White House officials said, but decided to speed it up because questions about his status were casting a shadow over his exchanges with foreign officials. "
"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson bade farewell to the State Department on Thursday in a brief and barbed speech that called for an era of respect and kindness after he was dismissed by presidential tweet. “This can be a very mean-spirited town,” Mr. Tillerson said, a remark that generated a rare burst of applause from employees in a department that never embraced his distant and disorganized leadership. “But you don’t have to choose to participate in that,” he continued as the clapping crescendoed in the formal, flag-draped entrance of the State Department’s headquarters. “Each of us gets to choose the person we want to be, and the way we want to be treated, and the way we want to treat others.” President Trump fired Mr. Tillerson last week and announced in a post on Twitter that the nation’s top diplomat would be replaced by Mike Pompeo, director of the C.I.A. Mr. Tillerson had just returned from a weeklong trip to Africa, where he contracted an intestinal illness, and was surprised by the decision, said his spokesman, Steve Goldstein. The first Mr. Tillerson knew of his firing was when an aide showed him the president’s tweet, Mr. Goldstein said. Later that day, Mr. Goldstein and several other aides who were close to Mr. Tillerson also were fired by the White House. Officials said John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, had tried to warn Mr. Tillerson in a phone call days earlier by saying, cryptically, “you may get a tweet.” White House officials also added that Mr. Tillerson had been on the toilet at the time of the call.

"Last week, after more than 12 years of marriage, Vanessa Trump filed for an uncontested divorce in Manhattan from Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president. In a joint statement, the couple said: “We have decided to go our separate ways.” “An uncontested divorce is the much saner and healthier way of doing things, which makes it unusual for the Trump family,” said Kenneth Burrows, a New York matrimonial lawyer who is not involved in the case. Precisely because of the Trump family’s reputation for chaos — not to mention that the Trump Organization, which is being run by Mr. Trump and his brother Eric, has been subpoenaed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III — the divorce announcement only served to foster curiosity about Ms. Trump, who has been something of a lesser-known member of the family. One detail that has been closely scrutinized is Ms. Trump’s selection of a lawyer, David Feureisen, who has a background in civil, criminal and divorce cases but is not a boldface name. He works in Westchester County, N.Y., and has a low profile in the media. (He did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment.) In addition to handling Ms. Trump’s divorce, Mr. Feureisen also represented Ms. Trump’s mother, Bonnie Kay Haydon, in a recent real estate transaction. "

"To the Editor: Re “Facebook’s Chief Admits Mistakes in Guarding Data” (front page, March 22): Bravo to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, for apologizing for his mistake. “But that’s the least we can expect,” one might argue. Yes, it is, but it’s still a rare occurrence in business and elsewhere. “They’re still just words,” goes another objection. “He needs to back up his apology with a strategy for correcting his company’s mistakes.” Yes, he does. Nevertheless, it behooves us all to acknowledge Mr. Zuckerberg’s willingness to take responsibility for Facebook’s grave errors and to make sure they don’t happen again. The more we recognize a leader’s courage in being accountable, the more likely it is that accountability will be valued and cultivated. BRUCE WEINSTEIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Facebook claims “it’s free and always will be.” Recent events once again prove that if you don’t have to pay for a product, you are the product. Perhaps people might be willing to pay a small monthly fee for a more secure social network service that protects their data from companies like Cambridge Analytica. KAREN SMITH, BROOKLYN To the Editor: Various Times articles over the past several days rightly focus on the misuse of private Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign. However, a key point is not being mentioned: The formulas developed by Cambridge Analytica to explain and predict people’s personality traits and behaviors are most likely hogwash. For over 40 years I have worked for academic and public and private sector organizations as a specialist in personality assessment for the purpose of explaining and predicting behaviors. "
"WASHINGTON — House Intelligence Committee Republicans said Thursday that opposition to Donald J. Trump by the party’s national security establishment had opened the door for two foreign policy advisers whose interactions with Russian intelligence prompted F.B.I. scrutiny. The Republicans said they had found no evidence that either man, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, had colluded with the Russians, despite the F.B.I.’s interest in the men. Nor did campaign advisers and aides provide evidence that any member of the Trump campaign had colluded either, according to summaries of 44 findings and more than two dozen recommendations the committee voted to release Thursday. “When asked directly, none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government,” one of the findings read. First previewed last week, the findings are the culmination of a year-old investigation by the committee. Democrats say the Republicans hurried the investigation, ignored crucial evidence and failed to follow obvious leads in an effort to clear Mr. Trump. Other findings were less controversial and reflected the consensus position of American intelligence agencies and both parties on Capitol Hill. Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, who led the inquiry, said that the committee had found “a pattern of Russian active measures in the United States, both through cyberattacks and their use of social media to sow discord.” “This poses a serious threat to future U.S. elections, including the primary elections that are already underway,” he said in a statement. “It’s critical to release this information now to protect our country and our elections from foreign interference.” "
"HONG KONG — A brewing trade war between China and the United States sent markets reeling across Asia on Friday, following a sell-off on Wall Street overnight. Investors drove stocks into red territory from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Tokyo and Seoul as they digested news that the Trump administration would impose stiff tariffs on Chinese goods. Markets fell further as Beijing announced retaliatory tariffs on more than 100 items, including American pork and wine. By the close of trading on Friday, shares had fallen 3.4 percent in Shanghai and 4 percent in Shenzhen. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the market. South Korean stocks fell 3.1 percent. “This can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,” Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients. Europe looked poised for a similar sell-off, with futures flashing red for major markets. Markets were following the lead of stocks in the United States, which fell for a second straight day on Thursday, as President Trump announced $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports. After wobbling throughout the day, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index turned decisively lower in the last hour of trading, closing down by 2.5 percent. That put the index into negative territory for the year. "
"WASHINGTON — Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, took responsibility on Thursday for buying a $31,000 dining room set for his office, two days after saying his wife and assistant oversaw a purchase that has jeopardized his place in President Trump’s cabinet. Mr. Carson faced withering criticism from Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the Department of Housing and Urban Development. One senator, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, suggested that he regretted being one of the few Democrats to support the secretary’s nomination a year ago. “I voted to confirm you,” said Mr. Brown, who is up for re-election this year. “Four other Democrats on this committee voted to confirm you. I’m not sure I made the right decision.” In recent days, Mr. Carson’s aides have repeatedly advised him to apologize for the purchase, arguing that doing so was the only way to move on, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. But Mr. Carson, who has privately fumed about what he regards as the unfairness of being singled out for criticism, resisted doing so until Thursday’s hearing, when one of the panel’s Republicans, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, gently prodded him to be more contrite. “I take responsibility,” Mr. Carson said. Later, he suggested the episode had been a personal ordeal, saying that he modeled his reaction to the criticism on advice that Jesus gave in the Sermon on the Mount, which he summarized as “don’t worry about what people are saying about you, and do the right thing.” Mr. Carson’s tone was markedly different on Tuesday, when he told a House subcommittee that he had dealt himself out of the decision-making chain on the dining room set, despite internal department emails showing that he had participated in the selection of specific pieces of furniture last summer.

Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ In light of recent events, it was no surprise to us that “Do You Think It Is Important for Teenagers to Participate in Political Activism?” was the most popular writing prompt this week. We received excellent comments from students all over the country who organized and participated in the national student walkouts on March 14, as well as those who chose to opt out. Here are their thoughts on the protest and teenagers’ roles in politics: Kate Silver from Wilmington, N.C., shared her experience: Sydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., also participated in the walkout, though for a different reason: Leah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., was proud of her classmates: Collin from Lawrence was less impressed with his school’s demonstration: Kalpana from New York, N.Y., was also confused about the message protesters were sending, but remained hopeful: Though some students doubted the effectiveness of the walkouts, Sydney G. from New York thought they had the potential to make a difference: As did Cam from Maine, who hoped young people’s voices wouldn’t be silenced by adults: But Derek Han from San Jose, Calif., thought there were better ways for students to voice their concerns: Many students were passionate about teenagers’ involvement in politics, like Hugo Veliz from Providence, R.I., who wrote: Nelly3D from YC CLIP agreed: Robert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., argued that civic participation is one of the most important things citizens — young and old — can do for their country: _________ "
"You wouldn’t want to be operated on by a physician with only a few surgeries under his or her belt, and the assurance that this doctor brought a fresh perspective to anesthesia and incisions wouldn’t thrill you. You would choose a pilot who had flown 999 flights over one with nine, and you would want your child’s teacher to be practiced with pupils, not merely a vessel of great enthusiasm. So why the romance with candidates who have never done a stitch of government work before? Donald Trump cashed in on it. The fevered speculation surrounding Oprah Winfrey after her Golden Globes speech sprang from it. And Cynthia Nixon’s bid for governor of New York depends on it. On Monday, Nixon, a brilliant actress best known for the HBO series “Sex and the City,” stepped forward to challenge the incumbent, Andrew Cuomo, in this year’s Democratic primary. Her announcement took the form of a video about her biography and her values. Missing from those two slickly produced minutes was even a syllable about her experience, and that’s no accident. Little on her résumé is directly relevant to the big, difficult job that she nonetheless wants. Liberals complain a lot these days about how little regard many conservatives have for expertise, and that’s not only a fair point, it’s a vital one. In medicine, in social sciences, in economics and in so much else, rigorous training and painstakingly earned knowledge matter. They’re not badges of elitism. They’re proof of seriousness. Shouldn’t experience count in politics, too? And doesn’t excitement about Winfrey for president or Nixon for governor have some relationship to disdain for professors who peddle inconvenient truths? Both responses elevate what’s ideologically and emotionally pleasing over what makes the most sense. Both degrade the importance of experience. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Australia dodges U.S. tariffs, prominent septuagenarians trade schoolyard taunts, and the great Pacific garbage patch may now be the size of Mongolia. Here’s what you need to know: • Australia and South Korea made the list of American allies that will be spared, for now, from steep U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel that go into effect today. Above, a steel mill in Wollongong, south of Sydney. The U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, also said Argentina, Brazil and the European Union would join Canada and Mexico as exempt, at least temporarily. Those countries accounted for more than half of the total volume of steel sold to the U.S. in 2017, so the exemptions could undercut the tariffs’ impact on domestic steel mills. _____ • Banishing any possible doubt about the focus of his sweeping tariffs, President Trump announced plans to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports and to exact other penalties from an “economic enemy.” "
"Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here. Glance at the current TV listings, and you may think you’ve time-traveled back to the ’90s, with “Full House,” “The X-Files” and “Will & Grace” all airing new episodes in the past year. On Tuesday, ABC’s era-defining family sitcom “Roseanne” joins the nostalgia fest with a two-episode premiere of its first new season since 1997. True to form, the revival looks to be very much of its time: Its acerbic matriarch, played by Roseanne Barr, is a Trump supporter; her grandson is gender-fluid. “Roseanne” cranked out 222 episodes during its original nine-season run. So, the prospect of revisiting Roseanne and her clan in advance of their comeback can seem daunting. Luckily, it only takes a few episodes to understand what made this love letter to the working-class American family so special. This selection of highlights represents “Roseanne” at its smartest, funniest, and most poignant, and you should easily be able to get through these 22-minute episodes before the show returns at 8 p.m. on Tuesday. All the original episodes are available to stream on Amazon Prime Video. “Life and Stuff” Great sitcoms don’t always start with great pilots. (See: “Seinfeld.”) But the first episode of “Roseanne” is wonderful, thanks to the immediate chemistry between Roseanne Barr and John Goodman, who plays Roseanne’s husband, Dan. There’s a lovely warmth to the Conners’ marriage, whether they’re flirting, fighting or just making each other laugh. The premiere also features a young George Clooney, in his first appearance as Roseanne’s boss at the plastics factory. "
"Only a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions — the election of its leaders — would have seemed even more absurd. Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it. “Data drives all that we do.” That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users. The heart of Cambridge Analytica’s power is an enormous information warehouse — as many as 5,000 data points on each of more than 230 million Americans, according to recent reporting, a fact the company proudly confirms on its website. Its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies a vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms, and by an expanding data-mining culture operating without restrictions. That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one. An adequate ethics of data for today would include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms. It would also establish cultural expectations, fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges, requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them, not after they have already profiled, categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people. Students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science would also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash. "
"We have a serious problem, and it goes far beyond “fake news.” Too many Americans have no idea how to properly read a social media feed. As we’re coming to learn more and more, such ignorance seems to be plaguing almost everybody — regardless of educational attainment, economic class, age, race, political affiliation or gender. Some very smart people are helping to spread some very dumb ideas. We all know this is a problem. The recent federal indictment of a Russian company, the Internet Research Agency, lists the numerous ways Russian trolls and bots created phony events and leveraged social media to sow disruption throughout the 2016 presidential election. New revelations about Cambridge Analytica’s sophisticated use of Facebook data to target unsuspecting social media users reminds us how complex the issue has become. Even the pope has weighed in, using his bully pulpit to warn the world of this new global evil. But there are some remarkably easy steps that each of us, on our own, can take to address this issue. By following these three simple guidelines, we can collaborate to help solve a problem that’s befuddling the geniuses who built Facebook and Twitter. If the problem is crowdsourced, then it seems obvious the solution will have to be crowdsourced as well. With that in mind, here are three easy steps each of us can take to help build a better civic polity. This advice will also help each of us look a little less foolish. 1. No link? Not news! Every time somebody tweets “BREAKING” a little bell should go off in your head. Before you even read the rest of the news, look for the link. Average Americans almost never break news about big stories. Even most professional journalists lack the sources and experience to quickly verify sensational information. If news breaks on a truly important story, there should be a link to a credible news source. But I still regularly see tweets that have no connection to reality being retweeted thousands of times by people who should know better. Here’s but one example of completely fictional “news” that was retweeted over 46,000 times. It involved Haiti’s supposed reaction to President Trump’s recent insult: "
"ALBANY — On the day that Cynthia Nixon officially entered New York’s race for governor, the state Republican Party did not exactly keep its poker face. Up on Twitter went a photograph of Ed Cox, its chairman, in the famed V-for-victory pose of Richard Nixon, with his slogan: “Nixon’s the One.” (That Mr. Cox is the former president’s son-in-law made the joke even more piquant.) Ms. Nixon's candidacy — presenting a Democratic primary challenge for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo — has been a rare jolt of good news for the Republicans. “When you see people from every end of the political spectrum thinking it’s time for a change, that’s extremely important,” said State Senator John A. DeFrancisco, 71, a Syracuse-area Republican running for that party’s nomination. “And it does not bode well for Governor Cuomo, no matter who the candidate is.” Democrats hold enormous advantages in general elections in New York, with a more than 2-to-1 edge in registered voters, and a nearly two-decade-long winning streak. The last Republican to win a statewide race was Gov. George E. Pataki in 2002. "
"The $1.3 trillion spending plan passed early Friday by Congress delivered a broad rebuke to President Trump’s vision for shaking up government, ignoring many of his ideas for cutting domestic programs and, in some cases, expressly barring him from accomplishing his goals. Last year, in his first budget request for fiscal 2018, Mr. Trump envisioned a drastic reordering of government priorities, in which a large increase in military spending would be matched by deep cuts to foreign aid, the diplomatic corps, education, environmental cleanup and other domestic programs — many of which he would eliminate. The bill now heads to the president’s desk. Here’s a breakdown of what’s in it and what it means. The package that will arrive on Mr. Trump’s desk this week for what he has conceded will be a grudging signature contains a sizable increase for the military but few of the reductions he had sought. It reflects the triumph of politically palatable bipartisan deals for lawmakers who are preparing to face voters in midterm elections over the audacious promises of a president who has styled himself as a change agent, but has been unable to persuade a Congress controlled by his own party. The “big, beautiful wall”? Not this year. Deep cuts to environmental programs, clean energy initiatives and biomedical research? Congress said no, thanks. Zeroing out federal arts programs? Lawmakers gave them a modest increase. “Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter this week, venting his frustration about the bill, which he briefly threatened to torpedo on Wednesday in the final hours before it was unveiled. The administration sought to put the best face on the measure on Thursday, highlighting the large military funding increase and spending on the president’s priorities — immigration enforcement, school safety, infrastructure and combating opioid abuse — even as his top advisers conceded it fell short of what they had sought.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Boris Johnson’s Hitler comment, Mark Zuckerberg’s admission and Emmanuel Macron’s big challenge. Here’s what you need to know: • Tensions between Britain and Russia hit a new peak. Boris Johnson, the top British diplomat, told Parliament that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, would use the World Cup this summer as a propaganda tool, much as Hitler did with the 1936 Olympic Games. In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned foreign diplomats to suggest Britain itself may have been responsible for poisoning a former Russian double agent and his daughter with a nerve agent. (The British ambassador did not attend.) Separately, European leaders are expected to approve a deal today to avoid a sudden change of trade rules when Britain quits the European Union next March. But Brexit supporters are angry about policy retreats from London. _____ • President Trump plans today to announce at least $50 billion worth of annual tariffs and other penalties against China for its theft of technology and trade secrets, which administration officials say has robbed American companies of billions of dollars in revenue and killed thousands of jobs. Above, Mr. Trump led a delegation of top U.S. companies to China last year. "
"PARIS — When people used to ask me what I missed about America, I would say, “The optimism.” I grew up in the land of hope, then moved to one whose catchphrases are “It’s not possible” and “Hell is other people.” I walked around Paris feeling conspicuously chipper. But lately I’ve had a kind of emotional whiplash. France is starting to seem like an upbeat, can-do country, while Americans are less sure that everything will be O.K. Cynicism has deep roots in France. In the 18th century, Voltaire mocked optimists for their naïveté and celebrated pessimists for their lucidity. He’s still part of the national curriculum for French eighth-graders, and the râleur — the dissatisfied, grumpy whiner — remains a national archetype. Among intellectuals, if you say that everything is going badly, “everyone says, ‘Look how intelligent he is,’” explained Frédéric Lenoir, author of “Happiness: A Philosopher’s Guide.” Since I’ve lived here, polls have regularly shown that the French are more pessimistic about their country’s future than people in Afghanistan and Iraq. The French haven’t become magically cheerful, but there’s a creeping sense that hope isn’t idiotic, and life can actually improve. As is common with a new president, there was a jump in optimism after Emmanuel Macron was elected last year. But this time, optimism has remained strong, and in January it hit an eight-year high. It helps that France’s economy is finally growing more and that Mr. Macron has made good on promises ranging from overhauling the labor laws to shrinking class sizes at kindergartens in disadvantaged areas. For those still mourning France’s lost glory as a global power, he has taken the rhetorical lead on climate change and the European Union. And they feel lucky by comparison, as they watch Britain march off a plank with Brexit, and read about American children being killed at school. Voters here still have grievances, and many are reserving judgment. But in the French context, that’s practically euphoria. “The France of the optimists has won, and is dragging the other part of France toward its own side,” said Claudia Senik, an economist who heads the Well-Being Observatory, an academic think tank here.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Trevor Noah on Wednesday excoriated Facebook for failing to keep millions of users’ data secure. He poked fun at Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, whose net worth has plummeted because of the scandal. Noah pointed out that Facebook had not informed its users when it discovered a major breach of their privacy. “They need to be held accountable,” Noah said. Then he urged viewers to remember that many sites closely monitor users’ activity. “At the same time, though, it’s our responsibility to be vigilant,” he said. “In the year 2018, you have to assume everything you click online, everything you watch, every website you visit will be collecting data on you — and that data will be used eventually to try to sell you something.” Seth Meyers on Wednesday revisited President Trump’s recent call with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. During the call, Trump congratulated Putin for his win in Sunday’s election — something Trump’s staff had instructed him specifically not to do. Jimmy Kimmel pointed to reports that Trump is irate because details about the call to Putin were leaked to the news media. "
"Scottrade. Ameriprise. Wells Fargo. Within the last month, two of these financial-service providers were accused of deceiving retirement account customers, while Wells Fargo revealed that it was the subject of an investigation exploring whether it made questionable recommendations to 401(k) customers, among other things. It isn’t easy for consumers to figure out what kind of professional they can trust with their money, especially when any annuity salesperson with a business card can masquerade as a bona fide financial adviser. For a while, it seemed like a new consumer protection that took partial effect last June would provide some clarity: It requires financial professionals, including brokers and insurance agents, to act in their customers’ best interests when handling their retirement money. The goal of the rule, which was implemented by the Obama administration despite strong opposition from the financial services industry, was to make it easier for retirement savers to trust that their financial advisers were looking out for them — and not profiting at their expense. Before the rule, brokers only had to ensure that their recommendations were suitable, which is a lower standard. But the future of the rule remains uncertain and is likely to become even more contested in the months ahead. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that the Labor Department, which oversees retirement accounts and created the so-called fiduciary rule, overstepped its authority and struck it down. "
"LONDON — In recent history as narrated by President Trump, the United States has been fleeced and humiliated by savvier nations unrestrained by naïve notions like global trading rules. Predatory powers have exploited American weakness to steal factory jobs, sowing despair. The primary villain in this narrative is China, the country that Mr. Trump has placed at the center of the combative trade policy he is advancing. Steep tariffs on steel and aluminum set to take effect this week are portrayed as targeting China, even as they mostly hit other powers. In a broadening of the battle to electronics and clothing, the Trump administration is readying at least $50 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on imported Chinese goods. If these demonstrations of muscle are intended to strengthen the American position in grappling with China, trade experts increasingly fret that Mr. Trump’s policies are doing the opposite: They potentially diminish the place of the United States in the world by alienating allies, undermining the potential for collective action among countries nursing shared grievances with China. “It’s going to be far more effective if they go together,” said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. “The fact that the United States is doing all of this alone, it does seem to be weakening the U.S. position.” China’s staggering economic development has indeed been propelled by trading practices that exploit gaps in international rules or breach them outright. The Communist Party government still subsidizes key industries, lavishes credit on state-owned companies and imposes barriers against foreign competitors. In many major economies, steel makers are contending with a glut of low-cost product, much of it made in China. Western businesses must acquiesce to Beijing’s wishes, sharing cutting-edge technology as a condition of entry to the Chinese marketplace. Frequently, the incoming technology is folded into Chinese goods that land on world markets, forcing innovators to compete against their own creations. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump has called for a wall along the border with Mexico to stop undocumented immigrants and drugs from entering the United States. But Border Patrol agents on the front lines say they need more technology and additional personnel to curb the illegal traffic, according to a report released on Thursday by Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The report was based on internal Customs and Border Protection documents from the 2017 fiscal year. It concluded that less than one half of 1 percent of the agents’ suggestions to secure the Southwest border mentioned the need for a wall. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the committee’s top Democrat, said the report reinforced what she had previously heard from border agents and leaders at Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol. “We can’t let politics get in the way of our efforts to strengthen border security and protect our country,” said Ms. McCaskill, referring to Mr. Trump’s promises to build a border wall. Officials at Customs and Border Protection called the report inaccurate, saying it confused how agents’ feedback about security vulnerabilities is used to develop programs to counter threats. The documents show that the Border Patrol identified what it called 902 “capability gaps,” or vulnerabilities, on the Southwest border. The word “wall” was suggested as a possible solution for just three of those gaps. "
"Over the next six months, Democratic voters will be asked again and again whether their party’s candidates should hew to the center or move to the left. How voters answer that question will help shape the strategic plans of the dozen or more Democrats jockeying to beat President Trump in 2020. The intraparty tension has been simmering for months. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, goaded party centrists last May when he declared abortion a Democratic litmus test: “Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health,” Perez said in a statement. “That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.” Perez later backed off. But in July, Ben Ray Luján, a congressman from New Mexico who is the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, declared that not only would the D.C.C.C. support anti-abortion Democrats, he was already working closely with the Blue Dog caucus — the party’s 18-member conservative House faction, which includes several members who oppose abortion rights — to recruit candidates for 2018. “There is not a litmus test for Democratic candidates,” Luján told The Hill. “You need to make sure you have candidates that fit the district, that can win in these districts across America.” “The Democratic Party cannot give an inch in their opposition to this Administration,” Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, countered. That is “especially true when it comes to abortion rights. The Democratic Party cannot and will not win if it turns its back on women and our fundamental rights.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant’s chief executive, publicly addressed the crisis facing his company, five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users. “We also made mistakes, there’s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,” he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users’ information. He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change. Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company’s operations, lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr. Zuckerberg’s mea culpa: “He avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,” a Columbia University researcher said. • Disillusioned Facebook users have been leaving the service.

"Toronto — Tell me if you’ve heard this before: The spoiled son of a sprawling business dynasty positions himself as an anti-elite populist. During a pivotal campaign, he brushes off a history of crude remarks as political incorrectness to the delight of his base. Then, running against the establishment of his own party and an evidently more qualified female candidate, he loses the popular vote but manages, by way of an arcane voting system, to take power. No, I’m not rehashing the victory of President Trump. I’m describing the rise of Canadian politician Doug Ford, who this month was elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, the right-of-center opposition in the country’s most populous province. With his party leading in the polls ahead of a June 7 election, Mr. Ford has a strong chance of becoming premier. Trumpism, it seems, has migrated north. Several years before the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Mr. Ford’s brother, the deceased former mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, more or less invented the politics of boorish, divisive populism the American president has since mastered. Rob Ford figured out as early as 2010 that riding out scandal, while blaming the media and other unspecified “elites,” was a winning political strategy. Torontonians forgave flaws in his character, appreciated them, even embraced them as signs of authenticity. It didn’t matter to his base that he smoked crack cocaine while in office. The Rob Ford era demonstrated that someone as shameless as Mr. Trump had a shot as a political figure. Doug Ford is a more serious and self-disciplined version of his bumbling younger brother. He has resisted comparisons between himself and the president, but has also spoken fondly about The Donald. “Absolutely he respects women,” he said of the Republican presidential candidate in 2016. “There’s millions of women that have voted for him. So all those millions of women are dumb? I don’t think so.” Mr. Ford, while much less addled than his brother was, has also been connected to Toronto’s underbelly, where Rob Ford spent so much of his time as mayor. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported in 2013 that Mr. Ford sold drugs throughout the better part of the 1980s. (He has never been charged and denies the allegations.) Thirty years later, if elected his government would be responsible for implementing Ontario’s new, legal recreational cannabis stores. "
"President Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and, against the advice of national security advisers, congratulated the Russian president on his re-election to a fourth term. The New York Times has obtained a transcript of the call, published below: The President: Pozdravlyayu! President Putin: Spasibo, Donald. The President: What’s your secret? President Putin: No secret, Donald. My people love me. I win 77 percent of vote. The President: You know, I also won 77 percent of the vote, if you don’t count all the illegal Mexicans who voted for Hillary. Plus the gays and blacks. How’d you do it? President Putin: I arranged for my only serious political adversary, Aleksei Navalny, to be convicted on trumped-up charges of embezzlement so he would be banned from running against me. The President: Love that. It’s like, “Lock her up,” Russia-style. President Putin: Yes, though you should be careful to disguise your most outrageous acts in clothing of scrupulous legality and strict bureaucratic procedure. That way masses think everything is correct and nothing is political. Like you did with this man, McCabe. Very well played, if I may say. The President: What a loser! I went after him because he was Comey’s boy and his wife’s in Hillary’s pocket. Next thing I know, it turns out he isn’t such an angel and maybe he did lie to the investigators. I didn’t see it coming but like I always say, I’ve got great instincts. President Putin: You must continue this, Donald. After Comey and McCabe it is essential to gain total control of security services. "

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) More than 10 years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the Republican governor of California, told an audience of conservative leaders that the California Republican Party had moved too far to the right and was “dying at the box office.” “How right I was,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a rare return public appearance on Wednesday. “The party was going down and down and down. Today we are the Titanic after it hit the iceberg — but before the last bit of the ship submerged.” Mr. Schwarzenegger was speaking at a youth center in East Los Angeles marking the start of an organization of moderate California Republicans trying to move the way-out-of-power state party to the center — and back, organizers said, into being a player in state governance. The organization is called New Way California and was put together by Assemblyman Chad Mayes, who was ousted as the Republican minority leader after voting with Democrats on extending the cap-and-trade automobile emission program. “We seek to shed the stereotype of the intolerant Republican Party that serves only the rich and big business,” Mr. Mayes said. Mr. Schwarzenegger was not the only Republican firepower on stage: John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, who is considering challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020, was also on hand. In Sacramento, the former governor — and occasional actor — broke with national Republicans (at least of today) when he championed environmental protection efforts, including stringent emission controls. In sentiments also reflected by Mr. Kasich and Mr. Mayes, Mr. Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be “environmentally progressive, socially liberal and fiscally conservative” in order to be competitive.

"Good Thursday Here’s what we’re watching: • Tariffs will test investors’ resolve. • Trump on Tariffs: “If they charge us, we charge them.” • The stock market is proving Gary D. Cohn right. • China tech stocks are also tumbling • Dropbox has priced its I.P.O. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher. But will investors shrug off President Trump’s tariffs on China? The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent. Until now, investors might have thought they could take Mr. Trump’s trade pronouncements in stride. After all, many countries have won a reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs. And as Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote Thursday of the anti-China measures, “The administration is delaying the action to solicit comments from affected U.S. companies, and it is quite possible the final tariffs will fall short of the threats.” Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday, saying in a tweet that Mr. Biden “would go down fast and hard” if the two men ever physically fought. Mr. Trump was responding to Mr. Biden’s comments on Tuesday about how, if he was in high school, Mr. Biden would “beat the hell” out of Mr. Trump for disrespecting women. Mr. Biden, speaking at a University of Miami rally to combat sexual assault, said, “A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, ‘I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it,’ ” referring to an Access Hollywood audio recording in which Mr. Trump is heard boasting about kissing and groping women without their consent. Mr. Biden said when he was asked if he would like to debate Mr. Trump, he said, “If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” The back-and-forth blustering between two men in their 70s comes a day after Mr. Trump criticized two of his predecessors, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, for not being able to improve relations with Russia. And Mr. Trump is facing revived sexual misconduct accusations after a New York state judge ruled that a defamation lawsuit from a woman who has said Mr. Trump made unwanted sexual advances could go forward. Mr. Biden, who has been a longtime advocate for anti-sexual assault policies, has been on the road lately, campaigning for Democrats. Earlier this month, he campaigned for a Democrat in western Pennsylvania who won a special congressional election in a district that had previously been considered Trump country. Mr. Trump campaigned for the Republican candidate who lost. Democrats see the loss as an indicator of a potential wave of Democratic wins in the upcoming midterm elections. There has been talk of a possible 2020 presidential run, which could pit Mr. Biden, 75, directly against Mr. Trump, 71. Mr. Biden considered running in 2016, but decided not to because of the death of his son. At the time, Mr. Trump said he thought Mr. Biden made the right choice for his family and that he would rather run against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump has previously tweeted about Mr. Biden while he was vice president, commenting on Mr. Biden’s gaffes. In 2012, Mr. Trump said he felt sorry for Mr. Biden’s communications team. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration began imposing stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum early on Friday morning. But it granted a brief exemption to some allies, and in a twist, said it might impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States. The White House detailed the decision in a pair of presidential proclamations late Thursday night. They gave allies that won exemptions a May 1 deadline to negotiate “satisfactory alternative means” to address what the administration calls the threat to United States national security resulting from its current levels of steel and aluminum imports. The exempted group includes Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea. President Trump also said in the proclamation that he would “consider” directing Customs and Border Protection to put in place a quota on imports from the exempted countries before the May 1 deadline, “if necessary and appropriate.” Mr. Trump wrote that he would “take into account all steel articles imports since Jan. 1, 2018, in setting the amount of such quota.” The announcement also left the door open for other allies that did not win exemptions, most notably Japan, to negotiate with the administration over tariffs. “Any country not listed in this proclamation with which we have a security relationship remains welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports of steel articles from that country,” Mr. Trump wrote. The shift in strategy reflects a few chaotic weeks in which foreign governments lobbied, cajoled and  threatened Washington to win exemptions from the 25 percent tariffs on steel and the 10 percent tariffs on aluminum. Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump, said Thursday in a television appearance that the White House would impose quotas. "
"LOS ANGELES — In the nearly two decades since the original lineup of the Smashing Pumpkins succumbed to rock-star clichés, crumbling under the weight of drugs, expectations and egos, the band’s lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Billy Corgan has kept himself plenty busy. A confident mastermind with omnivorous ambitions, Mr. Corgan, 51, became a published poet; a professional wrestling executive and owner; a prolific Myspace and LiveJournal user; a curator of vintage photographs; an amateur talking head and recurring guest on Alex Jones’s Infowars programming; the proprietor of a Chicago-area tea shop; and a cat magazine cover star, among other side-hustles. There was no shortage of music either, including two solo albums and one with Zwan, as well as various iterations of the Smashing Pumpkins that Mr. Corgan has kept afloat since declaring in a 2005 full-page newspaper ad: “I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams.” Yet despite reviving the Pumpkins brand with additional albums and regular touring over the years, Mr. Corgan, as the only constant member, has never again sniffed the creative or commercial success of the band’s heyday. Amid four consecutive platinum albums in the 1990s, the grunge-adjacent group peaked by selling more than 10 million copies of “Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness,” a 28-track opus with no fewer than four era-defining hits, including “Tonight, Tonight” and “Bullet With Butterfly Wings.” Looking back at the aftermath of those accomplishments, Mr. Corgan can admit now that he was a bit like Don Quixote, “wrestling with the ghost of the thing” and carrying on “a war that was very much my own war,” he said this month. “I was in denial about what I’d given up.” "
"Citigroup is setting restrictions on the sale of firearms by its business customers, making it the first Wall Street bank to take a stance in the divisive nationwide gun control debate. The new policy, announced Thursday, prohibits the sale of firearms to customers who have not passed a background check or who are younger than 21. It also bars the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. It would apply to clients who offer credit cards backed by Citigroup or borrow money, use banking services or raise capital through the company. The rules, which the company described as “common-sense measures,” echo similar restrictions established by some major retailers, like Walmart. But they also represent the boldest such move to emerge from the banking sector. Since the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month, renewed calls for remedies to firearms violence have led to sweeping consumer boycotts and unprecedented moves by corporate America to distance itself from the powerful gun lobby. But federal lawmakers have taken limited action, and President Trump quickly abandoned a promise to pursue gun control measures, instead promoting proposals backed by the National Rifle Association to arm teachers. The financial services and investment community was even less engaged, staying mostly quiet on suggestions that it wield its considerable influence over gun merchants to encourage firearms-related changes.

"WASHINGTON — John Dowd resigned on Thursday as President Trump’s lead lawyer for the special counsel investigation as Mr. Trump signaled that he was prepared to ignore his advice and wanted a sit-down with investigators. After days of uncertainty among the president’s lawyers about their status, Mr. Dowd ultimately broke with Mr. Trump over whether he should agree to be questioned in the inquiry, a person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Dowd viewed an interview as too risky; the president reiterated shortly after Mr. Dowd resigned that he wanted to clear his name. “I would like to,” the president told reporters at the White House when asked about meeting with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. “I would like to.” Mr. Dowd’s departure cleared the way for the president to embrace a more aggressive posture toward the investigation and marked another reshuffling of personnel for Mr. Trump. In the most politically consequential investigation in decades, the president has refashioned his legal team several times, a revolving door that mirrors the high turnover among senior White House and campaign aides. “I love the president,” Mr. Dowd said in a telephone interview. “I wish him the best of luck. I think he has a really good case.” Now, as he weighs whether to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller, the president will be advised by a cadre of lawyers better known for their television and advocacy work than their courtroom triumphs.

"New York City’s population reached a record high last year of over 8.6 million and has climbed 5.5 percent since 2010, according to a Department of City Planning analysis of new Census Bureau population estimates. There were 8,622,698 people in the city last year, 447,565 more than were counted in the 2010 census. City demographers said the new total was the culmination of an average annual gain not seen since the first half of the 20th century, when the city became dominant in everything from finance to culture and communications — and also had strong manufacturing and shipping sectors with thousands of jobs. Joseph J. Salvo, the chief demographer at the planning agency, said that, in effect, New York City added as many people as in all of New Rochelle, a city in Westchester County, each year from 2010 to 2017. The 2010 census put New Rochelle’s total at just over 77,000. He attributed some of the city’s jump to housing units planned before the 2010 census that were deferred in the recession and have been completed in the last few years. “It’s a remarkable growth story,” Dr. Salvo said. From 2010 to 2017, New York City led the rest of the state in population growth, with the Bronx emerging as the fastest-growing county in the state. The Bronx surged 6.21 percent, with 86,052 new residents. But Brooklyn, with a population of 2,648,771, took in more people — 144,071 — to achieve the highest growth of any county in the state by absolute numbers. Its 5.75 percent jump from 2010 to 2017 was second as a percentage gain. "
"President Trump put China squarely in his cross hairs on Thursday, imposing tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods to combat the rising threat from a nation that the White House has called “an economic enemy.” The measures are Mr. Trump’s strongest trade action yet against a country that he says is responsible for thousands of lost American jobs and billions in lost revenues. Financial markets plunged on fears of a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropping by 2.5 percent. The White House said it was taking action in retaliation for China’s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets. The measures include a significant change in Mr. Trump’s looming steel and aluminum tariffs that would aim them primarily at China. After Mr. Trump announced the moves, China’s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on 128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion. China urged the Trump administration to resolve differences through dialogue to “avoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.” The president’s actions fulfill his frequent campaign pledge to demand fairer trade deals with nations around the globe and to retaliate against trading partners if the United States does not secure better agreements.

"The life of the body as a physical object is all over this week’s recommended titles, from Alan Hollinghurst’s customarily sexy new novel to Maya Dusenbery’s consideration of women’s health to Kevin Toolis’s study of death rituals around the world. There’s even a history of Victorian approaches to the flesh, which includes a detailed analysis of Charles Darwin’s various beard styles and what they tell us about the era’s ideals of masculinity. Brooklyn hipsters, take note. Of course, times being what they are, we also have books about the body politic: In “The People vs. Democracy,” Yascha Mounk writes about the rise of populist movements and in “Impeachment: A Citizen’s Guide,” Cass R. Sunstein writes about the constitutional hurdles to that particular political remedy. We also have new fiction (physical, political and other) from Peter Carey, Donna Leon, Mario Vargas Llosa and Elizabeth Crook. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books THE SPARSHOLT AFFAIR, by Alan Hollinghurst. (Knopf, $28.95.) Hollinghurst’s sixth novel plays out across nearly a century of gay life in England, as a hazy sex scandal reverberates through the lives of the characters. “When Hollinghurst picks up an aspect of human experience, however banal — riding a bus, sitting for a portrait, being on a sailboat — he is so exacting that it’s as if no one has described these things before,” our critic Dwight Garner said. “Hollinghurst is a cerebral sensualist. His characters work themselves into each other’s hearts and minds as devotedly as they work themselves into each other’s underpants.” DOING HARM: The Truth About How Bad Medicine and Lazy Science Leave Women Dismissed, Misdiagnosed, and Sick, by Maya Dusenbery. (HarperOne/HarperCollins, $27.99.) Through an orderly blizzard of studies and statistics, Dusenbery examines sexism at every level in medicine from medical school admissions on up. Her book, which our critic Parul Sehgal calls well researched and “wonderfully truculent,” argues that women are regarded as unreliable narrators who can’t even testify to their own pain. “This cultural distrust of women — ancient and ingrained — is shown to govern quality of care at every stage of treatment,” Sehgal writes, to sometimes shocking effect, as when a breast-cancer patient opts for a mastectomy only for her doctor to object: “But you aren’t married.” THE PEOPLE VS. DEMOCRACY: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger & How to Save It, by Yascha Mounk. (Harvard University, $29.95.) The title of this book makes clever use of what looks like a glaring oxymoron: After all, what is democracy if not rule by the people? But Mounk, who lectures on political theory at Harvard, shows how populist insurgencies can undermine democracy in the long run. “One of the many things to recommend this clarifying book is its international scope,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “As much as Donald J. Trump might fancy himself one of a kind, Mounk argues that the American president is part of a global wave.” IMPEACHMENT: A Citizen’s Guide, by Cass R. Sunstein. (Harvard University, paper, $7.95.) Sunstein’s topic has obvious contemporary resonance, as Andrew Sullivan notes in his review, and though this short book does not take up the Trump presidency directly it does tease out “various hypotheticals with some similarities to our current concerns,” concluding that “each of these is an impeachable offense.” Yet Sunstein also cautions that the Constitution was written to ensure that a clear national consensus was necessary if a president was to be judged to be gravely violating his oath of office, or betraying the country. “This is why in well over two centuries the impeachment power has been invoked against sitting presidents only four times,” Sullivan writes, “and never actually pursued to conviction.” "
"WASHINGTON — Congress gave swift approval to a $1.3 trillion spending bill that will keep the federal government open through September but broadly defies the Trump administration’s wishes to reshape it. The House voted 256 to 167 to approve the bill early Thursday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the spending plan, which stretched 2,232 pages, had been unveiled. After a scare over whether a fiscally conservative senator might force a brief government shutdown this weekend, along with an unexpected grievance from another senator over the renaming of an Idaho wilderness area, the Senate voted 65 to 32 to approve the bill around 12:30 Friday morning. Government funding was set to expire Friday night, but by approving the bill, lawmakers moved to avert what would have been the third shutdown of the year. The spending bill, which congressional leaders agreed to on Wednesday and President Trump seemed to grudgingly endorse on Twitter, provides big increases to the military and to domestic programs — and clearly rebuffs the Trump administration’s efforts to sharply scale back the reach and scope of the federal government. The bill funds the government for the 2018 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1 and is already almost halfway over. Congress paved the way for this week’s legislation with a two-year budget deal last month that raised strict limits on military and domestic spending by about $140 billion this year. "
"BEIJING — For the better part of two decades, China’s leaders have made the most of the global trade rules set by the United States and others, seizing on opportunities to bolster their nation’s economic rise while finessing American complaints that they were not always playing fair. Now, for the first time, China faces an American president who is embracing protectionist measures, and that has presented its leader, Xi Jinping, with an extraordinary challenge: Even as he has elevated his status as the country’s “helmsman,” with a new mandate to rule indefinitely, the United States is moving to treat China more seriously as a strategic rival and to recast an economic relationship that has long bound the two countries. The punitive actions unveiled by President Trump on Thursday — tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, as well as new restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States — put Mr. Xi on the spot, forcing him to consider retaliatory action. On Friday, China said it was proposing additional tariffs on 128 American products valued at $3 billion even as it called on Washington to resolve the dispute through negotiations to “avoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.” The trade tensions could send a shudder through the global economy and complicate Mr. Xi’s efforts to sustain China’s rapid growth in the face of rising debt and an aging population. Chinese leaders are judged in part on how they manage relations with the United States, and a damaging trade war, if handled poorly, might diminish Mr. Xi’s political standing and test the wisdom of the highly centralized power structure that he has erected around himself. If he retreats and offers significant concessions, however, Mr. Xi risks looking weak and inviting criticism in a political system that has fanned nationalist and anti-American sentiment. "
"To the Editor: Re “The Calm Before the Stormy,” by Frank Bruni (column, March 21): We have a former porn star, a former Playboy model and a former “Apprentice” contestant all credibly accusing a president of the United States of sexual predation. President Trump and his lawyers have denied any past improper sexual conduct with these women, who are among at least 19 women who have made accusations. I know one of these 19 women personally, and she told me years ago of Mr. Trump’s advances, long before he was ever a candidate for the presidency. Mr. Trump has bragged about his exploits with women on many occasions, publicly and privately, and as we have now learned, large sums of money have been paid to keep some of these women from speaking out. I believe the reason that Mr. Trump has not ranted and raged about Stormy Daniels is that she has the goods on the president, including her 2011 polygraph test results, and possibly photographs and tapes of their encounters, and Mr. Trump is beyond scared of what the reaction will be if these get released. Mr. Trump’s payment to Ms. Daniels may have been in violation of campaign finance laws, and were certainly in violation of his marital vows to Melania. I for one cannot wait for Sunday’s broadcast of the Stormy Daniels interview on “60 Minutes”! HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN, NEW YORK "
"“Trade wars are good, and easy to win.” So declared Donald Trump a few weeks ago, after announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Actually, trade wars are rarely good, and not at all easy to win — especially if you have no idea what you’re doing. And boy, do these people not know what they’re doing. It’s odd, in a way. After all, trade is clearly an issue about which Trump is truly passionate. He tried to kill Obamacare, but to all appearances his main concern was tarnishing his predecessor’s legacy. He wanted a tax cut, but more to score a “win” than because he cared about what was in it. But reducing the trade deficit has been a long-term Trump obsession, so you might expect him to learn something about how world trade works, or at least surround himself with people who do understand the subject. But he hasn’t. And what he doesn’t know can and will hurt you. In the case of steel, here’s what happened: First came the splashy announcement of big tariffs, ostensibly in the name of national security — infuriating U.S. allies, which are the main source of our steel imports. Then came what looks like a climb-down: The administration has exempted Canada, Mexico, the European Union and others from those tariffs. Was this climb-down a reaction to threats of retaliation, or did the administration not at first realize that the tariffs would mainly hit our allies? Either way, Trump may have gotten the worst of both worlds: angering countries that should be our friends and establishing a reputation as an untrustworthy ally and trading partner, without even doing much for the industry he was supposedly trying to help. Now comes Trumptrade II, the China Syndrome. On Thursday the administration announced that it would levy tariffs on a number of Chinese goods, with the specifics to be detailed later. How will this one work out? Let’s be clear: When it comes to the global economic order, China is in fact a bad citizen. In particular, it plays fast and loose on intellectual property, in effect ripping off technologies and ideas developed elsewhere. It also subsidizes some industries, including steel, contributing to world excess capacity. "
"On Saturday, Rebecca Schneid plans to pull on her sneakers, sling a camera over her shoulder and march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington with thousands of other students demanding an end to the gun violence that has cut through so many American communities. But to Ms. Schneid, a survivor of the school shooting that killed 17 people last month in Parkland, Fla., the march is just the beginning — a moment of political awakening, she hopes, that will put the nation on notice that young people plan to be a greater, more organized force than teenagers and college students in the past. “It’s going to look like millions and millions of people,” said Ms. Schneid, 16, who is the editor of the newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “And it’s going to look scary to politicians.” With more than 800 student-led demonstrations planned in the United States and internationally, the organizers of the March for Our Lives are aiming for a generational show of strength by a diverse movement united in a conviction that adults have failed them. Still, for all their fierce energy, these liberal-leaning activists have yet to be tested in the arena of electoral politics. They face a political system that is historically resistant to major change, and a Republican president and Congress with a strong base of support among much older voters, many of whom have more conservative views on guns. A major moment will come in the 2018 midterm elections: Some students will be eligible to vote in November, and have vowed to make gun laws a central issue. Many more hope to organize networks and lay groundwork to vent their frustration — about pervasive school violence, and an unjust political system they view as enabling it — in the next vote for president in 2020.
