"Having more orders than you can fill is generally deemed a high-class problem. Despite demand for 400,000 of its Model 3, Tesla is proving otherwise, and that’s a problem for investors, not to mention the future of electric vehicles. The Trump administration is dialing back regulations that locked carmakers into improving average fuel efficiency to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by 2025. The Environmental Protection Agency, under its administrator, Scott Pruitt, is also looking to review California’s authority to impose stricter pollution rules, a move that prompted a blistering response from the California Air Resources Board’s chairwoman, Mary Nichols. “This is not a technical assessment,” she said. “It is a move to demolish the nation’s clean-car program.” President Trump claims that companies overestimated demand for highly efficient cars such as fully electric vehicles — E.V.s. Yet consumers’ initial rush to own Tesla’s Model 3, with current pricing starting around $50,000, certainly belies that claim. What Tesla overestimated was the number of E.V.s it could produce. Tesla’s inability to ramp up production has created a cash crunch and a crisis of confidence for a company valued at $45 billion, or about as much as Ford Motor. Although valued similarly, there are vast differences between the companies. Ford sold 6.6 million vehicles last year, some 64 times Tesla’s sales of 103,000. Ford earned $7.6 billion, which the market found disappointing. Tesla lost $2.24 billion on sales of $3.3 billion, which the market shrugged off, at least until recently. That tells you how the stock market values the future of both companies and of E.V.s in particular. It’s not a belief that’s universally held. For at least a year, there has been open warfare between the Tesla believers and the Tesla skeptics and short sellers. The believers see the advance orders for the Model 3 as testimony to the company’s disruptive brilliance. The Tesla shorts — investors who bet against the stock — see the company as an automotive Ponzi scheme. To them, the founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, is beginning to look more like Tesla’s corporate eponym, Nikola Tesla, the brilliant but eccentric scientist who in 1888 created the alternating current electrical grid that powers the world today and who died penniless.

"Rebecca Dallet, a Milwaukee County Circuit judge favored by liberals, was elected on Tuesday to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, The Associated Press reported, reducing the hold of conservative justices over the state’s highest court. Judge Dallet’s defeat of Michael Screnock, a Sauk County Circuit judge who had the backing of conservatives, was immediately being held up as a sign of Democratic enthusiasm ahead of the November elections, in a state that narrowly chose President Trump in 2016. The election was officially nonpartisan, and it involved candidates who were little known in Wisconsin until a few weeks ago. It was held during an off season for voting, on a day when snow and freezing rain were predicted in parts of the state. Still, the realities of this race fell firmly along partisan lines, as have many Wisconsin Supreme Court races in recent years. And it came at a moment when seemingly every contest across the country is being examined through the lens of the approaching midterm elections. A series of recent races in states like Pennsylvania, Alabama and Virginia has shown Democratic strength. The Wisconsin Supreme Court contest was the first chance in 2018 to take the temperature of voters across the state — a matter of intense interest to analysts, in part because Wisconsin’s choice of President Trump in 2016 marked the first time in 32 years that a Republican had carried the state in a presidential race. Wisconsin state politics had been shifting to the right; in 2010, Scott Walker, a Republican, won the governor’s office, and both chambers of the State Legislature flipped to red as well. Then in January, though, a Democrat won a special election for a State Senate seat that had been held by a Republican for 17 years, setting off a flurry of predictions. "
"WASHINGTON — Amazon, you’re not alone. President Trump once accused Verizon of making “a STUPID deal” for AOL. He ridiculed Coca-Cola as “garbage” — but said he would keep drinking it. He called both H&R Block and Nordstrom “terrible.” He said Sony had “really stupid leadership” and described executives at S&P Global, a financial firm, as “losers.” Before and after he became president, Mr. Trump attacked tech firms, military contractors, carmakers, cellphone companies, financial firms, drug companies, air-conditioner makers, sports leagues, Wall Street giants — and many, many media companies, which he has labeled “shameful,” “dishonest,” “true garbage,” “really dumb,” “phony,” “failing” and, broadly, “the enemy of the American people.” Lately, Mr. Trump’s antibusiness rants have become particularly menacing and caused the stocks of some companies to plunge. His Twitter posts have carried with them the threat, sometimes explicit, that he is prepared to use the power of the presidency to undermine the companies that anger him. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, long a booster of Republican presidents, is not happy. “It’s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the chamber. Mr. Bradley, who did not specifically name Mr. Trump, added that criticism of companies from politicians “undermines economic growth and job creation.” Amazon’s stock price dropped sharply before rebounding this week after Mr. Trump threatened the company with possible antitrust action. The president’s remark in November that the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would not be “good for the country” roiled the continuing antitrust fight between the companies and the government. His earlier complaint on Twitter that Boeing’s $4 billion price for a new generation of Air Force One was “out of control” forced a fresh round of negotiations, although the price fell only to $3.9 billion. Most presidents have clashed with business interests and industries, sometimes in ways that generated headlines. But Mr. Trump is unique in singling out individual companies for ridicule with regularity. And rarely have presidents done so because of a personal pique or grudge, as happens with Mr. Trump. "
"SEATTLE — Five times in the last week, President Trump has pointed his Twitter arrows at Amazon over what he insists is a bad deal for the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday that the agreement, which sets what Amazon pays the Postal Service for many orders, costs American taxpayers billions of dollars. “I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,” he wrote. The details about the deal are not public — they are considered commercially sensitive information — but some of the available evidence suggests the opposite: that Amazon has been a boon to the Postal Service. The Postal Service has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships as more of its customers turn away from postcards and letters in favor of email, texting and other forms of digital communication. The total pieces of mail it shipped last year was 149 billion, down from 212 billion a decade earlier. Yet there is a bright spot — its business of package shipping, including Amazon orders, which grew to 5.7 billion packages last year from 3.3 billion in 2008. Several years ago, the Postal Service added Sunday delivery for Amazon packages. The agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion on $69.6 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and faces huge retirement benefit obligations. Without Amazon’s business, the financial picture at the Postal Service would most likely be bleaker, many analysts say. "
"Two warring factions of Democratic lawmakers have agreed to reunite and end seven years of infighting, a significant political realignment that ends an arrangement that had helped give Republicans a foothold of power in Albany. An alliance in the State Senate between Republicans and a renegade of group of Democrats known as the Independent Democratic Conference was formed during Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s first week in office. It had since amounted to one of the oddest political arrangements in the country — and one that had become increasingly untenable in the current political climate. Impassioned activists have called for Democrats to unite against President Trump and to hold up New York as a bastion of liberalism. They have launched primaries against most of the breakaway Democratic lawmakers. And now Mr. Cuomo himself is facing a primary challenge, from the actress Cynthia Nixon, who has made the bipartisan alliance in Albany a focus of her attacks on governor’s progressive credentials. The Democratic accord, which would dissolve the I.D.C., left the Republicans with a perilous one-vote majority hinging on one last recalcitrant Democrat. It came together Tuesday over coffee and cookies at a Manhattan steakhouse. “For the good of the party, this has to stop,” Mr. Cuomo said at the closed-door gathering, according to two people who were in the room. Around the table sat Mr. Cuomo; the leaders of New York’s most powerful labor unions; Joseph Crowley, the top-ranked New York Democrat in the House of Representatives; and the two rival Democratic leaders of the State Senate — Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who leads the main group of Democrats, and Jeffrey D. Klein, who leads the breakaway group — among others. "
"There has been a lot of talk lately about Kim Jong-un’s willingness to discuss the “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula. It’s a cumbersome word and one that has given rise to more than a few misunderstandings. Many people, including President Trump, seem to hear “denuclearization” and imagine a promise by Mr. Kim to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, recently acquired at great cost. But the term means more than the North’s disarmament. It imposes obligations on the United States, too — even if Americans don’t want to hear that part. The word “denuclearization” is more or less native to the Korean Peninsula. This wasn’t the term experts used to talk about the elimination of nuclear weapons programs in South Africa, Iraq or Libya. In those contexts, the word was almost always “disarmament.” So why have diplomats this time chosen the far more complicated word “denuclearization”? Because the situation is, well, far more complicated. The term itself is a relic from the 1990s, the moment in which the ongoing crisis over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions began. At the end of the Cold War, the only nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula were American. The problem, from an American perspective, was that North Korea wanted to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities of its own. Ultimately, President George H.W. Bush’s administration chose to withdraw American nuclear weapons from South Korea as part of an effort to seek a diplomatic solution to the North’s nuclear ambitions. For a moment, it seemed like it would work: After the 1991 withdrawal of American nuclear weapons, South Korea and North Korea signed in 1992 a joint declaration on “the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” “Denuclearization” was conveniently abstract. That allowed it to capture different aspects of what James Baker, Mr. Bush’s secretary of state, called “the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula.” It covered at the same time the nuclear weapons that the United States withdrew from South Korea, the so-called “nuclear umbrella” of extended deterrence provided by the United States, and North Korea’s own nuclear weapons ambitions. It was a shapeless, ill-fitting word. But the alternatives — “disarmament” or “nonproliferation” — were just too narrow. Diplomats couldn’t squeeze everything that mattered into them. "
"With Democrats winning in normally deep red places like Alabama and Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District, it looks like a blue wave is swelling for the midterm elections. There’s still time for Republicans to change that, but first they must figure out how to mount an effective defense. To do that, they need to focus on a largely overlooked group of voters: Donald Trump voters who did not like him. According to the 2016 exit polls, 18 percent of Americans did not like either Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump owes his victory to the fact that he beat her among this group by a 17-point margin, 47 percent to 30 percent (the remainder voted for a third party or write-in candidate). Multiplying Mr. Trump’s percentage among this group by the group’s share of the electorate yields a startling fact: Nearly one-fifth of all Trump voters didn’t like him. This is a shockingly high share; it goes a long way toward explaining why places that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 could be voting against Republicans in 2018. The president’s job-approval rating remains historically weak, in the low 40s, only a few points higher than his humble favorability rating was on Election Day. Both exit polls in 2017 and analysis of recent generic congressional ballot polls — which indicate a Democratic lead — show that willingness to vote Republican or Democratic is highly correlated with one’s opinion of President Trump. That can mean only one of two things: Either people who voted for Mr. Trump without liking him are so discouraged they aren’t even answering polls (unlikely) or millions of Trump voters are intending to vote for Democrats in the fall. That probably shocks political pros from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Trump’s first year in office, while tumultuous, followed a predictable script. He signed the Republicans’ signature agenda item, a giant tax-cut bill. He pursued a traditional business-friendly Republican program for deregulation and promoted conservative priorities like stricter immigration policy. He appointed the conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, regularly attacked the news media and provoked liberals with culture-war tweets (like berating N.F.L. players for kneeling during the national anthem).

Here’s what you need to know: • He’s been in office 14 months, but President Trump is increasingly falling back on the hard-edge isolationism that fueled his “America First” campaign. He also said he planned to deploy the National Guard to the border with Mexico, to confront what the White House calls the growing threat of illegal immigration and crime. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, didn’t say how many troops would be sent, nor when. Mr. Trump has spoken before about using the military to police the border, only to have his aides walk back the remarks. • Immigration rights campaigners said the announcement was a political ploy. Mr. Trump has been criticized by some conservative supporters for signing a trillion-dollar-plus spending measure that didn’t fund the border wall he promised. • The woman who shot and wounded three people at the company’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., before killing herself on Tuesday has been identified by the police as Nasim Najafi Aghdam.

"Like all things in this Trump-deranged era, the remarkable ratings success of the rebooted “Roseanne,” a show that last aired when I was 17 years old but commanded a larger audience in its return than any sitcom now on network television, has unleashed a thousand takes about the show’s political significance. Who’s going to win “Roseanne” voters in 2018? Can Hollywood entertain Trump country without betraying its principles? Is the pro-Trump Roseanne Barr an oracle or a conspiracy theorist? Can a member of the #Resistance watch “Roseanne” in good conscience? All of these takes are, I’m sorry, tiresome. So let’s try to analyze the return of the Conner family in strictly cultural terms, without directly referencing the present occupant of the White House. The show’s sky-high ratings probably owe something to Roseanne’s political views and blue-collar goddess reputation, but above all they are a case study in the power the baby boom generation still wields, even as it begins to enter old age, over our collective cultural imagination. And not only that: They testify to the extent to which the boomers, for all the destruction trailing in their wake, might be the only thing holding American culture together at this point. That’s because if the boomers were destructive, they were also creative. Indeed, you can make a reasonable case that theirs was the last great burst of creativity in Western history, the last great surge of mass cultural invention. The boomers were the last generation to come of age with some traditional edifices still standing, the old bourgeois norms and Christian(ish) religion and patriotic history, which gave them something powerful to wrestle with, to rework and react against and attempt to overthrow. And because they came of age within a stable-seeming (though not for long) common culture, their revolution was experienced as a communal experience itself, something that united millions of people simply by virtue of their being young and Western in 1965 or 1969 or 1975. In an essay on “Golden Ages” in his “Prejudices: Philosophical Dictionary,” Robert Nisbet argued that a great period of ferment and achievement often features a “dialectical antinomy.” This is a fancy way of saying that you need ideas and trends and forces in tension with each other (community and individualism, the secular and the sacred, new ideas and settled consensus, younger and older generations) to ignite what he calls “the blaze of creativity.” We can debate just how golden their achievements really were, but in hindsight his description applies to the period of the boomer takeover — it was the tension between a multitudinous younger generation’s utopianism and libertinism and mysticism and an older generation’s attachment to patriotism and family and religion that shaped and stamped the rise of rock ’n’ roll, the rebel cinema of the 1970s, the New Age reinvention of religion, the New Journalism and the postmodern wave in the academy and the libertarian ascendancy in the G.O.P. and more.

President Trump has been criticizing Amazon over the past week, and on Thursday he suggested — inaccurately — that the company is ripping off the United States Postal Service. Jimmy Kimmel was dumbfounded by the criticism, and Jimmy Fallon took the opportunity to poke fun at Trump. Dwayne Johnson sat down with Kimmel on Tuesday, 48 hours after April Fools’ Day, but he still found a way to play a prank on the host. He told Kimmel with seeming sincerity that his girlfriend had played an April Fools’ joke on him, pretending to go into labor and nearly letting him take her to the hospital before she revealed the joke.

"According to most estimates, there are more than 40,000 Chinese restaurants in the United States, and it seems as if you can find some version of beef and broccoli at almost all of them: velvety wok-fried meat in brown sauce, served in a forest of green. The dish has been part of the Chinese-American restaurant-food canon since at least the 1950s, a few decades after broccoli first rode to popular heights on the backs of the southern Italian immigrants who championed it on our shores. The dish is a standard at high-end restaurants and scruffy takeout shops alike, wherever there is a market for the sweet-salty-crisp flavors that Americans claim as a birthright. But it would be a trial to find such a dish in China. “It’s diaspora food,” said Jonathan Wu, who until it closed recently was the chef at the elegant dim-sum bar Nom Wah Tu on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, “a genre unto itself.” Wu, an American of Chinese descent, ate the dish a lot when he was growing up outside Hartford, a home-cooked variety in which his mom reversed the proportions to provide a lot more broccoli and rice than beef. The broccoli was his favorite part, he said, lightly tossed in a wok that never got very hot on her electric-coil stove, and mixed with a sauce she never thickened beyond its base of pungent oyster cut through with soy. “She kept it simple,” he said. “Streamlined.” That happens to be excellent advice for anyone who believes that home-cooked takeout-style beef and broccoli can trump the white-carton delivery variety. Inspired, I found myself cooking a version of Wu’s mother’s recipe for beef and broccoli not three hours after talking to him. On his advice, I trimmed chuck steak and cut it against the grain into strips, then stirred them into a marinade of rice wine, soy sauce and cornstarch. It clung to the beef, a kind of lustrous cloak. I cut broccoli into florets and planked the stems, just as his mother did, and made a sauce out of three others: Wu’s oyster and soy, and a little chile-garlic for zip. The result was a heady miracle for a family that somehow always believes that the food coming on the bicycle, being handed through the Plexiglas shield, served from the steam table in the corner of the airport will be excellent, though it never really is. The two little Michelin inspectors who eat my food every night gave it two stars. I thought: Two stars is great. [Pause] I was looking for three. In search of improvement, I considered the lead of the antic, puckish chef Danny Bowien, of Mission Chinese in New York and San Francisco, who put a recipe for beef and broccoli into his 2015 cookbook. He built the dish on a foundation of braised beef cheeks and Chinese broccoli adorned in smoked oyster sauce. But the beef cheeks alone took the better part of a day. The smoked oyster sauce was like building a rocket. I looked at the other end of the spectrum as well, at chain-restaurant copycat recipes, considering the shiny slurries of cornstarch, soy and mirin that are meant to evoke the sugary sauce on the beef and broccolis served at PF Chang’s and Panda Express. I don’t love the food at those restaurants. I hated the slurries. "
"SHANGHAI — China hit back at the United States on Wednesday with proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of American soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods, in a move likely to stoke fears that the countries’ escalating confrontation could become an all-out trade war. Moving with unusual speed, Chinese officials outlined plans to make it more costly to import 106 types of American goods into China. They are intended to hit the United States square in the farm belt — a major section of President Trump’s political support but also a major supplier of what China stocks in its supermarkets. Beijing’s plan to institute new tariffs was announced just hours after the Trump administration detailed its own protections on a similar value of Chinese-made aircraft parts, cars and car parts, televisions, steel and much more. Following a previous round of tit-for-tat tariffs unveiled over the past few days, the new measures have sparked concerns that the dispute could widen further, hurting jobs and growth in both countries. Investors drove financial markets lower over the prospect that the two sides were not yet done fighting. “China has never succumbed to external pressure,” Zhu Guangyao, vice minister of finance, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. He added, “External pressure will only make the Chinese people more focused on economic development.” The question now is whether the two sides will intensify their efforts to punish each other before they sit down to negotiate. Neither set of tariffs go into effect right away, though the exact timing of the Chinese measures was not clear. "

"In March, The New York Times, working with The Observer of London and The Guardian, obtained a cache of documents from inside Cambridge Analytica, the data firm principally owned by the right-wing donor Robert Mercer. The documents proved that the firm, where the former Trump aide Stephen K. Bannon was a board member, used data improperly obtained from Facebook to build voter profiles. The news put Cambridge under investigation and thrust Facebook into its biggest crisis ever. Here’s a guide to our coverage. The Times reported that in 2014 contractors and employees of Cambridge Analytica, eager to sell psychological profiles of American voters to political campaigns, acquired the private Facebook data of tens of millions of users — the largest known leak in Facebook history. There was more. Our article first showed how Cambridge received warnings from its own lawyer, Laurence Levy, as it employed European and Canadian citizens on campaigns, potentially violating American election law. The Times also found that tranches of raw data still existed beyond Facebook’s control. Read how researchers may have used your Facebook “likes” to predict your political views. In a companion piece, The Times reported that people at Cambridge Analytica and its British affiliate, the SCL Group, were in contact with executives from Lukoil, the Kremlin-linked oil giant, as Cambridge built its Facebook-derived profiles. Lukoil was interested in the ways data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature and said the oil giant never became a client. The articles drew an instant response in Washington, where lawmakers demanded that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, testify before Congress. Democrats looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election — already interested in Cambridge’s role in providing analytics to the Trump campaign — said they would seek an investigation into the leak. They were echoed by lawmakers in Britain investigating Cambridge Analytica’s role in disinformation and the country’s referendum to leave the European Union. "

This week, we’re tracking the ethics issues surrounding the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency. And we’re thanking our newsletter subscribers — all 100,000 of them. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, made a big announcement this week: The E.P.A. will reconsider, and most likely roll back, Obama-era automobile standards for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency. The decision goes beyond what even the automakers had asked for, and sets up a showdown with California over air pollution rules. But headlines in recent days have focused on Mr. Pruitt himself as he faces a growing list of potential ethics scandals. It can be hard to follow every development, so let us catch you up on some of the biggest ones dogging Mr. Pruitt this week. On Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, was asked whether Mr. Trump was “O.K.” with Mr. Pruitt’s apartment arrangement. “The president’s not,” she said. “We’re reviewing the situation. When we have had a chance to have a deeper dive on it, we’ll let you know the outcomes of that, but we’re currently reviewing that here at the White House.” "
"HOUSTON — A cyberattack on a shared data network forced four of the nation’s natural-gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers over the last week. No gas service was interrupted, the companies said, and the interruption of customer transactions was merely a precaution. It was unclear whether any customer data was stolen. The attack highlighted the potential vulnerability of the nation’s energy system, cyberexperts say. Beyond consumer and business data — energy companies possess much proprietary information about their holdings, trading strategies and exploration and production technologies — the increasing dependence of pipeline infrastructure on digital systems makes them a particularly ripe target. Control valves, pressure monitors and other equipment connected to wireless networks are vital to daily functions of everything from refineries to oil wells. With nearly 2.5 million miles of oil, gas and chemical pipelines crisscrossing the country, intrusions into control systems could do more than disrupt deliveries, said Andrew R. Lee, a cybersecurity expert at the law firm Jones Walker in New Orleans. The risks include “explosions, spills, or fires, which easily will threaten human life, property and the environment,” he said. Nothing close to that kind of disaster happened this time. But the pipeline industry leaders Oneok; Energy Transfer Partners; Boardwalk Pipeline Partners; and Eastern Shore Natural Gas, a Chesapeake Utilities subsidiary, all reported communications system interruptions. The attack’s target appears to have been Latitude Technologies, a Texas-based provider of electronic data-sharing between pipeline companies and their gas producer and utility customers. The company handles the critical computer communications of gas storage facilities, as well as sales contracts and shipment scheduling. "
"Many people, including many Republican lawmakers, dismiss President Trump’s attacks on The Washington Post, CNN and other news organizations as just one of those crazy — but ultimately harmless — things he does to blow off steam. They’re wrong. Yes, Mr. Trump hasn’t been able to implement many of his worst proposals to undermine the press. Congress hasn’t tried to change the First Amendment or pass new libel laws, for example, and journalists — including at the “failing New York Times” — regularly unearth new scandals in the Trump administration. But the president’s rhetoric is clearly having an effect in the United States and especially around the world, where political leaders have seen it as a green light to crack down on the press. Malaysian lawmakers this week passed a law that would impose prison sentences of up to six years on people found to be spreading “fake news,” an ill-defined term that will put tremendous power in the hands of government officials to punish journalists and publishers. In India, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed revoking the accreditation of journalists who traffic in “fake news” before scrapping the idea after journalists denounced it. In recent days, Mr. Trump turned his guns on The Post, accusing it of trying to advance the business interests of its owner, Jeff Bezos, and the company he founded and runs, Amazon. Much has been made of the accusations the president has hurled at Amazon’s business practices, like its unwillingness for many years to collect state and local sales taxes. Some of these practices are indeed troubling. But don’t be distracted. Mr. Trump isn’t really distressed about the coffers of state and local governments, small retailers or whether the United States Postal Service suffers losses delivering Amazon packages. He is trying to undermine the credibility of The Post because it is holding his administration to account. Such attacks on the integrity of news organizations confuse the public about what’s true. Many Republican voters have long been skeptical of the mainstream news media, but their trust in it has fallen sharply since 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. And a study by two Yale professors found that Republicans were much more likely to trust hyperpartisan media outlets and news sites that peddle outright falsehoods than are Democrats. That phenomenon has undoubtedly been bolstered by Mr. Trump’s embrace of conspiracy theories and his endorsements of Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting, which has compelled news anchors at its local TV stations to read outrageous statements questioning the credibility of other news organizations. “Trump seems to be succeeding just through the force of his daily verbal assaults in shaking trust in the press and in other institutions that are crucial to our democracy,” says Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.

In the weeks following Britain’s vote in 2016 for “Brexit,” fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain’s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective. Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump’s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China’s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent. Investors may believe China’s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. It looks a lot like a trade war. Hours after the White House outlined $50 billion in tariffs on largely high-tech Chinese products, China announced its own tariffs on $50 billion worth of American goods. China’s list focused on agricultural products that come from the Republican-dominated farm belt, where lawmakers might be expected to have some influence with President Trump. Above, harvesting soybeans in Illinois. Administration officials say they see no reason to panic, and markets rose after an erratic day. ____ 2. The White House said that the U.S. would remain in Syria to continue the fight against the Islamic State — just a day after President Trump said “it’s time” to bring the 2,000 U.S. troops there home.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Farmers across California’s agriculture industry are worried over the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, with steep new tariffs specifically targeting some of the state’s most lucrative exports. The Chinese finance ministry announced over the weekend that it would impose tariffs on more than 100 American products, including many of California’s staples like wine and pistachios, in retaliation against tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum by President Trump. “We have heard a lot of concerns from our wine grape growers and our pistachio and almond growers. Those markets are definitely going to take the largest hit,” Sara Neagu-Reed, of the California Farm Bureau Federation, said. “Putting us in the middle of this issue is just not fair for our farmers.” That could mean trouble for the state’s farmers in the Central Valley and elsewhere. China is California’s third most valuable destination for agriculture products, according to the California Farm Bureau Federation, just behind the European Union and Canada. The state’s exports to China totaled more than $2 billion in 2016. Three products alone, all facing tariffs, accounted for most of those exports: $530 million in pistachios, $518 million in almonds and $161 million in wine. The tariffs add another layer of uncertainty for growers in California, and in particular those in the wine industry, which already faces growing production costs. The full impact of the tariffs is not yet clear, but experts are warning of significant decreases in exports of those products. Fluctuating prices in steel could also affect the price of farm equipment. "
"Stocks rose on Wednesday in a roller-coaster trading session during which investors were whipsawed by updates on an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished up 1.2 percent, an upbeat end to a session that started with a steep, nearly 1.5 percent decline driven by jitters of worsening trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Stocks reversed course after Larry Kudlow, President Trump’s newly installed director of the National Economic Council, sought to play down the risks of an outright trade war in late-morning comments to reporters. Washington and Beijing have announced a series of tariffs and counter-tariffs in recent days, with China saying on Wednesday that it planned to impose some $50 billion in import duties on soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods from the United States. The moves came in response to Mr. Trump’s recent decision to place tariffs on steel, aluminum, aircraft parts, flat-screen televisions and other products from China, which he has long accused of engaging in unfair trade practices. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump has instructed his military commanders to quickly wrap up the American military operation in Syria so that he can bring troops home within a few months, senior administration officials said on Wednesday. He dropped his insistence on an immediate withdrawal, they said, after commanders told him they needed time to complete their mission. The president’s decision to keep the 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria for the immediate future came in a meeting of the National Security Council in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday, hours after Mr. Trump had told a roomful of reporters that “it’s time” to bring American forces home from a conflict that has been a crucial battlefield in the fight against the Islamic State. At the meeting, Mr. Trump’s top military advisers told him they had drawn up plans to pull American troops out of Syria immediately. But they also presented a plan for the forces to stay longer to clean out the residual pockets of Islamic State fighters and to train local forces to stabilize the liberated territory so that the group could not regain a foothold. “How long do you need to do that?” the frustrated president asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, according to an official present for the exchange. They responded that it was difficult to predict a precise timetable, but that it would not take years. As long as the operation lasted months rather than years, Mr. Trump replied, “I can support that.” After that, discussion in the Situation Room turned to issuing a statement that would reassure Syrian Arab allies that the United States would not cut and run, and would reinforce Mr. Trump’s message that Persian Gulf states needed to do more to contribute to the stabilization and reconstruction of liberated areas. "
"WASHINGTON — Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress’s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration’s efforts to re-examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. The report, issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported — including by black students in affluent schools. Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration’s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates. The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety. On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year — and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person.

"EVELETH, Minn. — On northern Minnesota’s Iron Range, where evergreen trees stretch on for miles and snowpack lingers into the spring, a political shift is underway. Generations of residents have gone to work in the mines, endured cycles of booms and layoffs, and mostly voted for Democrats. But President Trump’s tariffs on imported steel are being celebrated as a boost to the local taconite mines, which supply American steel mills, and Republicans are hopeful that they can flip the area’s congressional seat in November. “President Trump is keeping his promises that he made on the campaign trail,” said Pete Stauber, a retired police officer and former professional hockey player who is running for Congress as a Republican. “He talked about leveling the playing field for the American worker. He did that with the tariffs.” Much has been said about groups who dislike the tariffs: a bipartisan mix of manufacturers, farmers and politicians who warn of trade disputes and unforeseen consequences. China’s announcement on Wednesday of proposed tariffs on a range of American exports — including soybeans, chemicals and cars — heightened concern that a trade war could be looming. But in a few places where Republicans see openings to win seats and upend a national political forecast that seems to favor Democrats in November, the 25 percent tariff on foreign steel and the 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum are viewed as economic lifelines straight from the Oval Office.

"It looks a lot like a trade war. On Monday, China imposed tariffs on 128 American products imported into the country, including wine, pork and steel pipes. The next day, the Trump administration took a direct hit at China, announcing tariffs on about $50 billion worth of imports like flat-screen TVs, medical devices and aircraft parts. The day after that, China upped the ante. And on Thursday, President Trump said the United States should go further, suggesting additional tariffs on $100 billion of Chinese goods. With each move, the world’s two biggest economies have appeared more than willing to one-up the other to protect their interests, as the Trump administration tries to enact policies to help American workers and the Chinese government tries to become a global leader across a variety of cutting-edge industries. American companies have complained that they don’t have a level playing field with their Chinese counterparts. The Chinese government provides big subsidies for its homegrown players, as part of a broader state-led plan. The country has taken advantage of gaps in international rules or hasn’t bothered to follow them. "
"“Roseanne” mania has cooled slightly, but the ratings numbers for the show’s second night suggest that it is indeed a bona fide hit for ABC. The first two episodes of the revived sitcom, which aired back to back on March 27, scored huge ratings, surprising television executives and making the case that traditional networks are not about to cede their audiences to Netflix and other streaming services. In its return on Tuesday, the show notched 15.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen, a sturdy performance after last week’s blockbuster debut. The numbers were expected to increase once delayed viewing is factored in later this week. Including those viewers who watched the “Roseanne” premiere in the days after it aired, 25 million people saw it, according to Nielsen. That was the biggest audience for a sitcom in nearly four years. President Trump made a congratulatory phone call to Roseanne Barr, the show’s co-creator and a supporter of Mr. Trump, who was at the center of a national conversation in a way she had not been since “Roseanne” was an ABC stalwart from 1988 to 1997. Network executives moved quickly to renew the show for another season. In all, Tuesday’s figures were a 16 percent decline from the premiere. In the 18-to-49-year-old demographic vital to advertisers, “Roseanne” notched a 3.9 rating, a 25 percent decline. "
"MANCHESTER, N.H. — John Kasich had been here before. This much he pointed out, twice, before anyone had a chance to wonder why he was back. “Wow!” he called out, stepping into the Red Arrow Diner on Tuesday for an unannounced stop, emitting the kind of surprise that only a politician can summon over three dozen people eating lunch. “It was just this crowded the last time.” Mr. Kasich sidled up beside the counter, squatting to greet a young customer, Sophia Bauer, whose name he seemed to hear as “Sylvia.” “How old are you?” he asked. “Five? Are you going to be in first grade? Do you have a dog? Oh, really?” Soon, Sophia was being tickled by the two-term Republican governor of Ohio. He led her by the hand toward a booth in the corner, where a television camera was waiting. “Isn’t that cool?” he said. The two peered into the camera together. The governor smiled. Then Sophia was dismissed. “All right, Sylvia,” he said. “Go back to your mom.” It was time to talk to CNN again. It is both unclear what Mr. Kasich is doing here, in the first-in-the-nation primary state, and entirely clear what he is doing. He is not not running for president. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Foresees National Guard Securing Border” (front page, April 4): President Trump’s latest tirade is a transparent ploy to press Congress for money to build his wall. His pattern is becoming tiresome: Do something outrageous as a negotiating tactic. Threatening to deploy our military to guard our border with Mexico also sends Mexico a message: You are not a friend; you are an adversary. Mexico cannot trust Mr. Trump’s volatility.

PALOS VERDES ESTATES, CALIF. To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Perversion of Leadership,” by Frank Bruni (column, April 4): It is in his contempt for the very office he holds, his effort to make the presidency bend to him instead of giving it the respect it deserves and that we demand, that Donald Trump does the most damage. He luxuriates in his boorishness, somehow perceiving that changing what came before means repudiating every shred of decency, renouncing every ounce of compassion, rejecting every hint of morality. Even as we watched others in this office falter, we never sensed that the very essence of what made us a great country was under attack. We took comfort in the unshakable belief that our highest office was bigger than any one person, that its underlying principles were greater than the mistakes of omission or commission of any temporary holder, our structure stronger than any errors committed on one person’s watch. But that understanding has been shaken to the core. President Trump has made us question the fundamental belief of the greatness of the office of the presidency. And beyond all else, this we can never forgive. ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM, FORT LEE, N.J.

"THE MAKING OF A DREAM
How a Group of Young Undocumented Immigrants Helped Change What It Means to Be American
By Laura Wides-Muñoz
Illustrated. 361 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99. On Jan. 1, 2010, four student activists began a 1,500-mile walk from Miami to Washington, D.C. They wore white Nikes and, later, white T-shirts that said “Undocumented.” They chose the start of a new decade for their walk because it seemed auspicious. Exhausted by years of lobbying for immigration reform that never came to pass and a Dream Act that never materialized, the friends wanted to stage a protest. When they got to Washington, they hoped to persuade President Obama to address their predicament, one shared by hundreds of thousands of young people. That quandary, aptly summarized by the veteran journalist Laura Wides-Muñoz in “The Making of a Dream: How a Group of Young Undocumented Immigrants Helped Change What It Means to Be American,” was this: They were “kids raised in a country whose language and culture they identified with, whose Pledge of Allegiance they recited every morning in school — and yet a country that sought to render them akin to ghosts the moment they became adults, making it impossible for most to seek a college education, work legally or have any official say in the political system.” Consigning young immigrants to illegitimacy makes no sense, Wides-Muñoz points out, because taxpayers invest about $130,000 to educate a given student, and can only recoup that investment when students go on to work legally and pay taxes themselves. “The Making of a Dream” is a sweeping chronicle of the immigrant rights movement in which the four walkers took part. The teenagers profiled by Wides-Muñoz refused to accept their parents’ ghostlike status, and instead evolved into some of the most politically engaged student leaders in the nation. Wides-Muñoz casts their fight as the latest chapter in the civil rights movement; as they planned their march, the Latino students from Miami read Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter From Birmingham Jail,” and selected a route that allowed them to visit important sites from the civil rights era. The young Dreamers wrestled with one question in particular: What should they ask of Barack Obama? Initially, the country’s first biracial president had signaled that he wanted to pass comprehensive reform, but then Wall Street melted down. After that, Obama became consumed by the raucous debate over health care. It had been thus for years. Early in George W. Bush’s presidency, the proposed legislation known as the Dream Act, which would have granted a path to citizenship to children who had been brought into the country without legal permission through no fault of their own, received promising support from key leaders like Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. But its first big hearing in Congress was slated for Sept. 12, 2001. After 9/11, the Dream Act sputtered, and Congress instead passed the Patriot Act, allocating more technology and personnel to domestic security, including surveillance along the borders. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump will issue a proclamation on Wednesday directing the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to work with governors to deploy National Guard troops to the southwest border to assist the Border Patrol in combating illegal immigration. “It’s time to act,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, as she outlined the policy during a White House briefing. In recent days, and in anticipation of an annual increase in numbers of people who attempt to cross the border, the Trump administration has been ramping up plans to block migrants and asylum seekers, including young unaccompanied children, from entering the United States. The announcement came a day after Mr. Trump said he wanted to send the military to the southwest border to guard against growing threats from unchecked immigration, suggesting he might want to use active-duty armed forces to do what immigration authorities cannot. “We are going to be guarding our border with our military,” Mr. Trump had said on Tuesday during a meeting with Baltic heads of state. “That’s a big step.” By Tuesday evening, the White House said Mr. Trump had been referring to mobilizing the National Guard, a step that previous presidents have taken to support border enforcement. “We do hope the deployment begins immediately,” Ms. Nielsen said. “We’re working with all haste.” The active-duty military is generally barred by law from carrying out domestic law enforcement functions, such as apprehending people at the border. Even so, previous presidents have deployed National Guard troops to act in support roles on the border with Mexico. President Barack Obama sent 1,200 in 2010 and President George W. Bush dispatched 6,000 in 2006. Governors of border states have done the same when faced with large inflows from the south. "
"A group that is suing Harvard University is demanding that it publicly release admissions data on hundreds of thousands of applicants, saying the records show a pattern of discrimination against Asian-Americans going back decades. The group was able to view the documents through its lawsuit, which was filed in 2014 and challenges Harvard’s admissions policies. The plaintiffs said in a letter to the court last week that the documents were so compelling that there was no need for a trial, and that they would ask the judge to rule summarily in their favor based on the documents alone. The plaintiffs also say that the public — which provides more than half a billion dollars a year in federal funding to Harvard — has a right to see the evidence that the judge will consider in her decision. Harvard counters that the documents are tantamount to trade secrets, and that even in the unlikely event that the judge agrees to decide the case without a trial, she is likely to use only a fraction of the evidence in her decision. Only that portion, the university says, should be released. “This is an important and closely watched civil rights case,” William S. Consovoy, the lawyer for the group, Students for Fair Admissions, said in his letter to the court. “The public has a right to know exactly what is going on at Harvard. Even if this were a commercial issue — as Harvard would like to portray it — the public would have a right to know if the product is defective or if a fraud is being perpetrated.” At stake in the dispute is the secrecy of the university admissions process, especially at elite institutions like Harvard that are competing for a small pool of highly qualified students, and whether and how race and ethnicity play a role.

Nasim Najafi Aghdam, who was in her late 30s and living in California, was a social media star in Iran. Known there as “Green Nasim,” she posted music parodies and workouts, promoted vegan cooking and opposed animal cruelty.

"JANESVILLE, Wis. — When dozens of high school students from across Wisconsin marched through his hometown, chanting his name and demanding new gun control laws, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, was not around to hear them, having just wrapped up a trip to the Czech Republic. But Randy Bryce was. Mr. Bryce, for those who don’t watch MSNBC, is better known by his Twitter handle, “Iron Stache” — a nod to his occupation (ironworker) and his thick horseshoe mustache. A Democrat, he has become a liberal media darling of sorts, as he seeks to do the unthinkable: unseat Mr. Ryan in Wisconsin’s First Congressional District this fall. But Mr. Bryce is not the only candidate hoping to dethrone a congressional king. Another Democrat, a schoolteacher named Cathy Myers, is also running for her party’s nomination. She is irked that national Democrats and progressives — including Senator Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate — have thrown their weight behind Mr. Bryce. And on the right, Republicans are confronting an embarrassing spectacle: A white nationalist and anti-Semite, Paul Nehlen, who lost to Mr. Ryan by 68 points in the 2016 Republican primary, is running again, this time flaunting his bigotry to gain a national following. His Twitter account was suspended in February after he used it to make racist comments about Meghan Markle, the fiancée of Prince Harry. “It’s a circus,” sighed Mark Graul, a seasoned Republican strategist here. “You can’t make this stuff up.” Mr. Ryan, meanwhile, has been coy about his intentions. After passing a landmark tax overhaul that fulfilled a career-long dream, he has not yet announced his candidacy for re-election, saying he will make a decision after consulting with his wife in the spring. That has prompted speculation that he will retire, which his aides have dismissed as nonsense. "
"The gender pay gaps detailed by British companies in recent months surprised almost no one — men are paid more than women, often by a wide margin, at the vast majority of businesses. But by making companies publicly air their salary information, Britain intends to force a reckoning. Officials in London hope the embarrassing revelations in the reports, which had to be submitted by Wednesday, will shame companies into doing more to close the divide. The push is one of a growing number of efforts among countries to promote the principle of equal pay. Australia recently mandated gender pay gap reporting for most companies. In Germany, a new law will require businesses with more than 500 employees to reveal their pay gaps. Nordic countries like Iceland have been even more aggressive, by making companies prove they are paying male and female staff equally. Proponents of the British effort argue that the increased transparency will lead to smaller gaps. Research by the accounting firm PwC predicts that if nothing is done, it could take nearly a century for the divide to close entirely across the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of rich countries that includes Britain. “This is a game-changer,” said Andrew Bazeley, a policy manager at the Fawcett Society, a British organization that campaigns for women’s rights and equality. “It will force businesses to think about the gender pay gap in ways they might not have before.” Under the new reporting requirements, companies with 250 or more employees must publish salary differences between men and women every year. They are also required to provide details on gaps in average bonuses paid, and the proportion of men and women who received those bonuses. "
"WASHINGTON — White House officials moved quickly on Wednesday to calm fears of a potential trade war with China, saying the administration’s proposed tariffs were a “threat” that would ultimately help, not hurt, the United States economy, hours after China said it would punish American products with similar levies. The administration’s insistence that a trade war was not imminent came as the United States and China traded tit-for-tat penalties that caused wild swings in stock markets from Hong Kong to New York. Led by more audacious leaders than either country has had in decades, China and the United States are now locked in a perilous game of chicken, with the possibility to derail the global economic recovery, disrupt international supply chains and destabilize the huge yet debt-laden Chinese economy. White House officials reiterated on Wednesday that China must stop the “unfair” trading practices President Trump believes have disadvantaged American companies and workers, but they held out the possibility that tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods outlined on Tuesday might never go into effect. “There’s no trade war here,” Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s new top economic adviser, said in an interview on Fox Business Network. He described the threat of tariffs as “just the first proposal” in a process that would involve negotiations and back-channel talks. “I understand the stock market’s anxiety,” he said. “But on the other hand, don’t overreact.” Behind the scenes, however, top officials remained split over the administration’s approach as the United States and China move into a period of high-stakes negotiations. That includes how far to go in punishing China and the types of concessions the White House should accept to avoid a protracted and damaging trade war. People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit — the gap between what China ships to the United States and what America ships in the other direction. Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance, arguing that these changes would do little to address the mercantilist and protectionist trade policies China has adopted for decades. "
"As I write this, China’s announcement of a new round of tit-for-tat tariffs has stoked fears of trade war and sent stock futures plunging. If this morning’s futures hold, the S&P 500 will be about 10.5 percent off its January peak, around 6 percent off its level when Gary Cohn, the last of the Trump “globalists,” was pushed out. My question is, why such a large fall? One good answer is, that’s a stupid question. The three rules you need to bear in mind when discussing the stock market are (1) the stock market is not the economy (2) the stock market is not the economy (3) the stock market is not the economy. And stocks move for all sorts of reasons, or no visible reason at all. As Paul Samuelson famously quipped, the market has forecast nine of the last five recessions. Another answer is that the trade war is a signal: Trump, Navarro et al are showing that they really are as unhinged and irresponsible as they seem, and markets are taking notice. Imagine how these people would handle a financial crisis. Still, I think it’s worth noting that even if we are headed for a full-scale trade war, conventional estimates of the costs of such a war don’t come anywhere near to 10 percent of GDP, or even 6 percent. In fact, it’s one of the dirty little secrets of international economics that standard estimates of the cost of protectionism, while not trivial, aren’t usually earthshaking either. Yet there is a reason why stock prices might overshoot the overall economic costs of a trade war. For a trade war that “deglobalized” the U.S. economy would require a big reallocation of resources, including capital. Yet you go to trade war with the capital you have, not the capital you’re eventually going to want – and stocks are claims on the capital we have now, not the capital we’ll need if America goes all in on Trumponomics. Or to put it another way, a trade war would produce a lot of stranded assets. First, about the costs of trade war. This is the wonkish part, so feel free to skim and don’t worry if it seems incomprehensible, as long as you’re willing to accept the bottom line for the sake of argument. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Decades later, the story of the civil rights movement can seem so tidy — so virtuous and inevitably victorious — that it loses some of its inspirational power. In its own day, though, the movement had much in common with today’s political struggles, over justice, democracy and equality: It involved more defeats than victories. It often felt contaminated by the grubbiness of partisan politics. And its leaders were human, which is to say that they were flawed and that they made many mistakes. Today, of course, is the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., killed in Memphis while he was supporting striking sanitation workers. King is now such a widely revered figure that many remembrances of him lack substance. But there are plenty of ways to celebrate what he actually stood for: not just moral clarity but also courage, toughness and resilience in the face of frequent setbacks and vicious criticism. You can read his final speech, delivered in Memphis the night before his death, or you can listen to it. Don’t settle for the usual quick outtakes. The famous lines — like “I’ve been to the mountaintop” — aren’t the only worthwhile ones. “Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination,” King said. “And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.” "
"Medicare officials have announced plans to crack down on prescriptions for opioids in an attempt to limit their use and thus their damage. But making it harder for people to get pain medication legally will most likely drive many to seek relief from far more dangerous and superpotent synthetic opioids. And they are surprisingly easy to obtain. Recently, out of curiosity, I typed into Google the terms “synthetic opioid and Chinese pharmacy.” Within minutes, I found a website where I could purchase the synthetic opioid carfentanil. For just $750, I could buy 100 grams of the drug, which would be shipped to me “overnight by discreet courier.” Carfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, another synthetic opioid that has already hit the streets, and 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. This drug is typically used to sedate large animals, like elephants. It is so dangerous that when veterinarians administer it, they wear gloves and face masks to avoid exposure. Fentanyl is scary enough. A dose of two milligrams — a few grains of the substance — can be fatal. But with carfentanil, 0.02 milligrams — hardly more than a speck of dust — could be enough to kill a person. That means that for $750, I could in theory purchase enough carfentanil for five million fatal overdoses. Americans are by far the largest consumers of the world’s natural and synthetic opioids, and 116 of us are dying every day as a result. Carfentanil could unleash a wave of mortality that would dwarf these numbers. "
"WASHINGTON — A witness who is cooperating in the special counsel investigation, George Nader, has connections to both the Persian Gulf states and Russia and may have information that links two important strands of the inquiry together, interviews and records show. Mr. Nader’s ties to the United Arab Emirates are well documented — he is an adviser to its leader — but the extent of his links to Russia had not been previously disclosed. Mr. Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman, has a catalog of international connections that paved the way for numerous meetings with White House officials that have drawn the attention of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. For example, Mr. Nader used his longstanding ties to Kirill Dmitriev, the manager of a state-run Russian investment fund, to help set up a meeting in the Seychelles between Mr. Dmitriev and a Trump adviser days before Donald J. Trump took office. Separately, investigators have asked witnesses about a meeting Mr. Nader attended in 2017 with a New York hedge fund manager, where he was joined by Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, who at the time were both senior advisers to Mr. Trump. The investigative trail even led Mr. Mueller’s team to stop an Australian entrepreneur with ties to the U.A.E. after he landed at a Washington-area airport, according to people briefed on the matter. The investigators questioned the entrepreneur about Mr. Nader, including Mr. Nader’s relationship with Russia and his contacts with Mr. Trump’s advisers, as well as the movement of money from the U.A.E. into the United States. Mr. Nader has received at least partial immunity for his cooperation, and it appears unlikely that Mr. Mueller is trying to build a case against him. Instead, it is common for prosecutors to interview as many people as possible to corroborate the testimony of a key witness like Mr. Nader. "

"MATÍAS ROMERO, Mexico — With a sarcastic half-smile, Nikolle Contreras, 27, surveyed her fellow members of the Central American caravan, which President Trump has called dangerous and has used as a justification to send troops to the border. More than 1,000 people, mostly women and children, waited patiently on Wednesday in the shade of trees and makeshift shelters in a rundown sports complex in this Mexican town, about 600 miles south of the border. They were tired, having slept and eaten poorly for more than a week. All were facing an uncertain future. “Imagine that!” said Ms. Contreras, a Honduran factory worker hoping to apply for asylum in the United States. “So many problems he has to solve and he gets involved with this caravan!” The migrants, most of them Hondurans, left the southern Mexican border city of Tapachula on March 25 and for days traveled north en masse — by foot, hitchhiking and on the tops of trains — as they fled violence and poverty in their homelands and sought a better life elsewhere. This sort of collective migration has become something of an annual event around Easter week, and a way for advocates to draw more attention to the plight of migrants. But this particular caravan caught the attention of Mr. Trump, apparently after he heard about it on Fox News. In a Twitter tirade that began Sunday, he conjured up hordes of dangerous migrants surging toward the border. He demanded that Mexican officials halt the group, suggesting that otherwise he would make them pay dearly in trade negotiations or aid cuts. "
"David D. Smith, the chairman of Sinclair Broadcast Group, says the media is getting his company all wrong. His remark, in a lengthy email exchange with The New York Times, came in response to renewed scrutiny of Sinclair after a video spread rapidly showing anchors at dozens of its stations across the country reciting the same speech about media bias. Mr. Smith defended the anchors’ segments, known as “must-runs,” and likened them to the late-night shows that networks air on their local affiliates. “Not that you would print it, but do you understand that every local TV station is required to ‘must run’ from its network their content, and they don’t own me,” he wrote on Tuesday. “That would be all their news programming and other shows such as late-night talk, which is just late-night political so-called comedy.” In the Sinclair-mandated segments, the anchors warned that some media outlets published fake stories. They also said they were “concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country.” “Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility,” the anchors added. “Now more than ever.” "
"WASHINGTON — A little over a year ago, when news surfaced of a Trump administration memo that proposed mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants at the southern border, a White House spokesman quickly denounced the reports as “irresponsible.” “That is 100 percent not true,” Sean Spicer, the press secretary at the time, told reporters aboard Air Force One. “There is no effort at all to round up, to utilize the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants.” At the Pentagon, where officials had greeted the news grimly, there were sighs of relief: Military leaders have long opposed sending National Guard troops to the border. “There is a significant opportunity cost,” said James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star admiral who commanded United States forces in Europe and Latin America and is now dean of The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, adding that troops sent to the border with Mexico — ostensibly an American ally — would “miss important training opportunities for their real primary mission — combat.” But the idea that Mr. Spicer called inconceivable a year ago is back in play. On Wednesday, White House officials said that President Trump planned to mobilize the National Guard to the southern border. The announcement came a day after Mr. Trump surprised some of his top advisers by saying that he wanted to send in the military to do what the immigration authorities, in his view, could not: secure the border from what he characterized as a growing threat of unauthorized immigrants, drugs and crime from Central America. Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said on Wednesday that her department and the Defense Department would work with governors to deploy the Guard to “assist the Border Patrol.” But beyond that, officials had few details about how many troops would go, when they would arrive or in what capacity they would serve. "
"In the escalating economic showdown between the United States and China, President Trump is trying to put American shoppers first. The administration did not place tariffs on necessities like shoes and clothes, and mostly spared smartphones from the 25 percent levy on Chinese goods announced this week. But by shielding consumers, Mr. Trump has put American manufacturers — a group he has championed — in the cross hairs of a potential global trade war. If the measures stand, along with China’s retaliatory tariffs, they could snuff out a manufacturing recovery just beginning to gain steam. “If you want to spare the consumer so you don’t get this massive backlash against your tariffs, then there goes manufacturing, because that’s what’s left,” said Monica de Bolle, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The irony is, you cannot spare manufacturing from anything because manufacturing is globally integrated. The sector sources its parts and components from all over the world.” That intricate supply chain often runs directly between the two countries, sometimes in both directions. Chinese factories make wing panels and doors for Boeing’s Next Generation 737 planes, which are assembled by union workers in Renton, Wash. General Motors makes its Buick Envision, a sport-utility vehicle, in Shandong Province, and sells it to American consumers. Construction workers in Denver use building materials manufactured in China, made in part from ethane gas produced in Texas. A central aim of Mr. Trump’s America First agenda is to bring back pieces of the supply chain lying outside the country. The tariffs announced this week are just a bargaining point in a broader negotiation between the United States and China over trade. “They are trying to force end-product manufacturers here to use more American content by making it more expensive for them to use Chinese content,” said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "
"President Trump escalated his verbal fusillade against immigrants this week by announcing a foolish plan to deploy troops along the Mexican border. Such a move has at best a tenuous basis in law and none in logic, and it will burn through federal funds better spent elsewhere. Mr. Trump has long stoked a xenophobic fear of newcomers among his political base. Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, he seems increasingly desperate to find ways to compensate for his failure to deliver on his promise to build a “big, beautiful” border wall on Mexico’s dime. On Sunday, Mr. Trump began a new round of confusing tweets and specious claims about undocumented immigrants. The president tweeted about “the big caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our ‘Weak Laws’ Border,” suggesting Central American hordes were converging upon the United States to take advantage of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. “Must pass tough laws and build the WALL,” another tweet read. “Democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime!” On Tuesday, he went further, declaring an urgent need for military forces on the border to confront this growing threat. He was expected to issue the order on Wednesday. It is a president’s duty to defend the country, and putting troops on the border is not unprecedented. Yet Mr. Trump’s move is not rooted in the reality of immigration in recent years. The number of people apprehended at the border plummeted from more than 1.6 million in 2000 to 310,000 last year, the lowest level since 1971. The main causes are slowed population growth, improved economic opportunities in Mexico and stronger American border security, the result of investment in thousands of guards, physical barriers and technology.

"WASHINGTON — Whether it is the Paris climate accord or the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has moved methodically to dismantle the foreign policy legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama. Except for Syria, on which Mr. Trump has faithfully echoed Mr. Obama’s hands-off policy. Mr. Trump’s statement on Tuesday — that “I want to bring our troops back home; I want to start rebuilding our nation” — underscored again how similarly he and Mr. Obama view the United States’ role in the overlapping conflicts in Syria. Both men have doubted the wisdom of a long-term American military commitment in the country. Both have complained that Saudi Arabia expects the United States to bear the burden of a costly war against President Bashar al-Assad. Both have viewed Syria primarily through the prism of combating the Islamic State. Though Mr. Trump’s aides made much of his order to fire Tomahawk missiles at Mr. Assad’s airfields last spring — an order that Mr. Obama famously refused to give four years earlier — it was the exception that proved the rule. Mr. Trump, a former senior adviser said, does not believe that Syria’s civil war is a vital national security interest of the United States. Neither did Mr. Obama, which is why he initially rebuffed proposals to funnel weapons to the rebels in Syria or to impose a no-fly zone over parts of the country. “Both men retreat from the idea of getting deeply involved in other countries’ civil wars,” said Robert S. Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria. “Both of them are instinctively more concerned about the American economy and things at home, even if they have very different visions of America.” "

"Last May, the private equity firm Blackstone announced that it was creating a $40 billion fund that would invest in infrastructure projects in the United States. The fund’s largest backer was the government of Saudi Arabia, which agreed to kick in half the cash. Ten months later, the highly anticipated fund has yet to complete an initial round of fund-raising, much less start investing in infrastructure. Although the Saudis promised to contribute up to $20 billion, Blackstone is required to raise a dollar from other investors for every dollar the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund puts in. So far, only two other investors have publicly committed to the fund, with their contributions totaling $575 million, according to data provider Preqin, which tracks such investments. In the short term, Blackstone’s goal now is to raise a total of $15 billion — much less than it trumpeted during President Trump’s visit to Riyadh last spring — according to a document posted on the website of a Pennsylvania pension plan that has agreed to invest in the fund. Facing hesitant investors, Blackstone has twice missed its own deadlines for completing the first round of fund-raising, according to people briefed on the plans and a timetable included in the Pennsylvania pension plan’s documents. Among the factors that have complicated the fund’s launch: Saudi officials told Blackstone last year that they wanted to create an investment committee — including one or more Saudi representatives — that would oversee the fund, according to four people briefed on the talks who weren’t authorized to discuss them publicly.

"WASHINGTON — It was the kind of story destined to take a dark turn through the conservative news media and grab President Trump’s attention: A vast horde of migrants was making its way through Mexico toward the United States, and no one was stopping them. “Mysterious group deploys ‘caravan’ of illegal aliens headed for U.S. border,” warned Frontpage Mag, a site run by David Horowitz, a conservative commentator. The Gateway Pundit, a website that was most recently in the news for spreading conspiracies about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., suggested the real reason the migrants were trying to enter the United States was to collect social welfare benefits. And as the president often does when immigration is at issue, he saw a reason for Americans to be afraid. “Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming,” a Twitter post from Mr. Trump read. The story of “the caravan” followed an arc similar to many events — whether real, embellished or entirely imagined — involving refugees and migrants that have roused intense suspicion and outrage on the right. The coverage tends to play on the fears that hiding among mass groups of immigrants are many criminals, vectors of disease and agents of terror. And often the president, who announced his candidacy by blaming Mexico for sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States, acts as an accelerant to the hysteria. The sensationalization of this story and others like it seems to serve a common purpose for Mr. Trump and other immigration hard-liners: to highlight the twin dangers of freely roving migrants — especially those from Muslim countries — and lax immigration laws that grant them easy entry into Western nations. "
"WASHINGTON — Facebook on Wednesday said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election — a figure far higher than the estimate of 50 million that had been widely cited since the leak was reported last month. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules. The European rules, which go into effect next month, give people more control over how companies use their digital data. Facebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, the firm connected to the Trump campaign. It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russian-backed actors to influence the 2016 presidential election. Among Facebook’s acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed “most” of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested. The new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks — including a rare question-and-answer session with Mr. Zuckerberg and reporters — came just before Mr. Zuckerberg’s expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill, where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users. Sheryl Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg’s top deputy, has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week. The company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica. "
"Settlement agreements between Bill O’Reilly and two of his accusers — made public for the first time on Wednesday — filled in previously unknown details about tactics employed by the former Fox News host to silence women who came forward with sexual harassment allegations against him. The documents show that two women who reached settlements, Andrea Mackris and Rebecca Gomez Diamond, were required to turn over all evidence, including audio recordings and diaries, to Mr. O’Reilly. In addition, Ms. Mackris was required to disclaim the materials “as counterfeit and forgeries” if they ever became public. The settlement with Ms. Mackris confirms a New York Times investigation that found a private investigator had been used to dig up information about her, with the agreement calling for the destruction of materials collected about her by Fox News’ private investigators, including Bo Dietl. The document also shows how her lawyers agreed to switch sides in the midst of the fight. Strict confidentiality was the goal of the settlements. If the women were found to breach the agreements, they would be forced to return all the money they had received, forfeit any future payments and pay Mr. O’Reilly’s legal fees. The settlement agreements were made public on Wednesday as part of the ongoing defamation lawsuit against Mr. O’Reilly and Fox News filed in December in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Ms. Mackris, Ms. Diamond and Rachel Witlieb Bernstein, who reached harassment settlements involving Mr. O’Reilly. There are six publicly known settlements involving Mr. O’Reilly, five for sexual harassment and one for verbal abuse, that total about $45 million. "
"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Jamie Dimon chafes under liquidity rules. • Mark Zuckerberg has disclosed more on how much Facebook user data may have been accessed. • The White House is still talking tough on trade with China. • Blackstone’s infrastructure fund isn’t doing so well. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. On Wall Street, there’s been a running parlor game about whether Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, would try to run for president in 2020. His annual letters, filled with commentary on U.S. policy, have only increased the chatter, and this year’s letter, released Thursday, is no different. It touches on everything from trade to immigration. While Mr. Dimon, who once called himself “barely a Democrat,” says he plans to stay at the bank for the next five years, the question among political prognosticators is whether Mr. Dimon’s policy views could ever find a home among voters in this politically polarized environment. Mr. Dimon’s sensible letter was seemingly supportive of some of President Trump’s policies, while taking the opposing side on others. Mr. Dimon particularly applauded the corporate tax cut and deregulation efforts. On China trade, Mr. Dimon writes: “It is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency,” and that “one of the administration’s best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked.” However, he said he would like to see more cooperation with U.S. allies on talks with China and added that the U.S. should “revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership.” On immigration, he called for tougher border control, writing, “American citizens have the right to complain that we have not successfully protected our borders since the last immigration reform in 1986.” He also said, “People immigrating to this country should be taught American history, our language and our principles.” At the same time, he also advocated for “a path to legal status and citizenship” for “Dreamers” and improving “merit-based immigration” programs so that immigrants educated here can stay. Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other. "
"MATÍAS ROMERO, Mexico — The caravan of Central American migrants that President Trump has portrayed as an emblem of flawed immigration policy in the United States began to splinter on Thursday, as hundreds of people departed this rural town aboard buses and on foot, abandoning the decrepit municipal sports complex where their journey had stalled for five nights. But the movement’s organizers insisted that the caravan would regroup in the Mexican city of Puebla in the next few days before continuing on to Mexico City, where it would officially end after meetings with government officials and possibly a street protest. Mr. Trump has been fixated on the caravan this week, making it a recurring motif in his tweets, warning that it represented a grave threat to the sovereignty of the United States, and using it as a justification for sending the military to reinforce the southwest border. On Thursday morning, he returned to the subject, declaring that the caravan had mostly dissipated, even though organizers estimated at the time that there were still some 800 migrants gathered at the sports complex. “The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border,” the president wrote on Twitter.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump denied on Thursday knowing of a $130,000 payment his lawyer made to a pornographic film actress who claims to have had a sexual encounter with him, an assertion that threatened to complicate his legal battle against her. Mr. Trump made his first public remarks about the matter aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington from White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., where he had held a round table on tax cuts. Asked by a reporter if he knew about the payment to the actress, Stormy Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, he said, “No.” Asked why Michael D. Cohen, his personal lawyer, had made the payment, Mr. Trump said: “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney, and you’ll have to ask Michael Cohen.” The president said he did not know where the money had come from, and ignored a question about whether he ever set up a fund Mr. Cohen could draw from. Ms. Clifford has said that she was paid $130,000 before the 2016 election to buy her silence. She is now suing Mr. Trump to abrogate a nondisclosure agreement that was supposed to prevent her from discussing the relationship. She claims the agreement is null and void because Mr. Trump never signed it. The president’s comments on Thursday could create a predicament for him and his legal team. Ms. Clifford’s case is based on the notion that the confidentiality agreement is invalid because Mr. Trump was not a party to it. By saying he was not aware of the agreement, Mr. Trump appeared to confirm that argument, which would mean neither party is legally bound by it, thus potentially paving the way for Ms. Clifford to break her silence without consequences.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • During five trips to Iraq, Times journalists scoured former offices of the Islamic State, gathering more than 15,000 pages of documents abandoned by the militants as their “caliphate” crumbled. We’ve just published the results of our yearlong investigation. It shows that ISIS, known for its brutality, was also effective at wielding power through paperwork. Here’s a closer look at some of the documents we collected, including tax collection forms, religious edicts and the will of a suicide bomber. We also have a new audio series, “Caliphate,” which follows our reporter Rukmini Callimachi as she covers the Islamic State and the fall of Mosul, Iraq. Listen to a preview here. • Separately, President Trump wants to bring home the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria. He dropped plans for an immediate withdrawal, but instructed military commanders to wrap up the mission within a few months. • The latest dispute between the U.S. and China has been defined by reciprocity, with each side announcing matching tariffs. But if things continue to escalate, Beijing will have less room to maneuver and could resort to more unconventional measures, our senior economics correspondent writes. "
"Officials from the Trump administration and the State of California, who have been negotiating behind the scenes on car emissions standards, are expected to reopen talks that could preserve rules targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency for elimination, according to people briefed on the talks. Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, announced this week that his agency would start the process of rolling back the federal standards, which are aimed at cutting tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming. He also demanded that California, which has vowed to stick to its own stricter standards, fall in line and follow Washington’s lead. That announcement raised the specter of a messy legal battle between the Trump administration and California, which has the legal authority to write its own air pollution rules and has threatened to sue to protect that authority. Though California’s authority is considered to be on solid legal footing, a protracted legal fight would raise the prospect of uncertainty and a domestic auto market split between the states that follow stricter emissions rules — California and 12 other coastal states that adhere to its standards — and the ones that would allow for dirtier cars. Officials and former officials with direct knowledge of the talks declined to be identified for this article, citing the sensitivity of ongoing negotiations. An E.P.A. spokeswoman, Liz Bowman, confirmed that the agency had “an ongoing dialogue with California” on emissions standards but declined to discuss details. Stanley Young, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, the state’s clean air regulator, declined to disclose the state of negotiations. But privately, officials from the Trump administration and California, along with representatives of major automakers, are searching for a compromise that could save a uniform set of standards for the entire country, according to a half-dozen people briefed on recent communications among the parties. One person close to the Trump administration said he considered communications with California as “active and ongoing.” "
"We now have a president whose actions are governed by emotions: envy, vanity, guilt, hatred and, chief among them, fear. Donald Trump seems to have become shaken by fear that his base might abandon him because of his inability to deliver on his signature promises, like the construction of a border wall between this country and Mexico. (Completely gone is the suggestion that Mexico would pay for this ridiculous boondoggle.) So he has been on a tear, resurrecting the even more nationalist, isolationist Trump of the campaign. He has pushed us to the teetering verge of a trade war, has suggested that we hasten withdrawal from Syria, has recommended that we send “the military” to the southern border and railed against caravans of brown people heading our way. To a large degree, he appears to be making policy from the podium, responding to the propaganda organ Fox News and bouncing ideas off a small circle of loyalists. His cabinet and the White House are left to respond to what Trump says on the fly and develop that into a quasi-coherent policy. This is no way to run a country, unless your intention is to run it into the ground. This is now the American quandary: The wheels of government are being forced to turn on the erratic whims of an egomaniac. "
"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, transformed this week what has appeared to be a weakness — his relative lack of independence — into a strength. Since he was appointed in May by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the scope of Mr. Mueller’s power has been intensely debated. President Trump’s allies have portrayed the special counsel as running amok as his focus expanded to the business dealings of Mr. Trump’s associates. The president’s critics have worried that Mr. Mueller is too vulnerable to potential Trump administration interference. The tension is familiar when the president comes under scrutiny by law enforcement, as the vast powers of the executive branch are at stake. Similar tensions cropped up during the Watergate, Iran-contra, Whitewater and Valerie Plame leak investigations. Now they have spurred the first significant legal fight arising from Mr. Mueller’s work, as Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, battles charges related to payments he received from a pro-Russia government in Ukraine. “Manafort’s fight over Mueller’s authority goes to a central question in our republic, going all the way back to Plato’s question, ‘Who guards the guardians?’” said Neal Katyal, a former Justice Department official who drafted its special counsel regulations in 1999. “The central debate is how much independence do you want, versus how much accountability for the prosecution. There needs to be a balance between these two competing goals.” Last month, Mr. Manafort asked Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss his indictment. Portraying Mr. Mueller as out of control, Mr. Manafort’s defense lawyers contended that criminal allegations arising from their client’s Ukraine dealings either exceeded the limits of the special counsel’s assigned jurisdiction or that Mr. Rosenstein had improperly given Mr. Mueller a “blank check” to prosecute anything. Mr. Manafort has also filed a  lawsuit making similar arguments. Mr. Mueller’s original assignment from Mr. Rosenstein was to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any links to Trump campaign officials, with the ambiguous addition of “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” "
"WASHINGTON — The United States military is spending about $1 million to help detain thousands of Islamic State fighters and their family members in makeshift camps run by Kurdish militias in northern Syria, pulling the Pentagon deeper into the war zone detention operations it has sought to avoid. The dilemma is unfolding even as President Trump has pledged to withdraw the 2,000 remaining United States troops in Syria, many of whom are vetting the most dangerous detainees, and suspend more than $200 million in State Department recovery funds for the country. Defense Department and Kurdish officials said several thousand detainees — including at least 400 fighters from more than three dozen countries and their families, as well as other Syrian militants — were being held in several camps. The American funding is paying to erect fencing, put bars on windows and otherwise secure schools and other buildings being used as temporary jails for fighters who were captured or surrendered after last year’s collapse of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital. Military officials insist American personnel are not strengthening the buildings or guarding the detainees themselves, just paying for it. Critics fear the facilities could become breeding grounds for extremists and repeat a key security miscue of the Iraq war. But without the American assistance, the camps lack sufficient security to prevent jailbreaks of battle-hardened militants who could reinvigorate pockets of Islamic State fighters near Abu Kamal, a town in eastern Syria along the Iraqi border. Syrian Kurdish officials said the camps were straining their capacity to oversee the dangerous fighters and rapidly depleting their budgets to pay for operations at the half-dozen sites in and around Raqqa. One senior American official said as many as 50 to 60 fighters were detained in a single room. "
"H. Fred Walker stood before his Edinboro University community on a recent snowy day and issued a warning. “We have been very insular in that we have not looked beyond the boundaries of Edinboro,” the college president told a group of staff and students who had gathered at a meeting in this town tucked away in Northwestern Pennsylvania to hear the details of the college’s strategic plan. “When we’re judged against our peers, it’s a punch in the eye for us.” While it was difficult for many in the room to hear, it was a reality years in the making for Edinboro, a four-year public university with an enrollment of about 6,000 students that is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. In the last decade, enrollment has plummeted, faculty salaries have caused expenses to skyrocket and completion rates have dissipated. No longer is the school’s most promising pipeline the average teenager going to college for the first time, but more likely the adult who may need to go back for a second or third. After 160 years as an anchor of rural Pennsylvania, the university is becoming obsolete. “There’s a reckoning that has to come,” Mr. Walker said in an interview in early March. For Mr. Walker, the reckoning came just a few weeks later. He resigned on March 27 after he enraged faculty and students with comments he made about his reform tactics to the The Chronicle of Higher Education. "
"If you’ve been watching stock markets, you’re probably feeling seasick. The Dow is crashing! No, it’s bouncing back! Wait, it’s crashing again! In general, trying to explain stock fluctuations is a mug’s game. But in this case it’s pretty clear what’s going on. Whenever investors suspect that Donald Trump will really go through with his threats of big tariff increases, provoking retaliation abroad, stocks plunge. Every time they decide it’s just theater, stocks recover. Markets really, really don’t like the idea of a trade war. So is a trade war coming? Nobody knows — even, or perhaps especially, Trump himself. For while trade is one of Trump’s two signature issues — animus toward dark-skinned people being the other — when it comes to making actual demands on other countries, the tweeter in chief and his aides either don’t know what they want or they want things that our trading partners can’t deliver. Not won’t — can’t. As a result, incoherence rules: The administration lashes out, then tries to calm markets by saying that it might not carry through on its threats, then makes a new round of threats. Let’s talk in particular about the will-he-or-won’t-he confrontation with China. In some ways, China really is a bad actor in the global economy. In particular, it has pretty much thumbed its nose at international rules on intellectual property rights, grabbing foreign technology without proper payment. And to be fair, Trump officials do sometimes raise the intellectual property issue as a justification for getting tough. But if getting China to pay what it owes for technology were the goal, you’d expect the U.S. both to make specific demands on that front and to adopt a strategy aimed at inducing China to meet those demands.

isa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska, is not known for her fiery speeches or public charisma; in interviews, she is sometimes so cautious that you can almost hear the strain of her self-editing. Murkowski is, however, exceptionally comfortable in one-on-one informal encounters, where she is skilled in the art of the folksy, quick connection. On Saturdays, she and her husband, Verne Martell, a well-liked former small-business owner, occasionally hit their local Anchorage Costco, which entails hours of active listening to constituents in the toilet-paper aisle (“Verne wants to slit his wrists,” reports Murkowski’s cousin Anne Gore). She spends less time than most senators sequestered in a private car, because 80 percent of her state can be reached only by flight. And because Murkowski never takes her upgrades on flights to and from Alaska (the optics of traveling in first class are terrible), she is forever mixing and mingling with her constituents on planes, not infrequently while in line for the bathroom. Murkowski was in just such a line, on a flight out of Wrangell, Alaska, on July 5, when one of her constituents, a 39-year-old financial adviser, looked up from her seat and recognized her. “Hi, Lisa,” she said. “I’m Kerri Willoughby. Do you remember me?” Murkowski said she did and greeted her warmly by name — “like a friend,” Willoughby said. Willoughby is a member of a group of liberal, activist women from Juneau who call themselves the ReSisters. In March 2017, the group published an open letter to Murkowski in The Alaska Dispatch News, laying at her feet their concerns about President Trump. The letter said they hoped the senator, “as a strong female leader,” would have their backs on reproductive choice, affordable health care and defending “the foundations of our democracy.” A few months later, Murkowski — who is more popular with women than men and is strong with moderates generally — met with the group to hear them out. By the time Willoughby and the senator crossed paths on the plane, several weeks after their first encounter, the vote on the new health care bill was imminent. The Republican Party had staked its reputation on its promise to roll back the Affordable Care Act and could afford to lose the votes of only two of the 52 Republican senators. (Vice President Mike Pence would provide the deciding vote in the case of a tie.) Senator Susan Collins of Maine had made it clear that she was a no; John McCain, Rand Paul and Murkowski had expressed reservations but not yet declared their decisions. On the plane, Willoughby took the opportunity to ask Murkowski what everyone wanted to know: “Have you decided which way you are going to vote on the health care bill?” Murkowski told Willoughby that the last bill she saw was “unpassable,” adding, “We have to get this right.” Willoughby left the flight feeling hopeful that Murkowski would not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Three weeks later, Murkowski did, in fact, cast one of the three decisive votes that killed the bill. One of Willoughby’s fellow ReSisters, Julie Nielsen, a fisheries biologist with a side passion for health care reform, was so happy that she put a bright pink sign in the window of her office overlooking one of the main shopping streets in Juneau. “Thank you Lisa!!” read the sign. In the middle of the “O” in “you,” she had drawn a big heart. "
"Until Thursday afternoon, there had been a reassuring sense of restrained, tit-for-tat reciprocity in the trade skirmish between the United States and China. But if this spirals into a bigger conflict between the world’s two biggest economies — something that seemed to become more likely Thursday evening with President Trump’s threat to add $100 billion more in tariffs — it’s worth keeping something in mind: In a trade war, the usual rules of commerce may not apply. That is doubly true in a potential trade war with China, for several reasons. Because the country exports far more in goods to the United States than it imports, China simply doesn’t have as much room to keep up with escalating American tariffs, especially given the Chinese government’s desire to cushion its citizens from higher prices for food staples. Moreover, China has in the past proved willing to use a wide range of government powers to achieve commercial objectives — from campaigns against out-of-favor companies in state media to selective, stepped-up regulatory enforcement. And if things really get nasty, the United States and China are financially intertwined in ways that China could seek to exploit — though not without creating risks for a country holding $1.2 trillion in United States Treasury bonds. “One of the very important tools that the Chinese have is the ability to make life difficult for a large number of American businesses,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who studies Chinese economic relations. “They have all of these unconventional weapons that are not covered by traditional trading rules that could be potent weapons in actually fighting a trade war.” The details of what China might do are speculative. Thus far, China’s government has reacted to new tariff actions by the Trump administration with relatively restrained words and promises of proportional responses to the American government’s actions.

"LONDON — Nicole Grobert is German, but she has spent almost all of her career in Britain, developing tiny nanomaterials and figuring out how to use them in everything from artificial bones to super-efficient batteries. Young scientists have an unusual degree of autonomy here, she has found, and European Union funds enabled her to build her own research group at the University of Oxford. These days, though, Dr. Grobert says her future at Oxford looks cloudier than it used to. Since Britain voted to quit the union, she has been getting calls from universities on the Continent, and farther abroad, gauging her interest in a new job. For now, she is staying put, but if grants grow scarce or immigration rules create new hassles, she is ready to move. “I came with a suitcase,” Dr. Grobert said. “I can grab that suitcase and go.” For decades, the European Union has provided a collaborative, cross-border framework in which British universities have grown and thrived. European grants fund research like Dr. Grobert’s and nurture the international back-and-forth crucial to scholarly work in disciplines from archaeology to economics. Free movement within the bloc has meant faculty from other European nations can live and work in Britain visa-free, and students from elsewhere in the union pay the same tuition as Britons. Now, university administrators are watching anxiously as negotiations between London and Brussels lurch along, with little clarity about how drastically ties may change after the divorce, known as Brexit, which is expected next March. Last month, negotiators announced a 21-month transition period, which may postpone the biggest shifts, but like everything about Brexit, it remains subject to change. “This is the single biggest challenge to our universities, in the same way it is the single biggest challenge to our nation, since the Second World War,” said Alastair Buchan, Oxford’s head of Brexit strategy.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Following the paper trail of ISIS, railing against Emmanuel Macron and relaxing with monkeys. Here’s the latest: • The ISIS files. On five trips to battle-scarred Iraq, New York Times journalists scoured old Islamic State offices in 11 cities and towns, gathering thousands of documents abandoned by the militants as their “caliphate” crumbled. Following a paper trail that led through booby-trapped streets near the front lines of battle, they found suicide bomber forms, birth certificates, tax records, school books teaching English words like “gun” and “martyr,” and papers from the Ministry of War Spoils. (Here’s a closer look at the documents.) The records reveal how the terrorist group combined brutality and paperwork to wield power over territory that at one point was the size of Britain, with a population estimated at 12 million people. Above, papers littered a room in the bombed-out remnants of the Directorate of Agriculture in Mosul, Iraq, last September. _____ "
"NEW DELHI — India’s defense minister is visiting Moscow this week to finalize the purchase of a Russian missile defense system, Indian officials say, in a weapons deal that would violate American sanctions against Russia. The potential $6 billion deal comes at a time when the Trump administration is both weighing more extensive sanctions against Russia and trying to forge a military alliance with India. Indian officials say the agreement could be finalized as soon as this week, with India purchasing five S-400 Triumf systems, an antiaircraft missile array that can also intercept missiles. If the purchase goes through, the Trump administration would have to choose between punishing India for violating the sanctions or granting an exemption to avoid souring the relationship. The United States has been trying to cultivate India as a strategic ally and a hedge against Chinese military expansion. Washington has typically dangled defense deals as a way to improve military ties with countries, and it has courted India aggressively. Lockheed Martin offered last summer to move the production of F-16 fighter jets from Texas to India if India agreed to buy the plane. “In the past few years you’ve seen a massive transition where more equipment is being bought from the U.S. That’s because the U.S. wants a closer relationship with India, and defense deals are essentially diplomatic deals,” said Shailesh Kumar, the Asia director of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm.

"WASHINGTON — At least five officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, four of them high-ranking, were reassigned or demoted, or requested new jobs in the past year after they raised concerns about the spending and management of the agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt. The concerns included unusually large spending on office furniture and first-class travel, as well as certain demands by Mr. Pruitt for security coverage, such as requests for a bulletproof vehicle and an expanded 20-person protective detail, according to people who worked for or with the E.P.A. and have direct knowledge of the situation. Mr. Pruitt bristled when the officials — four career E.P.A. employees and one Trump administration political appointee — confronted him, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The political appointee, Kevin Chmielewski, was placed on administrative leave without pay, according to two of the people with knowledge of the situation. Mr. Chmielewski was among the first employees of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, serving as a senior advance official. The two people, who are administration officials, said that Mr. Chmielewski flagged some of his concerns about Mr. Pruitt directly to the White House’s presidential personnel office. Two of the career officials, Reginald E. Allen and Eric Weese, were moved to jobs where they had less say in spending decisions and less interaction with Mr. Pruitt, the people said. A third career official, John E. Reeder, joined American University as a temporary “executive in residence” after being told by the E.P.A. to find a new job. And John C. Martin, who served on the security detail, was also removed from the team and had his gun and badge taken away after raising concerns about how Mr. Pruitt’s security was being handled. A sixth official, Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, also raised questions about Mr. Pruitt’s spending, according to three E.P.A. officials. He remains in his job but is considering resigning, agency officials said. Mr. Jackson came to the agency from the office of Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who like Mr. Pruitt had been a major critic of regulatory moves made under President Barack Obama, and is a prominent climate change skeptic. "

"WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — President Trump dispensed on Thursday with what he called a “boring” speech on tax reform here, tossing his text to his fans before launching into a lengthy tirade against immigration that included an accusation that Democrats were embracing dangerous policies to secure immigrant votes. Mr. Trump traveled to West Virginia to promote his $1.5 trillion tax overhaul before a friendly audience. But the president grew tired of his prepared remarks after a few moments and returned to the bitter complaints about the United States’ immigration laws that have dominated his attention this week and prompted him on Wednesday to ask governors to deploy the National Guard to the southern border. “This was going to be my remarks — it would have taken about two minutes, but what the hell — that would have been a little boring,” Mr. Trump said, tossing a sheet of paper covered with neat paragraphs of text into the audience. “I’m reading off the first paragraph, I said, ‘This is boring.’ Come on. We have to tell it like it is.” Instead, he recounted the terrorist attack last October in Lower Manhattan, in which an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people when he drove a truck onto a pedestrian and bicycle path on the West Side Highway. “This is what the Democrats are doing to you, and they like it because they think they’re going to vote Democrat,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re doing it for that reason, and other reasons.” The president later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he intended to deploy 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops to the border with Mexico. If Mr. Trump sends the low end of his proposal, it would barely exceed the 1,200 sent by President Barack Obama in 2010 to support other border agencies. Even if Mr. Trump sends 4,000, the top end of his proposal, he would be dispatching fewer than President George W. Bush did in 2006. "
"Chelsea Handler, the comedian and author, spoke forcefully about women, power, privilege and politics on Thursday night, calling the sexual harassment revelations and outrage that have emerged as part of the #MeToo movement “a complete referendum on Donald Trump being elected to the presidency.” In an interview at Syracuse University with Megan Twohey of The New York Times, Ms. Handler spoke candidly about her personal experience breaking into Hollywood, how it shaped her perspective and her more recent decision to take up activism to promote women’s voices. The interview was part of a live conversation series called “Get With The Times,” which aims to inspire students to get involved in issues that matter to them. Early in their conversation, Ms. Twohey, one of the reporters who last fall broke the news of Harvey Weinstein’s decades of alleged sexual harassment of women, asked Ms. Handler whether she had been sexually harassed. Ms. Handler, 43, said she had not, but emphasized that it was important for people to recognize that the harassment is happening and that it’s everyone’s problem. “Seventeen million women across the world have been sexually assaulted,” she said. “It’s all over the place. So to ignore it is to live in a lane and be delusional about your own experience.” Here are some other takeaways. Watch the full conversation here. Ms. Handler noted that while more than half of white women who voted cast their ballots for Mr. Trump, more than 90 percent of black women did not. "
"In 1994, Newt Gingrich, brandishing his Contract with America, led a Republican revolution that swept aside Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate, initiating an epoch of conservative ascendancy that lingers on. Don Sipple, a Republican campaign consultant, declared at the time that the 1994 midterms pitted a Republican Party calling for “discipline” against a Democratic Party focused on “therapy.” Two years later, George Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at Berkeley, published “Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think,” which argued that Several approaches to contemporary politics echo the insights of Sipple and Lakoff. The crucial word now, however, is authoritarianism. The election of Donald Trump — built as it was on several long-term trends that converged in 2016 — has created an authoritarian moment. This somewhat surprising development is the subject of “Remaking Partisan Politics through Authoritarian Sorting,” a forthcoming book by the political scientists Christopher Federico, Stanley Feldman and Christopher Weber, who argue that The three authors use a long-established authoritarian scale — based on four survey questions about which childhood traits parents would like to see in their offspring — that asks voters to choose between independence or respect for their elders; curiosity or good manners; self-reliance or obedience; and being considerate or well-behaved. Those respondents who choose respect for elders, good manners, obedience and being well-behaved are rated more authoritarian. The authors found that in 1992, 62 percent of white voters who ranked highest on the authoritarian scale supported George H.W. Bush. In 2016, 86 percent of the most authoritarian white voters backed Trump, an increase of 24 percentage points. Federico, Feldman and Weber conclude that Last year, Federico, writing with Christopher Johnston of Duke and Howard G. Lavine of the University of Minnesota, published “Open versus Closed: Personality, Identity, and the Politics of Redistribution,” which also explores the concept of authoritarian voting. In an email, Johnston summarized some of their findings: Johnston notes that personality traits like closed mindedness, along with aversion to change and discomfort with diversity, are linked to authoritarianism: Johnston addresses class differences in voting patterns and also differences stemming from the level of a voter’s interest in politics: In their book, Johnston, Lavine and Federico reinforce this point: The revived interest in authoritarianism in politics began well before anyone seriously considered the possibility of a Trump candidacy — except, apparently, Trump himself.

"In the cheerily sterile, fitfully funny comedy “Blockers,” parents conspire to save the virginity of their daughters, high school seniors planning a collective deflowering (not, it should be said, with one another). That is the movie’s big joke, and while it sounds positively antediluvian it also brings to mind news reports that the Trump administration plans to introduce abstinence-only education this summer. According to the website The Hill, the idea is to emphasize “sexual delay,” which sounds like the title of a song that Marvin Gaye never recorded. The world has a way of killing the mood, if you let it. Thinking too hard and long about a would-be laugh-in like “Blockers” isn’t usually the best idea, of course. The point is to sit back and enjoy it, no matter how sporadic or familiar the jokes. That’s the case with the lighthearted, eager-to-please “Blockers,” which features an innocuously pleasant cast of middle-age professional goofballs and a rather less-funny collection of dewy young cuties. As expected, while the daughters and their dates frolic, the parents regress. They yell, fall, run in circles, and flap their hands and mouths. One also partakes in an inadvisable practice you can learn about by typing the words alcohol enema in your browser. The parents, Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter (Leslie Mann, John Cena and best in show, Ike Barinholtz), have done a bang-up job with their kids. Their three high school daughters, lifelong friends, are smart, social, happy, healthy and dull. Because they’re exceedingly, grindingly average, they hatch up a plan to have sex with three boys on prom night. And because the screenwriters Brian Kehoe and James Kehoe haven’t worked nearly as hard as they should have, Lisa’s daughter, Julie (Kathryn Newton), leaves her laptop vulnerable to parental prying. Enter Lisa, Mitchell and Hunter, who, after breaking the teenage emoji code in one of the movie’s cleverer bits, plot and deploy. High jinks and slapstick ensue. "
"WASHINGTON — A spreading crisis has threatened to engulf Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, who until recently ranked among the stars of the Trump administration. Now, he is mired in a series of ethical questions about his housing arrangements, staffing decisions and costly travel at taxpayer expense. Senior White House officials say that Mr. Pruitt’s fate has become uncertain. On Thursday, one of the central questions facing the E.P.A. chief — his decision in 2017 to rent a room in Washington from the wife of a top energy lobbyist — was exacerbated when an E.P.A. ethics official walked back his earlier assessment that Mr. Pruitt had done nothing wrong. In a new memo made public Thursday, the official said that he did not have all the facts when he made his initial finding. On Wednesday one of Mr. Pruitt’s top advisers, Samantha Dravis, resigned and Mr. Pruitt’s chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, has grown frustrated enough that he has also considered resigning, according to three people in whom Mr. Jackson has confided. Most ominously for Mr. Pruitt, however, senior White House officials signaled Thursday that the E.P.A. chief’s standing was shaky. “I can’t speak to the future of Scott Pruitt,” said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, on Fox News on Thursday morning. It added up to a major crisis for a cabinet member who, despite months of criticism over costly first-class travel and other practices, had aggressively helped the otherwise tumultuous Trump administration achieve one of its central goals — the rapid rollback of regulations covering climate change, clean water and the use of chemical pesticides. In recent days, even as controversy swirled, Mr. Pruitt launched a rollback of the Obama administration’s stringent regulations on planet-warming vehicle tailpipe pollution. "
"A Virginia woman who lost her job with a government contractor after she was photographed extending her middle finger at President Trump’s motorcade last year has sued her former employer for wrongful termination. Juli Briskman directed the gesture toward a string of black sport utility vehicles that zoomed by her on her bicycle on Oct. 28, as Mr. Trump’s motorcade was leaving Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Va. Reporters and photographers in a car behind her captured the moment, which quickly spread online and became a source of many jokes on late-night television. But Ms. Briskman’s employer, Akima L.L.C., did not find it funny. When she returned to work the following week, she said, company executives told her she needed to resign. Ms. Briskman, 50, had violated the company’s social media policy on obscenity by sharing the image on Facebook and Twitter, they told her, according to the lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia. The executives also feared blowback from the Trump administration, Ms. Briskman said the executives told her. “I was fired from my job because my employer feared unconstitutional retaliation,” Ms. Briskman said Thursday afternoon. “But on a larger scale, I feel that our democracy is being threatened.” Her lawyers assert that Ms. Briskman’s gesture was “core political speech” protected by Virginia law and the Constitution. She is seeking $2,692 for two weeks of severance she said she was promised but never received, as well as compensation for legal fees. "
"BEIJING — China’s leaders sound supremely confident that they can win a trade war with President Trump. The state news media has depicted him as a reckless bully intent on undermining the global trading system, while presenting the Chinese government as a fair-minded champion of free trade. And China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has used the standoff to reinforce the Communist Party’s message that the United States is determined to stop China’s rise — but that it no longer can. China is already too strong, its economy too big. “China is not afraid of a trade war,” the vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, declared at a news conference to discuss possible countermeasures. More than once, he cited the history of the “new China” — which began its extraordinary economic revival four decades ago — as evidence that it would “never succumb to external pressure.” Missing in the bluster and the propaganda are the questionable methods that China has adopted to squeeze foreign companies out of key technology markets — and the fact that in the cold-eyed calculus of economics, China is more vulnerable to a trade war than officials admit. Exports account for a big share of Chinese economic growth. Because the United States buys so much from China, Washington has many more ways to hit Chinese manufacturers. By contrast, the retaliatory tariffs Beijing has proposed already cover more than one-third of what China buys from the United States, leaving it fewer options to strike back. In the political realm, however, Mr. Xi enjoys advantages that may allow him to cope with the economic fallout far better than Mr. Trump can. His authoritarian grip on the news media and the party means there is little room for criticism of his policies, even as Mr. Trump must contend with complaints from American companies and consumers before important midterm elections in November.

"WASHINGTON — The United States Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, issued a national advisory Thursday urging more Americans to keep on hand and learn how to use the drug naloxone, which can save the lives of people overdosing on opioids. Naloxone has already revived thousands of overdose victims as the opioid epidemic has intensified, but rescue workers have usually been the ones to administer it. It was the first advisory issued by a surgeon general since 2005, and it underscored the urgency of addressing an opioid epidemic that has killed more than 250,000 people over the past decade, including more than 42,000 people in 2016. Dr. Adams said making naloxone more available in communities across the country is critical to reducing overdose deaths among people prescribed high doses of opioids for pain, as well as those who abuse painkillers or illicit opioids like fentanyl and heroin. “Each day we lose 115 Americans to an opioid overdose — that’s one person every 12.5 minutes,” Dr. Adams said in a statement. “It is time to make sure more people have access to this lifesaving medication, because 77 percent of opioid overdose deaths occur outside of a medical setting and more than half occur at home.” Naloxone can be administered through a nasal mist or an injection, suspending the effects of an overdose and resuscitating the victim. Many police officers and emergency medical technicians already carry the drug, and most states and many cities have issued standing orders allowing anyone to get naloxone at a pharmacy without a prescription. Most insurance plans cover it, and people can sometimes get it for free or low cost through public health programs or manufacturer discounts. Dr. Adams, who is scheduled to speak on Thursday at a conference in Atlanta, emphasized in the advisory that more opioid users, as well as their families and friends and anyone who regularly comes into contact with them, should carry naloxone.

"Dr. Ellen Stofan, the former chief scientist at NASA, will become the first woman to lead the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian Institution announced on Thursday. At NASA, Dr. Stofan, who has a background in geology, was a top adviser to Charles F. Bolden Jr., then the administrator for the department, where she helped lead in the development of a long-term plan to get humans to Mars. “Ellen’s scientific background, leadership skills, communication acumen and strategic thinking have positioned her superbly to lead the National Air and Space Museum,” David Skorton, the director of the Smithsonian Institution, said in a statement. “Her passion for science coupled with her love of education will ensure that the museum will continue to be a global treasure and world leader through its extensive programming, exhibitions and scholarship.” Space has been a part of Dr. Stofan’s life for almost its entirety. Her father was a NASA rocket scientist and at the age of 4 she attended her first rocket launch at Cape Canaveral, an event that spurred her own career. “It is an incredible honor to join the National Air and Space Museum family at this important point in the museum’s history,” Dr. Stofan said. “Space and aviation inspire our next generation of explorers, and there is no better place to experience this than at our museums on the Mall and at the Udvar-Hazy Center.” Dr. Stofan joins the museum at a time when interest in space interest might be climbing. In the new budget recently passed by Congress and signed by President Donald J. Trump, NASA was a big winner, to the tune of a $1 billion increase. She will be overseeing an institution with more than 300 full time employees and a budget of $48 million, 70 percent of which comes from federal appropriations. "
"President Trump has railed repeatedly against the Senate filibuster as a major reason that many of his policy priorities have flopped. Monday, raging about the Mexico border, he tweeted that “Congress must immediately pass border legislation, use nuclear option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people.” He’s not alone. Restive House members have also blamed Senate rules for the party’s thin legislative record under the first year of unified Republican control in Washington since 2006. As Representative Chris Collins of New York said, “Let’s be done with that archaic nonsense rule, once and for all.” Representative Darrell Issa of California went even further: “I regret the very existence of the Senate.” There are certainly bills that have been killed by Democratic filibusters in this Congress — just as there was legislation torpedoed by Republican obstruction during the Obama administration. The need to overcome a filibuster in the Senate on spending bills, and the influence that gives Democrats, was a primary cause of the protracted budget conflict that produced a brief government shutdown in January. But the greater cause of many Republican headaches is substantive divisions within the party. Democrats’ leverage on spending bills has been enhanced by the fact that a bloc of Republicans, especially in the House, generally refuse to support large, omnibus packages like the one Congress passed last month. And on issues where Republicans are capable of legislating without Democratic involvement, disagreements about how to proceed have been the major obstacle. The failed effort to repeal Obamacare using a legislative process that did not require overcoming a filibuster threat stands as the clearest casualty of Republican divisions, but it is not the only one. Consider the budget measure, passed by the House and Senate last fall, which provided the framework for what would become Republicans’ tax cut package. Some House Republicans pushed for a budget resolution that would have allowed them to pursue — on a party-line basis — significant cuts to the social safety net. Disagreements among House Republicans led them to scale back the initial plan, and eventually they abandoned it altogether for a tax-cuts-focused approach advocated by their Senate colleagues. "
"Sally Q. Yates spent nearly three decades in the Justice Department, rising to become acting attorney general before President Trump fired her last year for refusing to defend his travel ban. In a conversation in Washington on Tuesday with the reporter Matt Apuzzo of The New York Times, Ms. Yates discussed issues ranging from the wiretapping of a Trump campaign adviser to the president’s interference in criminal investigations. Here are the takeaways. Ms. Yates returned frequently to the difference between public policy and fundamental principles. “Elections have consequences, and I think you have to expect in a change in administrations, a change in party, that there are going to be policy decisions that are made that you don’t think are a good idea,” she said. “What worries me more than any of that is the relentless attack on democratic institutions and norms, and the impact that that can have on our country not just during the term of a Trump presidency, but in the years to come as well.” On issues like criminal justice (she supports lesser sentences for nonviolent drug offenders; the Trump administration doesn’t) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (she believes its prohibition on sex-based discrimination extends to gender identity; the Trump administration doesn’t), she gave her opinions but offered only mild criticism of Mr. Trump’s course. But when it came to the president’s penchants for pressuring the Justice Department, questioning the legitimacy of judges and attacking the news media, Ms. Yates did not hold back. His interference with the Justice Department — she declined to say whether it constituted obstruction — is especially worrisome, she said. "
"Since the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the March for Our Lives, the emergence of Emma González, a senior at the school, as a national face of gun control activism has drawn much attention for her role as a founder of #NeverAgain and for her views on social media strategy — and for her now famously shaven head. To many outside eyes, her hair (or lack of it) has become the symbol of her refusal to accept the status quo, her refusal to simply sit back and leave change to the establishment. So much so that The New Yorker recently published an article comparing her to Joan of Arc, as depicted in the 1928 film by Carl Theodor Dreyer: another young woman with a genius for inspiring leadership, a deeply felt belief system and “brutally close-cropped hair.” No matter that, as the essay’s author acknowledges, a few weeks before the shooting Ms. González had declared, on her school’s Instagram account, that “I decided to cut my hair because it was a pain in the neck, if you’ll forgive the pun. It was really hot all the time; it was very cumbersome and very heavy, leading to a lot of headaches. It was expensive to keep it up, and as prom time came around, I figured it would be cheaper to not have to worry about doing my hair.” Her original motivation has become shrouded in her advocacy, and in the eyes of the watching world, her head has taken on its own meaning, representative of our failure, of her renunciation. If, a few years ago, it seemed possible that with the advent of models like Ruth Bell and Kris Gottschalk, buzz cuts on women could be viewed as representations of “quirky beauty” and celebrated all over the East Village and beyond, the reaction to Ms. González’s hair has made it clear that we were deluded. "
"Why was this Passover Seder different from all other Passover Seders? Well, for one, it took place on Monday night, the fourth night of the holiday and not one on which the traditional dinner is called for. But that’s showbiz: Some of the 100 guests, and most of the evening’s performers, were Broadway actors, composers, producers — and Mondays are when Broadway theaters are dark, meaning casts and crews are available for socializing. It took place in a large downtown apartment in a prewar building, decorated with billowing scarves, bright pillows and hanging palm branches to replicate a Bedouin tent. The usual holiday prayers and songs, which commemorate the biblical exodus of Jews from slavery, were replaced by a high-caliber revue of poetic and musical performances from stars of some of the biggest current Broadway shows, including “Hamilton,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Frozen.” The story of exodus that was told over the course of the night was not of Moses and the ancient Jews’ sojourn eastward across the Red Sea, but of a man named Mohammed Al Samawi, who escaped a near-certain death in his home country, Yemen, by traveling westward over the Red Sea on what happened to be the second night of Passover in 2015. “Unleavened,” as this night was billed, was organized by Adam Kantor, an actor appearing in “The Band’s Visit”; Benj Pasek, the lyricist of “La La Land,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “The Greatest Showman”; and four other friends, all of whom are interested in contemporizing Judaism and making it relevant in an increasingly secularized climate.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and California are fighting a furious multifront legal war, and every week seems to bring a new courtroom battle. “It’s bloody combat,” said Jessica Levinson, who teaches at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “This isn’t a cold war. It’s a scorching hot war. And that’s politically expedient for both sides.” The state has filed 29 lawsuits against the federal government since President Trump took office, on issues including immigration, the environment and voting rights. “Government by litigation isn’t what the American people voted for,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Monday, “and attempting to thwart an administration’s elected agenda through endless, meritless lawsuits is a dangerous precedent.” That same day, Mr. Sessions filed suit against the state, accusing it of interfering with the sale of federal lands. It followed a separate suit last month to block three state laws that sought to protect unauthorized immigrants. Clashes between states and the federal government are nothing new, said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. "
"UNITED NATIONS — Solar panels are everywhere: perched on thatched roofs in rural Kenya, helping Indian farmers pump groundwater for their fields, and powering United States military bases. Solar power accounted for more than a third of all net new power capacity added worldwide in 2017, a larger share than any other new source, the United Nations Environment Program said in a report issued Thursday.  And solar power is becoming much more affordable.  The cost of electricity from large-scale solar projects has dropped by 72 percent since 2009, according to the study.   But even as solar and its renewable energy cousins — like wind, biomass and geothermal power; but not counting big hydropower projects —  expand, they still account for barely 12 percent of all the electricity that the world consumes. The greatest share still comes from fossil fuels like coal, and more coal-fired power plants continue to be built, contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that have warmed the planet to dangerous levels. “This shows where we are heading,” said Nils Stieglitz, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, which produced the report along with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The fact that renewables altogether are still far from providing the majority of electricity means that we still have a long way to go.” The world leader in investing in renewables, by far, is China. The country accounted for nearly half of all renewable energy investments worldwide, pumping $86.5 billion into solar energy alone in 2017 in what the report described as “an extraordinary solar boom.” China has cut back significantly on coal at home, though it has continued to fund and build coal-fired power plants abroad. One of the most closely watched is a proposed plant on the coast of Kenya, near the ancient island town of Lamu, a Unesco world heritage site. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Gavin Newsom is the lieutenant governor, a former San Francisco mayor and a leading Democrat to replace Gov. Jerry Brown. California Today has been doing occasional question-and-answer sessions with candidates for office. Today’s interview with Mr. Newsom, edited and condensed for clarity, was conducted for our article on the race. Q. Were there things Jerry Brown did you would continue? A. Oh, the “one that gets me in trouble” question. Brown’s perfect. (Laughs) Look — he’s done an extraordinary job. It’s important to remind folks where we were seven years ago: 12.4 percent unemployment, $27 billion budget deficit. Now we are having a raging debate about the size of the surplus. This state has turned a corner. Q. What has not gone right? A. We’re not all rowing in the same direction. We are the richest and the poorest state. Eight million living below the poverty line, 40 percent of our kids at or near the poverty line. Inequality is the issue that is going to define a good part of my tenure. To say it happened on our watch is accurate. Q. Has the governor paid enough attention to homelessness? A. He has on the margins. But have we designed a framework to regionalize solutions and to have the state drive the effort? No. And I intend to do that. We have never had a governor particularly animated by homelessness. Q. Do you support the proposal by Senator Scott Wiener to override local zoning and permit construction of eight-story housing near transit lines? A. I told him point blank, “I would not sign this bill, but I love what you are doing. How can I help?” No sooner than did we have that conversation than he’s already made substantive amendments, on rent control protection. He realizes one size does not fit all. The spirit of what he is doing is right. "
"On Sunday, Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party will likely cruise to another victory in Hungary’s general election, giving Mr. Orban, the reigning champion of “illiberal democracy” — a term he proudly embraces — a fourth term to pursue his assault on democratic institutions, immigrants, the European Union and anything smacking of social change. The campaign has been surprisingly tough, but then Fidesz designed the voting system and controls much of the media. A victory will no doubt hearten the ranks of the nativist populists who, despite their avowed aversion to international organizations, take pride in being in the vanguard of an international reactionary movement. It is telling that after his ouster from the White House, Stephen Bannon went on a tour of European soul mates, during which he hailed Mr. Orban as his hero and “the most significant guy on the scene right now.” A report by The Times’s Patrick Kingsley on how Mr. Orban reached that august status offers a chilling look at the breadth of the populist assault not only on the “hardware” of democracy — constitution, judiciary, the electoral system — but also the software: the culture, civil society, education system and religious organizations. Fidesz (founded in 1988 as the Hungarian Alliance of Young Democrats) has actively pushed a narrative of Hungarian victimhood and ethnocentrism in schools, theaters and universities while vilifying any opposing viewpoint, and especially pro-democracy organizations funded by George Soros, the Hungarian-American billionaire who has become something of a whipping boy for the far right throughout Central Europe. Mr. Orban’s defenders say people support him not for his populism but for his handling of the economy. Government debt and the budget deficit are down, the country’s credit rating is up, growth has almost quadrupled since 2010. What these figures do not show, though, is that many of these improvements have come through membership in the European Union, which Mr. Orban assails at every opportunity. At the same time, according to the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators, corruption has risen significantly under Mr. Orban. With national variations, Mr. Orban’s Hungary has been the template for the “authoritarianization” — the term some experts use — in Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s Poland, Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, Vladimir Putin’s Russia and in other democracies where populism has made headway. The United States may not fit into the same pattern, but like the others, President Trump came to power by playing on the resentments of a deeply divided nation. The populists, no matter how narrowly elected, assume that electoral victory was the will of the people and, in a terrible irony, a license to trample on the same democracy that raised them to power. They feel empowered to muzzle the press, crush the opposition, manipulate the courts and vilify whoever disagrees with them. "
"To the Editor: President Trump wants to be an American version of Vladimir Putin of Russia and cannot understand why there are factions in this country that oppose this. Mr. Trump wants to be like Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and kill drug dealers. Mr. Trump wants to be like Xi Jinping of China and be president for life. Mr. Trump is not stupid. He may be intentionally ignorant or uninterested in certain options if they don’t serve his limited agenda. Plenty of smart people rise to success of a sort despite strategies that do not embrace a larger understanding of the consequences of being unfair or dishonest or immoral or selfish. Mr. Trump does not appreciate how reducing diversity or silencing alternate intelligent voices will have dire consequences in the long term. He just wants instant gratification and to protect at any cost a view of himself as uniquely capable. The world must be a shallow, materialistic place to be deceived by these men. But this is what you get when you allow selfish children to rule the world — “Lord of the Flies.” KENNETH J. GARCIA, BETHPAGE, N.Y.

"WASHINGTON — Scott Lloyd’s unadorned job title betrays little hint of the power he has over the pregnant teenagers in his custody. As director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, he oversees the assistance program for the tens of thousands of refugees who still seek shelter in the United States, even with the Trump administration’s crackdown. But as the government official who is also responsible for the care of young, undocumented immigrants who enter the United States without their parents, he spends much of his time trying to stop those who want an abortion. He has instructed his staff to give him a spreadsheet each week that tells him about any unaccompanied minors who have asked for one and how far along they are in their pregnancy. In at least one case he directed staff to read to one girl a description of what happens during an abortion. And when there’s a need for counseling, Mr. Lloyd’s office calls on someone from its list of preferred “life affirming” pregnancy resource centers. Last fall Mr. Lloyd’s refusal to let a 17-year-old in Texas leave the shelter where she was living to get an abortion drew an admonishment from a federal judge who said she was “astounded” the government had been so insistent on keeping someone from obtaining a constitutionally protected procedure. Last week another judge barred him from trying to prevent any girl in his care from getting an abortion, but government lawyers have asked for a stay and plan to appeal. How Mr. Lloyd, an appointee of President Trump, turned a small office in the Department of Health and Human Services that provides social services to refugees into a battleground over abortion rights is part of the larger story of the Trump administration’s push to enact rules that favor socially conservative positions on issues like abortion, contraception and gay, lesbian and transgender rights. Unlike some traditional Republicans, many religious conservatives eagerly sought jobs in the administration and the chance to shape policy after eight years of a Democratic president. This was especially true at H.H.S., where the senior ranks are staffed with former activists who have built careers advancing socially conservative causes. "
"The United States ground war in Syria started in late 2015, when the Obama administration ordered a small deployment of roughly 50 troops. The American public saw little of the engagement: a few photos of familiar-looking soldiers in familiar-looking armored vehicles. The White House and the Pentagon stressed that the war in Syria against the Islamic State was being waged by Kurdish and Arab allies — small groups that American commandos were just “advising and assisting.” The American war, it seemed then, was primarily fought from the sky, taking the form of thousands of airstrikes. [The Times is reintroducing the At War blog, a forum for the firsthand experiences of global conflict.] As the months passed, the number of American troops on the ground increased. Today roughly 2,000 American troops live in Syria. The Islamic State’s de facto capital, Raqqa, is littered with rubble and explosives, and some of the Islamic State’s holdouts occupy a small slice of the Euphrates River Valley. President Trump has said he wants the Pentagon’s forces to leave. “I want to get out — I want to bring our troops back home,” Trump said on Tuesday during a news conference with leaders of Baltic nations. “It’s time. We were very successful against ISIS.” Trump’s statement ran almost directly opposite Pentagon plans, which were communicated at roughly the same time Tuesday by Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the top officer at the military’s United States Central Command. On Wednesday, Trump adopted the Pentagon’s view. The White House released a statement saying that the American military was going nowhere until the Islamic State was “eradicated” in Syria. "
"This September, The Learning Network will turn 20. And this Sunday, we’ll be in print for the first time. As you may know, our site was created in 1998 after The Times did a survey of loyal readers and asked how they were first introduced to the paper. Two answers dominated: “My parents read it” came first, but “my teacher gave it to me” was a close second. That supplied us with our mission — to help people teach and learn with Times content — and has guided what we do ever since. Now The Times is publishing a new quarterly section, called Learning, that will take over for the long-running Education Life — and work from our site, by students and by teachers, will be featured in every issue. For this inaugural April 8 edition, you can find: • Drawings of President Trump submitted by students to this year’s Editorial Cartoon Contest. • “Nothing Less Than Heroic,” a “found poem” by Ryan Nguyen, winner of last year’s annual April contest, which celebrates National Poetry Month. (To submit to this year’s contest, visit this page.) • Selected answers from our question, “What Do You Wish More People Understood About What It’s Like to Be a Student in 2018?” • Selected answers from our question, “What Do You Wish More People Knew About What It’s Like to Be a Teacher in 2018?” • The comic at the top of this post, which was created by David Finkle, a Florida teacher and cartoonist, who sent in another comic in response to our question, and from whom the Learning editors then commissioned this one. So please pick up a paper this Sunday and look for us on Page 15 of the new section. And stay tuned, because we’ll be regularly reaching out to you for ideas, opinions, drawings, photos and more for future editions. "
"In Graham Greene’s short story “The Destructors,” a gang of arrogant boys demolishes the home of a stranger. They break into the man’s dwelling and, in an act of arbitrary aggression, dismantle it piece by piece. They rip up the floorboards and saw the support beams. They smash the glass and shred the wiring. They strip it to its plumbing and finally pull down its walls. “My house,” their victim sobs when he discovers the wreckage. “Where’s my house?” This is a tale for our times. There are destroyers everywhere, from the White House on down. But there is one particular demolition crew that needs your urgent attention, because its work stands apart for both sheer ambition and lasting harm. The demolition crew is called the House Committee on Natural Resources. Led by the powerful Representative Rob Bishop of Utah, a Republican, it is intent on erasing the great edifice that we call American conservation. For more than a century, the people of the United States have been at work building this country’s conservation system. Like a family of visionary architects laboring over many generations, citizens here have erected a system of ideas and policies meant to ensure our society’s future by protecting it from ecological devastation. This system is built atop a few foundational laws: the Antiquities Act of 1906, the Wilderness Act of 1964, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973, among others. Destroy this architecture of environmental sanity, and you destroy our conservation heritage. The destruction is already well underway. Even as I write, Mr. Bishop and the other members of the House Committee on Natural Resources are waging a relentless assault on each and every one of these essential laws. If they succeed, our priceless public lands, water and wildlife will suffer irreversible damage. Consider, for instance, the National Monument Creation and Protection Act, which Mr. Bishop shepherded through his committee in October. Despite its name, the bill would fundamentally gut one of our oldest conservation laws. It would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 by severely restricting the president’s ability to independently designate national monuments on public land to protect natural, historic and cultural treasures. His legislation would also empower future presidents to reduce such monuments in size, effectively enshrining in law the Trump administration’s ongoing and legally dubious attack on national monuments across the country, especially in Mr. Bishop’s home state.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The Islamic State’s paper trail, Beijing’s Bible ban and sexism at the sumo ring. Here’s what you need to know: • Five trips to Iraq. More than 15,000 documents. One collapsed “caliphate.” We published the results of a yearlong investigation, in which Times journalists scoured former offices of the Islamic State that were abandoned by the militants. It shows that ISIS fighters, known for their brutality, were also effective administrators. We also have a new audio series, “Caliphate,” which followed our reporter Rukmini Callimachi as she covered the Islamic State and the fall of Mosul, Iraq. Listen to a preview here. The U.S. military, meanwhile, is spending about $1 million on makeshift detention camps for Islamic State prisoners in Syria, broadening its involvement in operations it had sought to avoid. _____ • “China is not afraid of a trade war.” That was a senior Chinese finance official who also said that the “new China” would “never succumb to external pressure.” Some of that is believable: Beijing has a strong grip on banks, the news media and politics. It also seems willing to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the U.S. political system. (China also has some “unconventional weapons” to make life harder for American companies.) "
"SHANGHAI — Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, arguing that he mischaracterized his company’s effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country. Taking aim at comments Mr. Zuckerberg made in a recent interview, the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar. The same problems keep recurring, they said, with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions. In a conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox this week, Mr. Zuckerberg referred to a pair of chain letters that were widely shared in Myanmar on Facebook Messenger last year. One message warned Buddhist groups about an imminent attack by Muslims, expected on Sept. 11. The other, spread among Muslims, cautioned of violence from Buddhist nationalists on the same date. “So that’s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “Now, in that case, our systems detect that that’s going on. We stop those messages from going through.” In an open letter, the organizations, which have worked with Facebook to flag dangerous and misleading content, including the chain letters, said the messages had spread for days, caused widespread fear and set off at least three violent incidents. They also said there was no system at all, only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol. "
"A Trump administration proposal to steeply increase entrance fees to the most popular national parks landed with a thud when it was presented in November, and park officials say they are now reconsidering it. The proposal, which would apply during the peak visitor season to 17 parks including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, called for a $70 fee for noncommercial vehicles, up from $30. The fee for motorcycles would rise to $50 from $25, while pedestrians and cyclists would be charged $30, up from $15. Officials received more than 109,000 comments during a monthlong public comment period last year, with most commenters writing against the increase. Many said they would no longer be able to afford a trip, or would choose other options for vacations. “If you enact this insane fee, I will no longer be able to afford to visit the national parks,” one said. “If that is your ultimate goal, well done.” A National Park Service spokesman said this week the plan was “still being reviewed and not yet finalized.” “We’ve taken the public’s suggestions seriously and have amended the plan to reflect those,” the service said in a statement.

"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Many farmers across the Midwest voted for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election but hoped he would never follow through on his threats to impose tariffs on China. They feared that they would suffer if China imposed its own tariffs as payback. Now, Beijing has done just that, proposing tariffs on 106 types of American goods — including soybeans, corn and pork — in retaliation for President Trump’s plans to penalize Chinese trade practices. On today’s episode: • Eldon Gould, a farmer in Illinois who voted for President Trump. Background reading: • The Midwest, which accounts for roughly half the nation’s agricultural output, is a prime target for any tit-for-tat response to American tariffs.

"Mick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in “wasteful spending” and needs to be slimmed down. To underscore the point, he submitted a quarterly budget request recently that was a nice round number: $0. That attitude, though, apparently didn’t apply to two of his recent hires. Mr. Mulvaney appointed two senior staff members who are paid salaries of more than $230,000, amounts that are far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs in Washington, according to agency documents obtained by The New York Times through a public records request. The consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street. As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency’s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have been trying to defang the agency, which they view as overly tough on the finance industry. One weapon they have tried to employ — so far, unsuccessfully — is to reduce the amount of money the agency can pay employees. But Mr. Mulvaney was willing to shell out top dollar for his highest-ranking appointees. When Mr. Mulvaney hired Kirsten Sutton in January to be the agency’s chief of staff, he agreed to pay her $259,500 a year, according to the documents obtained by The Times. Her salary is the highest allowed under the consumer bureau’s pay scale. (The hiring documents identify her as Kirsten Mork, but professionally, she uses the surname Sutton.) "
"TOMS RIVER, N.J. — The tables inside the hotel room were full and Andy Kim, the candidate responsible for filling them, was pleasantly surprised. It was a weeknight fund-raiser after all, rescheduled once already, for this relatively unknown Democratic challenger in a Republican district and a thick fog on Route 37 had obscured the tiny sign directing drivers to the hotel. “Seven months before Election Day this is not normal, to be able to pack a room on a weekday,” he told a crowd of about 150 supporters, each of whom contributed at least $10 to listen to Mr. Kim and snack on donated croissants. Ever since the election of President Trump, Democrats across the country have seen a predictable surge in energy among a base eager to take on the White House. What has been perhaps less expected is the uprising against the president coursing through more moderate suburbs, including many Mr. Trump won. Democrats buoyed by recent victories in Republican districts have lofty aims in suburban New Jersey as they work to wrest control of the House from the G.O.P., given Democrats’ surprise victories in Virginia, Alabama and, most recently, Pennsylvania. In New Jersey, which has been described by Democrats and Republicans as the most suburban state in the country, the revolt has been especially muscular and has put into play Republican-held congressional seats that until this year had hardly been on the Democratic radar. Voters have grown increasingly angry with Mr. Trump, viewing many of his actions as damaging the state’s fortunes. Under the new federal tax overhaul pushed by Mr. Trump, which severely limits the deductibility of local taxes and mortgage interest payments, over 10 percent of New Jersey households will see their taxes rise, more than any other state, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group. And Mr. Trump has been adamant about blocking any federal funding for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River that would ease travel for tens of thousands of commuters. As a result, New Jersey has become a key focus of the party’s effort to win the 24 seats it needs to retake the House. National leaders, outside groups and statewide officials have launched a concerted effort targeting four of the five New Jersey districts held by Republicans, including the Third Congressional District where Mr. Kim is running.

"MOSCOW — A Russian historian of the Soviet forced labor camps known as the Gulag, whose work ran counter to official contemporary narratives that play down the crimes of the Stalin era, was acquitted on Thursday of child pornography charges, which human rights groups said had been trumped up for political reasons. The historian, Yuri A. Dmitriev, gained renown in 1997 for discovering the remains of more than 9,000 victims of Stalinist purges buried in communal pits in Sandarmokh, a forest in northwestern Russia. Mr. Dmitriev has devoted the past 30 years to searching for such mass graves together with colleagues from Memorial, one of Russia’s oldest and most respected human rights organizations. Mr. Dmitriev serves as the regional director of Memorial in Karelia, a region in northwestern Russia bordering Finland. Initially, local government officials had supported his efforts and attended memorial events at the forest, which has been commemorated with a chapel and monuments to the victims amid the trees. But attitudes have been changing, and the Kremlin now emphasizes taking pride in Russia’s past, not uncovering its darker chapters. President Vladimir V. Putin said last year that “excessive demonization of Stalin is one of the ways to attack the Soviet Union, Russia.” Pro-government news outlets have run articles suggesting that Mr. Dmitriev’s grim discovery of masses of decaying bones could have been the site of executions of Soviet Army soldiers by Finns during the so-called Winter War with Finland that began in 1939, though most historians say that is unlikely. Mr. Dmitriev’s research was not on trial but formed a backdrop for his case. Mr. Dmitriev was arrested in December 2016 on the child pornography charges after taking nine nude photographs of his adoptive daughter, who was 11 at the time. He denied the images were pornographic. He said he took the photos to prove that he was not beating the girl, in case social services accused him of child abuse as the official pressure against him mounted. A court-appointed committee eventually agreed that the pictures were not pornographic in nature. The verdict on Thursday, handed down by a court in the city of Petrozavodsk, cleared Mr. Dmitriev of the pornography accusations but convicted him on a lesser charge of illegally possessing parts for a shotgun. He was sentenced to three months of probation and community service, Russian news agencies reported. Mr. Dmitriev had also denied the firearms charge, and it was not immediately clear whether he would appeal. Russian human rights groups had spoken out in defense of Mr. Dmitriev, saying investigators had illegally searched his house, opened a criminal case based on an anonymous claim and subjected him to a forced psychological examination, all practices reminiscent of the Stalinist past that Mr. Dmitriev had dedicated his life to exposing.
