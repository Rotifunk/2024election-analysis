"Environmental inspectors in northern China have found that nearly 14,000 companies, or 70 percent of the businesses they examined, failed to meet environmental standards for controlling air pollution, according to a state news agency report. The inspectors working for the Ministry of Environmental Protection came up with those results after two months of work across 28 cities in northern China, said Xinhua, the state news agency. The companies and industries varied widely, including businesses such as wool processing and furniture production. More than 4,700 companies were in unauthorized locations, lacked the proper certificates and failed to meet emissions standards, said the report, which was published on Sunday. Even though Chinese leaders have vowed to crack down on polluters, the factories continue to contribute to severe levels of air, water and soil pollution. Chinese citizens cite the country’s widespread pollution as one of the issues of greatest concern to them. The announcement, which was dated June 10 and circulated online this week, also calls into question whether China can fill a global leadership vacuum on the issue of climate change. China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has urged countries to abide by the Paris climate accord, even though President Trump is withdrawing the United States, historically the largest emitter, from the accord. China has pledged to hit certain targets to try to limit or bring down emissions, and its leaders say they intend to curb coal use. "
"Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, was cut off by Republican senators on Tuesday as she questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions during the latest high-profile Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in its investigation into Russian election interference. Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor, employs a rapid-fire questioning pace more commonly seen in courtrooms — a style that at times has her interrupting witnesses, which is frowned upon in the Senate, where decorum is still prized. But the moments were notable as the second time in a week that Ms. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent and is the only minority woman on the committee, was interrupted by two male colleagues during a hearing. Last Wednesday, Ms. Harris was interrupted by Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the committee, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, as she tried to question the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. On Tuesday, the two again interjected as she questioned Mr. Sessions over his role as campaign surrogate for President Trump and contact with Russian officials. “I’m not able to be rushed this fast,” a visibly flustered Mr. Sessions said to Ms. Harris at one point. “It makes me nervous.” When Ms. Harris then pressed Mr. Sessions on a Justice Department policy he cited as his rationale for not answering questions, Mr. McCain spoke up.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A lone gunman attacked a congressional baseball team practice in Virginia, shooting four people, including a congressman. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip of the House, was in critical condition after surgery. “He was hunting us,” said Representative Mike Bishop of Michigan, who was among the Republican lawmakers practicing for an annual charity game. Our graphics team mapped out how the shooting unfolded. The assailant, a 66-year-old Illinois man named James Hodgkinson, died after being shot at the scene. He was reportedly distraught over the election of Mr. Trump. _____ 2. New interview requests by Robert Mueller, the special counsel examining Russian meddling in the presidential election, are the latest indication that he will investigate whether President Trump obstructed justice.

"Beth Ditto did not set out to make her first full-length solo album. When she went into the studio a few years ago, Ms. Ditto, the powerhouse singer and feminist glamazon, planned to make another record for Gossip, the Portland, Ore., disco-punk trio she had fronted since 1999. But it was not to be: Her co-founder and bandmate, Nathan Howdeshell, had returned to their home state, Arkansas, and the songs Ms. Ditto was drafting in Los Angeles with session songwriters did not feel like Gossip material. “It’s like making somebody else’s sandwich, but you don’t know what they want on it,” she said. “It’s like, I don’t want to make them an entire lunch if they’re not gonna eat it, just waste all this food.” The group split, and Ms. Ditto settled into doing her own thing. “It was more solid; it felt more calm,” she said. With the help of the producer and writer Jennifer Decilveo, Ms. Ditto wrote nearly 80 songs. The dozen on “Fake Sugar,” due Friday, have stomp and girl-group melodies, Southernisms in their lyrics and garage-rock swagger, like the lead single, “Fire.” Between albums, Ms. Ditto, 36, honeymooned with the fashion world: She walked the catwalk for a Marc Jacobs show and started an eponymous clothing line, made in New York, for plus-size women. After years with short raven hair, she’s become a longhaired brunette. “I wanted everything colorful and flowing and free,” she said. For “Fake Sugar,” Ms. Ditto was inspired by her relationship with her wife of four years, Kristen Ogata; by her first-ever visit to Graceland (and by listening to Paul Simon’s “Graceland” on the way there); and by seminal punk artists like Alan Vega of Suicide, for whom she wrote a song, “Go Baby Go.” She spoke by phone from tour stops in Minneapolis and Dallas, where her family surprised her with a visit (and her 11-year-old niece joined her onstage for a song). These are edited excerpts from the conversation. "
"The Senate voted nearly unanimously on Wednesday to allow Congress to strip the president of the power to unilaterally lift existing sanctions against Russia, a matter that had many of President Trump’s allies siding with his harshest critics. The measure, which was approved 97 to 2 — Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, were the only votes against it — bolsters existing sanctions and would allow Congress to thwart any presidential effort to curtail sanctions without congressional approval. “This administration has been too eager, far too eager in my mind, to put sanctions relief on the table,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Wednesday. “We cannot let Russia’s meddling in our elections go unpunished, lest they ever consider something similar again.” Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said the overwhelming passage of the measure “sends a strong signal to President Putin while ensuring the Trump administration has the flexibility it needs.” “The Russian government continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine, aggravate the crisis in Syria and destabilize democracies around the world,” he added. “This amendment makes clear that we will not continue to tolerate such actions.” During the hearing on Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson urged senators to oppose the measure so that Mr. Trump and his administration would have “the flexibility to turn the heat up” if necessary. “I certainly agree with the sentiment that has been conveyed by several members from both parties that Russia must be held accountable for its meddling in U.S. elections,” he said. “I would urge Congress to ensure any legislation allows the president to have the flexibility to adjust sanctions to meet the needs of what is always an evolving diplomatic situation.” The existing restrictions were put in place by President Barack Obama after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. The new sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its role in the fighting in Syria and for interfering in the 2016 election. The House has yet to take up the measure, which is an amendment to a bill that tightens sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile tests. Republicans and Democrats have said they doubt Mr. Trump would veto the bill. Last year, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that he questioned whether it was in the United States’ best interest to continue the sanctions on Russia. "
"CAIRO — The fate of Tiran and Sanafir, a pair of small, barren islands in the Red Sea, is one of the most politically sensitive issues facing Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Since Mr. Sisi announced a plan to hand the islands to Saudi Arabia last year, he has faced an unusually virulent backlash. A top court ruled against the transfer, there were rare public protests, and an opinion poll found that a large majority of Egyptians bitterly opposed the idea. Yet Mr. Sisi may be about to get his way. On Wednesday, after three days of rowdy and emotional debate, Egypt’s Parliament voted to allow the contentious transfer of the islands to proceed. The decision did not come as a surprise — Mr. Sisi’s supporters dominate the largely pliant chamber, which is openly manipulated by his security agencies. The decision could yet be blocked in the courts. But it offers a new sign of how Mr. Sisi can impose his will, even in the face of stiff public disapproval, at a time when the political opposition has been crushed and the free press is under renewed assault — all as Egypt heads into a presidential election next year. “This gives an assessment of opposition strength in Egypt and what it might become,” said Michael Wahid Hanna, a scholar of Egypt at the Century Foundation. “The answer is, not much.” Mr. Sisi’s drive to end the uproar over the islands comes at a time when he has appeared emboldened by the strong support he was shown in a White House visit with President Trump in April. The two leaders met again in Saudi Arabia last month, and Mr. Sisi has since introduced a raft of new restrictions aimed at his critics. "
"WASHINGTON — Representative Chuck Fleischmann stood just outside the House chamber in the Capitol on Wednesday morning recounting his harrowing survival of a shooting rampage aimed at a group of lawmakers practicing for an annual charity baseball game. He was still wearing his cleats and red jersey with “Republicans” emblazoned across the front. But for once, such party labels were not the defining trait. Badly shaken members of Congress — both Democratic and Republican — were united in concern for those wounded and in shock at the events as they assessed where the nation’s increasingly harsh political climate had led them: an early-morning playing field sprayed with gunshots that could have killed dozens of their colleagues, aides, security personnel and volunteers involved with the game. “I never thought anything like that could happen on a ball field,” said Mr. Fleischmann, a Tennessee Republican who conceded that he was still rattled after bloodying himself diving into a dugout to huddle with his colleagues to flee what appears to be a politically motivated assault. The sense that national political conflict had escalated out of control was underscored by the fact that the gunman had taken out his deranged political rage on preparations for a rare congressional event that actually brings lawmakers together. Though the annual congressional baseball game pits Republicans against Democrats, it is more a moment for bipartisan camaraderie, fun and bragging rights for frustrated jocks who get to suit up for a good cause. But such gatherings cannot mask the acrid partisan atmosphere in Congress as well as back home, where lawmakers say they are increasingly worried about hostile audiences and constituents filled with vitriol who are unrestrained in venting at their member of Congress. "
"WASHINGTON — Shaken and angry, Republican members of Congress seized on the brazen daytime shooting of their colleagues on Wednesday to demand that existing restrictions on gun access be loosened so that people facing similar attacks are able to defend themselves. Past shootings have brought calls for more gun control, especially for restrictions on the kind of rifle used in Wednesday’s attack. But the ardent supporters of gun rights who came under fire this time were not about to change their views. As Representative Steve Scalise, the third-ranking House Republican, had surgery for a gunshot wound to the hip, his colleagues complained that Washington’s restrictive gun laws had barred him and other lawmakers who live in the capital from bringing weapons to the baseball practice in Alexandria, Va. “Had there not been a member of House leadership present, there would have been no police present, and it would have become the largest act of political terrorism in years, if not ever,” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia said, pointing to legislation he has introduced to make it easier for people to carry a gun in Washington. That bill “would allow the most law-abiding among us to defend themselves,” he said. Republicans who had gathered for the morning workout before Thursday night’s annual congressional baseball game were blunt about their sense of vulnerability. "
"WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia is engaging in a $750 million, multiyear training program through the American military to help prevent the accidental killing of civilians in the Saudi-led air campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The kingdom has also promised to take steps to ease American concerns about an air campaign that has killed more than 9,000 civilians in more than two years of conflict, according to a private letter that Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir wrote to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson before President Trump’s visit to the kingdom last month, another tacit acknowledgment of the weaknesses of the Saudi armed forces. The additional training and new safeguards effectively amount to important new conditions on the $110 billion in proposed arms deals that the United States is preparing to seal with Saudi Arabia, which Mr. Trump announced during his trip. These conditions may also have played a role in the Senate’s narrow approval of the first installment of Mr. Trump’s weapons sales — more than $510 million in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. But senior American officials who have worked closely with the Saudis in recent years to help them improve targeting procedures said that while the additional training was important, it would be effective only if Defense and State Department officials monitor the program closely. “This training package sets an important precedent to focus on preventing civilian casualties,” said Larry L. Lewis, a former senior official at the State Department who visited Saudi Arabia five times in 2015 and 2016 to help the country’s air force improve its targeting procedures and investigations. “But the follow-through is critical. Those things are necessary but not sufficient to help them solve their problems.” "
"LONDON — It’s the greatest word. The best. After analyzing 131,798 short stories written by children taking part in a BBC competition, the Oxford University Press has declared “Trump” to be Children’s Word of the Year. A statement by the publishing house said the word was chosen because of its significant increase in use — 839 percent — and the wide variety of contexts in which it was deployed. It’s the first time that a name, or proper noun, has won word of the year in either the children’s or adult categories (the 2016 Children’s Word of the Year was “refugee”). But if it initially seems like an odd choice, rest assured it has been put to inventive use. “Trump” features in stories as a character name (Boggle Trump, Snozzle Trump, Trumpdiddlydumper) and acquires prefixes, suffixes and other fixes to become Trumpelstilskin, Trumpido, Trumpeon, Trumpyness and Trumpwinningtastic. It is also used as a verb, as evidenced in this passage by one young author: “Suddenly I did the loudest trump EVER! The whole restaurant gasped, as if it was a crime. ‘You trumped in front of the Queen,’ hissed the shark.” Mr. Trump also features as himself. In “Donald Trump Goes to the Moon,” one entrant wrote: “10... 9...8 ‘my hair is so amazing’...7. ‘And real’. 6... 5 ‘I am going to make the moon great again!’. 3... 2...1 blast off!!” Lest other political figures feel left out, “Hillary Kitten” and “Obama Llama” appeared, too. Runner-up words included Brexit, fake news, social media, vlog and super. But they weren’t the best. "
"Inflation has stubbornly stayed lower than the Federal Reserve has desired for the past eight years, and it has been falling in the last few months. In a move that could well define her chairmanship of the central bank, Janet Yellen is betting that falling prices are a temporary blip that will soon be forgotten. If her forecast is right, the Fed policy meeting on Wednesday will turn out to be a nonevent in a gradual return to normal policy. If she’s wrong, the June 2017 meeting will look like a giant unforced error that unnecessarily prolonged an era in which the Fed proved impotent to get inflation up to the 2 percent level it aims for and lost credibility needed to fight the next downturn. The Federal Reserve is assigned a “dual mandate” — its mission is to achieve maximum employment and stable prices. Ms. Yellen emphasized that the job market looked quite healthy, justifying the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates for the second time this year and fourth time in 18 months. She is a labor market scholar, after all, and in her view the labor market looks pretty darn good, with a 4.3 percent unemployment rate and the economy still producing more new jobs than it is new workers. Using the economic models on which the Fed has traditionally relied and which were taught to generations of undergraduates, that would seem to set the stage for higher inflation. Employers would compete for workers and hike wages, fueling broader price increases for all types of goods and services. But there is little evidence this cause-and-effect is actually happening. The Fed has defined stable prices as inflation of 2 percent. Right now, not only are key inflation measures below that level, but they are also falling. The most recent reading of the inflation measure favored by the Fed is at only 1.5 percent. And the Consumer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.7 percent over the year ended in May, down from 2.2 percent in February. "

thought I was going to fall out of my seat,” my 8-year-old son told me after the final vertigo-inducing scene of “Mountain,” a documentary of soaring peaks and harrowing descents that debuted on Monday at the Sydney Opera House with a live orchestral performance. It was Balthazar’s first time inside the opera house. He was clearly happy to be there, and man-oh-man was he not alone. Upon completion, the capacity crowd of more than 1,200 roared with applause and howls of support. I was impressed. I’ve been to other music-plus-movie events and my fair share of premieres, but the enthusiasm soared above what I’d seen before (except maybe in Havana, after the premiere of “City of God”). In any case, Sydney’s response to “Mountain” was one of several experiences this week that got me thinking about Australia’s relationship to culture. That same day, Sebastian Smee, a wonderful art critic who returned to Sydney this year after winning a Pulitzer with the Boston Globe, wrote for us about the Art Gallery of New South Wales and its struggle to obtain the financing it needed to expand its exhibition and event space.

"Hoping to step into the breach left by the end of the Obama administration’s aggressive approach to civil rights abuses by the police, a coalition of civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Chicago on Wednesday. The lawsuit, which seeks sweeping changes to a police force with a well-documented pattern of excessive force and other misconduct, comes five months after Mayor Rahm Emanuel pledged to cooperate with the Justice Department to implement a police reform plan supervised by the federal courts. But the change at the White House cooled the federal appetite to intervene in police departments, and critics say Mr. Emanuel has been all too happy to negotiate a less stringent deal. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, is the latest chapter in the city’s long-running saga over how its Police Department treats the blacks and Hispanics that each comprise about a third of its population. It catalogs episodes of controversial police use of force dating back to the 1960s. Without federal court oversight, the plaintiffs contend, little will change in a city that has perennially faced racially tinged police-abuse scandals. “It is clear that federal court intervention is essential to end the historical and ongoing pattern and practice of excessive force by police officers in Chicago,” the lawsuit states. “Absent federal court supervision, nothing will improve.” "
"WASHINGTON — Law enforcement officials plan to announce charges Thursday against a dozen members of the Turkish president’s security detail for their involvement in a brutal attack on protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence here last month, two American officials said on Wednesday. The authorities have already charged several others, including two Americans and two Canadians, with taking part in the violent skirmish. The Washington police have been investigating the May 16 attack along with the State Department and the Secret Service. The police planned to announce the charges at a news conference on Thursday morning, according to the two officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the charges before they were made public. Washington police officials confirmed that the two Americans are Sinan Narin, of Virginia, and Eyup Yildirim, of New Jersey. Mr. Narin was charged with felony and misdemeanor assault. Mr. Yildirim, who can be seen on video repeatedly kicking a protester, was charged with two felony counts and one misdemeanor assault count. The two did not immediately return calls on Wednesday requesting comment. The police declined to comment on others facing charges, but were expected to release details on Thursday. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, a political agitator pressed into the unfamiliar new role of soothing a nation, called for bipartisan unity in his first statement responding to the shooting  Wednesday morning of a congressman and three others on a suburban Virginia baseball diamond. Mr. Trump, known for on-air improvisation and flouting presidential convention, approached this early test of his leadership with a gravity and sense of focus not seen since his well-received address to a joint session of Congress in February, when he called for a new era of bipartisan cooperation. The president followed the dignified script established by his predecessors as mass shootings have become more prevalent over the past decade, delivering a solemn two-minute statement in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House during which he appeared shaken by what he called “a very brutal, brutal assault.” Yet Mr. Trump is not a typical president coping with a crisis at a time of settled civility. Moving beyond the confrontational, personal, rhetorically violent and at times divisive tone he has infused in politics will be no easy task. Mr. Trump steered clear of the possible political motivations of the gunman, at least during his first official response, amid reports that the suspect, James T. Hodgkinson, was a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders who channeled his deep resentments of Republican lawmakers practicing for the annual congressional baseball game. "
"To the Editor: Re “Sessions Denies Collusion, Deploring ‘Detestable Lie’ ” (front page, June 14): During Tuesday’s hearing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed that he was confused by “a rambling question” posed by Senator Al Franken during his confirmation hearing that caused him not to mention meetings with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. Mr. Sessions repeatedly said he could not remember details of meetings that occurred just a few months ago. Mr. Sessions leads the Justice Department. Presumably he has to read legal briefs, which in their own right are confusing. If he becomes muddled by questions from senators, how are we to feel confident in his ability to oversee an entire department? C. K. KERNS
JACKSON HEIGHTS, QUEENS To the Editor: Your June 14 editorial “Jeff Sessions Clams Up in Congress” most compellingly asks, “Why, since he agreed with the committee that Russian interference in the election represents a profoundly serious attack on American democracy, has Mr. Sessions never received or read any detailed briefing on that operation?” This disturbing pattern of inaction points to either gross incompetence or a bewildering lack of curiosity, as exemplified several times in his testimony: Mr. Sessions says he discussed getting rid of James Comey after the election but before the inauguration. If Mr. Comey was doing such damage to the F.B.I., why did Mr. Sessions wait six months to recommend his removal? Mr. Sessions claims to have never discussed Russian hacking with the Russians, even when he met them in his office. Mr. Sessions apparently never asked Mr. Comey what President Trump said when he cleared the room to be alone with Mr. Comey. Mr. Sessions couldn’t cite a specific Justice Department policy preventing him from reporting conversations with the president. How could he not have been prepped to answer this most fundamental question? Mr. Sessions testified that he “in effect” recused himself from the Russia investigation his second day in office, but didn’t actually do so for another three weeks. Why not? Mr. Sessions apparently seizes up as well as clamming up. RICK ROTH, SEATTLE To the Editor: The thing I cannot understand is why so many officials, like ducks in a row, are sacrificing themselves for President Trump, even people like H. R. McMaster, Dan Coats and Adm. Michael Rogers, who have had long careers and credibility, readily damaging themselves, looking as if they’re lying or hiding evidence for a president who has no loyalty except to himself and who would throw them under a bus without thinking. There is no reward here. And what is the worst that would happen to them if they stood up for what’s right? Mr. Trump would fire them. And then they would be heroes. It is a sad spectacle of misjudgment. Jim Mattis and Rod Rosenstein seem to be the only ones trying to hang on to their honor. We will see how far that goes. REVA COOPER, BROOKLYN "
"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A lone gunman who was said to be distraught over President Trump’s election opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team at a practice field in this Washington suburb on Wednesday, using a rifle to shower the field with bullets that struck four people, including Steve Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives. Mr. Trump, in a televised statement from the White House, condemned the “very, very brutal assault” and said the gunman had died after a shootout with the police. Law enforcement authorities identified him as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, from Belleville, Ill., a suburb of St. Louis. Two members of Mr. Scalise’s Capitol Police security detail were wounded as they exchanged fire with the gunman in what lawmakers described as several chaotic, terror-filled minutes that turned the baseball practice into an early-morning nightmare. One was wounded by gunfire, and one suffered other, minor injuries. The tragedy united Republicans and Democrats in shock and anguish. “For all the noise and all the fury, we are one family,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday afternoon. Standing at second base, Mr. Scalise was struck once in the left hip, according to witnesses, and collapsed as the shots rang out, one after another, from behind a chain-link fence near the third-base dugout. Witnesses said Mr. Scalise, of Louisiana, “army crawled” from the infield to the grass as the shooting continued. "
"Good morning. Today’s item comes from the Los Angeles bureau chief, Adam Nagourney. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) LOS ANGELES — The Democratic Party is so dominant in California that there are barely enough Republicans around for even the most rudimentary political brawl. So state Democrats are turning to the next best thing: Democrats. The state party here has been enmeshed in what seems to be an unending battle over who is its new leader. Eric Bauman, the Los Angeles County Democratic leader, appears to have won — in the actual vote May 20 and in a recount — but the challenger, Kimberly Ellis, has not conceded, contending that there were voting irregularities. She is facing growing calls to accept the results; so far she has said she will not. Mr. Bauman and his supporters have rejected her call for an independent audit of the vote by the California Democratic Party, or C.D.P. “The party cannot go back in time and alleviate the storm of suspicion that surrounded last year’s presidential primary campaign,” the Ellis campaign said in a letter disputing the outcome. “But, in this instance, the C.D.P. has the ability to do the right thing and subject our chair’s election to independent scrutiny.” "
"HONG KONG — Ever since Anbang Insurance Group bought the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York nearly three years ago, the politically connected company has tested the mostly unwritten rules of the Chinese business world, ignoring regulators’ hints and wading into international controversies. Now, with the detention by police of Anbang’s chairman, the biggest question is which potential transgression may have spurred Beijing to crack down. The chairman, Wu Xiaohui, has not been publicly accused of any wrongdoing, and the authorities in China sometimes detain financiers for questioning only to release them to resume their duties a few days later. Anbang said on its website on Wednesday only that Mr. Wu was temporarily unable to fulfill his duties as chairman for “personal reasons.” Anbang embodies the contradictions of China’s modern economy, with its potentially combustible mix of risk-taking capitalism and episodically draconian government control. Abroad, Anbang shocked Wall Street with its multibillion-dollar takeover efforts, even as Beijing moved to rein in deals. At home, it drew tens of billions of dollars from Chinese investors big and small looking for their own success stories — making it vulnerable at a time when Beijing is looking to limit potential financial explosions. And it played the fraught game of politics on both sides of the Pacific, including courting Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Trump. On paper, the company appeared to be a quiet, conservative insurer. But Anbang often seemed to behave as though the usual informal political guidelines did not apply — possibly because Mr. Wu was married to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, a major Communist Party figure who was China’s paramount leader in the 1980s. “One of the basic rules of operating in China is everybody is a dog on a leash,” said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia who has co-written three books on the Chinese financial system. “Nobody has freedom. The party does not give anybody freedom. They merely give them a leash.” "
"WASHINGTON — I first came to America 40 years ago. It was the summer of 1977, and I was 20 years old. Jimmy Carter had moved into the White House a few months earlier. I and five friends rented a motor home in Bethlehem, Pa., and drove manically to Santa Barbara, Calif., and back, following the imperious orders of Fleetwood Mac — “Don’t Stop,” the ubiquitous hit of that summer. The day Elvis Presley died in Memphis — Aug. 16, 1977 — we were driving across the South, not too far away. But our English was tentative, and we missed the news. Since then my English has gotten better, and I’ve revisited the United States many times. I’ve come as a tourist, a resident, a husband, a dad and a son — in 1987, my parents ordered me to drive them around Arizona for two weeks. I’ve come as a journalist, a teacher, a lecturer and a writer (I wrote a book about life in America in the carefree mid-1990s). I came for conferences and long train journeys — from Portland, Me., to Portland, Ore.; from Washington, D.C., to Washington State. I’ve come for presidential elections, book tours, sports events and interviews. I remember Madonna, in Los Angeles, who didn’t like me; and Bruce Springsteen, in Buffalo, who during the sound check asked the E Street Band to play “Lost in the Flood” “for our Italian guest.” This time, it was for an annual conference designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. It included more than 100 political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media, from 30-odd countries. We spent three great days together. One could tell the Americans and the Europeans at first glance — the hosts in their shirts and light summer dresses, and the guests wearing sweaters and windbreakers against the ferocious air-conditioning. The main conference room was huge. Not big enough, though. There was a blond elephant inside, and he didn’t go away. His name was Donald Trump. Forty years is a long time. Coming often to the United States, I thought I’d experienced every national mood. I was wrong. I have never seen Americans so self-absorbed. It’s a strange time to be a European in America. Everyone was nice, and some trans-Atlantic topics were on the agenda. But the Americans’ minds were elsewhere — a few miles to the east, around the White House. They are still trying to come to terms with their new president — friends and foes, for different reasons. The debate on the future of the European Union, on the third day of our conference, created as much excitement as a math class on a Friday afternoon. "
"Where’s the line between covering a scoundrel as a news figure and giving him a promotional platform? The question has consumed Megyn Kelly this week, after she showed a trailer Sunday night of her coming feature on NBC about Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who has questioned whether the Sandy Hook school massacre truly happened and asserted that Sept. 11 was an inside job. “#ShameOnNBC” and “#ShameOnMegynKelly” campaigns broke out across Twitter, including from some Sandy Hook parents; JPMorgan Chase pulled its advertising, and Sandy Hook Promise, a group founded by Sandy Hook parents to prevent gun-related deaths, canceled Ms. Kelly’s planned appearance at its annual gala this week. Coming on only the third episode of her new NBC newsmagazine, “Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly,” the segment has become, as the technical television term goes, a hot mess. Ms. Kelly was respectfully unapologetic when I caught up with her late Tuesday. “What we do as journalists is we shine a light on those with power, those with influence, those who have become culturally relevant,” she said. “Of course, it’s upsetting to know that doing that causes any upset to the Newtown families, many of whom I know well. But I have to do my job.” Mr. Jones, she noted, has found new prominence in the Trump era. He’s gaining in popularity and, perhaps more important, has back-channel communications with the president of the United States, who has been known to espouse some of his theories. "
"WASHINGTON — As the majority whip in the House, Representative Steve Scalise is known among his Republican colleagues as a pleasant, persistent force, who gently checks back to see whether a lawmaker who has repeatedly said “nope, not with you” on a coming vote has had a change of heart. Back home in southern Louisiana, Mr. Scalise hangs his own Christmas lights on his modest house in suburban Jefferson while his security team idles nearby, pads around Sam’s Club with his honey-do list on Saturdays, and continues to knock on doors for votes, even though he has few challengers these days. In both places, Mr. Scalise is known for his passionate love of baseball and for the annual congressional baseball game, a Washington tradition in which Republicans play Democrats for charity. His office is decorated with photos of him playing in previous contests, and he is a fixture at practices. He was standing at second base during one of those practices on Wednesday outside Washington, one day before the game, when a gunman opened fire, wounding Mr. Scalise and at least three others, the authorities said. Witnesses said Mr. Scalise was shot in the hip and fell to the ground, then crawled toward outfield grass as more shots rang out. Mr. Scalise was taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where he had surgery and was in critical condition, his aides said. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Gives Mattis Authority to Send More Troops to Afghanistan” (news article, June 14): I agree with Senator John McCain that “we still haven’t got a strategy for Afghanistan.” To this Vietnam veteran, this seems like déjà vu all over again. Gen. William Westmoreland repeatedly asked President Lyndon B. Johnson for more troops to end a similar “stalemate” in Vietnam. Increasing troop strength without a meaningful strategy leads to endless conflict and more loss of life on every side. President Barack Obama was right to keep civilian control of military plans.

"Right Now: Five people have been wounded by a single gunman, who died after he was shot and taken into custody. • Five people, including Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana and a member of the House leadership, were shot Wednesday morning in an attack at a baseball field in Alexandria, Va. • Police said the gunman was shot and wounded and taken into custody. President Trump said the assailant, identified by authorities as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill., died from the wounds. • Mr. Scalise was in critical condition and was undergoing surgery. His office said that he was “in good spirits” before going into surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center and that he spoke to his wife by phone. “He is grateful for the brave actions of the U.S. Capitol Police, first responders and colleagues,” his office said. • He was at a baseball practice with other lawmakers and staff members preparing for a charity game when the attack occurred. • Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, said two law enforcement officers and a congressional aide were among the injured. • Mr. Brooks told CNN that players took cover wherever they could on the field and that members of a security team exchanged fire with the gunman, who had a rifle. • Police said a call came in at 7:09 a.m., and officers responded in three minutes. Two officers engaged the attacker and returned fire, the authorities said. • The office of Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas, said that a member of his staff had been shot and was receiving medical attention. (His office said the congressman had not been shot, as some have reported.) • Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said quick action by Capitol Police saved lives. “The field was basically a killing field,” he said. • The motive of the gunman was still under investigation. • Police have not said whether the gunman knew any of the victims. • The conditions of the other wounded were not immediately available. • Police have not disclosed how the gunman knew of the lawmakers’ practice schedule.

"The Trump administration is formally reconsidering — and may dismantle — two new rules that were a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s crackdown on predatory for-profit colleges. The announcement by the Education Department on Wednesday freezes changes that would speed up and expand a system for erasing the federal loan debt of student borrowers who were cheated by colleges that acted fraudulently. It also throws into limbo what is known as the gainful employment mandate, which cuts off loans to colleges if their graduates do not earn enough money to pay off their student debt. The move came just over two weeks before the new loan discharge rules were to take effect on July 1. The agency said it would form new rule-making committees to study both regulations and would hold off on implementing the discharge changes until the review was completed. “Fraud, especially fraud committed by a school, is simply unacceptable,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. “Unfortunately, last year’s rule-making effort missed an opportunity to get it right. The result is a muddled process that’s unfair to students and schools, and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs.” The agency also took aim at the Obama administration’s rules on gainful employment, criticizing them as “overly burdensome and confusing” for colleges. Consumer advocates and some state officials quickly lashed out against the delay, calling it damaging and potentially illegal. "
"The Trump administration says its compass is set to “America first.” A century ago, President Woodrow Wilson, standing at Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day, told the nations of Europe: “We did not set this government up in order that we might have a separate and selfish liberty, for we are now ready to come to your assistance and fight out upon the field of the world the cause of human liberty.” “America will once more have an opportunity to show to the world that she was born to save mankind,” Wilson said. Those words sound confident now. But on Memorial Day 1917, it was not entirely clear that America would demonstrate the commitment of which the president spoke so forcefully. In six days, every man in the country age 21 to 30 — about 10 million in all — was to register for possible conscription into the armed forces. Pacifists, anarchists and anti-imperialists seemed ready to disrupt the enrollment, and evidence was accumulating of younger men heading abroad to evade the draft. On June 6, however, The New York Times reported that the registration process had been “sustained heartily.” In New York City, which was then (as it remains) a sociological stewpot, officials were especially pleased by the enthusiasm among ethnic and racial minorities. “The most remarkable thing is how well and willingly the foreign element has responded,” the Manhattan registry chairman said. “These people are on the ‘job.’ They seem anxious to serve the country of their adoption. This speaks well for America. It means that our institutions are guaranteed to posterity.” Propaganda helped the effort along. Posters like this one, by James Daugherty, showed virile young men — unblemished by combat — posed as if they were ready to receive a victory garland without having lifted a well-muscled finger. Readers of The Times who had been witnessing the grisly war of attrition since 1914 might have known that a different fate was in store. Times Insider is offering glimpses of some of the most memorable wartime illustrations that appeared in The New York Times Mid-Week Pictorial, on the 100th anniversary of each issue: "

"GENEVA — Airstrikes by the American-led coalition against Islamic State targets have killed hundreds of civilians around Raqqa, the militant group’s last Syrian stronghold, and left 160,000 people displaced, a United Nations panel said on Wednesday. The findings of the panel, which has been documenting the war in Syria with periodic reports almost since the conflict began more than six years ago, reinforced fears by humanitarian groups over the heavy loss of civilian life that would result from the American-led coalition’s airstrikes. Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, the Brazilian diplomat who leads the panel, said the airstrikes had escalated as an American-backed militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces moved recently to retake Raqqa, which Islamic State fighters seized in 2014 and made their de facto capital. “We note in particular that the intensification of airstrikes, which have paved the ground for an S.D.F. advance in Raqqa, has resulted not only in staggering loss of civilian life, but has also led to 160,000 civilians fleeing their homes,” Mr. Pinheiro said in a report, presented to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. It was the first time Mr. Pinheiro’s panel had focused on American military conduct that has led to heavy civilian casualties and other suffering. The panel’s investigators found that 300 civilians had been killed in the airstrikes since March 21, panel member Karen Abuzayd told reporters in Geneva later. They included 200 civilians killed in a single incident in March when an airstrike hit a school in the town of Mansoura, she said. "

"For women in business and beyond, it was an I-told-you-so day. The twin spectacles Tuesday — an Uber board member’s wisecrack about women talking too much, and Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, being interrupted for the second time in a week by her male colleagues — triggered an outpouring of recognition and what has become almost ritual social-media outrage. Academic studies and countless anecdotes make it clear that being interrupted, talked over, shut down or penalized for speaking out is nearly a universal experience for women when they are outnumbered by men. A few statistics show that the questions directed at Uber about how women fare in the workplace extend beyond one company, and indeed beyond Silicon Valley. Women make up 6.4 percent of Fortune 500 chief executive officers and 19.4 percent of Congress this year. About a fifth of board members in Fortune 500 companies in 2016 were women, according to research conducted by Deloitte and the Alliance for Board Diversity. After Arianna Huffington, an Uber director, spoke of how important it was to increase the number of women on the board, David Bonderman said that would mean more talking. He soon resigned from the board. Even in companies without notorious bro-cultures, however, women have had to struggle to feel heard and, as the numbers make clear, to advance to the top. “I think every woman who has any degree of power and those who don’t knows how it feels to experience what Kamala Harris experienced yesterday,” said Laura R. Walker, the president and chief executive of New York Public Radio. “To be in a situation where you’re trying to do your job and you’re either cut off or ignored.” Senator Harris, a former prosecutor, assertively questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, interrupted and chided her to let Mr. Sessions answer her questions. Soon after that, Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the committee chairman, cut her off, saying her time had elapsed. "

"Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, has steered the conglomerate to global prominence, making splashy purchases like the Waldorf Astoria hotel along the way. Now, he has joined the ranks of Chinese tycoons ensnared in the country’s anticorruption drive. Mr. Wu was taken away on Friday in Beijing as part of a government investigation into Anbang, according to Caijing, a respected newsmagazine. Two people briefed on the matter confirmed that he had been detained. Anbang said on Wednesday that Mr. Wu was “for personal reasons no longer able to perform his duties.” The Anbang chairman counted Wall Street executives like Stephen A. Schwarzman among his business partners in the United States, so his detention was likely to reverberate through circles in China and the United States. Mr. Wu also has political connections, which have helped with his business dealings: He married a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, China’s paramount leader in the 1980s, and tried to forge a relationship with Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. The move comes after China’s insurance regulator barred Anbang from offering new insurance products for three months as part of a clampdown on speculative wealth management products, of which Anbang is a major issuer. The conglomerate has also been dogged by questions about its internal workings and political ties. "
"MOGADISHU, Somalia — Militants began an assault in the capital, Mogadishu, on Wednesday evening with a car bombing at the gates of a hotel popular with foreigners, and continued with gunfire at a nearby restaurant. The Associated Press put the death toll at 31, citing local officials and the emergency services, an increase from an earlier estimate of 18 people. Special forces troops rescued more than 50 hostages, state news outlets reported. The attack occurred less than a week after militants from the Shabab extremist group killed dozens of people — both soldiers and civilians, including children — when they stormed a military base in northeastern Somalia. On their website, the Shabab took responsibility for the violence on Wednesday, which started at the Posh Hotel in central Mogadishu. After a car bomb exploded at the hotel’s gates, gunmen fanned out to the Pizza House restaurant. Many people, including visitors from Ethiopia and Kenya, had been enjoying a night out. “I saw several people lying on the ground,” said Yusuf Warsame, a freelance photojournalist who went to the scene. “I personally counted the dead bodies of six people, including a young woman.” It was not known how many people were being held captive early Thursday, but the Shabab, who have links to Al Qaeda, are known for killing hostages, not holding them for ransom. The Shabab have been fighting the United Nations-backed government in Somalia for years, seeking to impose their strict interpretation of Islam. They have also been behind attacks in Uganda and Kenya, including the Westgate Mall siege in Nairobi in 2013. Recently, they have carried out a series of attacks in Kenya, killing dozens. Although the group has suffered defeats, including the deaths of leaders and the loss of territory, the Shabab’s ability to inflict harm remains undiminished. Devastating attacks on hotels have been one of their trademarks. Last Sunday, the United States military carried out a drone strike in southern Somalia against the Shabab, the first since President Trump relaxed some rules for preventing civilian casualties when the Pentagon carries out counterterrorism strikes. The strike, which the military said had targeted the command and logistics portion of a Shabab camp, came two and a half months after Mr. Trump cleared the way for offensive strikes in Somalia, a chaotic nation in the Horn of Africa, without a specific self-defense rationale.

"WASHINGTON — The most ardent supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders have long been outspoken about their anger toward Republicans — and in some cases toward Democrats. Their idol, the senator from Vermont, has called President Trump a “demagogue” and said recently that he was “perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country.” Now, in Mr. Sanders’s world, his fans have something concrete to grapple with: James T. Hodgkinson, a former volunteer for Mr. Sanders’s presidential campaign, is suspected of opening fire on Republican lawmakers practicing baseball in Alexandria, Va. That shooting on Wednesday, which wounded four people, may prove to be an unexpected test for a movement born out of Mr. Sanders’s left-wing, populist politics and a moment for liberals to figure out how to balance anger at Mr. Trump with inciting violence. “Both sides need to look in the mirror,” said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who campaigned for Mr. Sanders and is working on a new think tank started by the senator’s wife. “We have to decide what kind of language we are going to use in our political discourse.” Mr. Sanders has advocated what he has called a peaceful political revolution. On Wednesday, he acknowledged that Mr. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., had been a volunteer on his campaign and said he was praying for the recovery of Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, and the other victims. “I am sickened by this despicable act,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement. “Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.” "
"WASHINGTON — Nearly 200 Democratic members of Congress filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by profiting from business dealings with foreign governments. The plaintiffs — believed to be the most members of Congress to ever sue a sitting president — contend that Mr. Trump has ignored a constitutional clause that prohibits federal officials from accepting gifts, or emoluments, from foreign powers without congressional approval. It is the third such lawsuit against Mr. Trump on the issue since he became president, part of a coordinated effort by the president’s critics to force him to reveal his business entanglements and either sell off his holdings or put them in a blind trust. Like the previous two federal lawsuits, this one, filed in federal court in Washington, accuses Mr. Trump of illegally profiteering from his businesses in a variety of ways, including collecting payments from foreign diplomats who stay in his hotels and accepting trademark approvals from foreign governments for his company’s goods and services. But it creates a new group of plaintiffs who claim the president’s actions have damaged them: Democratic members of the House and Senate who say they have been wrongly deprived of their constitutional right to rule on whether Mr. Trump can accept such economic benefits from foreign governments, according to Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who led the effort with Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan. “The founders ensured that federal officeholders would not decide for themselves whether particular emoluments were likely to compromise their own independence or lead them to put personal interest over national interest,” the lawsuit states. “An officeholder, in short, should not be the sole judge of his own integrity.” "

"Last November, a surprise announcement changed my life. I had been selected as a 2017 Rhodes Scholar. It was exhilarating news. Several days later, however, I got another, less pleasant surprise. A professor at my university stopped me in the hall and said, “I know I shouldn’t say this, but now that you won the Rhodes, will you throw away your cane and your brace?” I did nothing to solicit this comment. Nor had I ever joked with him about needing ambulatory assistance and an ankle-foot orthotic since suffering a spinal cord injury in a serious accident three years before. On July 5, 2013, a pickup truck collided into me while I was riding my bicycle. One of my lumbar vertebrae burst, and I had emergency spinal-fusion surgery the next day. It was successful, but the injury left me paralyzed below the waist. With a month of inpatient therapy and six more of outpatient, I slowly relearned to walk with the cane I use today. My left ankle, though, remains immobile (hence, the foot orthotic), and I continue to experience reduced sensitivity in some parts of my body and sometimes find keeping my balance a struggle. The medicine prescribed to enable normal bladder function, the shower chair I use and all the other mutations in my life seem almost second-nature now, to the point that I can hardly remember what life before was like. I sometimes forget that to others, these changes nonetheless remain “abnormal.” So it was arresting to hear this otherwise-brilliant scholar’s question. What was the logic behind it? Why did he suggest that people with disabilities might harness, and even affect, impairments to realize their far-flung desires? Somehow, he conferred upon me the near-supernatural ability to persuade — no, pull one over on — seven judges and to shortchange the 12 other district finalists competing alongside me. Of course, the idea that disability begets preternatural abilities is nothing new. The Greek seer Tiresias’ blindness gave him access to the spiritual sphere in Sophocles’ “Oedipus Cycle.” (As students of literature, we associate a similar capability with the blind poet Homer.) And so it goes for our modern mythologies: In “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” the blindness of Chirrut Îmwe, played by Donnie Yen, seems to connect him with the Force; Sofia Boutella’s character, Gazelle, likewise wears prosthetics that double as lethal blades in the spy thriller “Kingsman.” But I don’t feel like some “super-crip” — a supernaturally endowed disabled character — on nights when I can’t focus because of muscle spasms, on afternoons when I can’t spend time with friends because they’re playing disc golf, and on mornings when I remember how the nurses would catheterize me six times daily during that month I spent in the hospital, until they taught me to do it myself.

"The problem with staging a “Julius Caesar” in which Caesar clearly resembles Donald Trump, the culture-war controversy du jour thanks to Shakespeare in the Park, isn’t that doing so encourages the president’s assassination. The rough-and-tumble of democratic politics has always been rife with classical call-outs and far more egregious forms of lèse-majesté. The theatergoers who show up to watch a Shakespeare play in Central Park are — I hope — not high on the Secret Service’s watch list. And the play’s tragic arc does not exactly make tyrannicide look like the wisest of strategies, even if the director is crude and on-the-nose enough to dress his Cassius for the Women’s March. No, the problem with a Trumpified Caesar is that the conceit fails to illuminate our moment the way a good classical allusion should. The decadent years of the Roman Republic are as good a comparison point for our late-republican discontents as any in the history books, and a creeping Caesarism in the executive has been a feature of our politics for many years. But between his military prowess, his reforming energy and his immense (if fluctuating) popularity, old murdered Julius himself is a relatively poor analogue for Trump. Our president is a different sort of character, in need of a different sort of script. Suppose you exhumed Shakespeare and ordered him to write a Roman play for our times. Since the bard was reasonably skilled at flattering his patrons, the first question he would ask is where you get your news. If you answered Breitbart and Sean Hannity, he would disappear for a few weeks and re-emerge with “The Brothers Gracchi,” a tale for the times about Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, two aristocrats who decided to Make Rome Great Again by rallying the common people and taking on the Acela Corridor — er, the privileged of Rome. In this story, the displaced peasants and unpaid veterans of the Gracchis’ second century B.C. would look a lot like the steelworkers and coal miners who voted Trump, while the brothers themselves would preach populism and give orations about draining the Capitoline swamp. The senatorial elites who conspired to bring them down would sound and talk a lot like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, Chuck Schumer and John McCain, with a few TV hosts and Hollywood celebrities worked in for good measure. And the arguments among elites for assassinating the brothers would bear a strong resemblance to the case for pursuing impeachment or invoking the 25th Amendment against Trump. "
"It is only fitting that in this season of fake news there is plenty of exaggerated outrage to go around. Consider the latest kerfuffle over the Public Theater’s production of “Julius Caesar,” in which Caesar is a Trumpian figure with blond hair, odd hand gestures and a wife with an Eastern European accent. Breitbart and Fox News were aggrieved that the play appeared to show President Trump assassinated on stage under an American flag. And if there was any doubt why this was terrible, the hosts of “Fox & Friends” also noted that “women and minorities” played some of the senators who did the deed — a reminder of the old right-wing horror of horrors: cross-gender and cross-cultural casting of Shakespeare productions. Ever alert to having their brands associated with controversies — aside from ones they create themselves — Bank of America and Delta Air Lines swiftly pulled support: the bank for this production and Delta for its sponsorship of the Public, which presents the Shakespeare in the Park series of which this performance is a part. The commentators stoking this scandal are following a familiar playbook. They are using this production to get attention and get back at liberals. If young college students can block Charles Murray, author of “The Bell Curve,” which argues that genetic factors linked to race help determine financial success and social status, from speaking at Middlebury College, and activists can get corporations to pull ads from Breitbart and “The O’Reilly Factor,” conservatives ought to be able to attack the Public, as liberal a cultural bastion as they come. Call it competitive outrage — we see your college protests and raise you a theater boycott. Who started this one-upmanship is not important and is probably not knowable. The outraged in this case know, or at least should know, what actually happens in this 400-year-old play that is assigned reading in many high schools and colleges. And if they bothered to look beyond the scene in which senators stick it to Caesar, they would also know that this play is really about the futility and danger of using violence for a purportedly good cause like restoring democracy. The end of the Public’s production, which I saw in previews last month, leaves you wishing Caesar were still lounging in his bathtub with his wife Calpurnia. In addition, the Public has hardly broken ground by trying to give its Caesar some contemporary credence. Directors have often adapted Shakespeare to reflect modern realities. Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart executive and now the president’s chief strategist, once wrote a hip-hop screen adaptation of the tragedy “Coriolanus” set in Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots. And in 2012, the Acting Company put on a production in which Caesar was a Barack Obama-like figure. Fox hosts seem not to have noticed. But we should give them a pass since back then they were working very hard to figure out, along with Mr. Trump, if Mr. Obama was born in the United States. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Some stories have to be experienced to fully grasp — the Korea crisis is one of them. I arrived in Seoul on the evening of May 28. As I was dressing for breakfast the next morning, I was jarred by a news alert ringing on my phone: North Korea had just fired a short-range ballistic missile that had landed in the sea off its east coast. I waited for the sirens to tell us to go to the hotel shelter, as happened when I was in Israel during a Hamas rocket attack. But there were no sirens. Nothing. The breakfast buffet was packed. The mood was: Another North Korean missile test? Oh, pay no attention to our crazy cousins. Could you pass the kimchi, please? I was immediately reminded of my favorite quote from when I lived in Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, where people also became inured to the constant threat of violence. It was from a Beirut hostess who asked her dinner guests, “Would you like to eat now or wait for the cease-fire?” A few hours after the missile test, two U.S. B-1B Lancer strategic bombers out of Guam flew right up to the North’s border on what North Korea called “a nuclear bomb dropping drill.” No matter. The South Korean stock market didn’t flinch. In fact, one of the most popular housing markets for young Koreans today is Musan, located just south of the DMZ, the demilitarized zone separating the South from the North. It’s an easy commute to Seoul, and young people have gamed out that if the North launched rockets or artillery shells, they would likely go over their heads because they are so close to the border! Human beings! God love ’em. Their ability to adapt never ceases to amaze me. I interviewed a group of South Korean college students at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, and here’s what some said: “The fear has been diluted — as time goes by you just get used to it.” “We don’t really believe that North Korea can harm us or launch war, because we think we are stronger than them economically and militarily.” “We heard the G.D.P. gap between us and North Korea is 20 times, and we don’t want to pay more taxes to fix them up.” “When I went to the U.S. I freaked out [over] why people there care more about North Korea than me.” "

"Your book “No Is Not Enough” frames Donald Trump’s impunity as a type of branding. How does that help explain him? He’s a culmination of many dangerous trends in the culture, especially the triumph of the idea that a successful corporation is first and foremost selling an idea of itself and a sense of belonging and identity to its customers. In the late ’80s, you saw brands start to sell the idea, the sense of belonging, first. That primacy of the brand does a lot to explain Trump, and how he has developed this intimate relationship with his base, why they expect so little of him and why he gets away with what he gets away with, because the rules of branding are really simple: Be true to your brand. The problem with Donald Trump is that he went and designed a brand that is entirely amoral. Is he actually true to his brand? His brand is wealth and power, which is why he’s driven so mad by things like “President Bannon” and people disputing his wealth. Because if that’s the case — if he’s not as rich and powerful as he claims he is — that really does damage his brand. It is a tremendous weakness of Trump’s that he believes his own P.R. And it’s a central part of his brand that he is the guy who gets the deal, and it has been ever since his real first brand extension, “The Art of the Deal” — a book not written by him. One criticism I had of your dissection of his brand was that you talk about him as if he’s a triumph of capitalism, even though he’s not — he inherited his wealth. I would argue that that’s the kind of capitalism we have now. I think there has always been a huge gap between what theories of capitalism say it is and how capitalism operates out in the world. "
"The violence has come regularly for years, in one politically charged spasm after another. A member of Congress shot through the head in Tucson. Assaults on the Holocaust Museum, a Planned Parenthood office and the Family Research Council, a socially conservative group. Gunmen targeting black churchgoers in South Carolina, Indian immigrants in Kansas and police officers in New York and Texas. The attempted slaughter of Republican lawmakers on a baseball diamond outside Washington was less an aberration than the latest example of a grim trend, widely remarked upon by leaders in both parties, but never slowed or stopped. And with lawmakers, legislative aides and Capitol police officers hospitalized on Wednesday, a process of mourning and recrimination unfolded as a kind of familiar ritual, with a somber statement from the president and bipartisan denunciations of violence quickly giving way to finger-pointing and blame on social media. Even high-level gestures of conciliation, including from President Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders, did little to blunt the sense that America’s civic culture is consumed with anger and breaking down — though mental illness sometimes makes it impossible to say exactly what leads to violence. To survivors of past attacks, the shooting in Virginia — perpetrated by a 66-year-old former Sanders supporter who expressed rage over Mr. Trump’s presidency — came as a sign that the worst might still be ahead. Former Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said the violence reflected a contagion in America’s political culture, in which adversaries were treated as “people to be destroyed.” He said Mr. Trump and Democratic leaders, as well as the news media, all deserved blame.

"WASHINGTON — As one of the longest economic expansions in American history chugs into its ninth year, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday it was raising its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The Fed accompanied the widely expected rate increase with a further show of confidence: a description of its plans to start reducing its portfolio of more than $4 trillion in bonds later this year. The Fed intends both measures to raise borrowing costs for businesses and consumers after almost a decade of historically low interest rates. “Our decision reflects the progress the economy has made and is expected to make,” Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, told reporters after the announcement. Ms. Yellen may soon lose her role as the conductor of the Fed’s slow, steady and successful retreat. The Trump administration is beginning to consider whether Ms. Yellen should be replaced when her term as chairwoman ends in early February. Gary Cohn, President Trump’s chief economic adviser, is heading the search for a new leader. The administration has not ruled out a second term for Ms. Yellen, but Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail that he would “most likely” pick a new person. Ms. Yellen’s management of monetary policy may matter less than her disagreements with Mr. Trump about regulatory policy and Mr. Trump’s preference for people he knows.

"It’s no secret that the American Health Care Act is unpopular. In recent national polls, only about 29 percent of Americans support the bill. It is the most unpopular piece of major legislation Congress has considered in decades — even more unloved than TARP (“the bailout”), and much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Will Republican senators vote yes on a bill this unpopular? To hang on to their jobs, senators have to keep only voters in their own states happy, not the whole nation. Perhaps red-state senators, or even some senators in swing states, might think their states are friendlier to the bill than the nation as a whole. Our research indicates that is not the case. To get a sense of support by state, we combined recent polls to estimate support for the A.H.C.A. in every senator’s home state. Our estimates indicate that not one state favors it. Even though very few state polls have been conducted on views of the A.H.C.A., we are able to estimate views on the bill in each state using a statistical method called M.R.P. (multilevel regression and poststratification) and eight national polls that the Kaiser Family Foundation, YouGov and Public Policy Polling shared with us on people’s views on the A.H.C.A. While no polling system is infallible, our M.R.P. model combines respondents’ demographic characteristics, their state and their views of the A.H.C.A. to estimate the probability that a voter of a certain age, race and gender, and in a state with certain characteristics, would support the proposal. It then estimates support for the bill within every state based on each state’s demographics. Models like this have been used to accurately predict public opinion in states on other topics, and in last week’s election in Britain.

Trevor Noah responded to the news that President Trump was said to be considering firing Robert S. Mueller III, the special prosecutor leading the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. It’s a move that some are saying Mr. Trump wouldn’t dare make because it would suggest that he had something to hide. But on Tuesday’s “Daily Show,” Mr. Noah wasn’t convinced. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert caught up with Melania Trump — played by Laura Benanti — to find out how the first lady was handling the transition to living in the White House. Meanwhile, Mr. Colbert made fun of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his tight-lipped testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, during which the words “I do not recall” were a constant refrain.

"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Julia Stevenson scurried through the hallway as her school day came to a close, hoping to take advantage of as much daylight as possible to complete one of the last assignments of her high school career. “I’m flying home today,” Ms. Stevenson, 18, said with a broad smile, explaining that she was hoping for clear skies and a beautiful view of Lake Michigan on the 300-mile round trip from Gerald R. Ford International Airport to her hometown, Traverse City, Mich. With her pilot’s license in sight, Ms. Stevenson was about to graduate from the West Michigan Aviation Academy, a public charter school here founded by Dick DeVos, the billionaire husband of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Ms. DeVos has called it an inspiration for her dogged support for school choice, a shining example of what is possible when schools are able to meet students’ unique interests and needs. On Tuesday, she told thousands of charter school advocates that her husband’s school prepared students “to contribute in significant ways to our 21st-century economy.” But with its deep-pocketed founder, corporate sponsors and remarkable capacity to raise money, the Aviation Academy may be more an example of what education can achieve with seemingly limitless funds than a model for other schools.

"When President Trump delivered his commencement address at Liberty University on May 13, his themes were mostly conventional ones: patriotism, faith, the importance of striving for one’s goals. The true Trumpian note emerged only when the president strayed for a moment onto the subject of criticism. “Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic, because they’re people that can’t get the job done,” Trump said. Against the impotent carping of critics, he posed the constructive ambition of “dreamers”: “The future belongs to the dreamers, not to the critics.” This distinction had an obvious relevance to Trump himself, who dreamed himself into the White House against all odds. But it was not an original idea; disdain for critics is perennially popular, particularly in the arts. Indeed, artists who would be aghast to find themselves on the same side of any debate as Donald Trump might well feel a sneaking sympathy with his dismissal of critics. It was the composer Jean Sibelius who apparently originated the oft-repeated quip that no one ever put up a statue of a critic. (If that was ever true, it’s not now: There is a statue of Roger Ebert outside a movie theater in Illinois.) Trump would agree, just as he would surely appreciate the well-known comparison, attributed to the Irish writer Brendan Behan, of critics to eunuchs in a harem: They see it being done every day, but they can’t do it themselves. The contempt of artists for critics is, of course, understandable. To create an artwork is to give the world a kind of gift, and no one likes having a gift rejected, or even inspected too carefully. In a sense, artists who condemn criticism are relying on the old idea that “it’s the thought that counts”: Because the intention of the giver is generous and pure, any carping about the gift is cruelly small-minded. Yet as anyone who has received an ill-fitting or unsuitable present knows, the thought is not the only thing that counts. Once a work of art emerges from its creator’s study or studio, it becomes the possession of anyone who interacts with it, and therefore it is open to judgment: Do I actually derive pleasure and enlightenment from it? There is no way to stifle this question, which is the foundation of all criticism. Every reader or viewer or listener asks it, whether they want to or not. A critic is just a reader or viewer or listener who makes the question explicit and tries to answer it publicly, for the benefit of other potential readers or viewers or listeners. In doing so, she operates on the assumption that the audience for a work, the recipient of a gift, is entitled to make a judgment on its worth. The realm of judgment is plural. Everyone brings his or her own values and standards to the work of judging. This means that it is also, essentially, democratic. No canon of taste or critical authority can compel people to like what they don’t like. Not even the ardent sincerity of the artist can do that — and being subjected to criticism does a great deal to expose the complex motives that underlie an artist’s sincerity. Like any donor, she gives not out of sheer altruism, but also out of a desire for recognition, for admiration of her skill and talent. That is why books display the names of their authors: Writers want credit for what they’ve given us, not unlike the way hospital wings and sports stadiums display the names of their sponsors. One reason artists dislike criticism is that it can unearth and analyze this will to power. No one gets to be president without wanting to write his or her name in large letters on the American psyche, but most presidents at least gesture in the direction of humility and public service. President Trump, however, has never been anything but straightforward about his egotism. He made his reputation in real estate by splashing his name in gold on almost every structure he built; now he hangs a map of his electoral victory on the White House wall. When the terms of his achievement are so personal, how could criticism fail to strike him as an egoistic injury? The belittling of critics as pathetic and impotent is entirely of a piece with his giving mocking nicknames to rivals, like “low-energy” Jeb Bush and “little” Marco Rubio. "
"ARLINGTON, Va. — Ralph S. Northam, Virginia’s lieutenant governor, claimed the Democratic nomination for governor on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. A mild-mannered physician and Army veteran, Mr. Northam, 57, fended off Tom Perriello, a former congressman whose insurgent candidacy gave the state’s Democratic establishment a scare. He begins the general election as the favorite against the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie. What both scares Republicans and worries Democrats is that Mr. Northam could have been a candidate for Virginia governor just as easily 30 years ago as today. With the accent of his youth on the state’s rural Eastern Shore, a diploma from the Virginia Military Institute and a courtly Southern bearing, Mr. Northam is not exactly the typical Democrat of 2017. That makes some Republicans nervous because they believe he could pull votes from his fellow veterans and other conservative-leaning constituencies. But it also troubles some Democrats, who are unsure that Mr. Northam — who twice voted for George W. Bush — will be able to energize the party’s ascendant liberal base. Even though Mr. Perriello sought to outflank him on the left, Mr. Northam won in part because of his strength with crucial liberal voter blocs. Mr. Northam, who often attends a Baptist church with a largely black congregation, overwhelmed Mr. Perriello in Virginia’s most heavily African-American jurisdictions. And his advocacy as a state senator and lieutenant governor for teachers, gun control, abortion rights and a smoking ban in restaurants won him support that might have otherwise gone to a more progressive candidate. Virginia bars governors from running for re-election, the last state in the country with such a restriction, but Mr. Northam made no secret that he was effectively running for Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s second term. He featured the governor, who is highly popular among Democrats around the state, in television ads and promoted the economic progress the state has made in the last four years. His wager in the primary, and now in the general election, is that Virginia voters are happy with their state government and will support continuity. Mr. Northam scarcely mentioned President Trump’s name at the outset of the primary. But he soon saw how hungry Democratic voters were to confront the president, and he began calling Mr. Trump “a narcissistic maniac.” The insult made its way into his TV ads. But high-decibel attacks do not come easy to Mr. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, and he may have to be nudged to take it to Mr. Trump in the fashion many Virginia Democrats are expecting. "
"ARLINGTON, Va. — Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a Washington lobbyist, barely claimed the Republican nomination for governor of Virginia on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. A top aide in President George W. Bush’s administration, Mr. Gillespie, 55, is very much a creature of the pre-Trump, establishment wing of his party. He will face a stiff test in the general election against the Democrat Ralph S. Northam, as he seeks to retain the support of conservatives who are enthusiastic backers of President Trump while not turning off the state’s often pivotal moderates, a decidedly anti-Trump voter bloc. This is Mr. Gillespie’s second bid for statewide office. In 2014, he ran unsuccessfully against Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat. It was not expected to be one of the marquee Senate races that year, but Mr. Gillespie gave Mr. Warner a scare, losing by less than a single point. Running such an unexpectedly strong race gave Mr. Gillespie a leg up this year as a host of other high-profile Virginia Republicans deferred to him. If they had known how vulnerable he was on the right, some of those other would-be candidates may not have opted out of the race. A New Jersey-raised congressional aide-turned-Washington insider may not sound like the typical profile of a statewide candidate in a tradition-bound state like Virginia. But Mr. Gillespie has a model of sorts in the governor’s mansion today: Terry McAuliffe. Mr. McAuliffe was raised in Syracuse before making a name for himself in national politics as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The governor and the would-be governor, who have a friendly relationship born of the greenroom circuit, have something else in common: Both came to the nation’s capital to attend college at the Catholic University of America.

"A dizzying array of police lights flashed up and down the West Side Highway on a damp Thursday in May. President Trump was visiting the U.S.S. Intrepid, snarling traffic outside the Javits Convention Center, where Katy Perry was performing at a corporate showcase for her new partner, YouTube. The last time she was in the building was election night, when she had been preparing to toast the victory of Mr. Trump’s opponent. For Ms. Perry, who prominently supported Hillary Clinton’s campaign, that party on Nov. 8 began “with everybody looking fancy and beautiful and high on their horses,” she recalled in an interview several weeks after her YouTube set. The mood rapidly shifted when word started to spread that Mrs. Clinton was not on her way there — news that Ms. Perry, 32, described as “traumatizing.” “It was a revelation, it was a reckoning,” she said of Mrs. Clinton’s loss. She started downing drinks and reached out to the nearest person for physical support: Lady Gaga, also there to celebrate the election of the first female president. There they were, “Gaga and I just looking at each other, and being like, [expletive] it, we need to touch each other,” Ms. Perry said. And for a minute, two of the biggest pop stars in the world held hands. [Sign up for our music newsletter, Louder.] Alliances aren’t easily made in the superstar stratosphere, where elbows are often sharp. And Ms. Perry, who released her fourth major label album, “Witness,” on June 9, stands as one of the biggest successes in the industry, alongside Madonna, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. She has sold 6.5 million albums and nearly 71 million digital songs in the United States, according to Nielsen Music; notched 14 Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits; performed at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show; and landed a gig as a judge on the revamped “American Idol,” which is to return in September on ABC. But she said she had an awakening on election night tied to misogyny in her past. And she is undertaking a strenuous effort to prove she isn’t the same frothy Katy Perry as before, making over her look, her music and her vocabulary. For 96 hours, timed to the album’s release, she spread that message of “unity and communication” via filibuster — a nonstop YouTube live stream called “Witness World Wide,” organized into segments (a therapy session, meditations, a cathartic chat with RuPaul) where the words “safe place” came up a lot and Ms. Perry worked out to her own album.

"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence has hired a personal criminal defense lawyer to guide him through the various investigations encircling the White House, an aide said on Thursday. Mr. Pence has retained Richard Cullen, a former United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, becoming one of the most prominent figures in the Trump administration to have taken on personal white-collar criminal defense counsel. Mr. Pence, who had little relationship with the president before joining the campaign ticket just before last July’s Republican convention, is most likely a peripheral figure in the government’s inquiry into Russia’s interference in the election and potential collusion with members of the Trump campaign. Paul Manafort — Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman who has been scrutinized for financial ties to a pro-Russian political party — was instrumental in recruiting Mr. Pence. But as the special counsel investigation progresses — focusing increasingly on the president himself and his actions in office — the vice president’s account as a possible witness may become more relevant. “The vice president is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the president’s agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter,” Jarrod Agen, Mr. Pence’s communications director, said in confirming the hiring, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Major Washington investigations, whether the inquiry into Bill and Hillary Clinton’s Whitewater real estate holdings or the inquiry into the leak of a covert C.I.A. agent’s identity during the administration of George W. Bush, have been boons for the practice of white-collar law, which blossomed during the Watergate scandal and transformed boutique practices into major business for global firms. "
"To the Editor: Re “G.O.P. Lawmaker Shot Outside Capital” (front page, June 15): As I reflect on the shooting that occurred in Alexandria, Va., on Wednesday, I look through my lens as a longtime family law attorney. I’ve witnessed hundreds of unhealthy marriages that ended in divorce and wondered: How did things get this bad? I ask the same question of our democracy: How did things get this bad? We all felt the pain of each bullet in Alexandria regardless of our political affiliation. It’s time to hit the reset button and re-evaluate, as a nation, how we got to this boiling point. And, more important, where do we go from here? As members of the American family, we are all bound together through community, compassion and care for one another. Let us find peace and work together to solve our common problems. SONJA TROM EAYRS, MINNEAPOLIS To the Editor: Re “Shooting Tests Movement on the Left” (news article, June 15): Your article suggesting that the horrific shooting of a member of Congress by a Bernie Sanders supporter may be a test for Mr. Sanders’s political movement is unfathomable and irresponsible. Mr. Sanders has always advocated peaceful and compassionate political actions. If you are searching for some person or group to blame for this tragedy, look to the gun lobby. Moreover, and I say this with incredible sadness, we may also have to look at the intransigence of the Republican Party in allowing President Trump to continue his legal and constitutional transgressions unchecked, and to steer our country toward policies that blatantly harm most Americans and denigrate the values of a democratic nation. Of course, none of this justifies this act of violence. A far more reasonable approach for venting frustration is to continue voicing opinions in opposition to the intolerable political culture that has taken over Washington. "

"Alex Jones knows exactly whom he wants to blame for the Wednesday shooting on a Virginia baseball field: “the left” and its calls to violence. In a five-minute video produced by his conspiracy-laden website, InfoWars, Mr. Jones runs through a list of offenders on “terroristic social media,” distorting and cherry-picking comments, to make a wildly misleading case. His video is among the most flagrant examples of an emerging trend of partisans repurposing old statements from lawmakers — or simply fabricating quotes — to place blame for the shooting. Here’s an assessment. The video was posted to Mr. Jones’s Facebook page and YouTube channel, and viewed tens of thousands of times. It is structured like a news report, ticking off the facts of the shooting on Wednesday morning. It correctly lays out details of the attack, identifies the shooter as James T. Hodgkinson, and highlights his social media activity in support of Senator Bernie Sanders’s anger toward Republican policies. But it veers far from the truth with this sweeping, conspiratorial video presentation: First, it shows a bright graphic of the words “terrorist social media” framing a handful of tweets praising the attack or verbally assaulting Republicans. These tweets are from random individuals, media personalities or freelance writers who have no affiliation to a political party or organization. Next, there is a quick cut to a still image of Kathy Griffin from her controversial photo shoot as a voice-over claims that “the left is collectively and publicly embracing homicide as a political solution.” Prominent Democrats like Chelsea Clinton and Senator Al Franken of Minnesota chastised Ms. Griffin for her actions.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump, who is awaiting word from the Supreme Court on the fate of his travel ban, paid his first visit to the court on Thursday for a formal ceremony welcoming his appointee, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. Mr. Trump has been sharply critical of federal judges, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (“an absolute disaster”) and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (“her mind is shot”). He made no public remarks at the court on Thursday, watching the proceedings from a seat reserved for prominent visitors. Chief Justice Roberts greeted Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, from the bench. “Mr. President,” the chief justice said, “I extend to you and the first lady a warm welcome.” Justice Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court more than two months ago and has been hard at work. In April, he was an active participant in the current term’s final arguments. He issued his first opinion this week, and it was lively, polished and unanimous. But one piece of pomp remained: his formal investiture. The proceedings were “purely ceremonial,” the court’s public information office noted, but they were stately and steeped in history. Justice Gorsuch was, for instance, initially seated facing the bench in a chair that had been used by Chief Justice John Marshall. The ceremony was attended by lawmakers, federal judges, current and former Justice Department officials and members of Justice Gorsuch’s family. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein made a motion to have the clerk of the court read Justice Gorsuch’s presidential commission. Chief Justice Roberts, without particular deliberation, granted the motion. The commission, on parchment bearing elaborate legal language, was duly read. It said Justice Gorsuch possessed “wisdom, uprightness and learning.” Chief Justice Roberts administered the judicial oath, and Justice Gorsuch promised to “administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.” Justice Gorsuch placed special emphasis on the oath’s concluding clause: “So help me God.” Justice Gorsuch then took his seat on the far side of the bench, the spot reserved for the most junior member of the court. The courtroom erupted in applause, and Mr. Trump beamed and clapped. Justice Gorsuch was appointed to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump after an extended and bitter fight over the seat left vacant by the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, saying that the next president should choose Justice Scalia’s successor. The ceremony lasted just a few minutes. The chief justice and his new colleague then walked down the front steps of the courthouse as photographers captured the image. They were joined at the base of the steps by Justice Gorsuch’s wife, Louise, for more photographs. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Gorsuch chatted as they descended, outside reporters’ earshot. "
"Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, appears to be looking into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. It is not easy to prove that a president committed the crime of obstruction, but if publicly reported facts are accurate, Mr. Mueller is likely to find that he has a strong case against Mr. Trump. Obstruction of justice is a serious offense that lay at the core of Bill Clinton’s impeachment and forced the resignation of Richard Nixon. The Watergate-era cliché “The cover-up is worse than the crime” misses the point that the cover-up is a crime. Congress has made it a felony for any person — including the president — to “corruptly” interfere with a proceeding before a federal agency. Powerful evidence has emerged in recent weeks suggesting that President Trump did indeed interfere with the F.B.I. investigation of Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, which is part of the broader Russia inquiry. So far, the case against Mr. Trump involves three key events. First, James Comey said that when he was the F.B.I. director, the president told him in a Valentine’s Day chat, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Two Federal Courts of Appeals have held that similar “I hope” statements can — depending on the context — support charges of obstruction. Second, President Trump reportedly asked the director of national intelligence, Daniel Coats, in a private meeting in late March if Coats could get the F.B.I. to back off its Flynn probe. President Nixon’s attempt to use the C.I.A. to shut down the Watergate investigation was one of the reasons the House Judiciary Committee voted for articles of impeachment on obstruction charges. Last, President Trump fired Mr. Comey on May 9 and then said on television that the firing was related to the Russia inquiry — a signal to Comey’s replacement, Acting Director Andrew McCabe, that he should roll back the investigation if he wanted to stay on as F.B.I. chief.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity went on as planned, bringing rare bipartisan harmony to the capital, after the attack on the Republican team’s practice on Wednesday morning. Representative Steve Scalise underwent a third operation. Republican lawmakers called for looser gun laws so people facing similar attacks could defend themselves. The gunman, James Hodgkinson, who was killed in a shootout, began his day at an adjacent Y.M.C.A. and appeared to go about his normal routine before he opened fire. On our podcast, “The Daily,” lawmakers who were on the field at the time of the shooting described how the attack unfolded. _____ "
"It wasn’t long after a gunman opened fire on members of a Republican congressional baseball team on Wednesday that the emotional calls for unity began. Speaker Paul D. Ryan described the shooting as “an attack on all of us.” The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said it was “an injury in the family.” Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic member of the House who was shot in 2011, pleaded for civility. “We must stand together,” she said. “And serve together.” Their appeals, however fervent, are working against a historical headwind. Democratic and Republican voters don’t just disagree about the right way to reform health care or the true intentions of President Trump. Many despise each other, and to a degree that political scientists and pollsters say has gotten significantly worse over the last 50 years. “If you go back to the days of the Civil War, one can find cases in American political history where there was far more rancor and violence,” said Shanto Iyengar, a Stanford political scientist. “But in the modern era, there are no ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ — partisan animus is at an all-time high.” Mr. Iyengar doesn’t mean that the typical Democratic or Republican voter has adopted more extreme ideological views (although it is the case that elected officials in Congress have moved further apart). Rather, Democrats and Republicans truly think worse of each other, a trend that isn’t really about policy preferences. Members of the two parties are more likely today to describe each other unfavorably, as selfish, as threats to the nation, even as unsuitable marriage material. Surveys over time have used a 100-point thermometer scale to rate how voters feel toward each other, from cold to warm. Democrats and Republicans have been giving lower and lower scores — more cold shoulder — to the opposite party. By 2008, the average rating for members of the other party was barely above 30. That’s significantly worse than how Democrats rated even “big business” and how Republicans rated “people on welfare.” "
"A section of the Port of Charleston in South Carolina was shut down for several hours Wednesday night after a tip from a far-right YouTube conspiracy theorist warned that a dirty bomb might be on a container ship moored there, officials said. A section of the Port of Charleston was closed for about seven hours as nearly a dozen federal, state and local agencies searched and turned up nothing. The episode began around 8 p.m. on Wednesday when the Coast Guard said it received two phone calls about a potential dirty bomb — a crude explosive rigged to spray radioactive material — aboard the container ship Maersk Memphis, Lt. James B. Zorn, a Coast Guard spokesman, said on Thursday. Four containers aboard the ship were scanned and the section of the port that had been closed, the Wando terminal, was reopened around 3:30 a.m. on Thursday. "
"When a gunman opened fire on a congressional baseball practice Wednesday, everyone in Washington looked for a positive message. There had to be a point to something so awful. The consensus was for Coming Together. “For all the noise and all the fury, we are one family,” Speaker Paul Ryan told the House. “You’re going to hear me say something you never heard me say before,” rejoined Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. “I identify myself with the remarks of the speaker.” “We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” said Donald Trump. This was regarded as one of Trump’s better presidential moments. He didn’t insult anyone, the way he did after the London terrorist attack. He didn’t suggest that in the future, all baseball players should be armed. And let’s hope it lasts. Since the gunman, James Hodgkinson, was known back home in Illinois as a vehement Trump critic, the president could definitely regress back into making the tragedy all about Donald. But truthfully, American politics has been mean and verbally violent for a lot longer than Donald Trump’s been in the White House. Pelosi — who’s often depicted as the archvillain in Republican campaign ads — has been getting death threats for years. Back in 2010 a San Francisco man admitted to making more than 30 phone calls to Pelosi and her family, threatening to kill her or blow up her house if she voted for health care reform. Ironically, the practice Hodgkinson’s bullets interrupted was for a ballgame that’s a lonely throwback to the good old days of political congeniality, when people from both parties would debate during the day and then go off to drink together after work. The drinking thing is pretty much over. But the representatives and senators do still get together every year to yell good-natured insults at each other and play ball, Democrats against Republicans.

"In 2011, after Representative Gabby Giffords of Arizona was gravely injured and six others were killed by a shooter in Tucson, I was moved to commit an entire column to condemning the left for linking the shooting so closely to political rhetoric. Yes, Republican personalities and officials in the wake of Barack Obama’s election had spoken openly about “Second Amendment remedies” and being “armed and dangerous” and “revolution,” but it was not possible to connect the dots between that irresponsible talk and the Tucson shooter. Now, here I am again, only this time extending the same condemnation to the right for doing the same after four people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, were shot at an Alexandria, Va., baseball field where Republican members of Congress were practicing in advance of a charity game. The shooter, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, appears to have had strong liberal, anti-Trump, anti-Republican views — among other things, he was a volunteer with the Bernie Sanders campaign — but at the time of this writing, authorities had not announced a motive for the shooting. The very real possibility that the shooting was politically motivated was clearly on the minds of many, including Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, who was at the baseball field during the shooting: “This could be the first political rhetorical terrorist attack, and that has to stop.” Let me be clear: I don’t have a problem with viewing these incidents through a political lens. Not to do so is naïve and ridiculously self-blinding in a way that avoids reality. "
"The relentless focus on the white working class in the aftermath of the election of President Trump has overshadowed a much larger bloc of voters, the roughly 65 million service sector workers whose partisan loyalty is up for grabs.

The category of service class employment — as distinct from the goods producing or manufacturing sector — encompasses an exceptionally broad range of workers, from home care aides ($23,490 mean annual income) and fast food cooks ($20,510) to teachers ($54,341), loan officers ($75,170), real estate brokers ($79,140), accountants ($81,850) and securities and commodities brokers ($102,240). Mark Muro, a Brookings senior fellow, noted in an email: it also includes Muro sees potential for Democratic Party growth in the service sector, arguing that Since 1974, the total number of private sector employees in service-providing industries has grown from 40.3 million to 103.8 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manufacturing jobs moved in the opposite direction, falling from 18.2 million in 1974 to 12.4 million. Richard Florida, the director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, has conducted some of the most detailed analyses of employment sectors. "
"While President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines was bragging about his brutal war on drugs, the Islamic State was consolidating its sway over Islamist rebel groups on the island of Mindanao. The extent to which ISIS has succeeded is now alarmingly evident, as a pitched battle between Philippine troops and Islamist militants for control of the largely Muslim city of Marawi enters its fourth week. With the presence of foreign fighters, including Malaysians and Indonesians, who are working alongside militant leaders with strong ties to ISIS, Mr. Duterte has a serious problem on his hands that threatens the security of the entire region. The news on Wednesday that, in addition to American military advisers and intelligence assistance, United States troops are now on the ground in Marawi raises the stakes. Mr. Duterte, who has threatened to eject American forces from his country, said Sunday that he was unaware of the presence of military assistance in Marawi. In fact, the Pentagon has no permanent presence in the Philippines, but for years has kept 50 to 100 Special Forces troops in the south of the country on rotational exercises. Despite Mr. Duterte’s hostility to America, his army has close ties to the Pentagon, values its help against the extremists and has resisted Mr. Duterte’s efforts to expel the Americans. Mr. Duterte’s braggadocio is partly to blame for the escalation of the conflict. Last year, he rejected a cease-fire offer from the Maute group, which is leading the fight in Marawi. He said in December that when the group pledged to “go down upon Marawi to burn the place,” he responded, “Go ahead, do it.” The battle raging now began when Maute militants, who have joined forces with the Abu Sayyaf Islamist group, strongly resisted an attempt on May 23 by Philippine security forces to capture Isnilon Hapilon, Abu Sayyaf’s leader. Mr. Hapilon is on the F.B.I.’s list of most-wanted terrorists. The Philippine military is pummeling Marawi with daily bombing runs, presumably with targeting assistance from Americans. More than 200 people have been killed and some 2,000 civilians are believed to be trapped. President Trump has supported Mr. Duterte, including his use of extrajudicial killings to fight the drug trade, and he has intensified the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. But strongman tactics — like Mr. Duterte’s recent threat to declare martial law over the entire country — and a widening military show of brute force aided by the United States will not address the fundamental problems that have fueled militant movements on Mindanao since the 1970s: grinding poverty; lawless zones, where criminal gangs reign; and overcrowded prisons, which are a boon to Islamist recruiters. The most urgent need now is to ratchet down the fight in Marawi and press Mr. Duterte to restart negotiations with militant groups. "
"After decades of failed efforts to enact “regulatory reform” bills, Congress appears to be within a few votes of approving reform legislation that would strip Americans of important legal protections, induce regulatory sclerosis and subject agencies that enforce the nation’s laws and regulations to potentially endless litigation. This is not reform. These bills would sabotage agency regulation with legislative monkey wrenches. Key compromises about agency power and procedures, worked out under the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, would be discarded by these overwhelmingly anti-regulatory bills. And because they would be statutory changes, not mere presidential edicts, these changes would likely long outlive the Trump administration. It is easy to complain about regulation, of course, and much could surely be improved. But government rules are the foundation of the safety net that protects Americans. Are you ready to abandon protections of your drinking water? What about that school hamburger? Is it O.K. to eat? Can you depend on Medicare or Medicaid? Are toys safe? Can workers fight overtime violations or discrimination? Will government agencies be there to police mortgage, student-loan and retirement-savings abuses? Will the education of special-needs students be protected? Few members of Congress would dare vote directly to eliminate protections like those. But by imposing a byzantine, burdensome process on all agencies, Congress could dodge accountability but nonetheless derail the implementation of popular laws. The principal bill in this so-called reform package is the Regulatory Accountability Act, a bipartisan proposal sponsored by Republican Senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, as well as Democratic Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. This measure would subject major rule making by agencies to dozens of new requirements, with a pervasive mandate for cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses. Agencies would also have to periodically review the efficacy of new rules, even if no one was complaining about them. In addition, agencies would have to select a single best regulatory choice measured by monetary metrics and based on “best available” data. As a result, less quantifiable goals behind our protective laws — clean air and water, civil rights, safe drugs and honesty in markets, for example — would fade in importance. Every agency choice about what is “best” or most “cost effective” would become the subject of litigation. "
"Soon — maybe as early as Friday — President Donald Trump, with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, is expected to announce a presidential initiative that will roll back the Obama-era efforts that loosened the 56-year-old United States embargo on Cuba. How far will the president go? More important than the actual content of the executive changes, though, will be how the United States Congress, businesses and other interested groups react to Mr. Trump’s reversal of policies that, according to Pew Research Center, 75 percent of Americans support. Key, too, will be the reaction of the Cuban government. For the past half-century, the gerontocratic Cuban regime has survived because the embargo has not just isolated the Cuban people from their closest neighbor of more than 300 million — including close to two million fellow Cubans — but also provided a convenient excuse for the regime’s economic failure. Despite the assertions of its advocates, the embargo’s harshness has never correlated with improvements in human rights. The worst crackdown in modern Cuban history was in April 2003, when the Cuban government rounded up 75 human rights activists and independent journalists and sentenced them to an average of 20 years in prison. That was precisely when the embargo was at its tightest, under George W. Bush’s administration, when even Cuban-Americans were restricted in how often they could travel to the island to visit relatives or send them money. (Most political prisoners were released in 2010-11 through a deal brokered by the Vatican.) What the United States lacked then but has now is leverage. Since President Barack Obama announced the first in a series of dramatic reforms on Dec. 17, 2014, to normalize relations, the United States and Cuba have collaborated on fighting narcotics trafficking and money laundering, cooperated on improving port and airport security, and managed to secure visits from officials like the United Nations special rapporteur on human trafficking. The changes have also helped generate jobs and income for the United States economy. Since President Obama loosened restrictions on travel, tourism has boomed. Last year, an estimated four million visitors went to the island, including more than 600,000 from the United States — a 34 percent increase from 2015. Those trips have helped fuel the hospitality industry on both sides of the Florida Straits, with Delta, American, JetBlue and others flying to at least six Cuban cities daily and Carnival cruise lines taking American citizens to port in Havana. Airbnb also now lists hundreds of privately owned houses where open-minded Americans can stay and interact with locals, and last week it said its connections have helped place $40 million in the pockets of Cuban owners of private bed-and-breakfasts. All told, the group Engage Cuba estimates (in a report that I took part in) that restricting the rights of United States citizens to travel and invest in Cuba would cost the American economy $6.6 billion and affect 12,295 American jobs.

"The stage adaptation of “1984” opening on Thursday, June 22, may be George Orwell’s Broadway debut. But his novel — and coinages like Big Brother, thought police and double-think — have never been far from the cultural stage. Here’s a partial history of the prophetic year that somehow never passes into the past. [Read about “1984” coming to Broadway.] The novel, published in 1949, sold well, but it took the “telescreen,” as Orwell might have put it, to inject its nightmare vision into the cultural bloodstream. A TV adaptation aired in the United States in 1953, followed the next year by a BBC version seen by seven million people, many of whom seemed to have the bejesus scared out of them. The show opened with the image of a mushroom cloud and a warning that it was “unsuitable for children or those with weak nerves.” The next day, The Daily Express reported a casualty under the front-page headline “1984: Wife Dies as She Watches.” The BBC was flooded with complaints, and the British Housewives’ League denounced it as “sadistic and horrible.” It had the lasting effect of turning Orwell’s shadowy villain into a celebrity. “The term Big Brother, which the day before yesterday meant nothing to 99 percent of the population,” The Times of London reported, “has become a household phrase.” While Orwell was a man of the left, the novel was seized on as a useful cultural weapon against the Soviet Union. The Time-Life publisher Henry Luce promoted it in his magazines. And the Central Intelligence Agency, which had financed an animated film version of Orwell’s “Animal Farm,” also took an interest in “1984.” "
"A British adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984,” first staged in 2013, had three successful runs in the West End and national and international tours, including stops in Boston, Los Angeles and Washington. There was talk of bringing it to New York, but no sense of urgency. Then came Donald J. Trump’s inauguration and Kellyanne Conway’s now-famous comments about “alternative facts,” which sent the novel zooming to the top of the Amazon charts in the United States. Duncan Macmillan, who wrote and directed the show with Robert Icke, sent a text to one of his producers reading simply “84 NY?” Within two weeks, a run at the Hudson Theater, where it officially opens on Thursday, June 22, was announced. “I think the feeling was, we have to do it now,” Mr. Macmillan recalled recently. “If we don’t, we’ll miss our chance.” [An overview of George Orwell’s “1984.”] The production — which stars Tom Sturridge as Winston Smith, the Everyman who rebels against Big Brother, and Olivia Wilde as Julia, the fellow party member with whom he has a forbidden affair — may be arriving on Broadway at a ripe, perhaps even overripe, moment. Several shows commenting directly or indirectly on Mr. Trump’s rise have opened (and, in the case of Robert Schenkkan’s Off Broadway “Building the Wall,” already closed) since the inauguration. Michael Moore’s one-man show “The Terms of My Surrender” — “Can a Broadway show bring down a sitting president?,” the poster asks — will open just down the block from the Hudson in July. "
"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeatedly refused to answer senators’ questions on Tuesday about his conversations with President Trump, even though Mr. Trump had not asserted executive privilege to keep them secret. That raises questions about whether Mr. Sessions had any legal basis to stonewall Congress. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Sessions argued that it would be “inappropriate” for him to talk about such confidential discussions because the president might choose to assert the privilege in the future. “I’m protecting the president’s constitutional right by not giving it away before he has a chance to view it and weigh it,” he said. Before the same panel last week, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, gave a similar rationale for not answering questions. The pattern has angered Democrats, who argue that the officials are improperly impeding Congress’s oversight investigation. Here are several issues raised by the dispute. Presidents have claimed the power under the Constitution to prevent the other branches of the government from gaining access to certain internal executive branch information, so that, among other things, the president and top White House aides can communicate confidentially with other officials. The idea is to avoid a chilling effect on the candor of the advice the president receives about his constitutional duties. "

"Updated, 9:45 a.m. Good morning on this temperate Thursday. When Celeste Beatty brewed her first batch of beer, she found her vocation. She loved the process and the smell of the boiling barley. It reminded her of cooking soup with her mother in the South as a child. Ms. Beatty’s beer journey began in her apartment near Marcus Garvey Park nearly two decades ago, after a friend gave her a home-brewing kit. She began hosting brewing sessions in her living room, teaching the craft to her family and friends. Beer became an “interesting platform for me to bring those people together and enjoy a great beer and have dialogue,” said Ms. Beatty, 53, who has lived in Harlem for 25 years. She turned her passion into a business, the Harlem Brewing Company, 16 years ago. Ms. Beatty has since developed recipes rooted in Harlem’s history. Her Sugar Hill Golden Pale Ale is made with locally grown hops. Another Harlem Brewing Company original, Renaissance Wit, pays homage to a beer that Alexander Hamilton brewed on his 32-acre estate in what is now Hamilton Heights. "
"EVERYTHING UNDER THE HEAVENS
How the Past Helps Shape China’s Push for Global Power
By Howard W. French
Illustrated. 330 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95. DESTINED FOR WAR
Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?
By Graham Allison
364 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books. $28. The Chinese superpower has arrived. Could America’s failure to grasp this reality pull the United States and China into war? Here are two books that warn of that serious possibility. Howard W. French’s “Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China’s Push for Global Power” does so through a deep historical and cultural study of the meaning of China’s rise from the point of view of the Chinese themselves. Graham Allison’s “Destined for War: Can American and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?” makes his arguments through historical case studies that illuminate the pressure toward military confrontation when a rising power challenges a dominant one. Both books urge us to be ready for a radically different world order, one in which China presides over Asia, even as Chinese politicians tell a public story about “peaceful rise.” The books argue persuasively that adjusting to this global power shift will require great skill on both sides if conflagration is to be avoided. French says in his exhaustively researched and fascinating account of geopolitics, China style, that the Chinese era is upon us. But, he asks, “How will the coming China-driven world look?” To what extent will China support the international order that emerged when it was suffering humiliation at the hands of foreign powers? What are the drivers and motivations for the new ways China projects its power? How best should its neighbors and its rival North American superpower respond? French, a former reporter for The Washington Post and The New York Times, argues that China’s historical and cultural legacy governs its conduct of international relations, a legacy that sits uncomfortably with the Western notions of equality and noninterference among states. China’s relations with its neighbors in Japan and Southeast Asia were for millenniums governed by the concept of tian xia, which held that everything “under the heavens” belonged to the empire. A superior civilization demanded deference and tribute from vassal neighbors and did not hesitate to use military force. China’s testy relationship with Vietnam became fraught whenever a Vietnamese leader dared to demand equal footing with a Chinese emperor; the Japanese claim to divine origins was unacceptable. "
"SYDNEY, Australia — Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s first phone call with President Trump was famously unpleasant. His next one might be even more so. On Thursday, an Australian news network released a brief recording of Mr. Turnbull poking fun at the president, at a dinner full of journalists that was supposed to be off the record. “The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls,” said Mr. Turnbull (whose actual poll numbers, like Mr. Trump’s, are nothing to boast about). “We are winning so much. We are winning like we have never won before.” “We’re winning in the real polls,” he continued, to gales of laughter from the audience. “You know, the online polls.” He added, “They are so easy to win. I have this Russian guy.” Mr. Turnbull’s parody of Trumpian bluster, and his allusion to the investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia, were recorded Wednesday night at Parliament House’s Mid Winter Ball, an annual event not unlike the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in Washington. Organized by journalists, it is one of the premier social events in Canberra, the capital, featuring comic (or would-be comic) speeches by the prime minister and the opposition leader. "
"HONG KONG — Anbang Insurance Group, whose chairman has been detained by the police, has seen its growth come to a screeching halt as Chinese investors who helped fund its meteoric rise prove skittish about a politically connected company that is no longer in Beijing’s good graces. Anbang’s sales of life insurance policies and investment products, an important source of cash, stopped almost completely in April after tumbling sharply in March, according to Chinese government data released on Thursday. Across the insurance industry, sales slowed in April compared with earlier in the year. The weakness follows the government’s crackdown on a sector that is supposed to help families and companies cut their financial risks, but has recently become a hub for rampant financial speculation. China’s anti-corruption officials announced in April that they were investigating the industry’s top regulator, who was subsequently removed from his post. After that, regulators stepped up their enforcement. Anbang has been the archetype of the industry’s changing favor. For years, Anbang used its revenue to fund splashy global takeovers, most famously its 2015 purchase of New York’s landmark Waldorf Astoria hotel. But its strategy tested the country’s political and financial limits, amplifying scrutiny of the company. Anbang’s rise had been “just another example of the Wild West capitalism in Chinese finance, where people can go off and do whatever, no matter what their sectors are supposed to be doing,” said David Zweig, the director of the Center on China’s Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “It starts out by providing a needed service in the economy, but these guys end up just going out of control.” "
"WASHINGTON — As they draft legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Republican leaders are aiming to transform large sections of the American health care system without a single hearing on their bill and without a formal, open drafting session. That has created an air of distrust and concern — on and off Capitol Hill, with Democrats but also with Republicans. “I’ve said from Day 1, and I’ll say it again,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. “The process is better if you do it in public, and that people get buy-in along the way and understand what’s going on. Obviously, that’s not the route that is being taken.” The secrecy surrounding the Senate measure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is remarkable — at least for a health care measure this consequential. In 1993, President Bill Clinton empowered the first lady, Hillary Clinton, to assemble health care legislation in private, with input from a group of more than 500 experts. That approach won scathing reviews from Republican lawmakers and others shut out of the deliberations. But it took place at the White House, not in Congress. Once the Clintons’ health plan reached Capitol Hill, it died in the public spotlight. Republican leaders this week defended their actions. “Look, we’ve been dealing with this issue for seven years,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “It’s not a new thing.” "
"WASHINGTON — James T. Hodgkinson, the man who the police say opened fire on a crowd of congressional Republicans on Wednesday, began his day at the nearby Y.M.C.A. at 5:31 a.m. and appeared to go about his normal morning routine before unleashing the attack, the Y.M.C.A. said Thursday. An hour and a half later, just after 7:09 a.m., the police in Alexandria, Va., responded to a call alerting them to gunfire outside the Y.M.C.A. Mr. Hodgkinson’s spray of bullets struck four people, the police said, including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, who had been taking part in a morning baseball practice with other congressional Republicans in an adjacent park. Mr. Scalise was severely wounded. After he underwent a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg, doctors said late Thursday that his condition was critical but improving. He is expected to remain in the hospital “for some time,” according to a hospital statement. Mr. Hodgkinson, 66, died in a firefight with police officers. The authorities said he was armed with a handgun and an SKS 7.62-millimeter semiautomatic assault rifle. Both weapons were bought in March, officials said, and Mr. Hodgkinson held a valid firearm owner’s identification card issued by the Illinois State Police. The SKS weapon that the authorities said was used in the attack is a semiautomatic infantry rifle designed in the 1940s in the Soviet Union and reproduced in China and a handful of nations formerly aligned with Russia. It fires the same medium-powered ammunition as the first generation of Kalashnikov assault rifles, which replaced the SKS in Soviet military service. "
"The prospect of your bank adjusting your mortgage and lowering those monthly payments probably seems quite attractive, especially if you’re in bankruptcy. It looks a little different when the bank also extends the terms of your loan by decades and you have to pay back much more money. Plaintiffs in several lawsuits are accusing Wells Fargo of doing exactly that. Any change to a payment plan for a person in bankruptcy is subject to approval by bankruptcy courts and the parties involved, but the lawsuits contend that Wells Fargo did not seek such approval. The lender says it did notify the borrowers and the courts. But according to court documents, Wells Fargo has been putting through unrequested changes to such loans since 2015. During this period, the bank was also under attack for its practice of opening unwanted accounts for customers to meet sales quotas. Wells Fargo has already been admonished by bankruptcy judges in North Carolina and Pennsylvania for unsolicited loan changes: One judge called the practice “beyond the pale of due process.” "
"President Trump is taking one of the most concrete steps of his presidency on Thursday to address the employment prospects of workers left behind by the current economic expansion. In doing so, he also joins a long-running and occasionally contentious debate over whether those workers have the skills they need to land desirable jobs. Mr. Trump’s action comes in the form of an executive order expanding federally funded apprenticeship programs. The order would create a category of programs that industry groups and other third parties could develop and then submit for Labor Department approval, rather than working within existing department guidelines. “Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees,” Mr. Trump said. “Instead apprentices earn while they learn.” Mr. Trump would redirect over $100 million of federal job training money to pay for the new apprenticeships, supplementing $90 million in funding for the existing program. Corporate groups hailed the idea of expanding apprenticeship programs and making them more flexible, arguing that apprenticeships are a reliable path to good-paying jobs in sectors like retail and hospitality for those who could no longer support themselves in production sectors like manufacturing. “We applaud the Department of Labor and the administration for being willing to look at how to craft this in a way that brings apprenticeships to a new range of audiences,” said Rob Gifford, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, which oversees the industry group’s apprenticeship programs.

"WASHINGTON — “I know you are a very great nation,” Emmanuel Macron told us this month, “and that the United States was founded to let freedom, truth and reason prevail over ignorance and darkness.” The young French president was hastily speaking, in English and French, just before midnight after his American counterpart announced he would withdraw the United States from the landmark climate agreement forged in Paris in 2015. Mr. Macron — whom the French press occasionally mocks for his American-style communications — knew just how to win Yankee hearts. Go back to the origins of his nation and ours: back to the 18th century, and to ideals that no one can repeal. We may scrap and snipe like any old couple, but the United States and France can’t ever be truly untangled. The ties go too far back, a point reinforced at the National Gallery of Art, just down the National Mall from where President Trump said he represented “Pittsburgh, not Paris,” in an exhibition of art from before and after our respective revolutions. “America Collects Eighteenth-Century French Painting” brings together more than five dozen works, by the ancien régime flatterer François Boucher (1703-1770), the Jacobin painter Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) and more obscure names too. It also maps the American taste for French art through loans from museums in 25 states: not just the Met and the Frick and the Getty but places like Alabama’s Birmingham Museum of Art, which has one of this country’s most extensive Rococo collections. “America Collects” is one half of a rocking double feature of French art in the United States capital. In the East Building of the National Gallery is “Frédéric Bazille and the Birth of Impressionism,” an exceptional showcase of a contemporary of Monet and Renoir. Bazille pushed the boundaries of realism but died before he was 30, in 1870. “America Collects” tells a largely by-the-book story of the French 18th century across eight stylishly hung bays. In the early 1700s, the Baroque gave way to the more sentimental Rococo style, typified by soft pinks and blues, light curves and amorous gods and maidens. Eight paintings by Boucher in this exhibition epitomize the mature Rococo, among them a soft-edged portrait (lent by the Harvard Art Museums) of Madame de Pompadour, Louis XV’s mistress, as well as “The Toilette of Venus” and “The Bath of Venus,” twin pictures of that nude goddess cocooned in silks and smothered by cherubs. Figures harden as the French Revolution approaches, and the century ends with an erasure of froufrou and a praise of moral virtues drawn from Greek and Roman examples. "
"WYOMING, Ohio — For more than a year, while their son Otto was a prisoner in North Korea, Fred and Cindy Warmbier knew nothing about his fate. Then, over the last week, the Warmbiers finally received some news: First, the family learned that Otto, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student, was gravely ill, and then that he would be coming home. But his return has been heart-wrenching for the family and this small community that has wrapped its arms around them. On Thursday, doctors caring for Mr. Warmbier at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center delivered grim news: He had suffered “extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of his brain” most likely caused by “cardiopulmonary arrest,” which cut off the blood supply to his brain. Based on two M.R.I. scans sent by the North Koreans, the doctors concluded that Mr. Warmbier had sustained his catastrophic brain injury sometime before April 2016. “His neurological condition can best be described as a state of unresponsive wakefulness,” said Dr. Daniel Kanter, the medical director at the center’s Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit. Mr. Warmbier has “spontaneous eye-opening and blinking,” Dr. Kanter said, but “shows no signs of understanding language, responding to verbal commands or awareness of his surroundings.” The doctors spoke just hours after Fred Warmbier attacked North Korea as a “pariah regime” that had “brutalized and terrorized” his son. He described the homecoming as “bittersweet” and called his son “a fighter,” adding somberly, “We’re trying to make him comfortable.” "
"MOSCOW — In the 15th episode of his annual call-in show on Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin was part Oprah, part King Solomon, part Avenger against an incompetent bureaucracy, and very much a modern czar, fielding questions mostly from aggrieved Russians and promising to personally solve their problems. The televised town hall-style event included the usual cascade of mostly happy economic statistics, concern for social ills, a smattering of foreign policy pronouncements and a peek into Mr. Putin’s personal life. He even allowed a question about relations with the United States from an American: Jeremy Bowling of Mesa, Ariz., submitted his query via video, saying he did not expect it to be used. Mr. Putin again blamed domestic political battles in the United States for renewed Russophobia, and when asked about the recent testimony before Congress by James B. Comey, the fired F.B.I. director, Mr. Putin repeated his view that there was no evidence to support the accusations that Moscow interfered with the American presidential election. In passing, he caustically offered Mr. Comey asylum in Russia, like that given to Edward J. Snowden for leaking classified materials, should Mr. Comey face legal problems for quietly passing information to the news media about his meeting with Mr. Trump. "
"President Trump’s “travel ban” has drawn much scrutiny for its attempt to prohibit citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. But the executive order — which this week was struck down by a second federal court and seems headed to the Supreme Court this summer — has another important part: a reduction, by more than half, of refugee admissions, to 50,000 from 110,000. This provision is bad for the country for security and economic reasons. As discussed in a forthcoming report by the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, it also potentially violates international commitments and American laws. Years ago, United States refugee admissions were based on geographic and ideological preferences — specifically, for refugees from Communist countries and repressive regimes in the Middle East. The Refugee Act of 1980, first introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, was intended to create a more systematic and equitable process for admitting refugees. The act changed the definition of refugee to a person with a “well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion” — and in that way, conformed United States law to United Nations conventions and protocols. The act affirms that it is “the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands,” including caring for them in asylum areas and promoting opportunities for resettlement. While a previous shutdown of all Syrian refugees resettlement was dropped from Mr. Trump’s revised executive order, a 120-day moratorium on all refugee admissions remains. This leaves vetted refugees in dangerous and uncertain conditions — seemingly in violation of the opening declaration of the Refugee Act. The law also requires presidents to consult with Congress in setting annual targets for refugee admissions. This consultation must take place before the start of the fiscal year. The only exception to changing this determination is to increase admissions in the face of a refugee emergency, also with appropriate congressional consultation. Given that the fiscal year 2017 quotas were set at 110,000 by President Obama, in consultation with Congress, it exceeds President Trump’s authority to unilaterally change the number set by his predecessor. The process of setting admissions has now begun for fiscal year 2018, which begins in October, with the recent submission to Congress of the president’s budget. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires this process to include a comprehensive proposal and report from the president regarding refugee and resettlement activity, and in-person discussions with the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress this fall. As the Harvard report explains, the president’s executive order would seem to violate the immigration law by prematurely and unilaterally reducing the refugee cap. It also disregards the law’s call for extending “special humanitarian concerns” to refugee populations — language that would support enhancing emergency allocations for Syrian refugees rather than decreasing the number of admissions.

"It didn’t take long — hours, in fact — after Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot, and six others murdered, in Tucson, Ariz., in January 2011, for liberals to begin pinning political blame for the atrocity. “Giffords’ blood is on Sarah Palin’s hands,” wrote Daily News columnist Michael Daly, noting that the former Alaska governor had put Giffords’ district in a metaphorical cross hairs as a vulnerable Democratic seat. In Slate, Jacob Weisberg issued a broader indictment, never mind that Jared Loughner was a paranoid schizophrenic of no fixed ideological orientation. “The Tea Party movement,” he wrote, made it “appreciably more likely that a disturbed person like Loughner would react, would be able to react, and would not be prevented from reacting, in the crazy way he did.” It will be interesting to read what these and other Tea Party-blamers will have to say after Representative Steve Scalise, the G.O.P. whip in Congress, and three others were shot Wednesday morning (another was hit by shrapnel) by a man whose political leanings were considerably more clear than Loughner’s.

"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Thursday that it had freed the American college student Otto F. Warmbier on “humanitarian grounds” but did not reveal any details of his medical condition or the diplomatic negotiations that led to his release. After he was held for more than a year in North Korea, Mr. Warmbier, 22, was flown from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to Ohio, his home state, in a coma on Tuesday. Mr. Warmbier has been in a coma since shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor during a one-hour trial in March last year, according to his family members, who were briefed by American officials. Doctors were evaluating Mr. Warmbier at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was admitted shortly after the plane carrying him landed in Cincinnati. A one-sentence dispatch on Thursday by the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency was the country’s first official comment on Mr. Warmbier since his release. Mr. Warmbier’s release came after a series of low-key communications between United States and North Korean officials in recent months, even as the North conducted missile tests and Washington hinted at the possibility of military action to stop the country’s advancing nuclear weapons program. In Oslo last month, Joseph Y. Yun, the State Department’s point person on North Korea, met with Choe Son-hui of the North Korean Foreign Ministry, who handled relations with Washington, to push for the release of all four American citizens then being held in the North.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump complained on Thursday about the unfairness of the Russia investigation, wondering on Twitter why Hillary Clinton’s connections to Russia are not being similarly scrutinized. Twitter users quickly responded, with many of them tweeting a version of the same thing: Because you’re the president. Moments later, Mr. Trump continued to rant about his former rival for the presidency, saying — wrongly — that Mrs. Clinton had “destroyed phones w/ hammer, ‘bleached’ emails, & had husband meet w/AG.” Those accusations were apparently references to stories that emerged during the campaign. An aide to Mrs. Clinton (not Mrs. Clinton herself) told the F.B.I. that he had disposed of Mrs. Clinton’s old cellphones by “breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer.” "
"For eight years, we have asked a fresh Student Opinion question every weekday. Each June, just as we do with lesson plans, we round them all up and post them in one place. Below are the 179 questions we’ve asked between September 2016 and June 2017, all still open to comment by any student 13 or older. Each question is based on — and linked to — articles, videos and images from The New York Times, and each Times article is accessible without a digital subscription. This list is also available by PDF, here. Students can use these questions to practice writing persuasively or creatively, or as inspiration for our contests. Teachers might use these prompts as jumping-off points for class discussions, as part of their lesson plans, or as encouragement for their students to engage with what’s happening in the world. At the end of this post we feature our Civil Conversation Challenge lessons, a special student forum and contest held this school year to encourage respectful discourse about some of the biggest issues dividing Americans today, including immigration, guns, climate control, and race, gender and identity. How have you used these questions? Tell us below. ________ Questions for Debate and Persuasive Writing "
"WASHINGTON — The Energy Department is closing an office that works with other countries to develop clean energy technology, another sign of the Trump administration’s retreat on climate-related activities after its withdrawal from the Paris agreement this month. The 11 staff members of the Office of International Climate and Technology were told this month that their positions were being eliminated, according to current and former agency employees. The office was formed in 2010 to help the United States provide technical advice to other nations seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The small office also played a lead role preparing for the annual Clean Energy Ministerial, a forum in which the United States, China, India and other countries shared insights on how best to promote energy efficiency, electric vehicles and other solutions to climate change. Word of the closing came right before Rick Perry, the energy secretary, attended the latest Clean Energy Ministerial meeting in Beijing on June 6 to 8, agency employees said. The Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment. In May, President Trump released a budget for 2018 proposing the “elimination of climate change initiatives” within the Energy Department, including the international climate office. While the budget will require congressional approval, Mr. Perry has authority to reorganize parts of the Energy Department before lawmakers decide on spending levels. "
"In tiny Lesotho, a landlocked kingdom in southern Africa, about one-third of its estimated two million people spent much of the past two years in danger of starving because of the lingering effects of a drought. That is just the latest woe afflicting this cursed nation, and just one example of how fragile the future seems for Africa, large parts of which face the prospect of new famine and, in consequence, further catastrophic displacement within and among their growing populations. More than 40 years ago, I made Lesotho the centerpiece of a book, “The Alms Race,” that explored why so many development projects kept failing. I chose it because in 1974 it received more development aid per capita than any other nation. It could also have been voted most likely to vindicate Thomas Malthus’s warning in 1798 that human numbers would inevitably outrun the resources on which our lives depend. Today, Lesotho’s experience since the 1970s is an even stronger case study of what happens when development plans ignore the reality that such efforts can be a recipe for exploding human numbers. The kingdom’s sad history also offers an urgent, cautionary tale of how rapid population growth can nullify development efforts that might otherwise let an emerging nation endure periods of abnormal weather. Now, as Lesotho’s story is being retold in many of the 17 other African nations suffering drought, the Trump administration in particular should pay heed to what Lesotho can teach us. Instead, it has announced that the United States will cut its annual contribution to the United Nations Population Fund, which promotes family planning. That reckless move — followed by the even more reckless withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement — could only increase the growing number of desperate migrants who for decades have been fleeing famine and war in too many corners of the globe.
