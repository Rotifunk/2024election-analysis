"The United States undercut China’s technology ambitions on Tuesday, advancing a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies to sell their products in this country. The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to move forward with a plan that would prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security. The decision takes direct aim at Huawei, which makes telecommunications network equipment and smartphones, and its main Chinese rival, ZTE, sending a message that the government doesn’t trust them. A day earlier, the government barred ZTE from using components made in the United States, saying the company had failed to punish employees who violated American sanctions against North Korea and Iran. The moves intensify an already testy fight between China and the United States for high-tech supremacy. Although tensions have simmered for years, the two economic powerhouses are threatening a global trade war as they look to protect their most advanced industries. Long bedeviled by political concerns about its ties to the Chinese government, Huawei (pronounced “HWA-way”) has spent the better part of the last decade trying to sell its equipment and phones in the United States. The company made a big push in the United States with a new line of smartphones this year. But that effort was derailed when AT&T, appearing to bow to government security concerns, walked away from a deal to sell the devices. "
"MOSCOW — At least one bright spot stands out in the Russian economy, even as its prospects darken in the face of escalating sanctions: the manufacture of work uniforms. The production of specialized work clothes, including bulletproof vests, is one of the lone growth areas in the economy, up by 27 percent, said Igor Nikolaev, director of the Strategic Analysis Institute at the FBK auditing and consulting firm. The comments came at an otherwise gloomy news conference Tuesday focused on Russia’s economic prospects. That statistic, amid a generally dormant economy kept afloat as usual by energy sales, seemed to underscore what many analysts are saying at the moment: President Vladimir V. Putin’s increasingly aggressive posture toward the West is producing a boomerang effect, with an isolated Russia likely to suffer long-term economic damage as a result. The deterioration reflects a growing awareness in Western capitals that Russia, growing ever more hostile, should be treated as a threat rather than a mere annoyance. That in turn is pushing them toward a unified front in challenging Moscow over such serial transgressions as destabilizing its neighbors, assassinating its critics abroad, meddling in the elections of other countries, tolerating the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government and cyberskirmishing. The confrontation is likely to only get worse, analysts say, for one main reason: Mr. Putin and his closest advisers are convinced they are justified in their policies and have persuaded important portions of the elite as well as the bulk of Russians that the country is thriving, rebuilding its global muscle rather than weakening itself. “The party of war has won within the Russian elite,” said Yuliy A. Nisnevich, a political-science professor. “There are people in the elites who would like the confrontation to stop — these are the people who would like to spend or earn money abroad. But the party of war, the people who get their money inside the country and live here, is prevalent now.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. High hopes on North Korea, a battle over values in Europe and an apology in Britain. Here’s the latest: • The C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, above, met secretly with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, recently to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between Mr. Kim and President Trump, according to two people briefed on the trip. The revelation follows fresh evidence of a diplomatic thaw underway on the Korean Peninsula, showing that a once-unthinkable encounter between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim has become far more likely. Meanwhile, in Syria, inspectors were seeking to enter Douma, a suburb of Damascus, where the U.S. and Western allies say President Bashar al-Assad’s forces dropped chemical weapons. Here’s a look at the group that sent the inspectors, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Syrian refugees in Turkey who are following the crackdown are reliving the trauma from a distance. And the White House erupted into open conflict over new sanctions against Russia. After one of Mr. Trump’s advisers said Nikki Haley, the ambassador to the U.N., had gotten “ahead of the curve” in announcing the new penalties amid “momentary confusion,” Ms. Haley then fired back. The rift reinforced questions about Mr. Trump’s foreign policy — and who speaks for his administration. _____ "
"FRONT PAGE An article on Tuesday about President Trump’s decision to reject new sanctions against Russia, relying on information provided by a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, referred incorrectly to an increase of Russian online trolling activity that occurred around the time the United States launched airstrikes against Syria. The increase was noted among Russian hashtags, not bots. Additionally, the information should not have been attributed to the department’s spokesman, Tyler Q. Houlton. BUSINESS DAY An article on Tuesday about the 2018 Pulitzer Prizes misspelled the surname of the editor of pictures for Reuters. He is Ahmad Masood, not Maood. • An article on Tuesday about a Senate bill that would have exempted businesses on tribal lands from federal labor standards misstated how many more votes were needed to end a filibuster blocking a package of bills that included the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act. The number was five, not six. SPORTS An article on Tuesday about the results of the Boston Marathon misidentified the runner who said, “I was in third or fourth, and I thought, ‘I probably shouldn’t drop out.’” It was Desiree Linden, not Shalane Flanagan. Ms. Linden went on to win the women’s race. THE ARTS A review on Saturday about the Massenet opera “Cendrillon” referred incorrectly to the history of the word “carosse,” which means royal coach. It is an archaic French word, not a word from the Old French language. OBITUARIES An obituary on Monday about the filmmaker Milos Forman misstated where he shot the film “Amadeus.” It was Czechoslovakia — not the Czech Republic, which did not exist until 1993, nine years after “Amadeus” was released. The obituary also referred incorrectly to Mr. Forman’s biological father. He moved from Czechoslovakia to Ecuador, not Peru, but he was not living in South America when Mr. Forman found him in the 1960s; he had moved again, to New York, in 1945. • An obituary on Tuesday about the actor R. Lee Ermey described incorrectly an action by Mr. Ermey’s character, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, in the film “Full Metal Jacket.” Sgt. Hartman punches a recruit in the gut; he does not knee him in the groin. Errors are corrected during the press run whenever possible, so some errors noted here may not have appeared in all editions.

"“With all due respect, I don’t get confused.” NIKKI HALEY, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, after administration officials suggested her announcement of further sanctions against Russia had been premature. "
"There are nearly twice as many registered Democrats in New York State as Republicans. Word, however, hasn’t reached Albany. In 2011, a small band of elected Democrats broke from their caucus and called themselves “independent,” giving Republicans de facto control of the State Senate and allowing them to kill all manner of needed reforms through a mix of Albany jiu-jitsu, old-fashioned gerrymandering and, until recently, a dash of help from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Now, all but one of these ersatz Democrats appear ready to rejoin their party’s fold. New Yorkers this election season will have a chance to turn the Senate over to Democratic hands — the best shot at enacting a backlog of humane, necessary legislation blocked by Senate Republicans for more than half a decade. First on the agenda should be enacting early voting, to make it easier for millions of working people to cast their ballots. It’s notoriously hard to vote in New York, where party machines have for years successfully depressed turnout to keep incumbents in office. Registering voters automatically would help, and early voting — at least a week in advance — would bring the state into the 21st century. A working Democratic majority in the Senate could show political courage by taking on the state’s campaign finance laws, essentially one giant loophole that helps promote Albany’s dysfunction. They could start by ending New York’s L.L.C. scam: As the rules stand, a donor can brazenly contribute as much as he or she wants to a candidate by creating multiple limited liability companies that separately funnel money to a single campaign. The Democrats should also enact comprehensive public financing of campaigns, a measure Senate Republicans have blocked that would encourage competition in state elections. "
"Barbara Bush, the widely admired wife of one president and the fiercely loyal mother of another, died on Tuesday at her home in Houston. She was 92. Jim McGrath, a family spokesman, announced the death in a statement posted to Twitter. On Sunday, the office of her husband, former President George Bush, issued a statement saying that after consulting her family and her doctors, Mrs. Bush had “decided not to seek additional medical treatment and will instead focus on comfort care.” The Bushes had celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in January, making them the longest-married couple in presidential history. Mrs. Bush had been hospitalized with pneumonia in December 2013. She underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer in 2008 and had heart surgery four months later. As the wife of the 41st president and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush, Mrs. Bush was only the second woman in American history to have a son of hers follow his father to the White House. (Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams and mother of John Quincy Adams, was the first.) "
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump dispatched the C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo to North Korea to meet with its leader, Kim Jong-un, in recent weeks to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, two people briefed on the secret trip said on Tuesday. Mr. Trump alluded to Mr. Pompeo’s mission when he said on Tuesday afternoon that the United States was in direct talks with North Korea at “extremely high levels,” and that the White House was looking at five sites for a potential meeting of the two leaders. The White House has used intelligence, rather than diplomatic channels, to communicate with North Korea, ever since last month, when Mr. Trump unexpectedly accepted Mr. Kim’s invitation to meet. Mr. Pompeo, who is awaiting confirmation as secretary of state, has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to other officials. And he has been in close touch with the director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, who American officials said brokered Mr. Kim’s invitation to Mr. Trump. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump also said he would give his blessing to North and South Korea to “discuss the end of the war” when the leaders of those countries meet this month, opening the door to a peace treaty that would replace the armistice that halted the Korean War in 1953. His statements, which came as he welcomed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to his oceanfront estate here, were fresh evidence of a diplomatic thaw underway on the Korean Peninsula, and made a once-unthinkable encounter between him and Mr. Kim far more likely. "
"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis urged President Trump to get congressional approval before the United States launched airstrikes against Syria last week, but was overruled by Mr. Trump, who wanted a rapid and dramatic response, military and administration officials said. Mr. Trump, the officials said, wanted to be seen as backing up a series of bellicose tweets with action, but was warned that an overly aggressive response risked igniting a wider war with Russia. Friday night’s limited strikes on three targets, which lasted under two minutes, were the compromise. The debate reflects a divide between Mr. Trump and the defense secretary, who, like no other member of the cabinet, has managed to maintain a cordial relationship with the president even while reining him in. Until this month, Mr. Mattis had a buffer at the White House in the former national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who often deferred to the defense secretary, a retired four-star Marine general. The arrival of Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, means that buffer is gone. Administration and congressional officials said the hawkish Mr. Bolton is not expected to defer to the defense secretary; already, neoconservative members of the Republican foreign policy establishment have started to air concerns that Mr. Mattis is ceding strategic territory to Iran and Russia in Syria.

"A former counterterrorism agent at the F.B.I. who gave classified documents to the news media in an effort to reveal how the bureau treated minority communities pleaded guilty on Tuesday to the unauthorized disclosure and retention of national defense information. It is the most recent prosecution in a growing series of leak cases being pursued by the Justice Department, which has significantly increased its focus on such investigations since President Trump took office. However, the actions of the agent, Terry J. Albury, largely predate Mr. Trump’s presidency. As a field agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Minneapolis office, Mr. Albury provided a reporter with two documents between February 2016 and Jan. 31, 2017, according to the charges against him. The first document, dated Aug. 17, 2011, described how the bureau evaluated confidential sources; the second, which was undated, concerned “threats posed by certain individuals from a particular Middle Eastern country.” Mr. Albury also possessed, without authorization, “a document relating to the use of an online platform for recruitment by a specific terrorist group.” “Mr. Albury was entrusted by the F.B.I. with a security clearance, which included a responsibility to protect classified national defense information,” Bill Priestap, assistant director of the bureau’s Counterintelligence Division, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Instead, he knowingly disclosed that material to someone not authorized to receive it.” Mr. Albury, 39, faces up to 10 years in prison on each of the two charges, but under his plea agreement, he could receive less than five years. Judge Wilhelmina M. Wright of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota will decide his sentence. "
"In October 2015, John Boehner was driven from office by right-wing members of his own caucus. His successor, Paul Ryan, despite having been chosen as the Republicans’ 2012 vice-presidential nominee based on his ideological bona fides, faced similar pressure from his right as speaker — ultimately deciding to spend only three years in the role before announcing his resignation from the House last week. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, is still leading her caucus despite losing her party’s majority nearly eight years ago. Since the election of Donald Trump, political analysts have expected a left-wing version of the Tea Party movement to arise. But Republicans still suffer from more ideological dissension even after gaining control of Washington. As the 2018 nomination season gets underway, analysts anticipate a network of insurgent candidates and activists to seek a liberal purification of the Democratic Party, in the same way that Tea Party members took aim at a detested Republican “establishment” via a series of formidable primary challenges and congressional leadership battles. Yet there has been no evidence of a national, ideologically motivated rebellion among Democratic primary voters, interest groups or donors. The lack of a “liberal Tea Party” reflects a fundamental and longstanding asymmetry between Republicans and Democrats. The Republican Party is the agent of an ideological movement; most Republican politicians, activists and voters view their party as existing to advance the conservative cause. Because their goals of reducing the scope of government and reversing cultural change are difficult to achieve in practice, Republican officeholders are vulnerable to accusations of failing to uphold principles. They risk becoming targets of interest groups, media outlets and rival politicians who see their role as enforcing symbolic commitment to conservative orthodoxy. "
"Ben Flambert sat wrapped in an apron at a barber shop on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, listening intently as Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte explained why she was leading an effort to get the city to designate the surrounding neighborhood the Little Haiti Business and Cultural District. Across the street from the barber shop are a Haitian bakery, a Haitian church and a Haitian restaurant, Ms. Bichotte, the first Haitian-American woman elected to office in New York City, explained. People of Haitian descent make up 20 percent of the Caribbean population in Flatbush and the local Haitian parade used to pass directly in front of the barber shop. “Miami already has a Little Haiti,” Mr. Flambert, 42, a bus driver for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said as he sipped from a miniature bottle of Rhum Barbancourt. “But the Haitian presence out here is real strong. It makes sense.” Not everyone in the central Brooklyn neighborhood agrees. Last year, an area bounded by Flatbush, Church and Nostrand Avenues was designated the Little Caribbean cultural district, making a separate Haitian district redundant, some local leaders say. Ms. Bichotte says there were plans to name the area Little Haiti dating back more than a decade. Now, with momentum fueled by anger over recent slights by President Trump, prominent members of the Haitian community in Brooklyn and New York State are hoping the City Council will officially designate Little Haiti in May.

"Barbara Bush, wife of the 41st president and mother of the 43rd, died on Tuesday at the age of 92, prompting an outpouring of tributes and remembrances. In a statement, President Trump said that “as a wife, mother, grandmother, military spouse and former first lady, Mrs. Bush was an advocate of the American family.” On both sides of the aisle, lawmakers joined him in emphasizing Mrs. Bush’s support for literacy programs. Through the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy and other outlets, it was one of her most treasured causes. “Through her own work to promote literacy as a value in every American home, countless families now have the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in all aspects of their lives,” President Jimmy Carter said in a statement. Mrs. Bush is survived by her husband, her brother, five children, 17 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, many of whom shared tributes of their own. “My grandmother’s entire life was focused on others,” wrote George P. Bush, whose father is Jeb Bush. President George W. Bush, her son, said she was “so much more” than her public persona. “Laura, Barbara, Jenna and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was,” he wrote, referring to his wife, Laura Bush, and their two daughters. “Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end.” Many people noted the priority she placed on her family, despite her career in the public eye. “Mrs. Bush approached her public role with a class and grace seldom matched in our nation’s capital,” wrote Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, where the Bushes lived. “But it was her private role which she prized above all.” President Barack Obama, who succeeded Mr. Bush, and his wife, Michelle Obama, recalled “the generosity she showed to us throughout our time in the White House.” “We’re even more grateful for the way she lived her life — as a testament to the fact that public service is an important and noble calling,” they wrote. And President Bill Clinton, who in 1992 foiled the re-election bid of Mrs. Bush’s husband, George Bush, tweeted that she was “fierce & feisty in support of her family & friends, her country & her causes.” “I’ll always treasure my summer visits to Kennebunkport,” Mr. Clinton said in a statement. “Barbara joked that George and I spent so much time together I had become almost a member of the family, the ‘black sheep’ that had gone astray.” "
"Fox News declared its “full support” for Sean Hannity on Tuesday, even as the network acknowledged that its executives were caught by surprise when the conservative commentator was named as a client of President Trump’s personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen. The backing from his bosses was not exactly a shock: Mr. Hannity is the top ratings draw at Fox News, and he has been unapologetic about what he described as an informal, “de minimis” arrangement with Mr. Cohen, whom he has vigorously defended on air. His Monday night show, hours after the relationship was revealed in a Manhattan courtroom, went on as scheduled. But in the past, Mr. Hannity had run into trouble for crossing the line from commentator to activist — and Tuesday’s subdued reaction speaks to the new realities at Trump-era Fox News. In 2010, Mr. Hannity was yanked from a Tea Party rally in Ohio after network executives objected to his appearance. “I don’t think we should be supporting the Tea Party or any other party,” Rupert Murdoch, the channel’s owner, said at the time. In 2016, Mr. Hannity’s appearance in a Trump campaign ad earned a tart rebuke from the network, which declared “he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election.” Times have changed. With Megyn Kelly and Bill O’Reilly gone from Fox News, Mr. Hannity is its undisputed prime-time star, and his “Trump at all costs” brio is the template for a network that has tacked rightward since Election Day.

"WASHINGTON — After publicly flirting last week with having the United States rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Trump appeared to rebuff the idea once and for all late Tuesday. In a Twitter post at 10:49 p.m., Mr. Trump said that although Japan and South Korea would like the United States to join the 11 other nations in the multilateral trade agreement, he had no intention of doing so. The decision put an apparent end to a meandering trade policy in which Mr. Trump pulled out of the deal in his first week in office, before suggesting last week that he was having second thoughts. “Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work,” Mr. Trump wrote from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. “Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers.” The comments confounded some trade experts on Tuesday night because South Korea is not in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Trump followed up with a shot at the World Trade Organization, which he said was “bad” to the United States. The declaration comes as Mr. Trump has been in discussions with South Korea about peace talks with North Korea and as the president hosts Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Mar-a-Lago, where they are expected to discuss trade, among other issues. "
"HONG KONG — Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and nominee to be the next secretary of state, traveled to North Korea and met with its leader, Kim Jong-un, the strongest indicator to date that plans for direct talks between Mr. Kim and President Trump are moving ahead. If talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim do happen, they would be the highest-level meeting between the two countries. No sitting president has ever met — or even spoken on the phone — with a North Korean leader. Here’s a look at previous attempts at dialogue and how the possible summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim came about. While no sitting American president has met with a North Korean leader, two former presidents have. Jimmy Carter met Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder, in 1994. Against the wishes of Bill Clinton, then the president, Mr. Carter traveled to North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, after American intelligence agencies said they believed the North was processing plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. Mr. Carter’s meeting with Mr. Kim, who died three weeks later, set in motion the resumption of talks that led to what was called the Agreed Framework. Under that agreement, North Korea halted the construction of two reactors that could be used to produce fuel for nuclear weapons in exchange for oil and the promise of two light-water nuclear reactors that could produce energy but not weapons fuel.

This spinoff of “The Vampire Diaries” has been almost as resilient as the supernatural creatures it depicts. After facing potential cancellation and tying up major story lines at the end of Season 4, the CW renewed the drama for one final year. That means the vampire siblings Klaus and Elijah Mikaelson, who were separated at the end of last season, might yet reunite. In this episode, Klaus’s daughter, Hope (Danielle Rose Russell), resorts to drastic measures to bring her father back to New Orleans. And RIVERDALE leads in at 8, as tensions rise between Betty and Veronica, and a school production of “Carrie: The Musical” comes under threat. NBA PLAYOFFS On TNT. On Sunday evening, something unusual happened to LeBron James: He lost a Game 1 in the first round for the first time ever. It wasn’t particularly close, either, as the Indiana Pacers, led by Victor Oladipo, beat the Cleveland Cavaliers by 18 points. James will surely return invigorated in Game 2, at 7 p.m. on TNT. At 9:30, James Harden and the Houston Rockets will look to win again versus the Minnesota Timberwolves after a Game 1 victory. AMERICA INSIDE OUT WITH KATIE COURIC 10 p.m. on National Geographic.

The cast includes Jason Segel, Condola Rashad, Martin Sheen and Danny Glover. "
"I came to America from India at age 23. That was in 1985, a golden age of immigration to this country. It didn’t feel like it, though, because it still took my husband, a medical physicist, and me a good seven years to trade up from our student visas for an H-1B for him and an H-4 spouse visa for me. Eventually we got the ultimate prize: green cards — which, to our amusement, weren’t even green back then. In the decades since, wait times for green cards for Indian techies have become impossibly long, with particularly unfortunate consequences for H-4 spouses who want to work. And President Trump is now poised to undo a 2015 Obama-era regulation that took a small stab at addressing their plight. An H-1B, which is primarily reserved for high-tech talent, allowed my now ex-husband to accept a job at a Detroit cancer hospital. But my H-4 barred me from working, even though I already had several years of journalism experience along with a degree in biology and chemistry. I had to wait another two years for my green card before I got the legal right to earn a living. Putting my career on hold until I was 30 was frustrating, especially since we had a baby to support. But Indian spouses on H-4s — well over 90 percent of them women — who came after me envy my experience. When I arrived, the wait times for green cards for Indian H-1Bs averaged about four years. But over the next several decades, the wait steadily grew. By 2005, it was more like 10 to 15 years. Today, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research outfit, Indian H-1Bs can expect to stand in the green card queue for several decades. This happened because in 1990, Congress imposed an annual limit on employment-based green cards that was far too low for America’s growing economy. This was on top of the overall green card cap and country-specific quotas. With the I.T. revolution taking off and Silicon Valley aggressively recruiting Indians on H-1Bs, the timing of this third blow couldn’t have been more inopportune. "
"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — President Trump won 92 of Tennessee’s 95 counties in the 2016 election, making this state a seemingly daunting target for Democrats hoping to flip a seat in the Senate. But a decade before that commanding victory, another politician won an even bigger landslide. The state’s Democratic governor, Phil Bredesen, swept all 95 counties to win a second term. Now Mr. Bredesen is running for the Senate seat being vacated by a Republican, Bob Corker, and his track record makes him the rarest of Democrats: a formidable non-incumbent candidate in a solidly Republican state who can allow his party to go on the offensive in an improbable place. “There have to be hundreds of thousands of people who voted for me and voted for Donald Trump,” Mr. Bredesen said in a recent interview after meeting with a group of doctoral students from the Bredesen Center, a partnership between the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is named for him. Over breakfast at a restaurant here, Mr. Bredesen and the students talked about subjects like nuclear power, supercomputing and research funding. There is early evidence of his strength, or at least fond memories of his time in office: A poll released this month by Middle Tennessee State University found Mr. Bredesen with a 10-point lead over his expected Republican opponent, Representative Marsha Blackburn. Twenty percent of Republican voters said they would vote for Mr. Bredesen. Republican voters in Tennessee “don’t consider him an evil liberal person,” said Victor H. Ashe, a Republican and former longtime mayor of Knoxville. He predicted a tight race and said Ms. Blackburn could not afford to lose a significant chunk of Republican voters. "
"Was Robert Mueller, the special counsel, complicit in one of the worst scandals in the F.B.I.’s history — the decades-long wrongful imprisonment of four men for a murder they didn’t commit? This question, which has been raised before, is being addressed again — this time by some of President Trump’s most ardent supporters on the right, especially Fox News’s Sean Hannity but also Rush Limbaugh and others. My friend Alan Dershowitz, the retired Harvard Law School professor, has also weighed in. In an April 8 interview with John Catsimatidis on his New York radio show, Mr. Dershowitz asserted that Mr. Mueller was “the guy who kept four innocent people in prison for many years in order to protect the cover of Whitey Bulger as an F.B.I. informer.” Mr. Mueller, he said, was “right at the center of it.” Mr. Bulger was a notorious crime boss in Boston, the head of the Winter Hill Gang, and also a secret source for the F.B.I. There is no evidence that the assertion is true. I was the federal judge who presided over a successful lawsuit brought against the government by two of those men and the families of the other two, who had died in prison. Based on the voluminous evidence submitted in the trial, and having written a 105-page decision awarding them $101.8 million, I can say without equivocation that Mr. Mueller, who worked in the United States attorney’s office in Boston from 1982 to 1988, including a brief stint as the acting head of the office, had no involvement in that case. He was never even mentioned. The case wasn’t about Whitey Bulger but another mobster the F.B.I. was also protecting, the hit man Joseph Barboza, who lied when he testified that the four men had killed Edward Deegan, a low-level mobster, in 1965. Mr. Barboza was covering for the real killers, and the F.B.I. went along because of his importance as an informant. But the evidence — or rather, lack of it — hasn’t stopped the piling on against Mr. Mueller, particularly by Mr. Hannity. In a March 20 broadcast, he said, “Robert Mueller was the U.S. attorney in charge while these men were rotting in prison while certain agents in the F.B.I. under Mueller covered up the truth.” "
"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Jennifer Szalai became The New York Times’s nonfiction book critic in January. Before that, she was an editor for the Book Review. Below is a lightly edited Q. and A. with Ms. Szalai on her new role and what she hopes to do with it. What has drawn you to nonfiction? I came to work in book reviews after graduate school, where I studied international relations, and there was something about that background that informed what I did, even when reviewing books that weren’t obviously about politics. I appreciate the clarity of nonfiction, and there’s something truly satisfying about a thoughtful explication of the world as it is. But the world isn’t always so clear, and I love reading fiction too, which can capture the more ambiguous aspects of experience. Which topics do you like to read about and write about? The first review I did as the nonfiction critic was of a couple of books related to President Trump. I was interested in reading them, but a critic today could probably spend most of her time reading and reviewing Trump-related books, which I don’t necessarily want to do! In terms of my interests, they’re pretty catholic. I’m looking for something that I respond to. Sometimes it’s at an intellectual level that’s obvious and easy to articulate, or sometimes something’s just presented in a way that speaks to me. You typically review one book a week, so what does your week look like? Do you set goals for each day, and what kinds of notes do you take so that they’re helpful but not overwhelming? "
"WASHINGTON — A looming trade war between the United States and China has put Qualcomm, one of America’s largest technology companies, squarely in the middle of the battlefield. A major supplier in both China and the United States, the San Diego-based chip maker has long managed to play the trading relationship between the world’s two largest economies to its advantage. But an escalating trade battle over which country will dominate the technologies of the future is now threatening Qualcomm’s business and its growth. On Monday, Qualcomm lost the ability to export semiconductors to one of its biggest customers after the United States banned Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corporation from purchasing American technology for seven years. In China, Qualcomm’s plan to acquire NXP Semiconductors, a critical part of its growth strategy, has been stalled by a prolonged antitrust review, a move critics see as Chinese retaliation for President Trump’s aggressive trade moves. On Thursday, Chinese officials said that Qualcomm will have to make more concessions to compensate for the market power it would enjoy after completing the deal, without providing details. The White House, which has already threatened tariffs on more than $150 billion in Chinese goods, is preparing new restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States and could limit American partnerships with Chinese firms abroad. Such a move could place further restraints on American companies with advanced technology, like Qualcomm, General Electric and Boeing, as they seek to form overseas partnerships. It would also likely incite more retaliation from the Chinese. On Tuesday, the administration advanced a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies, including Huawei, one of Qualcomm’s competitors and a customer, to sell their products in America. Qualcomm’s situation illustrates the perils of trying to punish a major trading partner that has become a crucial link in supply chains stretching across the globe. By targeting foreign players with ties to their own markets, the United States and China are putting their own economic futures at risk. The question is whether the Trump administration will balk at paying that price — or see its goal of punishing China for unfair trade practices as more important than any collateral damage that could ensue.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Mike Pompeo’s secret visit to North Korea underscores President Trump’s unorthodox approach to one of the riskiest gambits of his presidency. Mr. Trump confirmed that he sent Mr. Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, above, to meet Kim Jong-un over Easter weekend. (Mr. Pompeo is still awaiting confirmation to his new post, secretary of state.) Mr. Pompeo went to lay the groundwork for a meeting between his boss and Mr. Kim. No date has been set, though Mr. Trump has said late May or early June. And officials are still discussing the location. The Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, has emerged as a top choice. No sitting president has ever met — or even spoken on the phone — with a North Korean leader. Here’s a look at previous attempts at dialogue — and how the possible summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim came about. _____ "

very April, the entire New York Times newsroom gathers together for the announcement of the Pulitzer Prizes. They’re the Oscars of journalism (or at least that’s how we explained it to our children), and in my 13 years at The Times, there’s never been a year that we didn’t win at least one. Tallies aside, I’m always inspired by the variety of coverage that gets the nod. There are simply so many different kinds of journalists and so many different ways to create memorable, impactful journalism — as evidenced by this year’s winners, and those of the past. I actually went back and read quite a few of our archival winners this week, which was both inspiring and humbling. Below you’ll find a selection of recent and still relevant winners that I handpicked based on what I admired most and what I think you’d enjoy reading. But before we get all archival, it’s worth highlighting this year’s winners — some of whom can be seen celebrating in the photo below. "
"The tabloid news company American Media Inc. agreed to let a former Playboy model out of a contract that had kept her from talking freely about an alleged affair with Donald J. Trump. The settlement agreement, reached on Wednesday, ends a lawsuit brought by the model, Karen McDougal, and protects the president from being drawn into a legal case involving efforts to buy the silence of women who had stories to tell about him during the 2016 campaign. He still faces another lawsuit from Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Ms. Clifford is suing to get out of a deal that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, arranged in 2016 for her silence about an alleged affair. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied both women’s stories. In August 2016, A.M.I., which owns The National Enquirer, acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story about Mr. Trump — which it never ran — in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her current career as a fitness specialist. Under the terms of Wednesday’s settlement, A.M.I. has the right to up to $75,000 of the profits from any deal she makes in the next year for her story about the alleged affair. According to her lawyer, Peter K. Stris, Ms. McDougal can keep the $150,000 payment, and the publisher will retain the rights to photographs of her that it already has. In a statement, A.M.I. called the settlement an “amicable resolution” and said that under the new agreement it would devote an upcoming magazine cover and feature article to Ms. McDougal, and would run several of her fitness columns in its publications.

"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week: Environmentalists and nuclear power make odd bedfellows, the world’s shipping sector charts a course, and a handy guide helps you reduce your own carbon footprint. Historically, environmental groups in the United States haven’t been big fans of nuclear power. But in recent years, the threat of climate change and a shifting energy landscape has made the nuclear question — well, a lot more complicated. You could see that tension last week in New Jersey, where the legislature passed a sweeping set of bills that would ramp up targets for wind and solar power but would also subsidize three of the state’s nuclear reactors to the tune of $300 million per year. Before the vote, the Natural Resources Defense Council told me they wouldn’t endorse the nuclear provision but wouldn’t actively oppose it, either. Why? New Jersey’s nuclear reactors, which are under consideration for retirement because of competition from cheap natural gas, generated more than one-third of the state’s electricity in 2016 without producing any planet-warming emissions. (Renewables generated less than 5 percent.) Shut those reactors down tomorrow, and they’d mostly be replaced by gas, causing emissions to rise. "
"I don’t know what will happen in the midterm elections. But if Republicans pull it out – that is, if they lose the popular vote by a small enough margin that gerrymandering and the geographic concentration of nonwhite voters frustrate the public’s will – it will be the result of tribalism. It won’t be because the G.O.P. won voters over with a tax cut. That’s not what they expected. The people who rammed through a massive tax cut without hearings or analysis thought they could sell it to voters as free money for everyone; never mind the big bucks for corporations and the wealthy, look at the extra cash we’re putting in your pocket. And history suggested that they might be right: the Bush tax cuts, like the TCJA, offered big breaks to the wealthy but only what amounted to loss leaders for the middle class. Yet as Larry Bartels famously documented in his paper “Homer gets a tax cut,” most people focused on their direct gains, and were unmoved by or unaware of the indirect implications of bigger deficits for government programs they depended on. As a result, the Bush tax cuts were popular – not hugely popular, but more people approved than disapproved, and they were probably a net electoral plus. But not this time. Polling suggests that only a minority – and probably a declining minority — of the public considers the Trump tax cut a good idea. Most people don’t see any benefits from the tax cut in their paychecks. And Republicans have pretty much given up campaigning on the tax cut. Voters are, of course, right to have negative views about TCJA. It’s a mess of a bill; it will do little for economic growth, while increased deficits will create pressure to cut social insurance programs that affect many more people than the relative handful of wealthy stockholders who will win big. But voters should have been negative about the Bush tax cut too. Why do voters seem so much more woke? Why is this time different? "
"Not long ago, the things Emmanuel Macron said this week would not have needed saying. Yet, addressing the European Parliament, the French president — barely 40 and not yet a year in office — sounded almost like a biblical prophet, warning of the rising fascination with antidemocratic and “illiberal” ideas, “the deadly tendency which might lead our continent to the abyss, nationalism, giving up of freedom.” Mr. Macron did not mention anyone by name — not Viktor Orban of Hungary, not Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Poland, not the populists who won in Italy’s national election, not the far-right parties that have spread across Europe on hatred of immigrants, xenophobia, disdain for the rule of law, intolerance of dissent and suspiciousness of international cooperation. Nor did he name Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin, though they are clearly an inspiration and model for the European far right. He did not have to. The struggle between the traditional values of Western liberal democracy and the new forces of authoritarianism, intolerance and nationalism has become a defining challenge of the times. Invoking the title of a well-known German trilogy by Hermann Broch about the deterioration of values in the years before World War I, Mr. Macron said: “I don’t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past. I want to belong to a generation that has decided forcefully to defend its democracy.” Mr. Macron’s crushing defeat of France’s reactionary National Front last May raised hopes that the tide of illiberalism was turning in Europe. But Prime Minister Orban’s easy win in Hungary’s national election on April 8 and the success of antiestablishment parties in Italy a month earlier have signaled otherwise. To the east, Russia’s brazen violation of international norms has only increased despite broad economic sanctions — witness the chemical assault on a double agent in Britain, while to the west, the Trump administration relentlessly pursues its chaotic assault on American values and traditions. Mr. Macron said political change was inevitable, but it should not mean abandonment of democratic principles. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Talk of a Korean peace treaty, a top civil servant resigns in Japan and a SpaceX launch. Here’s what you need to know: • The 65-year-old war on the Korean Peninsula may be coming to an end. South Korea confirmed that it had been in talks with the North and the U.S. about negotiating a formal peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice that halted, but did not end, the Korean War. A treaty could increase pressure on the North to give up its nuclear program, and on the U.S. to withdraw troops from the peninsula. President Trump supports the effort. But his decision to send Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and secretary of state nominee, on a secret trip to the North reflects the central role that spies — rather than diplomats — played in brokering an opening. One thorny issue is where to hold the meeting — a decision complicated by the limited range of North Korea’s aging fleet. Here’s a look at previous diplomatic efforts. Above, Chung Eui-yong, second from left, the South Korean president’s national security adviser, visiting Washington last week. _____ "
"Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York is moving to change New York state law so that he and other local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to President Trump who have been pardoned, according to a letter Mr. Schneiderman sent to the governor and state lawmakers on Wednesday. The move, if approved by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Legislature, would serve notice that the legal troubles of the president and his aides may continue without the efforts of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Under the plan, Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, seeks to exempt New York’s double jeopardy law from cases involving presidential pardons, according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The current law and the concept of double jeopardy in general mean that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice. Right now, New York state law prevents people from being prosecuted more than once for crimes related to the same act, even if the original prosecution was in federal court. There are already a number of exceptions to the law, and the letter says that Mr. Schneiderman is proposing to add a new one that could be used if federal pardons are issued. Mr. Trump and Mr. Schneiderman have a contentious past. Mr. Schneiderman led a three-year investigation of Trump University that resulted in a $25 million settlement. For his part, the president has dubbed Mr. Schneiderman “the nation’s worst AG.” He has also called him a “lightweight” and a “total loser,” and even tweeted that he wore eyeliner. While Mr. Schneiderman’s jurisdiction does not encompass many of the areas being investigated by Mr. Mueller, a president has no authority to commute sentences or pardon offenses at the state level. That leaves convictions obtained by the state attorney general’s office or any other local prosecutor outside the president’s ability to intervene. The proposal would be structured so that it would not affect people who sought clemency after long jail sentences, an aide to Mr. Schneiderman said. "
"WASHINGTON — Time Warner’s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, vigorously defended his company’s $85.4 billion merger with AT&T on Wednesday, saying the deal was necessary to confront “tectonic changes” in entertainment caused by internet competitors like Netflix and Amazon. Mr. Bewkes was the first top executive from Time Warner and AT&T to take the stand in federal court to argue against the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the merger. The Justice Department had sued to stop the blockbuster deal in November, arguing that a union of the two companies would harm consumers and weaken competition. Before a packed courtroom on Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes portrayed Time Warner as an underdog against Silicon Valley giants that can reach hundreds of millions of users and are spending billions of dollars a year to produce original shows that compete with Time Warner’s HBO and Turner Broadcasting. “We don’t have the tech platform, don’t have the engineers, don’t have the infrastructure,” Mr. Bewkes said in arguing for his company’s need to combine with AT&T, a mobile wireless and satellite television giant with access to more than 150 million subscribers nationwide. In cross-examination, a lawyer for the Justice Department grilled Mr. Bewkes on the underdog narrative, and presented an internal document that Mr. Bewkes wrote in January 2017 to Time Warner’s board that touted the company’s revenue projections. The document also showed that Time Warner was planning to introduce digital products even without the potential merger. Mr. Bewkes testimony came as the trial that will decide the fate of AT&T’s bid for the company enters its fifth week. The trial is being closely watched for the implications it could have on the course of antitrust policy and for how it could shape the landscape of entertainment as legacy media and telecom companies scramble to bulk up against new competition from Silicon Valley.

"WICHITA, Kan. — Federal jurors convicted three men on Wednesday of plotting to blow up an apartment complex where Somali refugees live and pray in Garden City, Kan. The domestic terrorism verdict came at a time when threats against religious and racial minorities are rising nationally, and the case drew interest from the highest levels of the Justice Department. “The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “That’s not just illegal — it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it.” The men, Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright and Patrick Stein, all of whom are white, appeared stoic as the verdicts were read at the federal courthouse in Wichita. Defense lawyers had tried to convince jurors that their clients were manipulated by the F.B.I., and had been unfairly targeted for exercising their rights to own guns and speak freely. “He was a member of a militia. He loved his guns. This was a lifestyle,” Melody Brannon, a lawyer for Mr. Allen, told the mostly white jury. “The government tried to criminalize that lifestyle.” The trial, which played out over about a month, focused on a period before the 2016 presidential election when a paid F.B.I. informant infiltrated a militia group that included the three men and secretly recorded hours of their conversations. Politics were front and center throughout the trial, with defense lawyers portraying the F.B.I. as a bullying-government force that used its informant to steer their clients from hateful speech to violent plotting. The courtroom critiques of the F.B.I. came after a series of condemnations of the bureau by President Trump, who overwhelmingly carried Kansas in 2016. "
"An American-educated Iranian expert on water who returned to Iran to take a cabinet-level job in the government of President Hassan Rouhani officially resigned in exile on Wednesday, a month after having left the country while under pressure from hard-liners. In a letter posted on his Twitter account, the expert, Kaveh Madani, 36, who had been Iran’s No. 2 environment official, wrote that hard-liners had considered him an outsider and a threat. Members of the security forces had hacked into his computers, he said. He had been called in for questioning in January during the arrests of nearly a dozen people involved in environmental activism. One of those arrested, Kavous Seyed Emami, a well-known professor and naturalist, died in Evin prison in February under suspicious circumstances. Mr. Madani, the deputy head of the Department of the Environment, a cabinet position, had been visiting Bangkok in March when a private photo taken five years ago in the United States showing him dancing was leaked on the internet. Iranian officials are supposed to adhere to strict laws that forbid dancing. After months of pressure and intimidation, Mr. Madani decided not to return to Iran and does not want to disclose his current location. “I feel things are not getting better but getting worse and affecting my beloved ones,” Mr. Madani wrote. “I say this with a broken but hopeful heart. I resign.” He is the second associate of President Rouhani to resign in recent weeks. The mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Ali Najafi, resigned last month after criticism over his presence at a show where grade-school girls performed a traditional dance. He resigned citing health reasons. The resignations are a sign of the increasing pressure being exerted by the hard-line judiciary, the news media and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Mr. Rouhani and his faction of reformists and moderates after protests in December and economic upheaval in recent months. President Trump has threatened to withdraw the United States from the 2015 nuclear agreement, a signature achievement of Mr. Rouhani’s that the Iranian president said would bring economic prosperity. Mr. Madani had been an outsider in Iran’s closed political system. He had worked abroad for nearly 15 years and was brought in by Mr. Rouhani not only to address Iran’s water crisis, but to set an example for other Iranian expatriates to return to Iran. In another Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Madani wrote that he did not hold dual citizenship, and had done nothing wrong. “I came with the excitement of a young man, love for my land and hope for improvement,” he said.

"THE WOMAN’S HOUR
The Great Fight to Win the Vote
By Elaine Weiss
Illustrated. 404 pp. Viking. $28. It’s probably inappropriate to evaluate a work of history on the basis of how many novels can be extracted from its pages; it’s also, if one is a novelist, irresistible. Which real-life situations and characters are so intriguing that they’d be worthy of delving into and depicting in the truly intimate manner that only fiction allows? By this measure — and by several others — “The Woman’s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote,” by the journalist Elaine Weiss, is a gold mine. After Congress passed the 19th Amendment in 1919, ratification needed to occur in 36 states for women’s right to vote to become federal law. By July 1920, the possible 36th state — or the place where the amendment would die after 70 years of strenuous activism — was Tennessee. Thus, for several weeks that summer, in and around Nashville’s statehouse, a frenetic pageant of political organizing, lobbying, demonstrating and double-crossing unfolded among the “Antis,” who opposed the amendment, and the “Suffs,” or suffragists, who supported it. As one legislator declared, “The entire world today has cast its eyes on Tennessee.” Weiss presents a panoramic view of the proceedings, which are alternately juicy (accusations of libel and bribery abounded, and, in spite of Prohibition, the whiskey and bourbon were free-flowing) and procedural. Weiss also provides national and international context: World War I had ended less than two years earlier, and both the war and its aftermath had jumbled established norms of gender, race and employment. In the United States, a physically ailing Woodrow Wilson occupied the White House, and two Ohioans, Warren Harding and James Cox, were vying to replace him, which raised the stakes of the 19th Amendment’s passage: Though women in some states could already vote, it was unclear how enfranchising all 27 million American women in time for the fall’s presidential election would influence national politics. In addition to offering contemporaneous perspective, Weiss goes back several decades to the roots of the women’s movement and the efforts of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others. Weiss celebrates their persistence and courage but does not sugarcoat their racism. Despite early unity with abolitionists, upper-middle-class white women willing to sacrifice racial equality for gender equality is nothing new. During the ratification in Nashville, Carrie Catt, the New York-based president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the successor to Susan B. Anthony, made calculated decisions to distance her groups’ interests from those of black men and women. After all, much of the Anti reluctance to grant women the vote was tied up with not wanting black women to vote. Weiss details the tribalism within the women’s movement as personified by Catt and the more militant and provocative Alice Paul, who led the National Woman’s Party. Though Paul was short on money and didn’t travel to Nashville for the special session, she dispatched the native Tennessean Sue Shelton White, an activist who could, with her very accent, dispel accusations about meddling outsiders. Weiss depicts another native daughter of Tennessee, this one a committed Anti: Josephine Pearson, who presided over multiple Anti groups and believed that in fighting against ratification, she was obeying both God and her deceased mother.

"HAVANA — Raúl Castro, who took over from his brother Fidel 12 years ago and led Cuba through some of its biggest changes in decades, is expected to step down on Thursday and hand power to someone outside the Castro dynasty for the first time since the Cuban revolution more than half a century ago. During his two terms as president, Mr. Castro, 86, opened up his Communist country to a small but vital private sector and, perhaps most significantly, diplomatic relations with the United States. It was a notable departure from his brother’s agenda, yet it was possible only because he, too, was a Castro. His handpicked successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, 57, is a Communist Party loyalist who was born a year after Fidel Castro claimed power in Cuba. His rise ushers in a new generation of Cubans whose only firsthand experience with the revolution has been its aftermath — the early era of plenty, the periods of economic privation after the demise of the Soviet Union, and the fleeting détente in recent years with the United States, its Cold War foe. Officials started gathering here in Havana on Wednesday morning and put forward Mr. Díaz-Canel as the sole candidate to replace Mr. Castro, all but assuring his selection by the Communist Party. Though Mr. Díaz-Canel’s path to the top office has been forecast for years, many an heir apparent before him has fallen by the wayside in the search for a successor to lead the country, whether because of party disloyalty, snide remarks or projecting too much power for the Castros’ liking. "
"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Wednesday that he intends to restore voting rights to felons on parole, a move that could open the ballot box to more than 35,000 people. The mechanism through which Mr. Cuomo plans to do so is unusual: He would consider pardons for all 35,000 people currently on parole in New York, as well as any new convicted felons who enter the parole system each month. The move amounts to a legal sidestep of the State Legislature, where the Republican-controlled Senate has opposed many of Mr. Cuomo’s proposed criminal justice reforms. It does not change state law, which currently bars convicted felons from voting unless they are on probation or have completed parole. Mr. Cuomo made the announcement at the National Action Network’s annual convention in New York City, where he was introduced by the group’s founder, the Rev. Al Sharpton. The governor said he had proposed legislation allowing parolees to vote, but that it had been rejected by the State Senate. “I’m unwilling to take no for an answer,” Mr. Cuomo said. “I’m going to make it law by executive order,” he added, continuing, “With active intervention, we can bend the arc toward justice.” Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, later clarified that Mr. Cuomo had proposed the idea during closed-door budget negotiations but that the idea was shot down; no bill was ever advanced.

"TOKYO — The highest-ranking civil servant in Japan’s Finance Ministry offered his resignation on Wednesday amid swirling accusations that he had sexually harassed several female journalists. At a news conference, the official, Junichi Fukuda, 58, the administrative vice minister, said allegations that he had made sexually suggestive remarks to the women were “not factual.” Still, Mr. Fukuda’s resignation, which was accepted by Taro Aso, the finance minister, was a small sign that Japan might be joining the international reckoning of the #MeToo movement, spurred by widespread accusations of sexual harassment and assault. Two days earlier, Mr. Fukuda threatened to sue Shukan Shincho magazine, which originally reported the accusations. On Wednesday, he also vowed, “I am going to dispute it in court.” Mr. Fukuda offered to step down on the same day that Ryuichi Yoneyama, the governor of Niigata, on Japan’s western coast, said he would resign over what he called a “women problem.” The weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun is set to report on Thursday that Mr. Yoneyama had paid multiple women he met through an online dating site. Both men’s resignations came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Palm Beach, Fla., meeting with President Trump. Mr. Fukuda’s resignation is subject to confirmation by the entire cabinet, including Mr. Abe. "
"Dick’s Sporting Goods plans to destroy the assault-style rifles and accessories it agreed to take off its shelves in February instead of returning them to manufacturers. It is the latest action taken by the Pennsylvania retailer that agreed to ban the sale of assault-style rifles at its 35 Field & Stream stores, and to stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone younger than 21. Since the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February that left 17 students and staff members dead, corporations have quickly responded to the public’s growing demand for responsible gun control measures. Several retailers agreed to stop selling firearms to consumers younger than 21. Among them are Walmart, the nation’s largest gun seller; L.L. Bean; and Kroger, which said it would restrict gun sales at its Fred Meyer stores. Walmart also agreed to stop selling toys online that look like assault-style rifles. And Kroger announced in March that it would stop selling “assault-rifle themed periodicals.” “It’s a very good barometer of where the public stands,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that seeks to end gun violence. “Corporations tend to reflect their customers.” The news that Dick’s Sporting Goods would destroy the weapons was first reported last week in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A spokesman told the paper that the company was in the process of destroying the firearms and accessories no longer for sale, “in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations.” "
"Let’s talk for a minute about Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump was there this week, hosting a get-together with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Important stuff to be discussed — North Korea, trade. The two men held a brief press conference on Tuesday, at which the president revealed: “Many of the world’s great leaders request to come to Mar-a-Lago and Palm Beach. They like it; I like it. We’re comfortable. We have great relationships. As you remember we were here and President Xi of China was here. And when we do it — it was originally built as the Southern White House. It was called the Southern White House. It was given to the United States and then Jimmy Carter decided it was too expensive for the United States. So they, fortunately for me, gave it back and I bought it. Who would have thought? It was a circuitous route. But now it is, indeed, the Southern White House. And again, many, many people want to be here. Many of the leaders want to be here. They request specifically.” I believe I speak for many Americans when I respond: Huh? People, which part of this makes you most unnerved? The fact that the president doesn’t make any sense when he talks or the fact that he devoted a large part of a press conference with the head of one of our most important allies to promoting his resort? Mar-a-Lago, in case you’re really interested, was owned by Marjorie Merriweather Post, a woman who had to go through life being referred to as the “cereal heiress.” When she died in 1973, she donated it to the federal government for the presidents’ use. However, nobody seemed to think the taxpayers should be stuck with a $1 million annual maintenance bill. It was more or less abandoned until President Carter gave the place back to Post’s heirs, who sold it to Trump. Which is of course a great deal for the nation, being off the hook for that maintenance tab. All we’ve had to pay so far is $45 million to $55 million to fly Trump back and forth and post guards around the beach. Some observers might have been surprised that the president would want to talk so long and lavishly about his $200,000-per-member chateau at a theoretically important meeting about foreign policy. These are people who’ve forgotten that last year, he addressed the South Korean Parliament about the threat from Pyongyang and managed to work in a plug for his golf club in New Jersey. Everybody knows Trump mixes personal business with his job running the country. Maybe it wouldn’t be so unnerving if he wasn’t so messy. We’ve had previous presidents with corrupt political associates, presidents sloshing around in sex scandals and presidents who appeared to have no clue of how to turn on the lights in the White House, let alone run a government. But we’ve never had one who managed to hit all three markers, while simultaneously using the nation’s highest office to further his private asset accumulation. "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate voted on Wednesday to overturn an Obama-era rule that restricted automobile lenders from discriminating against minorities by charging them higher fees for car loans, in the latest attempt by Republican lawmakers to roll back financial regulations. Republican lawmakers, along with one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, seized on the Congressional Review Act to overturn guidance issued in 2013 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The 1996 law gives Congress the power to nullify rules formulated by government agencies but has primarily been used to void recently enacted rules. After the Government Accountability Office determined late last year that the consumer bureau’s 2013 guidance on auto lending was technically a rule that could be rolled back, Republicans, led by Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, targeted it for rescission by using the Congressional Review Act. The House is expected to follow suit and also use the Congressional Review Act to void the guidance. Republicans have long derided the consumer bureau, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, for exceeding its authority, and President Trump’s pick to lead the agency on an interim basis, Mick Mulvaney, has largely frozen its rule-making and enforcement. Democrats and consumer watchdogs criticized the move and warned that Republicans were making broader use of the Congressional Review Act to advance their deregulatory agenda. “By voting to roll back the CFPB’s work, senators have emboldened banks and finance companies to engage in racial discrimination by charging millions of people of color more for a car loan than is justified,” said Rion Dennis of Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group. “Lawmakers have also opened the door to challenging longstanding agency actions that are crucial to protecting workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.” "
"CASSELTON, N.D. — Here in the largest soybean-producing county in the country, a snowy winter has left North Dakota farmers like Robert Runck with time on their hands before spring planting — time they have spent stewing over how much they stand to lose if President Trump starts a trade war with China. “If he doesn’t understand what he’s doing to the nation by doing what he’s doing, he’s going to be a one-term president, plain and simple,” said Mr. Runck, a fourth-generation farmer who voted for Mr. Trump. Pausing outside the post office in this town of 2,300, Mr. Runck said the repercussions could be more immediate for Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican whose bid against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, has been complicated by the proposed tariffs. “If it doesn’t get resolved by election time, I would imagine it would cost Kevin Cramer some votes,” he said. Stern warnings are coming from all over the Midwest about the political peril for Republicans in Mr. Trump’s recent course of action, in which the tariffs he slapped on foreign competitors invited retaliatory tariffs on American agriculture. Soybeans are America’s second largest export to China, and that country’s proposed 25 percent duties on the crop would hit hardest in states like Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota — where there are highly competitive House races — as well as Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, whose Senate contests may determine control of the chamber. By proposing the tariffs, Mr. Trump has moved to fulfill a central promise of his campaign: confronting those countries he believes are undermining American industry. Yet his goal — to revive the steel and aluminum industries, thereby aiding the Rust Belt states that were crucial to his election — has effectively prioritized one element of the Trump political coalition over another, larger bloc of voters. That larger segment, the farm belt, is essential to Republican success in the midterm elections and beyond. "
"As a child, Y. says she was beaten by her father with ropes and cables in Honduras. J. says he was forced into labor in Burkina Faso. R., who was born in the Dominican Republic, says she was neglected by her mother and abandoned by her father. All three applied for something known in immigration law as Special Immigrant Juvenile status, which lets children under the age of 21 who have been abused, abandoned or neglected by one or both parents obtain a green card. But in the last several weeks, all three, living in New York, were denied because of an unannounced policy reversal by the Trump administration. Under the new interpretation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services said that applicants in New York who were over 18, but not yet 21, when they began the application process no longer qualify. For the last 10 years, cases like theirs have routinely been approved. But as the Trump administration focuses on limiting all forms of immigration and tries to stop the flow of unaccompanied minors at the Mexico-United States border, it appears to be targeting the special immigrant status; President Trump often invokes fear that these immigrants could belong to MS-13, the transnational gang, and that they are committing fraud in their applications. “They are looking for what he calls ‘loopholes,’ and what we call protections, and trying to close them,” said Wendy Young, the executive director of Kids In Need of Defense, a nonprofit organization that represents young immigrants who come to the country unaccompanied. “Under this administration, everybody is presenting a fraudulent claim, rather than, ‘Why is this child here and do they need protection?’” "
"RE: GUNS David Joy wrote about growing up in gun culture and about fearing what it has become. David Joy writes: “I’m sure that part of why I carry is having a pistol put to my head when I was 14.” Concealed carry would not have done him any good. When someone has the drop on you, they have the drop on you. Concealed carry mainly works when you’re the first with the most. As someone who has had jobs that required the possession, maintenance and use of firearms, and who has used them, I find concealed carry to be a pain in the neck, even with modern handguns. You always have to think about what you’re carrying. It is a nuisance, and not a prescription for a good time or a happy life. Chances are low of using a concealed weapon effectively in a bad situation anyway. Unless you have a job that requires it, I would recommend you avoid concealed carry. Most police officers get at least decent training in the use of firearms, and look at all the trouble some of them have gotten into in recent years, in which they behaved like madmen. Vern Edwards, Portland, Ore. I’ve had guns pulled on me three times in my life. The first by a race-baiting angry vet when I stepped between him and a mixed-race couple in a parking lot; the second by a 19-year-old kid I had cut off in traffic; the third when I happened upon a fight in an alley late at night. Each time I felt the same bottomless fear when facing the muzzle of a handgun pointed in my direction. Each time I wished I had a gun of my own to protect myself and my family. And each time, lacking a gun, I raised my hands and stood passively and spoke softly, feeling utterly powerless and humiliated. To this day, years after these events, I fantasize about pulling my own weapon and facing down those threatening me. But I know that if I’d had a gun, I would have used it, and someone would have ended up dead. In each of these cases words trumped bullets, possibly saving my life and the lives of others. Outside of my fantasy life I’ll never carry a gun. Jrsherrard, Seattle "

He also explained why he decided to write a book criticizing President Trump. Comey’s book, “A Higher Loyalty,” hit stores on Tuesday. Comey admitted to Colbert that he had been surprised by his firing, given that he was leading an investigation that had to do with the Trump campaign’s own dealings with Russia. In recent days Trump has been furiously tweeting about Comey, even suggesting he should be put in jail. Comey told Colbert that the episode seemed to reflect the reasons he decided to write “A Higher Loyalty”: to remind the country that it should not take the president’s public acts too lightly.

"“It’s like Forrest Gump won the presidency,” said a Republican congressman in a conversation that Erick Erickson described last week on The Resurgent. The congressman went on, adding profanities, not reproduced here: “But it’s an evil, really stupid Forrest Gump. He can’t help himself. He’s just an idiot who thinks he’s winning when people are bitching about him.” This comes from a congressman who, Mr. Erickson said, regularly appears on Fox News to defend President Trump. The same congressman used a barnyard epithet to describe how the president treated his fellow Republicans, and concluded, “if we’re going to lose, we may as well impeach the —” well, as we used to say during Watergate, expletive deleted. They make a wild duet, Gump and Trump, like the set of identical cousins on the old “Patty Duke Show”: “One pair of matching bookends, different as night and day.” But one important difference between the fictional Forrest Gump as played by Tom Hanks in the 1994 film and the president of the United States, as played by Donald Trump in 2018, is that Gump is a fundamentally modest man, painfully aware of his own limitations. “I am not a smart man,” he says. “But I know what love is.” Mr. Trump says, in contrast, “I’m like, smart.” Does he know what love is? “You know, I don’t want to sound too much like a chauvinist, but when I come home and dinner’s not ready, I’ll go through the roof, O.K.?” he said in the same year “Forrest Gump” was released.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and secretary of state nominee, traveled to North Korea over Easter to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between its leader and President Trump. Mr. Trump confirmed the visit today after saying on Tuesday that the U.S. was in direct talks with North Korea at “extremely high levels.” The president also opened the door to a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War. (A 1953 armistice ended fighting there, but technically North and South Korea are still at war.) Such a treaty would increase pressure to ease sanctions on the North and to withdraw American troops from the Korean Peninsula. • If talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim do happen, it will be the first time a sitting U.S. president meets a North Korean leader. Here’s a look at previous diplomatic efforts. • Barbara Bush, the wife of America’s 41st president and the mother of the 43rd, died on Tuesday at her home in Houston. She was 92. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, confronting legal threats on multiple sides, sought on Wednesday to discredit a pornographic actress alleging a sexual encounter with him and investigators examining whether his campaign worked with Russia to sway the 2016 election, saying both were dealing in fake allegations. Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Wednesday to deny the claim by Stephanie Clifford, the actress also known as Stormy Daniels who has said she had an affair with him in 2006, that Mr. Trump dispatched a man to physically threaten her years ago. The president called a composite sketch of the man released on Tuesday by Ms. Clifford’s lawyer “a total con job,” marking only the second time he has weighed in on the subject after weeks of frenzied news media coverage. His tweet accompanied a post from another Twitter user, who said the man looked like Ms. Clifford’s former husband. In a news conference later in the day, Mr. Trump again referred to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russia’s election interference and whether the president has obstructed justice as a “hoax.” “This was a, really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss” in the election, he said during a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. "
"TOKYO — As every Japanese knows, when you travel abroad, you must bring home some “omiyage” — souvenirs. But after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s first day visiting President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., the Japanese public is wondering whether their leader, embattled at home by influence-peddling scandals, might return to Japan with the diplomatic equivalent of an “All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt.” When Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe appeared before reporters in Palm Beach on Tuesday, the American president declared that “Japan and ourselves are locked, and we are very unified on the subject of North Korea” and that Japan and the United States “have never been closer than they are right now.” But as the two leaders were meeting, news emerged that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, had been to North Korea this month for secret meetings with its leader, Kim Jong-un. There, Mr. Pompeo was laying the groundwork for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim to discuss the North’s nuclear program. It was yet another sign that the United States was acting independently of Japan, its strongest ally in Asia. Mr. Abe originally planned his trip to meet Mr. Trump after news last month that Mr. Trump had accepted an invitation to meet Mr. Kim for negotiations. Mr. Abe hoped to secure Mr. Trump’s commitment on two issues: curtailing the North’s nuclear and ballistic weapons programs, and facilitating the return of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and ’80s.

Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. The world needs a way to tell whether President Trump wants to pursue his combative trade policies. The Trump administration has in recent weeks announced a barrage of trade actions. First, Mr. Trump said he was imposing tariffs against steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. Then came announcements of actions against China that included tariffs on a large number of products. Very few restrictions have come into effect, though. President Trump has allowed temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs. The moves against China have to go through a public comment process before they can take place. Investors, executives and farmers who have concerns about the economic impact of the trade actions may like that little has so far happened. And they may hope that Mr. Trump uses the leeway he has under trade law to step back from his threats. But supporters of tougher trade policies will be watching closely to see if Mr. Trump actually carries them out. In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates. "

For anyone inspired to read more, try Richard Ben Cramer’s classic political book, “What It Takes.” That was then. “All the evidence we find is that, as a political issue, it is falling flat, influencing very few votes, if any.” So said NBC’s David Brinkley on the air in 1972, referring to the story known as Watergate. Most Republicans assumed all the talk was merely a political hit job by the Democrats and the media — “character assassination,” as the White House press secretary said, “well conceived and coordinated, to discredit this administration and individuals in it.” Many other voters, for their part, “seemed willing to brush it off as just the kind of thing that happens in campaigns,” as the journalist Leon Neyfakh says, in his excellent podcast series, “Slow Burn.” In retrospect, we all know how Watergate ended: With evidence of serious wrongdoing by top officials, including President Richard Nixon, which led voters and members of Congress to turn on him.

There is so much pent-up frustration around housing in the state that, in retrospect, it’s not surprising that this touched a nerve. Q: Was the original bill, which you’ve amended to make less sweeping, a negotiating tactic to provoke discussion? A: We knew it was an aggressive bill.

"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Every fish tale starts with a whopper. This one started with a photograph on Instagram. I was researching a story on the actor Chris Pratt and was surprised that a photograph he posted to the social networking app with his son on a fishing trip had been liked more than 1 million times. Even by celebrity standards, that is a huge number. Donald Trump Jr., another avid angler and Instagram user, whom I profiled last year, garnered tens of thousands of likes for his fishing pictures. And more and more, the people I follow were posting fish tales of their own. How big is the fishing crowd on Instagram, I wondered. It is indeed an active community; #fishing alone has nearly 20 million posts. As I scrolled through hundreds of photographs, I noticed that many anglers posing with their catch exhibited a studied flair, much like fashionistas promoting designer clothes in the early days of Instagram. (A few years ago, models had their own selfie pose called the “fish gape.”) Cultural trends seem to pop up early on the social media site. It’s where I first noticed the popularity of Los Angeles’s Zoe Church, which I recently wrote about, and where Sam Barsky, better known online as “the sweater guy,” gained Internet fame.

"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea confirmed on Wednesday that it had been in talks with American and North Korean officials about negotiating a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War after more than 60 years, as the United States and its ally try to establish a basis for persuading the North to give up its nuclear weapons. Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, said he had discussed the matter with John R. Bolton, his newly appointed American counterpart, in Washington last week, as they prepared for the planned talks between each of their countries’ presidents and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader. South Korean officials said they had also been in talks with the North about a possible treaty. Mr. Kim told Mr. Chung and another South Korean official last month that the North was willing to give up nuclear arms if it received security guarantees. In the past, the North has said that a peace treaty and the normalization of ties with the United States would be among the security guarantees it would require in exchange for surrendering its nuclear program. Referring to his meetings with Trump administration officials, Mr. Chung said on Wednesday, “We held in-depth discussions on various ways of how to end hostilities and eventually establish a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, how to address the North Korean concerns and how to ensure a bright future for the North if it makes the right choice.” “Mr. Bolton made it clear to me that he will do his best as an honest broker in successfully implementing President Trump’s peace policy on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Chung added. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that a peace treaty was being discussed and that he approved of the idea. The president, who confirmed on Wednesday that he had sent Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, to meet with Mr. Kim, has said he would meet with the North Korean leader in May or early June, after Mr. Kim’s April 27 talks with South Korea’s president, Mr. Moon, on the Koreas’ border.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Talk of a Korean peace treaty, challenging the French president and mourning a British royal pet. Here’s the latest: • The 68-year-old war on the Korean Peninsula may finally have an end in sight. South Korea confirmed that it had been in talks with the North and the U.S. about negotiating a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice that halted, but did not formally end, the Korean War. President Trump’s decision to secretly send Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, to the North to lay the groundwork for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, reflects the central role that spies — rather than diplomats — played in brokering an opening. Mr. Trump said he would walk out of the meeting if it was not heading toward success. No sitting U.S. president has ever met — or, apparently, even spoken on the phone — with a North Korean leader. (Here’s a look at previous diplomatic efforts.) Officials are still discussing a location for the talks. The Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, has emerged as a possibility, in part because Mr. Kim’s aging aircraft can get there. _____ "
"Kris W. Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas and face of the Trump administration’s efforts to clamp down on supposed voter fraud, was found by a federal judge on Wednesday to have disobeyed orders to notify thousands of Kansans in 2016 that they were registered to vote. Mr. Kobach, who served last year as the vice chairman of the Trump administration’s short-lived presidential commission on voter fraud, was reprimanded in a 25-page ruling by Federal District Judge Julie A. Robinson of Kansas, who held him in contempt of court. Mr. Kobach has championed restrictive laws on voting around the country, warning that voting fraud is rampant and unchecked, despite widespread agreement from election experts that it is extremely rare. But voting rights advocates pointed to the judge’s findings as a counter to Mr. Kobach’s efforts to position himself as a protector of the voting process. “Secretary Kobach likes to talk about the rule of law,” Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “Talk is cheap, and his actions speak louder than his words.” A law went into effect in Kansas in 2013 that required proof of citizenship to register to vote, one of the strictest such laws in the country. But in May 2016, Mr. Kobach lost a challenge to the law brought by the A.C.L.U., and Judge Robinson ordered him to notify people who had tried to register while renewing or applying for a driver’s license that they were indeed eligible to vote. Judge Robinson wrote in the ruling on Wednesday that those voters should have received postcards with information telling them of their polling place and their registration status, but Mr. Kobach did not ensure that the postcards were sent. “The Court is troubled by Defendant’s failure to take responsibility for violating this Court’s orders, and for failing to ensure compliance over an issue that he explicitly represented to the Court had been accomplished,” the judge wrote. Mr. Kobach also failed to ensure that the county elections manual on the secretary of state’s website was updated properly, the ruling said. Judge Robinson did not impose a fine or other sanctions, but ordered Mr. Kobach to pay “reasonable” legal fees to the A.C.L.U. Moriah Day, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kobach, said that the secretary of state would appeal the decision and had no other comment. Mr. Kobach is vying for the Republican nomination for governor in Kansas, running on his record as a proponent of restrictive laws on immigration and voting rights. He is challenging Gov. Jeff Colyer, who succeeded Sam Brownback earlier this year after Mr. Brownback accepted an ambassadorship in the Trump administration. Mr. Kobach represented himself in a trial in March in Judge Robinson’s courtroom, where he is defending the 2011 proof-of-citizenship law. Mr. Kobach was previously fined $1,000 for his “deceptive conduct and lack of candor” before a federal court. That penalty was upheld by Judge Robinson last year. "
"In a long-expected move that would affect the roughly 43 million households with brokerage or retirement accounts, the Securities and Exchange Commission voted on Wednesday to propose rules that would require brokers to put their customers’ financial interests ahead of their own. But not everyone is convinced the rules — if passed as proposed — would go far enough to improve consumer protections, including some of the S.E.C.’s own commissioners. Some of the five commissioners said they had concerns with different pieces of the proposal, suggesting that it may be difficult for them to coalesce around a final rule. Kara M. Stein, an S.E.C. commissioner, called the proposed rules a squandered opportunity to provide meaningful change, and suggested a new name for the proposal, now called Regulation Best Interest. “Perhaps it would be more accurate to call it regulation status quo,” Ms. Stein said at an open meeting in which she strongly criticized the proposal and was the sole vote against it. The 4-to-1 vote opened the proposal to public comment just weeks before the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement accounts, must decide whether it will take steps to resuscitate its own best interest standard. The future of that rule remains uncertain. The S.E.C.’s proposal includes three parts. First, it would require brokers to put their customers’ interests first when making investment recommendations. Second, it would require registered brokers and registered investment advisers to provide a brief summary of their relationship with clients. And last, it would reaffirm and clarify the existing rules of conduct for investment advisers, who are held to a higher standard than brokers. "
"Federal prosecutors and lawyers for President Trump’s personal attorney, Michael D. Cohen, have each proposed to a judge the names of possible candidates to serve as a “special master” to assist in the review of materials seized last week by the F.B.I. from Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen’s lawyers had asked the judge, Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan, to appoint a special master to help review the materials to determine whether any might be protected by attorney-client privilege. The government had opposed using a special master and said a so-called taint team of prosecutors not involved in the investigation could more efficiently carry out the screening process. The debate over the special master arose after F.B.I. agents raided Mr. Cohen’s properties last week and seized 10 boxes of documents and as many as a dozen electronic devices. Lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump had asked Judge Wood to block the government from reviewing the seized materials, and to direct the government to provide copies to Mr. Cohen, so Mr. Trump could review materials that related to him and determine whether they were subject to legal privilege. On Wednesday, the prosecutors, writing to Judge Wood, again argued that a special master was not warranted. But if the judge decided to appoint one, they suggested she select from among three candidates: Frank Maas, James C. Francis IV and Theodore H. Katz, all retired magistrate judges who had once sat in the federal court in Manhattan. All three had “many years of experience in resolving disputes on the issue of privilege in the context of criminal investigations,” the government said. Mr. Cohen’s lawyers on Tuesday suggested four candidates for the special master position, all former prosecutors in the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which is handling the Cohen investigation. One proposed candidate, Bart M. Schwartz, ran the office’s criminal division when Rudolph W. Giuliani was the United States attorney; Mr. Schwartz is now chairman of Guidepost Solutions, an investigations, compliance and security firm. The other three candidates are partners in law firms in New York: Joan McPhee, with Ropes & Gray; Tai H. Park, with Park Jensen Bennett; and George S. Canellos, with Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.

"At least a half-dozen investigations into Scott Pruitt’s conduct will proceed against the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, despite his July 5 resignation. The E.P.A. inspector general’s office announced in early July that five of its inquiries will continue. They are examining Mr. Pruitt’s frequent travel to Oklahoma and first-class flights; the management of and payment for his 24-hour security detail; a series of hiring and pay-raise decisions affecting political appointees; and the preservation of Mr. Pruitt’s emails and text messages. An agency spokeswoman also said investigators would compile a “factual record” of a meeting that Mr. Pruitt held with the National Mining Association in April 2017. In addition, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is moving forward with a broad investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s spending, management and use of federal resources. Here is a guide to the investigations Mr. Pruitt has faced, including those that are continuing. "
"Judge Kimba M. Wood had barely finished a hearing this week that involved both Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s lawyer, and — in a stunning revelation — the Fox News host Sean Hannity, when the right-wing media machine started going after her. Info Wars, the conspiracy theory website run by Alex Jones, posted an article that distilled Judge Wood’s 30-year career to a single Saturday five years ago when she performed the wedding of the left-wing billionaire George Soros. Keeping with the theme of a liberal cabal, the Washington Times mentioned that another progressive bigwig — Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader — was also at the festivities. Joining the attacks, Fox News and NRA TV also soon chimed in. Given its explosive mix of money, sex and presidential politics, the case engulfing Mr. Cohen — an investigation into whether he broke the law by suppressing scandals about women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump — was almost certain to provoke a pushback and present a challenge to any judge called upon to manage it. But the Cohen affair is not Judge Wood’s first turn in the political spotlight. In 1993, after five years on the bench, she was considered for United States attorney general by President Bill Clinton after an earlier nominee, Zoë Baird, was found to have hired undocumented immigrants as nannies and failed to pay their taxes. But Judge Wood was asked to withdraw her name after telling White House screeners that she was sponsoring her own nanny for a green card — which was legal then — and that she had paid all the necessary taxes. “I have fulfilled every legal requirement with respect to the employment of our babysitter,” she said in a statement at the time. “Nevertheless, and after further consultations, I have concluded that in the current political environment, proceeding further with the possibility of my nomination would be inappropriate.” Although she had done nothing illegal, Judge Wood, 74, was a casualty of politics and continued on the bench at Federal District Court in Manhattan, one of the country’s highest-profile judicial stages.

"WASHINGTON — Of all the obstacles to the potential summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, just getting there could prove the most turbulent. As officials scramble to convene the hastily announced and once-unthinkable meeting in the coming weeks, the site itself remains an open question. It is unclear whether Mr. Kim’s fleet of Soviet-era planes can fly him more than a few thousand miles from North Korea. “We know he has a plane, but it’s an old plane,” said Sue Mi Terry, a former C.I.A. analyst and National Security Council aide who worked on Korea issues. “No one really knows if it works.” Since taking power in 2011, Mr. Kim is not known to have flown outside his country, and the question of his transportation adds a layer of political complications to a fraught and uncertain summit meeting. Sitting leaders of the two countries have never met. Could Mr. Kim borrow a plane? Perhaps, but not without a significant dent to his well-established hubris. Could the meeting be held close enough for him to take a train, as he did last month in a secretive visit to China? In theory, though viable options are few. Could Mr. Trump instead travel to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, thus nullifying the issue? He is almost certainly unwilling to stomach the appearance of showing deference to Mr. Kim. “It’s really hard if you only have a 2,000-mile radius,” said David H. Rank, who previously served as the acting United States ambassador to China. "
"WASHINGTON — Even in the final days of her life, Barbara Bush retained the sharp tongue that belied her grandmotherly image. When her eldest son, former President George W. Bush, visited about 10 days before her death, the two playfully needled each other in the way they always did. At one point, Mrs. Bush turned to her doctor. “You want to know why George W. is the way he is?” she asked. The doctor looked a little surprised. “Because I drank and smoked when I was pregnant with him,” she said. The former president told that story about his mother on Wednesday as he paid tribute to Mrs. Bush, who died at 92 on Tuesday at her home in Houston. Mrs. Bush, who had congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, decided earlier this week to decline further medical treatment intended to prolong her life and instead spent her last days saying goodbye to her family. Former President George Bush, her husband of 73 years and the father of the younger Mr. Bush, was by her side when she passed away. Three of their children, Neil, Marvin and Dorothy, had been with her in the last few days, while George W. Bush and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida had visited recently and stayed in constant touch by telephone, according to a family spokesman. “I always knew Barbara was the most beloved woman in the world, and in fact I used to tease her that I had a complex about that fact,” her husband said in a statement released on Wednesday. “But the truth is the outpouring of love and friendship being directed at The Enforcer is lifting us all up.

"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump declared on Wednesday that he would scrap a planned summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, or even walk out of the session while it was underway, if his diplomatic overture was not heading toward success. Mr. Trump continued to express optimism — verging on eagerness — about sitting down with the North’s reclusive leader. But as the momentum for a meeting grows in both Washington and East Asia, the president acknowledged that it was a perilous undertaking that could still end in failure. “If I think that it’s a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, standing alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “If the meeting, when I’m there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting.” Mr. Trump’s words reinforced his decision to send the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, on a secret trip to meet Mr. Kim. Mr. Pompeo, nominated by Mr. Trump last month as secretary of state, played advance man for the president in Pyongyang, laying the groundwork for the planned meeting. Among the potential hurdles for the gathering, Mr. Trump said, were three American citizens detained in North Korea. The president said that the United States was “fighting very diligently” to obtain their release and that there was a chance of positive developments. Still, Mr. Trump conspicuously declined to make their release a precondition of his meeting with Mr. Kim. He also did not demand any new concessions from North Korea beforehand, underscoring how determined he is to make history by convening with the leader of a country he threatened with war a few months ago.

"W
hen John Wick and his wife, Peggy Rathmann, bought their ranch in Marin County, Calif., in 1998, it was mostly because they needed more space. Rathmann is an acclaimed children’s book author — “Officer Buckle and Gloria” won a Caldecott Medal in 1996 — and their apartment in San Francisco had become cluttered with her illustrations. They picked out the 540-acre ranch in Nicasio mostly for its large barn, which they planned to remake into a spacious studio. Wick, a former construction foreman — they met when he oversaw a renovation of her bathroom — was eager to tackle the project. He knew the area well, having grown up one town away, in Woodacre, where he had what he describes as a “free-range” childhood: little supervision and lots of biking, rope-swinging and playing in the area’s fields and glens. The couple quickly settled into their bucolic new surroundings. Wick began fixing leaks in the barn. Rathmann loved watching the many animals, including ravens, deer and the occasional gopher, from the large porch. She even trained the resident towhees, small brown birds, to eat seed from her hand. So smitten were they with the wildlife, in fact, that they decided to return their ranch to a wilder state. For nearly a century, this had been dairy country, and the rounded, coastal hills were terraced from decades of grazing. Wick and Rathmann would often come home and find, to their annoyance, cows standing on their porch. The first step they took toward what they imagined would be a more pristine state was to revoke the access enjoyed by the rancher whose cows wandered their property. Within months of the herd’s departure, the landscape began to change. Brush encroached on meadow. Dried-out, uneaten grass hindered new growth. A mysterious disease struck their oak trees. The land seemed to be losing its vitality. “Our vision of wilderness was failing,” Wick told me recently. “Our naïve idea was not working out so well.” Wick was especially bothered by the advance of a prickly, yellow-flowered invasive weed called the woolly distaff thistle. He pulled it, mowed it, doused it with herbicides. But the distaff kept moving into what had been pasture. He thought about renting goats to eat the weeds and brush, but they were too expensive. He even considered introducing wild elk, but the bureaucratic hurdles seemed too onerous. Then Wick and Rathmann met a rangeland ecologist named Jeff Creque. Instead of fighting against what you dislike, Creque suggested, focus on cultivating what you want. Squeeze out weeds by fostering conditions that favor grasses. Creque, who spent 25 years as an organic-pear-and-apple farmer in Northern California before earning a Ph.D. in rangeland ecology, also recommended that they bring back the cows. Grasslands and grazing animals, he pointed out, had evolved together. Unlike trees, grasses don’t shed their leaves at the end of the growing season; they depend on animals for defoliation and the recycling of nutrients. The manure and urine from grazing animals fuels healthy growth. If done right, Creque said, grazing could be restorative. "
"HONG KONG — China carried out live-fire military drills in the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, its state news media reported, an exercise intended to show the growing strength of its navy and deliver a message to self-governed Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. The war games were the first in the Taiwan Strait since 2016, Chinese state television reported. They were held in a two-square-mile area that includes two islets off the city of Quanzhou in Fujian Province. That area is about 125 miles west of the city of Hsinchu on Taiwan’s west coast. China has been increasing pressure on Taiwan in recent months, while the United States has taken steps to show support for the island, a longtime ally. While the drills Wednesday were most likely planned long in advance, they come at a time when the United States and China are increasingly at odds over a number of issues besides Taiwan, particularly trade. Liu Jieyi, the director of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said this week that the exercises were being planned with Taiwan in mind. “Our military exercises are carried out to protect the sovereignty of our motherland and territorial integrity,” he told reporters Monday on the sidelines of a cross-strait business conference in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. Last week, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, attended large-scale exercises by the country’s navy off Hainan Island in the South China Sea. He was shown on state television wearing camouflage fatigues and watching as fighter jets took off from the Liaoning, China’s first aircraft carrier. Those exercises, which included 48 ships, 76 aircraft and more than 10,000 personnel, were the largest ever carried out by the People’s Liberation Army Navy, the state news media said. "
"TAICANG, China — If China calls for a boycott of American goods, Chinese workers like David Xu could be in trouble. Mr. Xu is one of thousands of residents of this port town who cash paychecks from American companies. He works as a technician at a Procter & Gamble manufacturing and distribution center here, one of the company’s biggest in China. Across town, Nike has opened a huge distribution center, its largest in Asia. In all, more than 40 other American companies have set up shop here, making chemicals, lighters and a broad range of other products for a Chinese market eager for American goods. “There is no deep hatred for American companies,” said Mr. Xu, who has worked for Procter & Gamble for 13 years. “The impact of this trade conflict shouldn’t be big. After all, American companies bring so many conveniences to the lives of Chinese people.” Some Chinese state media outlets have hinted darkly that Beijing could weaponize its hundreds of millions of shoppers should Washington go through with its recent tariff threats and start an all-out trade war. On Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, there are sporadic calls to boycott Apple’s iPhones. Beijing has done it before, ably punishing Japanese, South Korean and Philippine products and companies over political disputes. A Boycott America plan could be much tougher to pull off. While competition from Chinese-made smartphones is rising, iPhones remain popular. Shopping mall developers, eager for the extra cachet, clamor for Starbucks to open stores. Nike dominates the sportswear market in China. Chevrolet is one of the country’s most popular brands. "
"WASHINGTON — A day after President Trump promised to slash the red tape involved in weapons sales, the administration announced on Thursday a new policy that could vastly expand sales of armed drones, a contentious emblem of the shift toward remotely controlled warfare. That change, in addition to a newly released update to the policy governing which nations are allowed to buy sophisticated American-made weapons, is intended to accelerate arms sales, a key priority of Mr. Trump. The president seemed to foreshadow the new policies on Wednesday night, when he said at a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan that after allies order weapons from the United States, “we will get it taken care of, and they will get their equipment rapidly.” “It would be, in some cases, years before orders would take place because of bureaucracy with Department of Defense, State Department,” Mr. Trump said. “We are short-circuiting that. It’s now going to be a matter of days. If they’re our allies, we are going to help them get this very important, great military equipment.” The new policies, though, will do little to change the often yearslong intervals between orders and deliveries of weapons, but the State Department announced that it intended over the next 90 days to re-evaluate the process that can sometimes lead to such gaps. Delays in delivering weapons systems have long been an irritant to foreign governments and domestic manufacturers, and almost every administration in the modern era has tried to fix the process. Top aides in the Trump White House have frequently called officials at the State Department and the Pentagon to try to hurry things along. "
"In early January, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer, filed a pair of lawsuits claiming that the political research firm Fusion GPS and the website BuzzFeed had defamed him by promoting the so-called Steele dossier, an intelligence report that alleged connections between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia. The dossier depicted Mr. Cohen as a central figure in what it described as a conspiracy. In the suits, Mr. Cohen complained that Fusion GPS had disseminated the dossier to reporters and that BuzzFeed put it on the internet, even though both companies knew that it contained what Mr. Cohen believed were lies. But much has changed in the past three months. Just last week, Mr. Cohen discovered that he is now the subject of a federal investigation seeking to determine if he broke the law by trying to tamp down scandals involving women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Because of that investigation, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer dropped both lawsuits in a sudden move on Wednesday night. “The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,” the lawyer, David M. Schwartz, said on Thursday. While Mr. Schwartz insisted that he still believes that BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS defamed Mr. Cohen, he added, “Given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.” Mr. Cohen’s chief complaint about the Steele dossier — a series of papers written by Christopher Steele, a former British spy — was its allegation that Mr. Cohen had secretly met last summer with a Russian official in Prague. Mr. Cohen has denied attending the meeting, and in one of the suits he said that the dossier’s defamatory claims turned him into “collateral damage in a U.S. political operation.” At the time the suits were filed — in Federal District Court in Manhattan and in State Supreme Court in Manhattan — Mr. Cohen’s lawyer said that he had sought legal action because it was the only way that he could “get back his reputation.” Last week, Fusion GPS responded with a court filing saying that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations and failed to “allege actual malice.” "
"With this week’s selection of titles, we put ourselves into the hands of experts: expert storytellers, expert thinkers, expert biographers of expert subjects. For instance? As the founding curator of the New York Public Library’s photography collection, Julia Van Haaften is a leading authority on the city’s rich photographic heritage — surely the right person to have produced the first major biography of Berenice Abbott, the larger-than-life artist who captured and defined New York City in some of the 20th century’s most arresting images. Read that, and spend some time lingering over the photos. Also for instance: We recommend fiction by the celebrated masters Thomas McGuane and Richard Powers — whose new novel, “The Overstory,” is reviewed by Barbara Kingsolver, speaking of experts — and nonfiction by Hannah Arendt (about politics), Barbara Ehrenreich (about mortality) and Ross Douthat (about the Catholic Church under Pope Francis). Other choices include a family memoir, a debut novel about a single gay mother, a ghost story and a Nordic thriller with shades of “The Silence of the Lambs.” And if the Abbott biography gets you thinking about the character and destiny of cities, you might want to settle in with Ben Austen’s “High-Risers,” about the ill-fated Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. It’s not a happy story, but it’s an important one, and Austen, a journalist who frequently writes about urban planning and housing issues, tells it expertly and well. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books BERENICE ABBOTT: A Life in Photography, by Julia Van Haaften. (Norton, $45.) The photographer Berenice Abbott (1898-1991) was born in Ohio and fled to Greenwich Village after dropping out after one year at Ohio State University. In 1920s Paris, she took sensitive and indelible portraits of Jean Cocteau, James Joyce and others. After returning to New York, she became a revolutionary chronicler of the modern metropolis. Julia Van Haaften, the founding curator of the New York Public Library’s photography collection, has written the first full-dress biography of her. “This is a vital work of American cultural history, and it wedges in so many personalities and vistas that it’s hard to know where to begin,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. NATURAL CAUSES: An Epidemic of Wellness, the Certainty of Dying, and Killing Ourselves to Live Longer, by Barbara Ehrenreich. (Twelve, $27.) At 76 years old, Barbara Ehrenreich has decided that she is old enough to die, and she has sworn off annual exams, cancer screenings and other measures those with health insurance are expected to take. “Natural Causes” takes aim at the wellness movement as a whole, at our tendency to treat aging as an outrage or, worse, as a sin. The book is “peevish, tender and deeply, distinctively odd,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “The pleasures of her prose are often local, in the animated language, especially where scientific descriptions are concerned. Her description of cells rushing to staunch a wound is so full of wonder and delight that it recalls Italo Calvino.” FUTUREFACE: A Family Mystery, an Epic Quest, and the Secret to Belonging, by Alex Wagner. (One World, $28.) Alex Wagner was born in 1977, in Washington, D.C. The only child of a Burmese mother and a white American father, she grew up listening to histories of “migrations, escapes, settlement, assimilation.” In “Futureface,” she embarks on a quest to find out as much as she can about both sides of her family, beyond the gauzy stories that have been handed down. The book “raises urgent questions having to do with history and complicity,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “Wagner is determined to look at her family with the coldest eye, making excuses for no one.” THE OVERSTORY, by Richard Powers. (Norton, $27.95.) The science of botany and the art of storytelling merge to ingenious effect in Powers’s magisterial new novel — a story in which people are merely the underbrush and the real protagonists are the trees that the human characters encounter. In her review, Barbara Kingsolver calls it a “monumental” book, and notes that by following various characters as they interact with the forest, Powers “accomplishes what few living writers from either camp, art or science, could attempt. Using the tools of story, he pulls readers heart-first into a perspective so much longer-lived and more subtly developed than the human purview that we gain glimpses of a vast, primordial sensibility, while watching our own kind get whittled down to size.” STRAY CITY, by Chelsey Johnson. (Custom House, $25.99.) Johnson’s engrossing debut novel explores a young, single, lesbian mother’s path to self-discovery and self-acceptance. “The sensitivity and insight with which Johnson treats Andrea’s bewilderment and shame … are among this novel’s many felicities,” our reviewer, Christine Sneed, writes, adding that “another of the novel’s delights” is “how clearly Johnson delineates the psychosexual dualities and prejudices of our culture, how effortlessly she instructs even as she entertains.” "
"Seven and a half months after being nominated to lead NASA, Jim Bridenstine finally gets to start his new job. His confirmation following a vote in the Senate ends the longest span of time that NASA has operated without a permanent leader, and comes with a vivid reminder that few posts in Washington are now spared from partisan conflict. On Thursday, the Senate confirmed Mr. Bridenstine, an Oklahoma congressman, as the new NASA administrator in a stark partisan vote: 50 Republicans voting for him and 47 Democrats plus two independents against. The vote lasted more than 45 minutes as Republicans waited for Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to cast his lot. The vote was also punctuated by the appearance of Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, who cast her “no” vote on the Senate floor with her newborn daughter in hand. Many who voted against him expressed concerns about his record of partisanship as well as some statements questioning climate change, an area of research in which the space agency plays a central role. Mr. Bridenstine takes over an agency in transition. While President Obama talked of sending astronauts to Mars in a couple of decades, the Trump administration has instead focused on a nearer, quicker goal: to return to the moon. The administration has also proposed getting NASA out of the business of running the International Space Station and instead spur commercial alternatives that do not yet exist. Critics have questioned whether the agency’s new administrator is up to the task. Mr. Bridenstine, a former Navy pilot who is now in his third term in the House of Representatives, has become immersed in space issues. In 2016, he sponsored a bill called the American Space Renaissance Act, which proposed broad, ambitious goals for the nation’s space program, including directing NASA to devise a 20-year plan. Although it did not reach a vote, some of the ideas were incorporated into other legislation. "
"Updated May 9. One was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in 2016 for an espionage conviction. Two others are scholars — one studies accounting, the other agriculture — who taught at a prestigious science and technology university before they were arrested in 2017 on suspicion of “hostile acts.” All three are Korean-American men who were held in North Korea until Wednesday, when they were released during a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The three former detainees share a common surname, Kim, but they are not related. Their release removes a point of tension as President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, prepare for their summit meeting, the first face-to-face encounter by the top leaders of the two nations. Previous Americans jailed in North Korea have been treated brutally. One of them, Otto F. Warmbier, died in June 2017 after being released from 17 months of captivity. His parents said he had been tortured, and a coroner found that he had suffered extensive brain damage. Mr. Warmbier, an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, had been convicted in March 2016 of trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a trip to North Korea and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. “Tortured beyond belief by North Korea,” an outraged Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last September. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump, called the three released Americans were “wonderful gentlemen,” who, he said, “seem to be in good health.” "
"Wells Fargo investors got yet another jolt of bad news on Thursday with the disclosure that regulators are poised to impose a $1 billion penalty on the bank for infractions related to mortgage rate extensions, auto loans, risk compliance and other matters. That comes on top of the $4.25 billion the bank set aside last year for liabilities related to its fake accounts scandal and the mortgage-backed securities issues it had before the financial crisis. It also paid a fine of $185 million in 2016 over the accounts scandal. In February, the Federal Reserve took Wells Fargo to the woodshed, ruling that the bank could not expand its balance sheet beyond the nearly $2 trillion in total assets that it reported at the end of 2017; it’s believed to be the first time the Fed has imposed such a curb on growth at a major bank. “We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank,” said the former Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, as she announced the move on her last day in the job. Even President Trump, ordinarily a champion of bank deregulation, piled on, saying on Twitter in February that fines and penalties against Wells Fargo for “their bad acts against their customers and others” will be “pursued and, if anything, substantially increased.” I’ve been a harsh critic of Wells Fargo’s previous management for fostering a culture of rule breaking and customer abuse, and for marginalizing as disloyal and even firing anyone at the bank with the courage and integrity to try to stop the illegal practices. But with the new $1 billion penalty, which is expected to be announced as soon as Friday, even I have to wonder: Has Wells Fargo been punished enough? "
"WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors are examining whether they have sufficient evidence to open a criminal investigation into Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director, his lawyer said on Thursday, after a Justice Department inspector general report repeatedly faulted him for misleading investigators. The inquiry is certain to add to an already corrosive atmosphere pitting Mr. McCabe and other current and former law enforcement officials against President Trump. The president has accused them of concocting a baseless investigation into possible links between his associates and Russia’s election interference. The inspector general referred his findings on Mr. McCabe to prosecutors in the United States attorney’s office for the District of Columbia in recent weeks, according to Mr. McCabe’s lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich, who called the step unjustified and stressed that the White House should not interfere in an independent law enforcement investigation. “We are confident that, unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the administration, the U.S. attorney’s office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute,” Mr. Bromwich said. Representatives for the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, and the United States attorney’s office declined to comment. Such a referral is common when the inspector general concludes, as he did in this case, that he has reason to believe the law was broken. Mr. McCabe has been swept up in an extraordinary and abrupt conclusion to his 21-year F.B.I. career. He was fired last month over the allegations at the heart of the inspector general report, and his appeal was rejected by Attorney General Jeff Sessions hours before Mr. McCabe would have been eligible for retirement benefits.

"WASHINGTON — A barrage of missiles against Syria by American, French and British forces most likely will not stop President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons program, a Pentagon assessment has concluded, despite President Trump’s “Mission Accomplished!” declaration hours after last weekend’s strikes. The military intelligence report, put out less than three days after the attack, said the allied airstrikes likely set back Mr. Assad’s production of sarin gas. But it found that the Syrian president is expected to continue researching and developing chemical weapons for potential future use, according to an American intelligence analyst who has seen the document and described it to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. “They do retain a residual capability” to produce chemical weapons, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the Joint Staff director, said on Thursday of the Syrian government. He said the chemical weapons are “spread through the country.” “They still have ability to conduct attacks; I would not rule that out,” General McKenzie said. Planning for the strike of 105 missiles on three targets — chemical weapons storage and research facilities near Damascus and Homs — took nearly a full week. Staging and final preparations for the attack, which lasted roughly two minutes, took hours to carry out. Mr. Trump announced it on Friday night in Washington as the missiles were hitting Syria before dawn on Saturday. Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the allied strikes to punish Mr. Assad for a suspected chemical weapons attack on April 7 “could not have had a better result.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Irreversible damage to the Great Barrier Reef, a volcano erupts in Japan and Saudi Arabia screens “Black Panther.” Here’s what you need to know: • Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is no longer demanding that American troops be removed from South Korea as a condition for denuclearization, the South said. That removes a major obstacle to talks with the United States. “The North Koreans did not present any conditions that the United States could not accept,” President Moon Jae-in of South Korea told journalists in Seoul. If confirmed, the reversal could affect long-term U.S. military plans in the region and ease Washington’s reluctance to strike a deal with North Korea. The U.S. is also “fighting very diligently” to negotiate the release of three Korean-American prisoners in North Korea, President Trump said. Above, South Korean and U.S. Marines in a joint drill in July 2016. _____ • If the world economy is looking so great, why are global policymakers so gloomy? Worries about trade and debt are chief among the concerns of top officials gathering in Washington for the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings. President Trump tweeted last month that trade wars are “good, and easy to win,” but policymakers disagree. "
"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell’s unilateral declaration this week that he would not allow a vote on legislation to protect the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provoked outrage from Democrats who said Mr. McConnell was giving President Trump carte blanche to oust the leader of the investigation into Russian election interference and the president’s inner circle. In reality, the bipartisan bill would stand little chance of passage even if Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, relented and allowed it to be debated and approved by the Senate. House Republicans are adamantly opposed. And if the bill somehow cleared Congress, Mr. Trump would have no incentive to sign a measure limiting his power. On top of that, the legislation might not be constitutional. But supporters of the bill are pressing ahead anyway, intensifying a dispute that underscores both rising concern among Republicans that Mr. Trump might fire Mr. Mueller and uncertainty about just how they would react if he did. Mr. McConnell’s stance has serious consequences. Backers of the legislation believe that a strong Senate show of support for Mr. Mueller and his inquiry would send an unmistakable signal to Mr. Trump that dismissing Mr. Mueller would present serious complications for his presidency. “It would send a message,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who recently endorsed the special counsel proposal written by two Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and two Democratic senators, Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Republicans both inside and outside the government warn that firing Mr. Mueller would be very unwise. "
"Kanye West is coming back with a vengeance — and two new albums. The rapper, who had been largely quiet in public since a dramatic spiral near the end of 2016 — during which he canceled a major tour, was hospitalized for a “psychiatric emergency” and angered some fans by meeting with then-President-elect Donald J. Trump before going dark — re-emerged recently on Twitter and in photos with his most frequent musical collaborators, stoking anticipation for a new release. On Thursday, Mr. West, 40, confirmed the whispers in his trademark off-the-cuff fashion, posting on Twitter, “my album is 7 songs,” followed two minutes later by a date: June 1. That was not all. Mr. West also announced a second album in collaboration with his on-again, off-again associate Kid Cudi due out June 8, according to his tweets: “it’s called Kids See Ghost,” Mr. West wrote. “That’s the name of our group.” Def Jam, Mr. West’s label, declined to comment further. The new music would be Mr. West’s much-anticipated follow-up to his seventh solo album, “The Life of Pablo,” which was released in February 2016. That body of work, too, had a less-than-traditional release: Mr. West debuted the songs during a fashion show at Madison Square Garden, released it a few days later as an exclusive on Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal and then continued to futz with the tracks, updating the music as he pleased. Things took a stranger turn during the rapper’s subsequent “Saint Pablo” tour, which attempted to redefine the arena show. Though critically acclaimed, the tour was abruptly halted — and later canceled — after Mr. West began cutting concerts short to express his grievances with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Mark Zuckerberg. “I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life — even at the risk of my own success, my own career,” he told one crowd. Mr. West had barely uttered a peep to his followers since, even after his hospitalization, which was never explained, until surfacing last week with a barrage of social media content. He also interviewed his interior designer, Axel Vervoordt, for The Hollywood Reporter, telling him, “I don’t wish to be number one anymore, I wish to be water.” On Twitter, such philosophical musings were mainlined directly to fans as Mr. West indicated he was writing a book “in real time” through the missives. “Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,” he wrote. "
"Federal regulators are poised to impose a $1 billion fine on Wells Fargo for years of selling unnecessary products to customers, the toughest action by the Trump administration against a major bank. The penalty, part of an expected settlement on Friday between the bank and two regulators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance policies they did not need and other misdeeds, according to four people briefed on the regulatory action. It is the latest blow to Wells Fargo. For years, it was regarded as one of the country’s best-run banks but lately has been reeling from a string of self-inflicted crises. President Trump has been especially vocal about holding Wells to account, taking to Twitter last year to warn that the bank could face stiff penalties. But he has been equally adamant about dismantling banking rules, part of a broader regulatory rollback. The consumer bureau is carrying out both agendas. The agency’s interim director, Mick Mulvaney, has pushed aggressively for the penalty against Wells. The consumer bureau’s portion of the penalty is likely to represent the largest fine in its history. Mr. Mulvaney is simultaneously working to defang the consumer bureau, an agency that has been a thorn in the side of the financial industry. He has criticized the bureau for wasteful spending and overzealous oversight. "
"WASHINGTON — Jake Tapper doesn’t seem to get rattled easily. He’s got a TV anchor’s unflappable poise and immovable hair, and radiates an almost eerie calm when a dozen explosive stories break during his daily CNN show. He’s weathered relentless online attacks from the right for his interrogations of Trump administration officials, and seemed unruffled when the president attacked him as a “CNN flunky” on Twitter. (Mr. Tapper retweeted the message, with an eye-roll emoji.) But during a recent interview at CNN’s Washington headquarters, Mr. Tapper confessed he was feeling nervous. On Tuesday, he’s publishing his first novel, “The Hellfire Club,” a political thriller set in 1954. It’s an ambitious debut, a meticulously researched work of historical fiction with a byzantine plot punctuated by explosive, Dan Brown-esque twists: a shootout at the Capitol, blackmail, murder, corruption, a stolen dossier, a terrorist attack at the House of Representatives and a top secret society made up of senior lawmakers, lawyers, chief executives and lobbyists, whose elite members engage in absinthe-fueled debauchery and other unsavory acts. Mr. Tapper has spent the last four years working on the novel — a seeming eternity for someone whose metabolism is attuned to the wild gyrations of the 24-hour news cycle, during one of the most volatile and unpredictable eras in the nation’s political history. And now that his book is about to come out, he’s feeling jittery. “It’s nerve wracking,” said Mr. Tapper, sitting at his desk in his office, an elaborately decorated shrine to political losers that’s brimming with campaign posters (the oldest, he proudly notes, is from Henry Clay’s failed presidential run in 1844). “You tinker with it until the last possible second. I can’t pick it up without thinking, oh, I wish I could change this word.” "
"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and longtime friend of President Trump, will join the president’s legal team in an effort to “quickly” resolve the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and possible ties to Trump associates. Mr. Trump will also bring on Jane Serene Raskin and Martin R. Raskin, former federal prosecutors based in Florida, according to Mr. Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow. Mr. Giuliani is himself a former federal prosecutor. “The president said: ‘Rudy is great. He has been my friend for a long time and wants to get this matter quickly resolved for the good of the country,’” Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. The three new lawyers give Mr. Trump a broader legal stable to rely on as he faces not just the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but the threat of an investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan into the president’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen. Federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room last week. Mr. Trump has a difficult time retaining top-flight lawyers as the inquiries have increasingly unsettled him, and he has angrily chafed against his lawyers’ legal strategies. Mr. Trump and his associates believe the issues in New York pose a far greater challenge to the president than even Mr. Mueller’s investigation. They do not know what was taken from Mr. Cohen’s office, and it is not clear what exactly investigators are looking into. But the fact that the authorities were able to get a federal judge to give them permission to raid Mr. Cohen’s office and residences has led Mr. Trump and his associates to believe the government possesses some evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Cohen.

"HOUSTON — It’s going to be strange, living in Houston without Barbara Bush. She was so much a part of this place, even if many of us just imagined that we had anything to do with her. All those literacy galas starring best-selling authors, the loyal appearances at Astros games (thank God she lived to see them win the World Series!), the endless questions about who she would and would not support, and the bracingly frank answers that often seemed a little jolting in a country-club Republican wife. (See most recently: “I don’t know how women” could vote for Donald Trump.) Unlike so many flash-in-the-pan socialites here, Mrs. Bush reigned like a semi-benevolent monarch for decades, particularly after she and 41 moved back to Houston permanently in the 1990s, following that painful loss to Bill Clinton. And once 43 took over the White House in 2000, the Bush stock, which never hit a low here, began to rise precipitously again. It will be very hard to forget all those dinner parties where to say an unkind word about any member of the Bush family was to assure that you were never, ever invited back. In the beginning, they didn’t cause much of a fuss. The Bushes came to Houston from West Texas in 1962, when George H.W. had already set the family on the path to wealth as president of a small oil company. Back then, there were lots of families who were linked to the oil business, and many of them were, well, more colorful. The Bushes were just another pair of Yankee immigrants without much flash, which in those days was the behavior of choice. Then George got into politics, running for president of the Harris County Republican Party in ’62. Most Texans were Democrats back then — even if they were right-wing Democrats — and Barbara’s introduction to local politics sounds about right. She got a flier in the mail calling her father, a publisher of women’s magazines, “a tool of the Commies,” as she wrote in her autobiography, and when she canvassed a neighborhood for her husband a woman kept spitting in her flowerpot while Mrs. Bush asked for her support. Another not-so-potential supporter answered the door in his underwear “and didn’t seem to mind a bit.” “There was some discussion about making George wear a cowboy hat to make him appear more Texan,” Mrs. Bush wrote, when things didn’t look so good. That idea didn’t fly, even if Mr. Bush had proved himself to be a real Texas oilman out in Midland. The truth was, the Bushes lived in Houston as they had lived on the East Coast, like well-bred Yankees. Their friends were other people who acted like Yankees, even if they weren’t real Yankees, like James Baker (the Hill School and Princeton had limited appeal in Houston then). Robert Mosbacher was, on the other hand, a sailing champion in football territory. "
"HAVANA — As soon as Cuba and the Obama administration decided to restore diplomatic relations, decades of bitter stagnation began to give way. Embassies were being reopened. Americans streamed to the island. The curtain was suddenly pulled back from Cuba, a nation frozen out by the Cold War. But one mystery remained: While nearly everyone knew of Cuba’s president, Raúl Castro, his handpicked successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, was virtually unknown. So when members of the United States Congress visited Cuba in early 2015, they peppered Mr. Díaz-Canel with questions: What did he think of the revolution that defined the island’s politics and its place on the world stage? “I was born in 1960, after the revolution,” he told the group, according to lawmakers in the meeting. “I’m not the best person to answer your questions on the subject.” Mr. Díaz-Canel, who became Cuba’s new president on Thursday, the day before his 58th birthday, has spent his entire life in the service of a revolution he did not fight. Born one year after Fidel Castro’s forces took control of the island, Mr. Díaz-Canel is the first person outside the Castro dynasty to lead Cuba in decades. "
"By a lot of measures, these are very good times for the global economy. Nearly every major region of the planet is enjoying solid growth and prosperity simultaneously for the first time in a decade. Yet the world’s top  economic policymakers, who are gathered in Washington this week, are sounding awfully glum. “The present good times will not last for long,” said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, as he released the fund’s latest projections, which foresee a solid 3.9 percent expansion of the global economy in 2018. Or as his boss, the I.M.F. managing director Christine Lagarde, put it, “The current global picture is bright, but we can see darker clouds looming.” The pessimism among policymakers — who are attending spring meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank in Washington this week — contrasts with financial markets. Despite a bumpy couple of months, stocks and most other financial assets are still priced at levels that suggest growth will continue apace for some time to come. “Economists are paid to worry,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve. “We’re paid to find problems and challenges. I think the markets, on the other hand, are pretty good at living in the moment.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Ted Appel was in his pajamas when the firestorm struck. It was 10 p.m. on Oct. 9 and what would become the most destructive wildfire in the history of California was bearing down on the city of Santa Rosa. Mr. Appel, the managing editor of the local newspaper, The Press Democrat, had to act fast. “I pulled reporters out of bed,” Mr. Appel said, thankful that he’d been alerted to the inferno by the veteran photographer Kent Porter. “We posted our first story at 12:35 and updated it 18 times by 6 a.m.” The PD, as the daily is known, quickly had 14 reporters and four photographers in the field. “Our people,” he said, “were in the teeth of it.” The firestorm lasted 30 days, killing 40 people and destroying more than 6,100 homes. Mr. Appel recalls an exhausting grind — part war zone, part marathon — that engulfed every member of his staff. The line between duty and safety soon blurred: Evacuated reporters slept in the newsroom, dogs and children ran between the desks. "
"James B. Comey is currently a lot of things: ex-director of the F.B.I., ex-United States attorney, author, moral crusader, “slimeball” (according to President Trump) and so ubiquitous that he is impossible to ignore. But whether you think he is a heroic truth teller or a self-aggrandizing grandstander, and there are arguments for both, what is indisputable is that he is also something else: a 21st-century embodiment of a 20th-century archetype rooted deep in American mythology. The ultimate G-man. With all the associations and expectations that image implies. If the Trump administration is its own reality show, Mr. Comey represents a character from a different Hollywood tradition. And if the goal of his book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” is to define what “ethical leadership” looks like — well. He’s providing an answer in more ways than one. Even though he is no longer, actually, a G-man — not since being fired by Mr. Trump last May. But oh boy, has he been dressing and acting the part in his appearances on George Stephanopoulos’s “20/20” special, “Good Morning America” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” And he is only going to get more omnipresent, thanks to a media blitz that includes appearances on “Today,” “The View,” “The Rachel Maddow Show” and CNN, and a book tour that lasts until May 25, with stops in New York; Chicago; Portland, Ore.; Washington; and Los Angeles (among other cities). Demand for some of those events is so high that tickets are being resold on sites like StubHub for hundreds of dollars. Mr. Comey stares out from small screens and promotional pictures everywhere — trailers, social media and reviews. He is steely eyed, often glancing upward, as to a higher goal, or resolutely ahead; dark, brush-cut hair just beginning to be smudged with gray; the squareness of his jawline matched only by the squareness of his shoulders, his 6-foot-8 frame often draped in layers of true blue.

President Trump is moving forward with his plan to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Trevor Noah said he didn’t quite know what to make of the news — but he was willing to give Trump credit for diplomacy. The C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, went to North Korea earlier this month, but news of the visit didn’t emerge until weeks later. Samantha Bee thought this week was the right time for a “Full Frontal” attack on Sean Hannity. Bee gave a rundown of the recent revelation that Hannity had been a client of Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen. Then she decided to use some of what she called Hannity’s own dishonest reporting techniques against him: She did an elaborate segment accusing him (sarcastically) of being a serial killer. Kimmel asked a third grader to explain the meaning of “fake news” to the president. Somehow, Stephen Colbert got Gwyneth Paltrow to unironically parody her remarkably unironic brand, Goop. “Scandal” is airing its finale on Thursday night, and members of the cast will appear on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Antonio Banderas is playing Pablo Picasso, his dream role, on National Geographic’s “Genius.” "
"They had shown the immigration officer their proof — the eight years of Facebook photos, their 5-year-old son’s birth certificate, the letters from relatives and friends affirming their commitment — and now they were so close, Karah de Oliveira thought, so nearly a normal couple. Thirteen years after her husband was ordered deported back to his native Brazil, the official recognition of their marriage would bring him within a few signatures of being able to call himself an American. With legal papers, they could buy a house and get a bank loan. He could board a plane. They could take their son to Disney World. Then the officer reappeared. “I’ve got some good news and some bad news,” he said. “The good news is, I’m going to approve your application. Clearly, your marriage is real. The bad news is, ICE is here, and they want to speak with you.” ICE was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency charged with arresting and deporting unauthorized immigrants — including, for the moment, Fabiano de Oliveira. In a back room of the immigration office in Lawrence, Mass., two agents were waiting with handcuffs. Her husband was apologizing, saying he was sorry for putting her through all of this. Ms. de Oliveira kissed him goodbye. “I’ll do whatever I can to get you out,” she said. For decades, marriage to a United States citizen has been a virtual guarantee of legal residency, the main hurdle being proof that the relationship is legitimate. But with the Trump administration in fierce pursuit of unauthorized immigrants across the country, many who were ordered deported years ago are finding that jobs, home and family are no longer a defense — not even for those who have married Americans. As the Trump administration arrests thousands of immigrants with no criminal history and reshapes the prospects of even legal immigrants — an overdue corrective, officials say, to the lenient policies of the past — many who have lived without papers for years are urgently seeking legal status by way of a parent, adult child or spouse who is already a citizen or permanent resident.

"WASHINGTON — As trade tensions mount, an 84-year-old Washington institution could have been a powerful tool for President Trump. The institution, the Export-Import Bank, was created to help American companies compete overseas and bolster exports by providing cheap government-backed loans. But the institution, which once financed multibillion-dollar projects, has been effectively crippled by the Trump administration. The bank has been without a chairman since Mr. Trump took office and the last of the bank’s five board members quit in March. Since 2015, it has not had the quorum of at least three members it needs to finance deals or projects worth more than $10 million. The effective shuttering of the bank has put American manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric at a global disadvantage, prompting a frenzied lobbying campaign by business groups worried that the White House is undermining its own trade goals. “The Export-Import Bank plays a vital role in supporting American companies as they work to sell their products to customers across the world,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “But as long as the seats remain vacant, U.S. businesses are at a disadvantage relative to global competitors.” In the past, the bank had been used by large corporations like Boeing and General Electric, which received loan guarantees to sell products like airplanes, satellites and industrial equipment to developing countries, lifting sales and supporting American jobs. It has provided loan guarantees to overseas airlines looking to buy American-made jets and helped organizations like the Environmental Chemical Corporation build water facilities in Africa. Proponents of the bank, including some lawmakers, argue the institution could be a powerful weapon for a president who wants to increase domestic manufacturing and narrow the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports overseas.

"South of the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and the slot-obsessed zombies of the Sin City Strip, there’s a shopping mall that counts Whole Foods among its tenants. If you’re going to make the drive up the Great Basin Highway in hopes of finding Basin and Range National Monument — the whereabouts of which many locals seem utterly unfamiliar with — you’re going to want to stock up on food and water here, because you probably will (and probably should) get lost along the way. I steered my rented Nissan sedan onto northbound Interstate 15 on a mild day in November, eventually arriving at the juncture for the Great Basin Highway, which is signaled by a massive solar farm, its panels resembling a lake of tar. Past the red-rock canyons, craggy cactuses, stacks of boulders, and Lilliputian forests that populate the landscape, you’ll hit something resembling civilization in the tiny town of Alamo, which hosts a few motels, a cafe, a high school, a gas station-supermarket hybrid and not much else. Shortly thereafter, the highway juts east toward Caliente, marking the most picturesque portion of the drive. On this stretch, I encountered a pair of wild horses — dam and foal, presumably — and a disheveled man hauling a wheelbarrow full of possessions down the highway. He made no attempt to hitchhike or flag down help, and I questioned whether he was an apparition until I saw him again on the way back. By “way back,” I don’t mean on the way back from Basin and Range. I’d overshot my intended Mount Irish access point by about 45 minutes before a kind cashier at a service station near Panaca handed me a map. Basin and Range wasn’t on it, so I set out to find a towering silver alien in front of a Quonset hut on Nevada’s Extraterrestrial Highway, so named because of nearby Area 51. As an El Camino in need of a scrub fired up in a large, desolate parking lot, this sheet-metal symbol of galactic sentience stood in front of the Alien Research Center, a deceptively named retail shop that sells clothing, trinkets, U.F.O. publications and Alien Tequila, a brand the operation’s owner, George Harris, manufactures in Mexico. Manning the front desk was Harris’ brother, Malcolm. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “If I think that it’s a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go. If the meeting, when I’m there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave.” While expressing optimism about his potentially historic summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, President Trump acknowledged on Wednesday that it could end in failure. Among the possible hurdles: the fate of three U.S. citizens detained by Pyongyang. The date and location of the talks have yet to be decided. (The venue might depend on the state of North Korea’s Soviet-era air fleet.) • Also on Wednesday, South Korea confirmed that it had been in talks with U.S. and North Korean officials about negotiating a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War. • President Raúl Castro is expected to step down today, handing power to someone outside his family for the first time in more than half a century. His handpicked successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, 57, is a Communist Party loyalist who has shown the sort of restraint the Castros have always prized. But that caution means he’s an enigma both at home and abroad. Our video explains what is known about Mr. Díaz-Canel. "
"An auditing firm responsible for monitoring Facebook for federal regulators told them last year that the company had sufficient privacy protections in place, even after the social media giant lost control of a huge trove of user data that was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The assertion, by PwC, came in a report submitted to the Federal Trade Commission in early 2017. The report, a redacted copy of which is available on the commission’s website, is one of several periodic reviews of Facebook’s compliance with a 2011 federal consent decree, which required Facebook to take wide-ranging steps to prevent the abuse of users’ information and to inform them how it was being shared with other companies. The accounting firm, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, effectively gave Facebook a clean bill of health. “Facebook’s privacy controls were operating with sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance to protect the privacy” of users, said the assessment, which stretched from February 2015 to February 2017. But during that period, Facebook was aware that a researcher based in Britain, Aleksandr Kogan, had provided Cambridge Analytica with private Facebook data from millions of users. Cambridge, which later worked for the Trump campaign, used the information to build psychological profiles of American voters before the 2016 election. Some details of Mr. Kogan’s work — though not the full scope of the data he had obtained — were revealed in an article in The Guardian in late 2015. Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged to lawmakers this month that the company had not informed users that Cambridge had acquired their data. In testimony before the Senate, he said the company had previously accepted Cambridge’s assurances that it wasn’t using Mr. Kogan’s data and had deleted it. “We considered it a closed case,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.” An investigation by The New York Times, The Observer and The Guardian last month found that Cambridge had obtained the private data of more than 50 million users without their consent. Facebook has since estimated that as many as 87 million users were affected. "
"It has been just over a year since American diplomacy entered a dark age, but the time for mourning has passed. The Trump White House’s disdain for diplomacy persists, and that probably won’t change. The new national security adviser, John Bolton, is no fan of diplomacy or diplomats. The best that the Foreign Service and those outside government in academia and at think tanks can do now is prepare wisely for the day after Mr. Trump leaves office to make sure that a renaissance follows the dark age. Many career diplomats in Washington have little to do these days. Some are between assignments because of the administration’s failure to fill hundreds of State Department positions. Others have jobs but find themselves increasingly ignored or sidelined. The silver lining is, they now have time to turn inward and find solutions to their problems — both those created by Mr. Trump’s neglect and those that have long plagued the department. There is even a precedent for this in American history. After the Civil War, Congress drastically slashed the United States Army’s budget. The service lost its sense of mission and morale suffered. So smart and farsighted officers began thinking and writing about how to initiate reforms and strengthen professionalism, to be ready when the dark period ended. One of the modern Foreign Service’s biggest cultural challenges has been to organically produce true — even if informal — leaders within its ranks, regardless of their formal positions or titles. This is one reason nobody has emerged as the face of the current discontent with the administration’s war on diplomacy. Even in normal times, career diplomats are conditioned to keep their heads down and not make much noise. The diplomats have to get over that. Abnormal times like these demand that grass-roots leaders take the initiative and mobilize their colleagues to create a path to a revival. "
"This article has been updated to reflect recent developments. There are few things more worrisome to imagine than the situation we have today in the Middle East. One, however, would be the current situation in the Middle East with nuclear-armed states. So far, the international regime of nonproliferation has effectively kept the number of nuclear-armed states at bay, even within the context of the continuing regional cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The most important and promising step taken toward nonproliferation in the past 20 years — the one with the most impact — is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. A document 159 pages long, it was signed in Vienna with the Islamic Republic of Iran almost three years ago by the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany. It is not only a historical landmark — the crowning achievement of 12 years of intense diplomatic negotiations — but also a safeguard against a nuclear Middle East. Yet President Trump and his administration have threatened to pull out of this compact. America’s withdrawal would put the agreement at high risk; it might also prompt the Iranians to leave the pact, starting a nuclear race in the region. It would drive a wedge in the trans-Atlantic partnership and drive Europe into a kind of forced marriage with the Russians and Chinese to save at least part of the deal. Of course, we are not blind to the discord and disarray resulting from Iran’s actions and attitude in the region. We strongly condemn its contribution to the war in Syria and its backing of the murderous government of President Bashar al-Assad, as well as Iran’s support, by varying degrees, of nonstate actors like Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. However, by taking the threat that Iran would develop a nuclear weapon off the table, the pact has effectively limited that country’s means to carry out its destabilizing activities. "
"Good morning on this cold and rainy Thursday. Long Island Rail Road riders, meet your new president: Phillip Eng. Mr. Eng stepped into the role this week after Patrick Nowakowski, the previous president, resigned following a scathing report by the state comptroller. The report slammed the railroad’s 2017 on-time performance, the worst in 18 years, as “unacceptable.” “I know that our riders are expecting, and they deserve, that we turn this around,” said Mr. Eng, 56, who had previously served as the chief operating officer of the M.T.A. and the acting president of New York City Transit. “We will do that.” We sat down yesterday with Mr. Eng, a Long Island native, in his new office in Jamaica Station, where trains creaked outside the window and wall-mounted screens played surveillance footage from Pennsylvania Station. We spoke with him about his priorities in the coming months, and then asked him questions posed by our readers. His responses have been condensed and lightly edited. NYT: What’s the first issue you’ll focus on? ENG: The big thing is really communication. Riders feel like they haven’t been heard. They also want real-time communication from us, not only with our daily service but also on incidents, the status of the incident and the actual cause of the incident. We also need to make sure we have people in our key hubs who can talk to our customers and give them the answers that they need. NYT: You commute to Queens from Smithtown on the L.I.R.R.

"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Regulators are about to hit Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty. • The European Union is prepared to offer some trade concessions. • Two big drug makers have shown interest in bidding for Shire. • How the Time Warner C.E.O. did on the stand yesterday. • Dates to watch in the U.S.-China trade fight. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Regulators are about to hit Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty, according to a report by our colleagues Emily Flitter and Glenn Thrush. The action, and the wide range of misdeeds at the bank, is a sobering reminder of how much can go wrong beneath the surface at a company with a strong reputation. The basics: • It would be the most stringent action taken against a bank by the Trump administration. • The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are the regulators levying the penalty. Notably, the bureau is led by Mick Mulvaney, who wants the agency to take a softer approach toward the financial industry. • The action is said to punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance they didn’t need, improperly charging mortgage customers and for having inadequate compliance practices. The misdeeds at Wells Fargo showed that the bank’s sales culture had degraded. Bank employees, eager to meet sales goals, had been opening accounts for customers without their consent. Other misdeeds were revealed as well. "
"North Korea has dropped its demand that American troops be removed from South Korea as a condition for giving up its nuclear weapons, South Korea’s president said Thursday in presenting the idea to the United States. President Moon Jae-in portrayed the proposal as a concession on the eve of talks involving the two Koreas and the United States. The North has long demanded that the 28,500 American troops be withdrawn, citing their presence as a pretext to justify its pursuit of nuclear weapons. But in Washington, the Trump administration privately dismissed the idea that it was a capitulation by the North because an American withdrawal from the South was never on the table. Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director whom President Trump secretly sent to Pyongyang two weeks ago to meet Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, did not ask him to take such a step, senior officials said. The move could increase pressure on the United States to support negotiations between North and South Korea on a peace treaty that would end the Korean War. While Mr. Trump gave those talks his blessing this week, officials said his ultimate goal is to force North Korea to relinquish its nuclear program. A peace treaty, they said, should be signed only after the North has given up its weapons. Mr. Trump has expressed excitement about his own planned summit meeting with Mr. Kim, but on Wednesday, he said he was ready to bail out before, or even during, the meeting if he concluded that diplomacy was not bearing fruit. He also said the United States would keep sanctions on North Korea until it ends its nuclear program. “We have great respect for many aspects of what they’re doing, but we have to get it together,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “We have to end nuclear weapons.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Democrats have long been dreaming about turning Texas purple. The state’s rising Latino population, plus an influx of liberals and moderates into Texas’ big cities, would allow Democrats to win statewide races for the first time in decades. Or so goes the fantasy. Despite years of predictions and hopes, Democratic victories in Texas haven’t looked any closer to reality. In 2014, Wendy Davis was supposed to have a shot at winning the governor’s race. She lost by more than 20 percentage points. Why? White voters’ shift to the right has easily kept pace with demographic change, as David Byler of The Weekly Standard has suggested. This year has brought a new Democratic hope: Beto O’Rourke, a member of the House who’s trying to win Ted Cruz’s Senate seat. O’Rourke is, as my colleague Frank Bruni recently wrote, “a peppy, rangy, toothy progressive with ratios of folksiness to urbanity and irreverence to earnestness that might well have been cooked up in some political laboratory.” I keep hearing from people I know in Texas that O’Rourke is the real deal. I have remained skeptical — not of him personally but of his chances to win. Democrats haven’t only been losing major statewide races in Texas for more than a quarter century. They’ve been losing them big. There has yet to be a close call that suggests a purple Texas is more than a fantasy. But I will admit that a new poll, which came out yesterday, has caused me to question my own skepticism. The poll — conducted by Quinnipiac University, one of the country’s most rigorous pollsters — was the first major public poll of the campaign. And it showed Cruz with just a three-percentage lead, 47 percent to 44 percent, which is a giant warning sign for an incumbent. As Quinnipiac said, the race is “too close to call” at this stage. "

"The nation’s largest cities and metropolitan areas — home to a majority of Democratic voters — are at the forefront of the party’s most vexing racial, ethnic and class conflicts. Last week, in an essay for CityLab, Richard Florida, a professor of urban planning at the University of Toronto, described how housing costs are driving the growing division between upwardly and downwardly mobile populations within Democratic ranks: Allies on Election Day, the two wings of the Democratic Party are growing further estranged in other aspects of their lives, driven apart by the movement of advantaged and disadvantaged populations within and between cities. These demographic patterns exacerbate intraparty tensions. Florida, writing with Benjamin Schneider of CityLab, expands on this point: The competition for housing between rich and poor has become a critically important and divisive issue in urban America. “The state of housing affordability in the expensive coastal metros is driving a wedge between two factions of the American left,” Issi Romem, a fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an email to me. In a paper published earlier this month, “Characteristics of Domestic Cross-Metropolitan Migrants,” Romem looked at the income and education levels of families moving in and out of 441 metropolitan areas. He found that One of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the country, San Francisco, is also one of the most Democratic sections of the country, (San Francisco County: Clinton 84.5 percent, Trump 9.2 percent). According to Romem, between 2005 and 2016, those moving into the San Francisco area had median household incomes averaging $12,639 a year more than the households of the families moving out, $70,015 to $57,376. Conversely, in the struggling Syracuse metropolitan area (Clinton 53.9 percent, Trump 40.1 percent), families moving in between 2005 and 2016 had median household incomes of $35,219 — $7,229 less than the median income of the families moving out of the region, $42,448.

"ALBANY — In the drama-laden race for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York — a contest that, although only one month old, has seen more fireworks than many campaigns ever do — the Working Families Party’s endorsement of Cynthia Nixon still stood out. The party’s decision on Saturday assured Ms. Nixon of a ballot line in November, gave her early bragging rights over the two-term incumbent, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and solidified her progressive bona fides. The endorsement also served as a catharsis to W.F.P.’s leaders, who likened it to breaking off a borderline abusive relationship. “You know the way you feel when you know you’ve done the right thing?” said Bill Lipton, the W.F.P.’s state director. “You sleep better at night.” As the dust settles on the party’s choice, the question remains of how, in practical terms — and how much, in political terms — the W.F.P. endorsement will help Ms. Nixon, an actress and educational activist making her first run for political office. The Working Families Party, a small but influential alliance built by labor unions and progressive activists, has become a force in local races, offering candidate and staff training, paid canvassers and organizers to fledgling campaigns. But as the party prepared to endorse Ms. Nixon, two powerful and prominent labor groups, with the governor’s blessing, pulled their support from the W.F.P. — a blow to the finances of the party, which has a $1.7 million yearly budget and a statewide staff of about 15 people.
