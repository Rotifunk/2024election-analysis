"The Showtime political documentary series “The Circus” is set to return in April, minus its most recognizable star: Mark Halperin, the high-flying journalist whose career was felled last year by allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Replacing Mr. Halperin will be Alex Wagner, a CBS News anchor and former MSNBC host. She will join two of the original hosts, the writer John Heilemann, Mr. Halperin’s longtime professional partner, and Mark McKinnon, a Stetson-sporting political consultant. “The Circus” is the only project linked to Mr. Halperin to survive the numerous allegations against him, including claims that he made unwanted sexual advances toward female co-workers at ABC News. Mr. Halperin lost his gig as a commentator at MSNBC, and Penguin Press canceled the next installment of “Game Change,” the lucrative franchise of campaign books he wrote with Mr. Heilemann. HBO, one of Showtime’s rivals, also canceled a planned “Game Change” movie about the 2016 presidential race. In a joint interview on Tuesday with his “Circus” co-hosts, Mr. McKinnon said he and David Nevins, Showtime’s chief executive, had discussed the future of the series shortly after the revelations about Mr. Halperin surfaced in October. “We all strongly believe that the success of the show is not based on the co-hosts — it’s based on the concept,” Mr. McKinnon said. “No one co-host was irreplaceable.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/media/showtime-the-circus-halperin.html?searchResultPosition=107

"I have a New Year’s confession: I retweeted President Trump with approval, not something I had expected to do, especially on the subject of Iran. But Trump has been right to get behind the brave Iranian protesters calling for political and economic change. The tweet in question: These are the largest popular protests since the Iranian uprising in 2009 against a fraudulent election. I was in an enormous crowd (estimated in the millions) that marched from Tehran’s Enghelab (Revolution) Square to Azadi (Freedom) Square three days after the vote. Fear evaporated in that throng. I asked a young woman to whom I’d been talking what her name was. “My name is Iran,” she replied. The memory still gives me goose bumps. For a few days, the Islamic republic stood on a knife’s edge. I have often asked myself what would have happened if Mir Hussein Moussavi, the leader of the reformist Green Movement who was later placed under house arrest, had told that crowd to march on the seats of power in the name of the ballot box over theocratic whim. Signs of disarray were palpable before the regime led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cracked down through the thugs of the Basij militia. As I wrote at the time, “There’s nothing more repugnant than seeing women being hit by big men armed with clubs and the license of the state.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/opinion/trump-right-iran-protest.html?searchResultPosition=110
"WASHINGTON — President Trump made his first “Crooked Hillary” Twitter post less than 48 hours into the new year on Tuesday, accusing a former Clinton aide of “disregarding basic security protocols,” and calling his own Justice Department a “deep state.” Attacking Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic opponent from the 2016 presidential election, and taking aim at his own Justice Department struck familiar tones for the new year. Almost 14 months after the election, Mr. Trump has kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on Mrs. Clinton. Last year, Mr. Trump also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents. The Twitter post on Tuesday morning followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Mr. Trump closely monitors. The article said the aide, Huma Abedin, forwarded some government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which affected all three billion of its accounts. After the breach, the data was offered for sale by a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe. Mr. Trump also implored his administration to investigate Ms. Abedin. The term “deep state” typically refers to a shadow government of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy; they are usually associated with countries that have authoritarian elements that undercut democratically elected leaders. On Friday, the State Department released about 3,000 of Ms. Abedin’s work-related emails. The emails were found on the laptop of Ms. Abedin’s now estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request. The emails found on Mr. Weiner’s computer are a sore spot for Mrs. Clinton. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, had notified Congress shortly before the 2016 election about the existence of newly discovered emails that could be relevant to the closed investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton, in a book released last year, said Mr. Comey’s disclosure hurt her campaign’s momentum and helped Mr. Trump win the election. In his Twitter post, Mr. Trump also referred to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine. According to a report in Fox News, the sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from the president, but has not.

"To the Editor: Re “How Not to Impeach” (Op-Ed, Jan. 2): Greg Weiner is correct that the process of impeachment must be conducted with “sobriety.” While it may still be “unclear” whether or not Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses, if he has, there should be no question that impeachment is the “prudent political remedy.” It is naïve to think that it is possible, if the process confirms that impeachable offenses were committed, to “reconcile the public, including Mr. Trump’s base,” with his critics. We cannot ignore the simple truth that this base is unmoved by the irrefutable evidence that Mr. Trump, among other character flaws, is a proven liar and dangerous egomaniac and is the most unfit and unqualified president in our history. Yes, impeachment is a political process, but it is the responsibility of Congress, if warranted, to exercise one of its “most solemn” constitutional powers without regard to whether or not it can muster enough public opinion to give it cover.

"A Turkish banker was convicted on Wednesday of taking part in a billion-dollar scheme to evade American sanctions against Iran, in a case that painted a picture of high-level corruption in Turkey and heightened tensions between the United States and a NATO ally. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was not charged in the indictment, but he seemed to loom over the Federal District Court case in Manhattan during the monthlong trial and even before it began. Testimony suggested that he had approved the sanctions-busting scheme. Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials had bitterly denounced the charges against the banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, and eight co-defendants, and repeatedly urged American officials to drop the case. Mr. Erdogan even took the matter up with President Trump. The case was followed closely in Turkey, where the government was already angry at the United States for giving shelter to a cleric Mr. Erdogan says was behind a coup attempt in 2016. Mr. Atilla, the deputy general manager for international banking at Halkbank, a Turkish state bank, was the only defendant to be tried. A co-defendant, Reza Zarrab, a wealthy gold trader, pleaded guilty shortly before the trial began and became the star prosecution witness. The seven other defendants are still at large. Mr. Atilla, 47, was described by prosecutors as a “fixer” who helped Iran circumvent the sanctions and gain access to billions of dollars of restricted petrodollar funds that were being held at the bank.

"President Trump has vowed to block millions of dollars of funding for Palestinians, declaring on Twitter on Tuesday that they were “no longer willing to talk peace.” Much of that aid flows through the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, or Unrwa. While Mr. Trump did not explicitly mention the agency, his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, made it clear that the agency was being looked at. Asked specifically about Unrwa, Ms. Haley said: “He does not want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians are agreeing to come back to the negotiation table.” Many have expressed concern about Ms. Haley’s remarks. What is Unrwa, and how would a cut in American aid affect its work with more than five million Palestinian refugees? The agency was set up in 1949 to provide humanitarian aid in the wake of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which left hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced in the Middle East. Unrwa was initially intended to be a temporary agency, but it has continued to provide support for Palestinian refugees for the better part of six decades. Palestinians are the only refugee group whose support is not handled under the broader mandate of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The agency has never been involved in peace negotiations and has instead focused its attention on humanitarian efforts throughout the Middle East in areas where the largest numbers of displaced Palestinians are concentrated. Israel has regularly feuded with the organization, as it rejects the Palestinian demand for a right of return for the refugees displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve has entered 2018 without a clear plan for raising its benchmark interest rate and with the added uncertainty of an imminent change in its leadership. An account of the Fed’s final meeting of 2017, which the central bank published Wednesday, said officials generally agreed that the Fed should continue to raise its benchmark rate in the new year. But Fed officials expressed a range of views about the frequency of future hikes. Six of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted during the December meeting that the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018. But six officials predicted two hikes or fewer and four officials predicted the Fed would raise rates at least four times. The decision about how often to raise rates will be made under new management. The Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, plans to leave the Fed in early February; her nominated successor, the Fed governor Jerome H. Powell, is awaiting a Senate confirmation vote. Last year was the first since the 2008 financial crisis that the Fed articulated a clear plan for monetary policy and stuck with it. The central bank said it would raise rates three times and did exactly that, with the third hike coming in December. The decision at that meeting to raise the benchmark rate into a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent reflected the Fed’s optimistic expectations for the economy, the account said.

"President Trump boasted Tuesday evening that he had a “nuclear button” that is “much bigger” and “more powerful” than North Korea’s, again prompting fears that an errant tweet could lead to a nuclear conflict. (It is worth noting that there is no nuclear button.) The remark led to an immediate debate over whether Mr. Trump had broken Twitter’s rules and whether the platform should bar him from posting. A company spokeswoman said in an interview on Wednesday that the tweet had not violated its terms of service. The platform’s policy says that only “specific threats of violence or wishing for serious physical harm, death, or disease to an individual or group of people” constitute violations. Then, on Friday, Twitter released a new rule pertaining solely to world leaders. “Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,” it said in its announcement.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, sued the special counsel on Wednesday and asked a federal court to narrow his authority, escalating Republican efforts to discredit an investigation that has stretched longer than the White House expected. The unusual move comes as Mr. Trump tries to portray the investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt that has cast a dark cloud over his administration and, in his view, the country. The president said last week that he hoped the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would treat him fairly. Mr. Trump’s lawyers have advised against directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a Republican former F.B.I. director who is regarded as one of the premier law enforcement officials of his time. But with four former Trump campaign aides facing charges and no end to the investigation in sight, some of Mr. Trump’s allies have stepped up their attacks. Mr. Manafort’s lawsuit gives voice to one of the common grievances Mr. Trump’s supporters have with Mr. Mueller: None of the charges he has brought answer the central question of his inquiry. Mr. Mueller is investigating the Russian government’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone close to Mr. Trump was involved. As part of that investigation, prosecutors indicted Mr. Manafort on money laundering charges related to years of foreign lobbying — but not related to Russian election interference or the Trump campaign. Mr. Manafort argued in the lawsuit that Mr. Mueller had gone too far. He sued both Mr. Mueller and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who appointed Mr. Mueller. The lawsuit said Mr. Rosenstein had improperly given Mr. Mueller the authority to investigate “anything he stumbles across while investigating, no matter how remote.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/manafort-lawsuit-mueller.html?searchResultPosition=68
"BRUSSELS — After some delay, the European Union has called the deaths of Iranians over nearly a week of protests “inexcusable,” but its members have so far pushed back against American efforts to issue a more full-throated, joint condemnation. The Europeans are especially anxious that President Trump may use the protests in Iran as a reason to reimpose United States economic sanctions on Iran, possibly killing the multilateral deal that limited the country’s nuclear program. The Europeans also suggest that Mr. Trump’s open support for the protesters in Iran risks helping the country’s religious and political hard-liners and damaging the relatively more moderate Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. The European reluctance to side more openly with the protesters is the latest divergence of approach with the United States over a critical matter of foreign policy since Mr. Trump announced he would move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. “The Europeans see an erratic response by Trump to the situation and believe that his messaging is playing right into the hands of the more radical elements in Iran, and they don’t want to add fuel to the fire,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations. The nuclear deal “is in the background of all this for the Europeans and for Rouhani, too, especially given sanctions renewal in mid-January,” Ms. Geranmayeh said.

"When Hollywood women announced that they would wear black at this Sunday’s Golden Globes in solidarity with sexual misconduct victims, it was inevitable that the plan would draw eye rolls. Popular culture’s fascination with — and derision for — the pomp and preening baked into awards shows can’t but extend to the women fixed in the cameras’ glare. Alternately revering and tearing down famous women for their red-carpet looks has become a blood sport. Any causes that actors and actresses might promote, from the carpet or the stage, can have the hollow ring of political messaging by beauty pageant contestants (with all due respect to the recent Miss Peru hopefuls who powerfully protested gender violence). Isn’t the red carpet at its heart a fashion show, a parade of the ultra-privileged, the land of “Good point, Cate, now let’s talk about that dress”? Doesn’t it perpetuate the objectification of women? Better to stay home, said the critics of Operation Black Gown: silently posturing in black would achieve exactly zilch. But then an anti-sexual-harassment action plan, impressive in its breadth and created by hundreds of powerful women in entertainment, was announced on New Year’s Day. Christened Time’s Up, the initiative includes a $14 million legal fund to help victims of sexual harassment nationwide, legislation to punish companies that tolerate it, and a push for gender equality among executives at talent agencies and studios. Asking women to wear black to the Globes was just part of Times Up’s larger vision. “A show of solidarity at an awards show is one very small piece,” said Reese Witherspoon, who spoke to the Bagger in late December about Time’s Up. “It really is a statement that women are deeply unified, we always have been, and that we stand up for those who can’t speak up.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/movies/times-up-golden-globes-red-carpet.html?searchResultPosition=71
"WASHINGTON — President Trump excommunicated his onetime chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, from his circle on Wednesday, ending for now a partnership of convenience that transformed American politics while raising questions about the future of the nationalist-populist movement they cultivated together. The rupture came after Mr. Bannon was quoted in a new book disparaging the president’s children, asserting that Donald Trump Jr. had been “treasonous” in meeting with Russians and calling Ivanka Trump “dumb as a brick.” Mr. Trump, described by his spokeswoman as “furious, disgusted,” fired back by saying that Mr. Bannon had “lost his mind.” In a written statement, the president excoriated Mr. Bannon as a self-promoting exaggerator who had “very little to do with our historic victory” in the 2016 presidential election and was “only in it for himself.” Rather than representing Mr. Trump’s hard-core political base or supporting his agenda to “make America great again,” Mr. Bannon was “simply seeking to burn it all down,” the president said. While Mr. Trump had remained in touch with Mr. Bannon after pushing him out of the White House over the summer, the two now appear to have reached a breaking point. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,” Mr. Trump said. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.” Assuming it lasts — and with Mr. Trump, nothing is ever certain — the schism could test whether he or Mr. Bannon has more resonance with the conservative base that has sustained the president through a tumultuous tenure marked by low poll numbers. Mr. Bannon’s Breitbart News has been a key weapon in Mr. Trump’s hostile takeover of the Republican Party. Cheering the breakup on Wednesday were establishment Republicans who resent Mr. Bannon’s bomb-throwing style and his vows to wage war on incumbent lawmakers in the party primaries this year. Senate Republicans could barely contain their glee as they redistributed Mr. Trump’s statement blasting Mr. Bannon with the note “in case you missed it” and a smiling face symbol. By afternoon, candidates whom Mr. Bannon has endorsed in a handful of races faced pressure to disavow his remarks about the president’s son.

"When Orrin Hatch’s career in the United States Senate ends on Jan. 3, 2019, it will have spanned an audacious 42 years, or seven full terms. Assuming he completes his final term, Mr. Hatch will become the sixth-longest-serving senator ever. His service truly has been epochal. Unfortunately, the epoch has not been a happy one. Mr. Hatch’s career reflects the sad trajectory of our times, from a Congress where legislators had differences but actually tried to legislate, to one in which legislators — especially Republicans, terrified of facing a well-financed primary from the right — do nothing of the sort. Mr. Hatch was elected in 1976 in one of the most improbable Senate victories, still, in recent American history. He was a Mormon, but a Pittsburgher; he had moved to Salt Lake City only in 1969 (though he had earlier done his undergraduate work at Brigham Young University, in Provo). He had no political experience and few political contacts when, the day before the deadline, this complete unknown filed his papers of candidacy for the mighty United States Senate. The incumbent was — and how strange does this sound today? — a Utah Democrat. Frank Moss had won the seat freakishly in 1958, when the Republicans split and ran two candidates. But he’d gotten himself re-elected twice and was a key leader on consumer issues. In 1976, Utah was still a centrist enough state that Moss had reason to think he’d win a fourth term. Four Republicans vied for the right to run against him. Mr. Hatch was the most conservative of the four. He had the backing of W. Cleon Skousen, a Utah-based far-right conspiracist whose pamphlets included the 1963 classic “The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society.” At the last minute in the Republican primary, Mr. Hatch finagled the backing of Ronald Reagan, who initially sent a statement in support of “Warren” Hatch. Mr. Hatch’s rhetoric, said the wife of the Republican establishment candidate, “seemed to appeal to those who were slightly estranged from the general society.” But he energized the state’s conservative primary voters and won. In the general, he bested a befuddled Moss, who’d never given a moment’s thought to the prospect that Mr. Hatch could emerge as his opponent.

"TIJUANA, Mexico — Is Donald Trump a conceptual artist? That’s the intriguing possibility put forth in an online petition Tuesday that seeks to have the group of eight prototypes for Mr. Trump’s controversial Mexican border wall designated a national monument. The prototypes were built at a cost of $3.3 million in federal funds and unveiled last October along the United States border near San Diego. The petition, sponsored by the puckishly named nonprofit, MAGA (the acronym recalls the President’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”), seeks to protect the prototypes from demolition by invoking the Antiquities Act of 1906 and characterizes the structures as “a major Land Art exhibition” of “significant cultural value.” The notion that the prototypes could qualify as conceptual art might seem somewhat far-fetched. They were designed to United States Customs and Border Protection specifications, built to withstand a 30-minute assault from sledgehammers to acetylene torches, and to be difficult to scale or tunnel beneath. Aesthetic considerations are largely secondary to brute strength, but, when viewed up close, the walls collectively have the undeniable majesty of minimalist sculpture. Mr. Trump dramatically reduced the size of two existing national monuments under federal protection just last month (a White House spokesperson did not respond this week to questions about the border wall project and President Trump). He would need to issue a presidential proclamation to establish the group as a monument. That particular irony is not lost on Christoph Büchel, the Swiss-Icelandic artist behind MAGA. Mr. Büchel originally posted the petition to the White House’s We the People website, started in 2011 by the Obama administration to allow citizens to lobby the president’s staff directly, but the site was taken down for maintenance until the end of January. MAGA has since created a website to promote the project and gather signatures.

"WASHINGTON — Democrats counted their New Year’s blessings on Wednesday as two new senators — Doug Jones of Alabama and Tina Smith of Minnesota — joined their caucus, reshaping the balance of power in the Senate after a history-laden swearing-in ceremony attended by three current and former vice presidents. The arrival of Mr. Jones, who replaced a Republican (Ms. Smith replaced a Democrat) alters the makeup of the Senate, giving Republicans a one-vote majority of 51 to 49. That could prove just enough to thwart much of President Trump’s legislative agenda. It also provided the first tangible boost to Democratic power in Washington since the crushing and unexpected defeats of Election Day 2016, which many Democrats had believed would usher in a new Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. “This is a miracle — to have a Democratic senator from Alabama!” Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said after mingling at a reception for Mr. Jones. The new senator told his supporters that his arrival in Washington was “the fulfillment of a dream for a long time.” Rare are the moments of bipartisan comity in the Senate, but Wednesday’s ceremony offered one, however fleeting. It was the senators’ first day back at work after their holiday break — a time of “fresh starts and new mercies,” as the Senate chaplain, Barry C. Black, said in his opening prayer at noon.

"During the final days of the Nixon administration in 1974, “Death Wish” became a populist smash as moviegoers cheered a vigilante Charles Bronson taking revenge on the punks who killed his wife and raped his daughter. 44 years later, MGM hopes to tap into the Trump era’s similar law-and-disorder mentality with a remake casting the “Die Hard” veteran Bruce Willis in the lead role. The action has been moved from Manhattan to Chicago, and the protagonist Paul Kersey is now a doctor rather than an architect. A new trailer begins with statistics meant to build a case for Dr. Kersey giving the perps who invaded his idyllic house a taste of their own medicine, claiming that out of 125 million families in the U.S., “1 in 4 will become victims of a crime.” The final sentence says “What if your family was next” The incorrect punctuation seems intentional, as if it’s not meant to be posed as a question. “The men who did it are out there,” Dr. Kersey growls. “I’m going to hunt them down one by one.” And so he does, killing one grease monkey by pulling out the jack holding up a car he’s working underneath and buying a gun from a busty blond who winks at him and coos, “You’re cocked, locked and ready to rock.” Written by Joe Carnahan (“Narc”) and directed by Eli Roth (“Hostel”), the new “Death Wish” co-stars Elisabeth Shue (“Leaving Las Vegas”) as Dr. Kersey’s doomed wife, Vincent D’Onofrio (“Law & Order: Criminal Intent”) as his brother and Dean Norris (“Breaking Bad”) as an ineffectual cop. Originally slated to be released over Thanksgiving weekend of 2017, the film will now hit theaters on the less family-friendly date of March 2.

"The auto industry’s long-running sales party has come to an end. After seven straight years of growth in domestic new-vehicle sales, manufacturers on Wednesday reported a decline of about 1.8 percent in 2017, to 17.2 million cars and light trucks. Further dampening the mood is the consensus that 2018 will bring an even larger drop. Edmunds.com, an auto-information website, predicts that just 16.8 million light vehicles will be sold this year. “Over all, you have to be cautious in this environment,” said Adam Silverleib, vice president of Silko Honda, a dealership in Raynham, Mass. “The industry cycle has peaked.” Some factors that propelled the upward swing are now fading or changing course. Exceptionally low interest rates are turning higher. And quality has improved, customer-satisfaction surveys have shown, so many Americans are keeping their cars longer. During the recession, consumers and businesses put off buying new vehicles. When the economy improved, many rushed out to replace the clunkers they’d been driving, driving sales up year after year. “The market is pretty saturated right now,” said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com.

"As far as Emily Cochrane is concerned, there is no Joe Biden. For Ms. Cochrane, per Times style, there is only Joseph R. Biden Jr. Ditto Michael T. Flynn, Eric H. Holder Jr., Roy S. Moore, Robert S. Mueller III, Christopher A. Wray, Michael E. Horowitz, and Donald J. Trump. The comedian Gilbert Gottfried had an old bit where he’d wander into the land of the three-name people, then escape to the land of the one-named people, before finally finding himself in the land of the people with initials in their names. Ms. Cochrane would have felt right at home. “The New York Times has a very specific style in terms of people who use middle initials,” she said. Middle initials are just the beginning. As the Washington bureau’s fact-checker, Ms. Cochrane reads stories generated among the 50 reporters based there; as they and editors cobble pieces together, she looks over their shoulders to confirm names, dates, quotes and other factual points across the dozen or more articles the bureau publishes each day. Fact-checkers, as the name implies, validate the information in stories written by colleagues. Their duties can include re-crunching arithmetic in search of errant decimals, verifying the spelling of names and ensuring Republican politicians are not called Democrats, or vice versa (a grievous error in these partisan times). Although common at magazines, where there is generally more time to review a story, in the fast-paced world of newspapers fact-checkers are so rare as to be virtually nonexistent. Peter Baker, The Times’s chief White House correspondent, said that he had never before in his 30-year career come across a full-time newspaper fact-checker. (He added that copy editors do often catch mistakes.) Reporters, both at The Times and elsewhere, are expected to check their own work. Stories already go through “two very distinct, strong layers of editing,” said Thom Shanker, the assistant Washington editor. “In this environment, where everything we do is being scrutinized so carefully,” Mr. Shanker said, the addition of a fact-checker constituted “one more layer of safety for us.” Meaning that the better Ms. Cochrane does her job, the less likely readers are to notice her work. She doesn’t seem to mind. “To have the opportunity to be one set of many eyes who get to make sure that we are fair and accurate and factually correct,” she said, “that is a privilege.” Fact-check reporter Linda Qiu, also in the Washington bureau, has a very different role. Ms. Qiu came to The Times in February from The Tampa Bay Times’s fact-checking operation, PolitiFact, which rates the accuracy of claims on a scale from “true” to “pants on fire.” At The Times, her remit is much the same, the news cycle driving in large part which public figures’ statements come in for a closer look. Sometimes the claims are flatly true, and sometimes they are baldly not, as when President Trump said that the tax plan then working its way through Congress wouldn’t benefit him personally.

"JERUSALEM — If President Trump’s goal with a pair of tweets threatening to cut their funding was to compel Palestinians, one way or another, to return to peace negotiations, they appear to have had the opposite effect — and left many Israelis confused and worried as well. “We pay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter while most of the Middle East was sleeping on Wednesday. “With the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace,” he added, “why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?” Mr. Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital last month, upending decades of American policy that had long avoided prejudging future negotiations over the city and prompting the Palestinians to declare that the administration no longer had a role to play in the peace talks. The tweets, on a day Mr. Trump also took jabs at Iran, North Korea and Pakistan, echoed remarks made hours earlier by Nikki R. Haley, his ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Haley threatened that the United States would stop providing financial support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which assists Palestinian refugees throughout the region, unless the Palestinians returned to the negotiating table. As the largest donor to the relief agency, the United States provided more than $355 million in support for its 2016 operations, including $95 million for a West Bank and Gaza emergency appeal. Washington also provided about $290 million last year to the Palestinians through the United States Agency for International Development and has provided about $5.2 billion in total since 1994. “We will not be blackmailed,” Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, said in a statement on Wednesday. “President Trump has sabotaged our search for peace, freedom and justice. Now he dares to blame the Palestinians for the consequences of his own irresponsible actions!” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/middleeast/trump-israel-palestinians-twitter.html?searchResultPosition=84

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The reason for the plummeting of crime over the past three decades remains mostly a mystery. The national murder rate, for example, is about half what it was in 1990, and most of the theories explaining the decline are somewhere between incomplete and unpersuasive. One of those theories has long been known as “broken windows” — the idea that by cracking down on minor forms of disorder, the police prevent worse behavior. Over the last several years, New York City has conducted a natural experiment on a central tactic of the broken-windows strategy: stop-and-frisk. In 2011, New York’s police department conducted more than 685,000 stop-and-frisks — or nearly 2,000 a day — of people whom officers deemed suspicious. But the combination of a court order and the election of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned against the practice in 2013, have largely ended it. During that 2013 campaign, the writer Kyle Smith — making an argument that was then widespread among conservatives — blasted de Blasio and the voters supporting him. “New Yorkers have evidently decided that the crime wave is over and it’s time to get lax about mayhem and disorder,” Smith wrote for Forbes. As you probably know by now, I’m a fan of journalistic self-criticism, and Smith has engaged in some of it this week. His piece for National Review is called simply, “We Were Wrong About Stop-and-Frisk.” He notes that crime has continued to decline under de Blasio. “To compare today’s crime rate to even that of ten years ago is to observe a breathtaking decline,” Smith adds.

"Three former homeland security secretaries warned congressional leaders and officials of both parties on Wednesday that the window for legislative action to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children will close by the middle of January, months before a period outlined by the White House. The letter — signed by Jeh Johnson and Janet Napolitano, homeland security secretaries under President Barack Obama, and Michael Chertoff, a homeland security secretary under President George W. Bush — was sent as congressional leaders and aides to President Trump prepare for a meeting on Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is expected to be discussed. In September, Mr. Trump ordered an end to the program, which shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, and gave Congress six months to extend those protections, granted by Mr. Obama under an executive action in 2012. The policy permits beneficiaries of the program, known as Dreamers, to remain in the country without fear of immediate removal and gives them the right to work legally. “We write not only in strong support of this legislation, but to stress that it should be enacted speedily, in order to meet the significant administrative requirements of implementation, as well as the need to provide certainty for employers and these young people,” the letter said. “For these reasons, the realistic deadline for successfully establishing a Dreamers program in time to prevent large-scale loss of work authorization and deportation protection is only weeks away, in the middle of January.” They went on to warn that they knew of the number of changes that must be enforced to allow applications by Dreamers who would apply to stay in the United States.

Mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn into office for his second term on Monday, and today, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will deliver the annual State of the State address in Albany. The stakes are higher this year for the governor, a Democrat in his second term — he’s up for re-election in November and may have presidential ambitions for 2020. Though Mr. Cuomo has been lauded for progressive victories — like tuition-free college, the legalization of same-sex marriage, a higher minimum wage and paid family leave — he has also faced troubles in office. He has been blamed (and blamed some more) for New York City’s transit crisis. He has also been criticized for his response to sexual harassment allegations against one former senior aide, and for his ties to another aide who will go on trial this month to face corruption charges. In his speech this afternoon, Mr. Cuomo will lay out his vision for the state. A few of the plans he is expected to put forward: On Safety His gun-control proposal would take firearms out of the hands of New Yorkers who commit domestic violence crimes. One criminal justice proposal would outlaw “sextortion” and revenge porn, and another would address workplace sexual harassment.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday released a statement in response to comments that Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, made to Michael Wolff for his book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. In the book, Mr. Bannon said that a meeting between members of the Trump team and a lawyer with Russian connections had been “treasonous.” An excerpt from the book was published by New York Magazine. The following statement was released from the White House, through the pool report. ____ From press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Statement from the President of the United States Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party. Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn’t represent my base—he’s only in it for himself. Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books. We have many great Republican members of Congress and candidates who are very supportive of the Make America Great Again agenda. Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down.

"From the surging value of cryptocurrencies to the continuing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, developments in 2017 were hard to forecast. Who could have predicted that an article in The New York Times in October describing sexual misconduct by the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein would unleash a torrent of claims about media stars, members of Congress and the judiciary and even an N.F.L. owner? With a little trepidation, here are my thoughts on a few topics that should continue to be of interest in 2018: For those of us who remember the dot.com boom, there is a sense of déjà vu with the frenzy over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has shot up to well over $10,000 in 2017 from about $1,000, according to Coindesk. Cryptocurrencies may be all the rage, but the Securities and Exchange Commission is focusing on initial coin offerings as a potential avenue for fraud. These I.C.O.s allow companies to raise money by creating their own private digital currency through a form of online crowdfunding, with some offerings raising millions of dollars in just a few days. A company raising money from the public by selling something whose value depends on the success of its venture sounds like a security. That is why the S.E.C. has ramped up its scrutiny of I.C.O.s to determine whether issuers are skirting the detailed — and expensive — disclosure requirements for dealing with investors. If anyone is going to rain on the I.C.O. parade, it will be the S.E.C. On Dec. 1, the agency filed an emergency action in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn to stop an offering of PlexCoin, which the complaint said raised more than $15 million by promoting a return of more than 1,000 percent in a month. The S.E.C. has also filed actions for fraud involving other I.C.O.s. We should expect it to continue to crack down on companies using digital currencies to raise money without following the requirements for selling securities. On Dec. 11, the S.E.C. chairman, Jay Clayton, issued a statement warning investors and investment professionals about the potential problems posed by I.C.O.s if they operate as unregistered securities. He pointed out that “there is substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.” How the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the presidential election will be resolved is anyone’s guess. In many white-collar criminal investigations, where prosecutors start is not always where they end.

"The big corporate tax break that became law last month is great news for companies and their investors. But what about employees? How much of the corporate tax windfall will go to workers via higher wages? Since President Trump signed the $1.5 trillion tax cut into law on Dec. 22, nearly 20 large companies have announced some form of bonus or wage hike for their employees. Will they make a difference? Or are they merely publicity stunts? “This is not a P.R. stunt,” said Teresa Tanner, who oversees marketing and human resources at Fifth Third Bank, a regional lender in the Midwest that is raising its minimum wage and giving some employees a $1,000 bonus. “The tax cut will be an ongoing benefit for us and we wanted to share this with our employees. It is the right thing to do.” Many of the large companies that have announced fatter future paychecks are also subject to close regulatory scrutiny. Among them: AT&T, which was one of the first companies to publicly announce plans to reward employees with a one-time bonus. The company is also wrestling with Mr. Trump’s Justice Department, which has blocked its planned merger with Time Warner. For most large companies, experts believe that the proceeds of the big tax cut will largely go toward paying for companies to repurchase their own shares, a tactic that tends to boost stock prices. The new law will drop the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and usher in other big side benefits. Economists and analysts expect much less of the tax winnings to go to permanent pay increases for employees, who, as a whole, have endured stagnant wages over the past decade. That’s especially true for larger companies. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/corporate-tax-cut-bonuses-employees.html?searchResultPosition=60

"BERLIN — It has been almost a year since Donald Trump took office, and Germany is still debating what, exactly, his administration means for Europe. Is Mr. Trump just a hiccup in the American political system or an indicator of a chronic disease? Will the trans-Atlantic relationship ever be the same again or is it time Germany and Europe prepared for a post-Atlantic era? But rather than providing insight into the future of the United States, the debate is turning into a Freudian analysis of Germany’s own troubles. It started in May, when Chancellor Angela Merkel, shocked by Mr. Trump’s first visit to Europe as president, said that “the times we can fully rely on others are somewhat over” and that Europe had to become more self-reliant. Since then, two factions have formed: those who believe Germany can wait out Mr. Trump and then return to normal and those who call for a strategic shift because they think the days of American leadership are over. The first faction is represented by a group of foreign policy experts who published a “Trans-Atlantic Manifesto,” which appeared in October in The New York Times and the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit. They argue that guarding the trans-Atlantic relationship is crucial to the liberal world order and that a firm trans-Atlantic commitment gives Germany the liberty to act as a leader in Europe without stirring old fears of German predominance. They find supporters in conservative policymakers such as Norbert Röttgen, the head of the Bundestag’s external affairs committee. He, too, stresses that mutual values, not just mutual interests, constitute the trans-Atlantic relationship. The other side is represented by Germany’s acting foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat. In a speech at a foreign policy forum in Berlin in December, he stated flatly that “the relations between the U.S.A. and Europe won’t be the same anymore — even when Donald Trump leaves the White House.” He called for Germany to reconceive its strategic posture and to plan for a new era when it could no longer rely on American leadership. Niels Annen, a leading Social Democrat and a member of the Bundestag, agrees. He cites the president’s isolationist core constituency, the destruction of America’s political culture and the cuts to the State Department as long-term threats to American power. He also believes that the recently passed tax cuts will further erode American society from within, knocking down a middle class that was long a bulwark for America’s activist foreign policy. “We should not write off the United States, of course,” he said. “On the contrary, we have to increase our efforts to work with policymakers in Washington and in the federal states. But we have to be realistic as to what to expect.” It’s a strange debate, in that it is both hypothetical and emotional. It is hypothetical, because economically, Germany and the United States remain close business partners, despite the failure to establish a trans-Atlantic trade deal and the shifting orientation of both economies toward China.

"HONG KONG — President Trump’s tweet Tuesday taunting the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un over the relative strength of the two nations’ nuclear arsenals set off a torrent of concern on Twitter — and a few jokes about masculine preoccupation with size. Noting that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had claimed that a “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times,” Mr. Trump tweeted that he had his own such button, one that was “much bigger & more powerful.” The response online was generally one of concern that a subject so stark and potentially catastrophic as nuclear weapons was being blithely discussed on social media by a man who has the power to use them. Some commentators said Mr. Trump’s tweets Tuesday, which included an announcement that he would name winners of “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR” next week and a declaration that he was responsible for a record year in global airline safety, were signs something was wrong with the president. Amid the tweets expressing fear and worry, some people questioned the level of discourse. Many of those tweets weren’t printable in a family newspaper, and here’s one that hinted at why. The president’s tweet produced several condemnations of Twitter, from those arguing that the service was not only a distraction but also left them worried about their own annihilation. Some people said the tweet should qualify as a violation of Twitter’s policy prohibiting threats of violence. After the CNN host and correspondent Brian Stelter raised the question of whether Mr. Trump had violated Twitter’s terms of service, Dan Scavino Jr., the White House director of social media, accused him of urging that Twitter take action against the president’s account. Mr. Stelter replied that he had contacted Twitter but that it had no immediate comment. Some of the president’s supporters wrote that Mr. Kim, as a dictator responsible for global instability and widespread suffering of his own people, deserved to be insulted, not coddled. Others noted that the “button” that Mr. Trump tweeted about was not actually a button, but a briefcase referred to as “the football.” But there were suggestions that perhaps a button could be introduced.

"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea reopened a border hotline with South Korea on Wednesday, restoring a channel of direct dialogue and signaling a possible thaw in relations between the two Koreas after years of hair-trigger tensions. The return of the telephone hotline at the village of Panmunjom, which straddles the Demilitarized Zone, the world’s most heavily guarded border, came two days after North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, made a rare overture to the South. In his New Year’s Day speech, Mr. Kim continued his nuclear threat against Washington, saying he had a “nuclear button” ready to launch a weapon against any target in the United States. But he also proposed negotiations with South Korea to discuss easing military tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula and his country’s possible participation in the Winter Olympics, which are being held in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang next month. The fast-moving political developments have given new hope for a warming of ties between the two longstanding enemies.

"TEHRAN — When they stepped through the gates of Tehran University last week, the student protesters had every expectation of igniting an impassioned rally against the government. After all, the university grounds had long been a flash point for demonstrations in the capital. But this time, their exhortations went unheeded. “Proud Iranians, support us,” they shouted, only to find pedestrians walking by, looking to see what the commotion was about but declining to join the protesters. The protests that broke out a week ago in other parts of Iran — but never gained traction in the capital — have shown some signs of abating, though demonstrators are still taking to the streets after dark in many outlying provinces. Elite forces with the Revolutionary Guards Corps were deployed to three of them on Wednesday — Hamadan, Isfahan and Lorestan — to help quell uprisings there. The government took another step on Wednesday to tamp down the uprising, staging pro-government rallies throughout the country and affording them generous coverage on state-controlled media. But little of the action, either for or against the government, has found its way to the capital. That stands in sharp contrast to 2009, when millions of middle-class people in Tehran erupted in anger over an election they saw as rigged, churning into the streets for months of anti-government protests that came to be called the Green Movement. But this time, as protests over the poor economy erupted in more than 80 cities over the past week and evolved into a condemnation of the political system and its clerical rulers, Tehran remained curiously muted. There have been some gatherings, but relatively few and drawing only a few hundred at a time, a lack of interest that has confounded many residents. About 500 people have been arrested in Tehran, a figure that pales in comparison to 2009. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html?searchResultPosition=101
"To the Editor: As the translator and editor of the recent publication “Growing Up With the Impressionists: The Diary of Julie Manet,” I am bemused, to say the least, by your review by Nancy Kline (Dec. 10), which was published online under the headline “Great Art, Repugnant Politics.” Julie’s diary, which she wrote between the ages of 14 and 20, is a seminal text on the period. My new translation, with an introduction and over 400 footnotes, gives a personal view of the last years of the 19th century through the eyes of Berthe Morisot’s daughter. The Dreyfus Affair material is essential for many reasons, the least being to gauge how politically ambiguous Julie Manet’s circle was at that time. We also see how impressionable young people could be (as they still are!) regarding their parents’ or mentors’ views and we are able to observe how the affair seeped into the fabric of everyday life during these troubled years.

"Your book “The Future Is History” traces the lives of intellectuals following the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Vladimir Putin. What do you make of the political climate in the United States, which feels particularly hostile to intellectuals and experts right now? The basic idea of the book — that a people robbed of the tools of self-understanding find themselves at a dead end — actually has relevance to this country. Not that I think Americans are at a dead end, but we should be cognizant of that danger. So I can imagine you weren’t enamored of the term “alternative facts.” I get really nervous when impossible phrases are created. In academic circles, the idea of fixed facts has been problematized for a long time, so that in itself doesn’t disturb me. The postmodern project was to get a better understanding of facts by questioning whether we can have them. Now we’re confronted with a nihilistic project of just saying there’s no such thing as facts. Based on what you know about the Russian government, do you believe there’s going to be evidence of collusion between this president and the Russian government? I have doubts that the investigation will be able to produce definitive evidence of sustained coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. It’s a lot of wheeling and dealing, a lot of freelancers and subcontractors — it’s really mostly people trying to make money. There’s no strategy. Will they be able to show that the government funding was for hacking the Democratic National Committee? I don’t think so. I don’t think that Donald Trump is capable of holding a thought for more than three seconds, so how can we possibly imagine that he actually had some sort of sustained relationship that had an articulated strategy behind it?

Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017
By Ian Black
Illustrated. 606 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $30. Do we need another history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Most Americans, even those who care about the subject, would probably say no. For one thing, most Americans already know what they think. Israel/Palestine is the foreign policy equivalent of abortion. The debate is vicious but predictable, and in the American political mainstream its contours haven’t changed much in a quarter-century. In the Trump era, moreover, Americans don’t care as much. Conservatives pay less attention to the security of Israel’s borders and more to the security of America’s. Liberals are too worried about the survival of democracy in the United States to focus on its survival in the Jewish state. Given these realities, even an Israel/Palestine book with a mind-bending thesis would struggle to command attention. And Ian Black’s new history of the conflict, “Enemies and Neighbors: Arabs and Jews in Palestine and Israel, 1917-2017,” isn’t mind-bending. Its central theme is that Zionism and Palestinian nationalism were irreconcilable from the start, but that ordinary Jews and Palestinians have interacted in creative ways nonetheless. If you find that argument plausible, it’s most likely because you’ve heard it before. But if “Enemies and Neighbors” breaks no conceptual ground, it has other merits. It’s a good read. Black, a longtime correspondent and editor for The Guardian of London, has a gift for summary. He synopsizes events in sharp, fast paragraphs filled with vivid detail. And by largely avoiding the international politics of the conflict, he keeps a tight focus on events on the ground. In describing the communal violence that broke out in 1929, for instance, he notes that Arabs from the village of Qaluniya attacked their Jewish neighbors in Motza, killing every member of the Maklef family except 9-year-old Mordechai. He survived by jumping out a window and went on to become the Israeli Defense Forces’ second chief of staff. Black also shows how certain dynamics recurred again and again across the decades. He notices that from the early days of Zionist immigration, Jews relied on Palestinian labor to help build the state that Palestinians opposed. In 1889, he notes, Zichron Yaakov, an early agricultural settlement comprising 200 Jews, employed 1,200 Arab laborers. Almost a century later, after Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six Day War, an Israeli sociologist noted that “at night the campus” of Tel Aviv University “is like a big dormitory for Palestinian workers.” In the 1990s, after Benjamin Netanyahu’s government responded to Palestinian terrorism by restricting movement from the occupied territories into Israel proper, a Palestinian complained that “most of the people in our village want to be connected to Israel [and to] have the opportunity to work in Israel.” Zionism’s need for Palestinian labor, and the willingness of many Palestinians to provide it, fits comfortably into neither the Zionist nor Palestinian nationalist narrative. But Black weaves it into his. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/books/review/ian-black-enemies-and-neighbors.html?searchResultPosition=98

"“The Post” tells of the tense days leading up to The Washington Post’s decision in 1971 to publish the Pentagon Papers, the government’s secret history of the Vietnam War. The New York Times had broken the story but was prohibited from running the full series after the Nixon administration won a court injunction. That’s when The Post took up the story. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film stars Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham, The Post’s publisher, who came into her own by defying President Richard M. Nixon’s order, and Tom Hanks as the legendary editor Ben Bradlee. It is also the first time these three Hollywood icons have all worked together. I spoke with Mr. Hanks and Ms. Streep about the film’s uncanny parallels with today, their thoughts on the Weinstein moment, and what it’s like following in the footsteps of what is arguably the best newspaper movie ever, “All the President’s Men,” starring Jason Robards as Bradlee. Our meeting took place before Ms. Streep was nominated for an Oscar for her turn in the movie, which also picked up a best-picture nod. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Did either of you go in thinking, “Well, the definitive Washington Post movie was made. Are we up against that?” STREEP I didn’t think the definitive Washington Post movie was made. It was a great movie, but it neglected to mention Katharine Graham, and her central position. She was glancingly there. HANKS There was a reference to her.

"BALTIMORE — A veteran cybersecurity specialist for the National Security Agency and other intelligence organizations, accused of taking thousands of secret documents home over two decades, has decided to plead guilty later this month to a single charge that could carry a 10-year sentence. But under the terms laid out by prosecutors, the intelligence contractor, Harold T. Martin III, would have no guarantee that the government will drop 19 additional felony charges. Mr. Martin appears to be making an unusual gamble that his penitence and cooperation will eventually persuade prosecutors to dismiss the rest of the indictment. According to court filings on Wednesday, Mr. Martin is expected to plead guilty on Jan. 22 before Judge Marvin J. Garbis of United States District Court to one count of willful retention of national defense information in connection with his taking home a single classified N.S.A. document. But charges involving 12 other N.S.A. documents, five from the military’s Cyber Command, and one each from the C.I.A. and the National Reconnaissance Office, would remain in place. A detailed letter filed by prosecutors in federal court marks a step toward resolution of a highly embarrassing case that exposed gaping holes in the government’s system for safeguarding secrets. Mr. Martin, 52, described by his own lawyers as a compulsive hoarder, took home highly classified documents from the N.S.A. and other agencies beginning in the late 1990s, stashing them on paper, hard drives and flash drives in his house in Glen Burnie, Md.; a shed in his yard; and his car. His serial theft, totaling a staggering 50 terabytes of data, went undetected until his arrest on Aug. 27, 2016. Mr. Martin had worked for the N.S.A.’s hacking unit, then known as Tailored Access Operations, and the material he took included most or all of the agency hacking tools that ended up being offered for sale on the internet by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers.

"BRUSSELS — It was Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States. The pianist Igor Levit strode onto the stage at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, an Art Deco gem here known as Bozar, to play Beethoven. But first, he had something to say. Declaring that “the time of staying in my comfort zone is over,” Mr. Levit, 30, did something that would not be in the least unusual at many kinds of concerts, but is still quite rare in classical music: He spoke directly to his audience, brought up the world outside the concert hall, and unhesitatingly took sides in a political controversy. “Yesterday, the greatest economic power in the world has freely elected a bigot, an opportunist, an angry and dangerous man as their new president, as their commander in chief,” Mr. Levit said, going on to denounce Brexit and the rise of the far right in France and Germany. His speech caused a commotion, as audience members called out, both attacking and defending him. “I don’t think one should use the concert stage all the time for political statements,” he said recently. “But this day was a very traumatic day for me, and I think for all of us: The night before, Donald Trump was elected president. I’d had a concert in London, I took a train to Brussels, I couldn’t sleep all night. And I just wrote down this speech. I felt a certain urgency.” On Wednesday, Jan. 3, his potent mixture of powerful art and political candor was given a major boost: the $300,000 Gilmore Artist Award, one of the most prestigious, and unusual, prizes in classical music. Granted to a pianist every four years, it is not a competition, so contestants do not even know they are in the running. Instead, a small, anonymous jury travels incognito to concerts around the world, searching for an artist with the potential to make a mark on music.

"HONG KONG — President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, traded threats this week about the size, location and potency of their “nuclear buttons.” The image of a leader with a finger on a button — a trigger capable of launching a world-ending strike — has for decades symbolized the speed with which a nuclear weapon could be launched, and the unchecked power of the person doing the pushing. There is only one problem: There is no button. William Safire, the former New York Times columnist and presidential speechwriter, tracked the origin of the phrase “finger on the button” to panic buttons found in World War II-era bombers. A pilot could ring a bell to signal that other crew members should jump from the plane because it had been damaged extensively. But the buttons were often triggered prematurely or unnecessarily by jittery pilots. The expression is commonly used to mean “ready to launch an atomic war,” but the writer added in “Safire’s Political Dictionary” that it is also a “scare phrase used in attacking candidates” during presidential elections. President Lyndon B. Johnson told Barry M. Goldwater, his Republican opponent in 1964, that a leader must “do anything that is honorable to avoid pulling that trigger, mashing that button that will blow up the world.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/asia/nuclear-button-trump-north-korea.html?searchResultPosition=94
"It wasn’t until the end of his State of the State address that Gov. Andrew Cuomo mentioned President Trump by name. But the president was unmistakably in Mr. Cuomo’s sights on Wednesday nearly from the start of the 92-minute speech, which served as both a blueprint for his own re-election campaign this year and as a possible outline for 2020 should he seek the White House. First came the state’s 2018 realities, including how to make up for lost revenues — $2 billion worth, the governor said — from a federal government he called “the most hostile and aggressive toward New York in history.” But more than money was at stake. He suggested that the nation’s very soul was imperiled by this national administration. “It’s always pitting one group against the other,” he said. “It’s always conflict. It’s always either-or.” And in case there was conceivably anyone unclear about whom he meant, he praised New York’s diversity and evoked the Latin motto “e pluribus unum” — out of many, one — embedded in a flag “right behind President Trump’s desk.” “To find the way forward, the president only needs to turn around,” he said to loud applause as he wound up. “That, my friends, is the true formula for what makes America great.” As he seeks a third term, Mr. Cuomo cast himself as a political progressive, but one more pragmatic than some others in his Democratic Party. (Might he have been thinking of you, Mayor Bill de Blasio?) “Progressive leaders must be dreamers and doers, visionaries and achievers,” he said, adding that people “don’t need theoretical progressive politics — they need practical politics, actual politics that makes a difference in their lives.” Mr. Cuomo stuffed so many proposals into his speech that it veered toward dirigible size. He touched on issues from environmental protection to economic development, from antiterrorism policing to coping with the opioid crisis, from enhancing workers’ rights to restructuring the state’s tax code to offset the fiscal threat potentially created by the Republicans’ tax changes.

"President Trump began the new year with an apocalyptic Twitter outburst, taunting the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Meanwhile, like an adult trying to carry on an intelligent conversation while a child is having a tantrum, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has tried to resume direct engagement with Pyongyang, which was cut off nearly two years ago. It provided at least a dim glimmer of hope that the North Korean nuclear arms crisis can be resolved peacefully. It’s a move that requires patience and humility, qualities Mr. Trump generally lacks. The North Koreans have long made clear that they view South Korea as a lackey of their chief adversary, the United States. Yet since his inauguration in May, Mr. Moon has called for dialogue with the North, which severed all communications with Seoul in 2016 after Mr. Moon’s conservative predecessor shuttered an industrial complex in the North. Mr. Moon has been pressing Pyongyang for months to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics his nation is hosting next month. The proposal was effectively ignored until Mr. Kim used his annual New Year’s Day speech to signal he was “open to dialogue” with the South to discuss easing military tensions on the Korean Peninsula, as well as to sending North Korean athletes to join the Games. Mr. Moon quickly took advantage of the opening, proposing that high-level negotiators meet next Tuesday at the village of Panmunjom at the demilitarized zone on the border. On Wednesday, the North agreed to South Korea’s suggestions to reopen a hotline at the DMZ, restoring a communications channel that let the two sides talk directly if tensions rose. The need has never been clearer than now, as Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim trade threats and inflame regional tensions.

"So, to start the year, our president bragged that he has a “much bigger” nuclear button than the guy in North Korea. Coming next week: Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un compare finger length, shoe and head size. That last is complicated by the fact that they have what are two of the worst government-leader haircuts in history. Honestly, you’d think Kim had executed every barber in his country. If it wasn’t for the exploding-planet aspect of all this, it’d be sort of funny. We have here two very silly egomaniacs. Kim’s government claims that he learned to drive when he was 3 and that he makes breakthrough medical discoveries in the treatment of cancer in his spare time. Meanwhile on our side, Trump recently gave himself credit for ending commercial airplane fatalities. (“Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation.”) The White House — which spends its entire life explaining why the last crazy tweet wasn’t all that crazy — claimed this was due to the president’s “initiative to modernize air traffic control,” a proposal that was never passed into law. Also, the Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of air safety, is run by an Obama appointee. Also, there haven’t been any commercial passenger deaths in the United States since 2013. And Trump once had an airline of his own that had a crash landing three months into operation, piled up massive debt and eventually folded. We could go on and on. As many did on Twitter. (“We had no gas explosions in our house this year. Thank you, Mr. President for your hands-on leadership.…”) But O.K., moving forward. In North Korea, Kim celebrated the new year with an address to the people in which he assured them “that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday abruptly shut down a White House commission he had charged with investigating voter fraud, ending a brief quest for evidence of election theft that generated lawsuits, outrage and some scholarly testimony, but no real evidence that American elections are corrupt. On Thursday, Mr. Trump called for requiring voter identification in a pair of Twitter posts because the voting system “is rigged.” “Push hard for Voter Identification!” Mr. Trump wrote. Mr. Trump did not acknowledge the commission’s inability to find evidence of fraud, but cast the closing as a result of continuing legal challenges. “Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry,” Mr. Trump said in a White House statement on Wednesday. “Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action,” he said. In fact, no state has uncovered significant evidence to support the president’s claim, and election officials, including many Republicans, have strongly rejected it.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will soon face several major trade decisions that will determine whether the White House adopts the type of protectionist barriers that President Trump campaigned on but that were largely absent during his first year in office. So far, the president’s actions on trade have been more moderate than his campaign speeches suggested. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from a Pacific Rim trade pact and opened other, existing trade deals to renegotiations. But he has yet to impose any of the broad tariffs that he has argued are necessary to give American companies a fair shot in a global economy. In 2018, Mr. Trump will have several opportunities to punish foreign rivals as the final decider in a series of unusual trade cases that were initiated last year. These cases, which were brought under little-used provisions of trade laws, give the president broad authority to impose sweeping tariffs or quotas on foreign products. The United States has numerous other routine trade cases in the works — like Boeing’s fight with the Canadian plane maker Bombardier. But the ones heading to Mr. Trump’s desk are unique because they fall to the president alone, rather than career bureaucrats, to decide. “We’re approaching a moment of truth where decisions have to be made to impose tariffs or not,” said Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former trade negotiator. “The days of saying we’re going to have a study on this or carry out an investigation into that are over.”      Many American companies, particularly manufacturers, are cheering on the administration. They argue that they need the government’s assistance to stop foreign companies from flooding the market with cheap products.

"Some conservatives have been almost gleeful that the Republican tax overhaul will hurt people who live in high-cost states like California, New Jersey and New York. An economist who has advised President Trump called it “death to Democrats.” But their celebrations may have been premature. In their rush to enact tax cuts before the end of 2017, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress created a legislative monster riddled with flaws and loopholes that even they don’t fully understand. They have offered up a bonanza to tax lawyers and accountants looking for provisions that can be exploited to lower taxes for clients. Add to that list state officials like Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Kevin de León, president pro tem of the California Senate, who say they are working to negate the damage from a part of the tax law that limits the deduction for state and local taxes to $10,000 a year. To put that number into context, the average deduction in California, New Jersey and New York was more than $17,000 in 2015, according to the Government Finance Officers Association. More than a third of taxpayers in those states claimed the deduction. There are three approaches state officials could use to undercut the tax law. First, they could encourage families to donate money to the state government by offering them a credit for those gifts against state income taxes. The idea would be to turn state taxes into charitable donations that are deductible against the federal income tax. This might sound like a gimmick that the Internal Revenue Service could easily shut down. But David Kamin, a law professor at New York University, says there is precedent supporting such a policy. For example, some states offer tax credits to people who donate money to private schools, and these donations also qualify for the federal charity deduction. Under the second approach, which is advocated by the economist Dean Baker, state governments would replace their income taxes with payroll taxes paid by employers. Those kinds of taxes — like the one for unemployment insurance coverage — are deductible for businesses under the Republican tax law. That switch would mean that employers could pay their workers less, but take-home pay would stay the same because employees wouldn’t be on the hook for paying state income taxes.

"There will be no white smoke from a chapel chimney. There will be no church convention, no lobbying and no election. Mormons don’t do succession drama. When the head of their church dies, as Thomas S. Monson did on Tuesday, the next leader is chosen from the top ranks based strictly on seniority. The system is intended to avoid any hint of instability or intrigue, but it practically guarantees that the president will be elderly — even very elderly. President Monson was 90, and had served as prophet and head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for nearly 10 years. Following a tradition that dates from the church’s early years, he is to be succeeded by the longest-serving member of a church governing body known as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Right now, that man is President Russell M. Nelson, a former heart surgeon, who is 93. Next in line after him is Dallin H. Oaks, a former president of Brigham Young University and state Supreme Court justice. He is 85. You have to pass four more people in the line of succession before you get to someone born after World War II. “It seems very predictable and regular, and there’s a certain comfort that comes from that level of stability,” said Brian Q. Cannon, past president of the Mormon History Association and director of the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies at Brigham Young University, the Mormon church’s flagship college. President Nelson is unlikely to deviate much from President Monson’s conservative course, Professor Cannon said. The two men are of the same generation, molded in the same culture. But President Nelson’s priorities in office may be somewhat different, given his background in medicine, his experience training heart surgeons in China and his fluency in Mandarin.

"LONDON — Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has blamed unnamed foreign “enemies” for the antigovernment protests that have swept his country for the past week, putting the demonstrators at risk of being accused of espionage or treason. The accusation resonates for many Iranians, whose country has long been subject to foreign interference, from the American- and British-led coup in the 1950s to more recent efforts by the United States and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. President Trump’s public support for the protesters has only reinforced suspicions of a foreign hand at work. While there has been no evidence that foreign governments orchestrated the protests, several countries are now trying to decide how to support a goal they share with many of the demonstrators: a less corrupt, more democratic and more open Iranian government. The State Department urged Iran on Tuesday not to restrict access to social media services like Instagram and messaging platforms like Telegram, which the protesters have used to spread word of anti-government gatherings. It even encouraged Iranians to use virtual private networks to sidestep government censorship, advice Iranians see as interference. Diplomats and analysts said discussions were underway in the capitals of Britain, Israel and other countries on whether or how to support the demonstrators. American intelligence officials and Iran watchers say the protests appear to have started organically.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has named interim United States attorneys in Brooklyn and Manhattan, two of the country’s most prominent federal prosecutors’ offices, replacing lawyers who had served as top deputies to Obama appointees. On Friday, Geoffrey S. Berman, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, will take over the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York from Joon H. Kim, who assumed control of the office in March after the longtime United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, was fired by President Trump. Richard P. Donoghue, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, will replace Bridget M. Rohde in the top job in the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York. Craig Carpenito, who once worked as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, will serve as the interim United States attorney for New Jersey, according to the Justice Department, which on Wednesday announced a total of 17 United States attorney appointments, including in Minnesota, Rhode Island and Central Florida. Typically, the White House acts in the first months of an administration to fill many of the country’s 93 United States attorney’s offices. But President Trump has waited so long in making his choices for several districts, including those based in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Newark, that their acting leaders were running against a legal limit of 300 days in office. Even though Mr. Berman and Mr. Donoghue were appointed by Mr. Sessions under special executive authority, they were widely considered to be President Trump’s top choices. They will serve in their interim roles for either 120 days or until they are formally nominated. Until recently, Mr. Berman, 58, was a comanaging shareholder of the New Jersey office of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which has a tradition of hiring Republican luminaries like Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York.

"Happy new year to you and yours, of course, but I’m going to have to put a halt to the festivities and play Frowning Farhad for a minute: You’re fooling yourself if you think 2018 is going to be any different, sanity- or anxiety-wise, from the roller coaster of the year just concluded. Sure, as in any year, a lot of good things could happen in 2018, and perhaps lots of bad things will happen, too. (How’s that for a prediction?) But there is a deeper and more unsettling certainty about the ride upon which we’ve all just embarked: A lot of probably very crazy things will happen in 2018. Get ready for even more events that don’t follow the rational course, and narratives that appear unmoored from the laws of politics, business and science. The background sensation of uncertainty that has pervaded much of the last two years isn’t going to abate. Just the opposite — my columnist’s Spidey sense tells me it’s only going to get worse. Strap in. Just a few years ago, there was a dawning sense that technology would give us a peek around the corner. Thanks to reams of information — sensors and surveillance everywhere, and computing capacity to make sense of it all — it looked as if we were entering a “Minority Report”-type world, where much of the future could be foretold in our numbers. Google could predict flu trends, election-stats nerds could predict political outcomes, and predictive policing algorithms were going to give us a handle on crime. Yet what has happened is rather quite different. Instead of revealing unseen order and predictability in the world, technology has unleashed a cascade of forces that have made the world more volatile — and thus made the future hazier and more open to out-of-the-blue results. Some of this isn’t news. In 2016 and 2017, the world began to appreciate how smartphones and social networks can upend what we once considered the natural order. Tech has helped undercut the power of incumbent institutions — governments, political parties, the media, the patriarchy — and it has created a new class of geopolitical actors whose presence and ricocheting power we’re all still getting used to: trolls, terrorists, conspiracy theorists, social-media activists, hackers and cyptocurrency bugs, among others.

"President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, have sharply escalated their nuclear saber rattling in recent days. Mr. Kim’s mention in his annual New Year’s Day speech of a “nuclear button” on his desk prompted Mr. Trump to respond Tuesday on Twitter: “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” In addition to his predictable bombast, Mr. Kim unexpectedly proposed opening bilateral negotiations between his country and South Korea. The offer was immediately accepted by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, whose administration fears that the North might disrupt the upcoming Winter Olympics in the South. As a confidence-building measure, Pyongyang reactivated a hotline with Seoul that had been dormant for nearly two years. While the Moon administration is open to dialogue with the North, Mr. Trump has yet to show a clear willingness to embrace diplomacy as a means to break the impasse over Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Mr. Kim’s offer presents an opportunity for Washington and its longtime ally South Korea to unite behind a strategy to freeze the North’s nuclear program at its current level and prevent a bad situation from getting worse. The diplomatic track has been blocked by Washington’s insistence that North Korea commit to denuclearization as a precondition to talks. But the Trump administration needs to accept that North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons as long as the Kim regime is in power. After an American-led coalition took down the Qaddafi regime in 2011, North Korea declared that Libya had been “tricked into disarmament.” The North Korean leadership’s paramount interest is survival, and all of its actions should be seen through this prism. For their part, South Koreans have historically had two fears — being abandoned by the United States or unwillingly drawn into a war with North Korea by the United States. Yet even with the increased tempo of North Korean nuclear and missile testing, as well as the escalating rhetoric between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, South Koreans are sanguine about the possibility of war.

And his willingness to re-enter public service at a time when other Trump-skeptical Republicans are running for the exits (and when he could be enjoying a very comfortable retirement with his 1,765 grandchildren) shows an old-fashioned spiritedness that his party’s hollow men conspicuously lack. But now, some criticism. For all that he is upright and decent and loves his country, Romney was also part of #HowYouGotTrump, and what he might have to offer today depends to some extent on whether he realizes it, and whether he’s learned anything from his presidential defeat and the weirdness that’s engulfed his party since. Romney’s direct role in Trump’s ascent was modest but telling. He didn’t just accept the Trump imprimatur in his campaign against Barack Obama; he flew to Las Vegas to have the endorsement bestowed upon him, issued some flattering words about his endorser’s awesome business acumen and essentially averted his eyes from the conspiracy theories about President Obama’s origins that Trump was then enthusiastically peddling. Like most prominent Republicans at the time, Romney no doubt assumed that the fever swamp stuff didn’t need to be attacked, that it would evaporate once the G.O.P. won back the White House. But instead the fever swamp stuff helped hand the G.O.P. to Trump himself, and the birther’s grip-and-grin with an uncomfortable Romney was a small but notable milestone on that path.

"SAN JOSE, Calif. — Top officials with the United States figure skating association said on Wednesday that they would welcome North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics next month in South Korea, setting up a potential conflict with the White House. “We’re hoping they’re there,” David Raith, executive director of U.S. Figure Skating, said of North Korea, which has qualified a pairs skating team for the Games and whose leader, Kim Jong-un, has signaled interest in participating. “It would be the safest place in the world.” The Trump administration has been more equivocal. Asked at a news briefing on Tuesday whether the United States supported participation by North Korean athletes in the 2018 Olympics, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, “We haven’t made a final determination on that front.” Samuel Auxier, the president of U.S. Figure Skating, speaking here at the United States championships, which will determine the Olympic team, also raised the prospect that skaters might defy a call for a boycott of the Games if one came from President Trump. The president has not said anything publicly about a potential boycott. And after some ambiguous remarks last month by Nikki Haley, the American envoy to the United Nations, she tweeted that “the U.S. looks forward to participating in the Winter Olympics,” which begin Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula. The possibility of a boycott surfaced again on Monday when Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, wrote on Twitter that the United States should avoid the Games if North Korea participates.

"ALBANY — With a re-election campaign and potentially treacherous political terrain ahead, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo laid out his 2018 agenda on Wednesday, painting a portrait of a state battling the effects of terrorism, sexual harassment and opioid addiction, and under siege from the Trump administration. In his 90-minute State of the State speech, Mr. Cuomo said the state would challenge the new Republican-led federal tax plan in court — earning a standing ovation from the crowd — and asked the Legislature to restructure the state’s tax code by adding a statewide payroll tax and to counter the effects of the so-called carried interest loophole. The governor’s office suggested that it was reviewing eliminating the state income tax, whose deductibility was capped by the new federal tax bill, likely in favor of a payroll tax, which is deductible, an idea also being floated in other states. Precise details on the plan were scant, and such a plan would face an uphill battle, with Republicans generally opposing new taxes and some conservative economists already voicing concerns on Wednesday. The proposal to constrain the carried interest loophole — which allows a private equity partner or hedge fund manager to enjoy a lower tax rate on an investment’s profits — would call for creating a compact with neighboring states that would impose a new tax on those taking advantage of the loophole. Still, with New York facing billions of dollars in budget gaps, and swaths of suburban voters possibly looking at tax increases as a result of the new cap on income and property tax deductibility, the initial reaction in Albany suggested the idea had a puncher’s chance, including among some State Senate Republicans representing moderate districts. And Mr. Cuomo, whose angry rhetoric leading up to the passage of the federal tax bill had bordered on the extreme, seemed to be banking that he could unite New Yorkers on both sides of the aisle to fight against Washington.

"WASHINGTON — While the two Koreas were gingerly reopening a border hotline, President Trump was gleefully taunting Kim Jong-un about the relative size of their nuclear launch buttons. That, in a nutshell, captured the challenge facing the Trump administration as South Korea embarked on fragile new talks with North Korea on Wednesday. The United States, the South’s key ally, views the overture with deep suspicion. For months, it has said that talks with North Korea would make no sense until its leader, Mr. Kim, at least curbs his provocative behavior, or at best agrees to relinquish his nuclear arsenal. Mr. Trump recently has talked about the potential for war, not a diplomatic breakthrough. Yet the president, so accustomed to being the center of attention, must now watch from the sidelines as these longstanding enemies open a dialogue. The talks at first are likely to focus on North Korea’s potential participation in the Winter Olympics, which are being held next month in the South Korean city of Pyeongchang. Trump administration officials said on Wednesday that they were not opposed to the idea of talks, provided that they be limited to the Olympics and that the South Koreans not make any concessions to the North that they, and the United States, would later regret. The White House plans to stay in close touch with South Korean officials to coordinate the messages going out and to review any offers coming in. Above all, the officials said, the Trump administration will resist efforts by the North to drive a wedge between the United States and its ally. North Korea, they said, has a long history of using such overtures to sow dissent between South Korea and the United States, particularly at times, like now, when the countries have governments with divergent politics.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Each winter, California officials trudge up the Sierra Nevada to measure the snowpack, with news cameras watching closely. Last year, there was a thick blanket of white. This year, the blanket had turned to a crunchy brown. “We would like to have had more snow,” said Grant Davis, the director of the Department of Water Resources, after officials put the official measurement of “snow water” at 0.4 inches. In some areas, the snowpack was as low as 3 percent of normal. Across the Sierra, snowpack is at 24 percent of the historical average. Roughly one-third of California’s water supply comes from runoff in the Sierra — snowpack measurements are critical to help plan how much water cities and agricultural areas will receive. Still, Mr. Davis said there was no cause for alarm. “It’s far too early to draw any conclusions about what kind of season we’ll have this year,” he said. Typically, half of the annual precipitation in the state comes in December, January and February.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Two quick thoughts on the Steve Bannon-President Trump feud: One, it’s a sign of the apparent seriousness of the Russia investigation for Trump’s family and inner circle. The insults got the attention, but the more significant part of Bannon’s remarks may be the “logical, cold-eyed recognition” that prosecutors are building a powerful case, notes Errol Louis at CNN. Two, the feud is a reminder that Bannon has failed to accomplish his biggest ambition: Expanding the Republican coalition to include many more middle-class and working-class voters. “Steve Bannon had a chance to be a genuinely significant figure in American politics and he blew it,” my colleague Ross Douthat wrote on Twitter. Democracy. Later this month, an alarmingly titled book, “How Democracies Die,” written by two political scientists, will be published. It is, as the book’s promotional material states, “a bracing, revelatory look at the demise of liberal democracies around the world — and a road map for rescuing our own.” That last part seems the most important. I remain optimistic that the Trump presidency will turn out to be a phase rather than a turning point in American history. But it would be foolish to dismiss the threats to our system of government. They’re greater than I ever expected to see. One recent example: In his interview with The Times last week, President Trump spoke admiringly of obviously autocratic tactics, such as using law enforcement as a raw exercise of power. “The president,” as Jonathan Chait points out, “explained his belief that the Department of Justice on principle ought to cover up crimes by the president and his administration.” Trump clearly believes that he deserves to be above the rule of law.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Between breaking into the email accounts of United States government officials, political dissidents and international human rights organizations, Iranian hackers liked to joke about their slow internet service, poor pay and lack of skilled colleagues. In conversations obtained by security researchers, the hackers groused like any other start-up employees, often frustrated by their lack of progress and inability to carry out more grandiose schemes. [Iranian hackers targeted the Trump re-election campaign.] But the work being discussed had global ramifications, and painted a picture of how Iranian hackers have matured over the last decade from defacing websites with crude photos and slogans. Now, they appear to be an organized work force, starting systematic cyberespionage campaigns aimed at promoting Iran’s interests around the world and on curbing dissent within the Islamic Republic. In a report published on Thursday by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Collin Anderson, an independent cybersecurity researcher, and Karim Sadjadpour, a Carnegie senior fellow, followed nearly a decade of the day-to-day activities of Iranian hackers. Their report on Iran’s improving capabilities arrives as anti-government protests in the country enter their second week, prompting the regime to shut down access to the internet under the claim that it is being used to spread “violence and fear” among protesters. Iran has long spied on the online activities of dissidents, but it has recently turned to cyberespionage campaigns aimed at the United States, according to recent reports by security firms. Those campaigns have left a trail of digital crumbs, allowing researchers to paint a vivid picture of whom Iranian hackers target — and when.

"SEOUL, South Korea — On both sides of the divided Korean Peninsula, the timing seems right. The New Year’s Day proposal by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for direct talks with South Korea came as sanctions appear to be biting, with reports of shortages in the North and new pressure by Washington to intercept ships engaged in fuel smuggling. The initiative was quickly embraced by South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who sees his first concrete chance to carry out his campaign agenda of engaging with the North, while also easing tensions as Mr. Trump’s warlike threats have rattled his country. In a telephone message delivered through the restored cross-border hotline on Friday, North Korea accepted the South’s proposal that the two sides begin talks on Tuesday, South Korean officials said. The talks, to be held in the border village Panmunjom, will be the first high-level inter-Korean dialogue in two years. But if this is a potential opening for a thaw, it is a small one. Skepticism abounds not only in Washington but also among South Koreans. Many in the country are mindful of how the so-called sunshine policy of two previous progressive leaders, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, failed to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, and remain wary of its revival. As Mr. Moon learned from his predecessors’ experiences, any South Korean leader accused of risking the alliance with Washington in trying to improve ties with the North could become a lightning rod of conservative ire. “If there are still those who think they can solve the North Korean nuclear problem and problems between the South and the North through dialogue, they must be crazy,” said Yoo Dong-ryul, a director of the right wing Korea Institute of Liberal Democracy, based in Seoul.

"On Tuesday, Donald Trump unleashed yet another tweet storm from within his unceasing drought of competence. In a series of 16 tweets, Trump lied, boasted, lashed out, bemoaned, provoked, belittled and prodded. In other words, Trump began this year the way he ended the last one: eroding and reducing the office of the presidency on a daily basis. His most consequential tweet was a boast about destructive power: “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Sir, this is not a missile-measuring contest. No one wants to think about the size of your button. You seem to think that the effects of a nuclear strike would be the verification of your virility rather than the loss of innumerable lives.

"Even though Doug Jones won a famous statewide victory in last month’s Alabama Senate race, he actually lost — less famously — to Roy Moore in six of the state’s seven congressional districts. That’s right: He carried only the heavily black Seventh Congressional District, into which the Alabama Legislature has jammed almost a third of the state’s African-American population while making sure that the rest of the districts remain safely white and Republican. That’s gerrymandering in the raw. Something equally raw, although less overtly racial, happened in Maryland back in 2011, when the overwhelmingly Democratic State Legislature decided that two Republicans out of Maryland’s eight-member congressional delegation was at least one Republican too many. The 2010 census required the state to shrink the majority-Republican Sixth District by 10,000 people in order to restore one-person, one-vote equality among the districts. Seeing its opportunity for some major new line-drawing, the Legislature conducted a population transfer. It moved 66,417 Republican voters out of the district while moving into it 24,460 Democratic voters from safely Democratic adjoining districts, a swing of more than 90,000 votes. And guess what? The 20-year Republican incumbent, Roscoe Bartlett, lost the 2012 election to the Democratic candidate, John Delaney, who has won re-election ever since. The best news to come out of the Supreme Court in months was its quiet announcement, late on a Friday afternoon in early December, that it was adding to its calendar a challenge to the Sixth District lines, brought by seven Republicans who formerly voted in the old district. This case, Benisek v. Lamone, has received much less attention than Gill v. Whitford, the case the justices heard in October that challenges a notorious Republican gerrymander of the Wisconsin State Assembly. But I predict that the Maryland case, which the court will hear in early spring, will prove to be the more important of the two. Based on my informal survey of friends and colleagues, the few who are aware of the Maryland case assume it to be a copycat case with little independent significance. But consider its odd trajectory to the court. Last Aug. 24, a special three-judge federal court voted 2 to 1 to reject the plaintiffs’ request for an order requiring new district lines to be in place for the 2018 midterm election. A week later, the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, along with a motion to expedite consideration of the case so that it could be heard in November, just weeks after the argument already scheduled in the Wisconsin case. When the justices denied that request, without comment, on Sept. 13, the natural assumption was that the court would simply keep the Maryland case on hold until it decided the Wisconsin case later in the term. So the court’s announcement that it would go ahead and hear the Maryland case after all was a surprise. What happened inside the black box that is the justices’ private weekly conference? One theory is that the justices were attracted by the bipartisan symmetry of hearing both cases, one brought by Democrats and the other by Republicans. After all, during the argument in the Wisconsin case, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. worried aloud that it would cause “very serious harm” to the Supreme Court’s “status and integrity” if people perceived the court as intervening in the gerrymander issue in order to favor one party over another. Perhaps, but a more interesting explanation lies in the doctrinal difference between the two cases. The theory of the Wisconsin case is that the Republican-engineered gerrymander violated the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. In the 2012 election, the first after the Wisconsin Legislature’s new Republican majority redrew the Assembly district lines, Republicans won only a minority of the statewide vote but captured 60 of the 99 seats; the new lines corralled Democratic voters into some districts and scattered them among others, where they were doomed to be ineffectual in electing their preferred candidates.

he small burgundy satchel bore the hallmarks of rugged craftsmanship: top-grain leather, double stitching on the straps. It was wider at the bottom, sort of like an inverted funnel, and two buckles secured the flap. Babak Behzadzadeh knew exactly how he might use the bag when he saw it hanging in a shop in Playa del Carmen, Mexico: It could be his bank. Behzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh’s small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations. One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna’s manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver’s north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants’ flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out. Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh’s office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse — Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh’s “murse,” for man purse — and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. “One day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,” Behzadzadeh reminisced. “I put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars.” When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. “So Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there’s a thousand dollars!” They laughed heartily. “If we had bank accounts,” Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, “it’d be much easier.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/magazine/where-pot-entrepreneurs-go-when-the-banks-just-say-no.html?searchResultPosition=42

"SAN JUAN COUNTY, Utah — In this county of desert and sagebrush, Wilfred Jones has spent a lifetime angered by what his people are missing. Running water, for one. Electricity, for another. But worst of all, in his view, is that the Navajo people here lack adequate political representation. So Mr. Jones sued, and in late December, after a federal judge ruled that San Juan County’s longtime practice of packing Navajo voters into one voting district violated the United States Constitution, the county was ordered to draw new district lines for local elections. The move could allow Navajo people to win two of three county commission seats for the first time, overturning more than a century of political domination by white residents. And the shift here is part of an escalating battle over Native American enfranchisement, one that comes amid a larger wave of voting rights movements spreading across the country. “It’s a historic moment for us,” said Mr. Jones, during a drive on the county’s roller coaster dirt roads. “We look at what happened with the Deep South,” he went on, “how they accomplished what they have. We can do the same thing.” The county is challenging the decision, arguing that the maps ordered by Judge Robert J. Shelby unconstitutionally consider race, and so discriminate against white voters. “In one of the poorest counties in the nation, the last thing we need is to be constantly sued by these predatory attorneys,” said Phil Lyman, a county commissioner. “Outside people try to put this into a racial divide that simply doesn’t exist in San Juan County.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/native-american-voting-rights.html?searchResultPosition=45
"MOSCOW — Presidential elections are normally a major affair. The competition may be more or less open, the candidates more or less exciting, the outcome more or less uncertain, but electing a head of state usually captures a nation’s attention. These days in Moscow, though, with glitzy “2018” signs illuminating the city center, you would be forgiven for thinking that the soccer World Cup, hosted by Russia, is the event to watch this year. Vladimir V. Putin is so used to presidential elections that he almost forgot to announce his candidacy for the next one. On Dec. 6, he finally confirmed that he would run for a fourth term on March 18 — incidentally, the fourth anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Since his approval ratings hover around 80 percent, that puts him on course to be in office until 2024. By then, he will have been in power for 24 years. No wonder he is running as an independent candidate this time: President Putin does not need a party to support him — he just needs to run as President Putin. His legitimacy stems from holding power since the day the millennium was born. Among pollsters, “apathy” is the word that best describes voter sentiment. Journalists noted that the president himself looked slightly bored during his annual news conference on Dec. 15, even though he kept it going for 3 hours 40 minutes. His first term was dedicated to restoring order in Russia’s post-Yeltsin chaos. The second term focused on the economy. During his third term, Mr. Putin made Russia great again — abroad. So far, mystery surrounds his next goal. No electoral slogans, no major campaign theme. If the candidate has a big idea for his fourth term, he is keeping it to himself. That makes the real question what will happen not on March 19 but in 2024. The idea of post-Putinism is emerging slowly as an object of political study. The Constitution does not allow a president to run for more than two consecutive terms, and Mr. Putin has already used the stratagem of switching with his prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, from 2008 to 2012. He is on record saying that he will not change the Constitution to stay indefinitely in power. Six years may seem like an eternity in politics. Not in Russia. While experts speculate on what kind of successor President Putin might groom or on which group might take over in the unavoidable infighting after he leaves, others see an opening in this “fin de règne.” An entire generation is looking forward to post-Putinism. Its members have not yet been allowed on stage, but they are definitely rehearsing. Their most visible actor is Alexei Navalny, the only candidate who has been running a real presidential campaign so far. Unsurprisingly, on Dec. 30 Russia’s Supreme Court barred him from taking part in the election, citing a fraud conviction that he says was based on trumped-up charges. He immediately called for a boycott of the election. Mr. Navalny, a 41-year-old lawyer, ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013 and came in second, with about 30 percent of the vote.

"An official of the Virginia State Board of Elections pulled the name of David Yancey from a blue and white stoneware bowl on Thursday, breaking a tied race that is pivotal to control of the state House of Delegates. The outcome in favor of Mr. Yancey, the Republican incumbent, means that the House remains narrowly in his party’s hands, 51 seats to 49, after a Democratic wave in November propelled by anger at President Trump. Going into the election, the Republicans had a 32-seat advantage. The random drawing, a species of political unicorn that attracted attention well beyond Virginia, was conducted in the Patrick Henry Building near the State Capitol in Richmond shortly after 11 a.m. Each candidate’s name was written on strips of paper, inserted into film canisters and mixed together in the handmade bowl, made by the potter-in-residence at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Steven Glass. Despite the high ceremony, the drawing may not bring finality to a race that has already been fiercely fought through a recount and in court skirmishes. By state law, the loser in the drawing may request a second recount. The Democratic challenger, Shelly Simonds, a school board member in Newport News, said after the drawing that “all options are still on the table.’’ But she also sounded resigned. “You know it was a long hard election season, and it does seem like a sad end to the story to have to end on a game of chance,’’ she told reporters.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened legal fire and fury on Thursday in an effort to block a new book portraying him as a volatile and ill-equipped chief executive, but the publisher defied his demand to halt its release and instead moved up its publication to Friday because of soaring interest. Angry at the publisher’s refusal to back down, Mr. Trump took aim late Thursday night at the book’s author, Michael Wolff, and one of his primary sources, Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, whose derisive comments about the president and his family stirred deep resentment in the Oval Office. “I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter shortly before 11 p.m. “I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!” The president’s blast at Mr. Wolff came at the end of a day in which Mr. Trump’s effort to stop publication failed. In an 11-page letter sent in the morning, a lawyer for the president said the book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” as excerpted in a magazine article, includes false statements about Mr. Trump that “give rise to claims for libel” that could result in “substantial monetary damages and punitive damages.” “Mr. Trump hereby demands that you immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book, the article, or any excerpts or summaries of either of them, to any person or entity, and that you issue a full and complete retraction and apology to my client as to all statements made about him in the book and article that lack competent evidentiary support,” the letter said. Undeterred, Henry Holt and Co., the publisher, announced that instead it would make the book available for sale starting at 9 a.m. Friday rather than wait for its original release date on Tuesday. “We see ‘Fire and Fury’ as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,” the company said in a statement.

"WASHINGTON — The viability of the multibillion-dollar marijuana legalization movement was thrown into new doubt on Thursday when the Trump administration freed prosecutors to more aggressively enforce federal laws against the drug in states that have decriminalized its production and sale, most recently California. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, long a vocal opponent of the legalization of marijuana, rescinded an Obama-era policy that discouraged federal prosecutors in most cases from bringing charges wherever the drug is legal under state laws. “It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law,” he said in a statement. In his memo to United States attorneys, he called the earlier policy “unnecessary” and pointed to federal laws that “reflect Congress’s determination that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime.” Democrats and some Republicans condemned the move. Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, threatened to retaliate by holding up Justice Department appointments that required Senate approval. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor of California, vowed to encourage cooperation among states that have legalized marijuana. “This brings states together around issues of freedom, individual liberty, states’ rights,” he said in an interview, “all of the principles that transcend red and blue.” California began allowing the sale of recreational marijuana on Monday, joining Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Massachusetts and possibly Maine are expected to begin sales this year. In all, 29 states and the District of Columbia have at least partly legalized the substance — including for medicinal use — though it remains illegal under federal law.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday it would allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters, giving energy companies access to leases off California for the first time in decades and opening more than a billion acres in the Arctic and along the Eastern Seaboard. The proposal lifts a ban on such drilling imposed by President Barack Obama near the end of his term and would deal a serious blow to his environmental legacy. It would also signal that the Trump administration is not done unraveling environmental restrictions in an effort to promote energy production. While the plan puts the administration squarely on the side of the energy industry and against environmental groups, it also puts the White House at odds with a number of coastal states that oppose offshore drilling. Some of those states are led by Republicans, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, where the tourism industry was hit hard by the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in 2010 that killed 11 people and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Governor Scott vowed on Thursday to protect his state’s coast from drilling, saying he would raise the issue with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. “I have asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,” he said in a statement. “My top priority is to ensure that Florida’s natural resources are protected.” The governors of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Oregon and Washington have all opposed offshore drilling plans. Virginia’s governor-elect, Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that expanding drilling would jeopardize his state’s tourism and fishing industries, as well as military installations. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, also a Democrat, called drilling a “critical threat” to his state’s economy.

"WASHINGTON — Enthusiasm for Stephen K. Bannon’s plans for a fiery Republican revolution had already been fading among some of the donors and candidates he was relying on to upend the party’s establishment. But Mr. Bannon’s provocative remarks about President Trump and his family, reported in a new book now scheduled to be released this week, and Mr. Trump’s angry response, further alienated some of Mr. Bannon’s most important backers — including the family of the hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer — leaving Mr. Bannon confronting the possibility of a dire fate for a publicity-hungry provocateur: political irrelevance. The Mercers were blunt on Thursday in cutting the cord, reiterating support for Mr. Trump while disavowing Mr. Bannon’s remarks and disowning his political endeavors. “My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements,” Rebekah Mercer, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, said in a statement. “I have a minority interest in Breitbart News and I remain committed in my support for them.” The reference to Breitbart seemed an implicit threat. Mr. Bannon is chairman of Breitbart, and many staff members there believe there is a strong chance he might lose the job, though he was dismissive of that possibility on the site’s daily editorial conference call on Thursday night, according to one person with knowledge of the call. Mr. Bannon’s predicament highlights a stark reality in American politics, unchanged even after Mr. Trump’s convention-defying victory: The influence of even the most influential political strategists is inextricably linked to the donors behind them and the politicians in front of them. “If Trump is openly breaking with him, that dramatically lowers his capital,” said Dan K. Eberhart, an Arizona oil investor and Republican donor who has spoken to Mr. Bannon about his plans to build an antiestablishment political operation. “He is a strategic thinker, and a lot of the things he said make sense, but this stuff from the book — I’m not going to defend that.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/bannon-mercer-trump.html?searchResultPosition=11
"It’s easy to cheer the demise of President Trump’s so-called election integrity commission, which he disbanded abruptly on Wednesday, just eight months after establishing it. Many send-offs come to mind. Some, like the one a White House adviser used in an interview with CNN, are unprintable in a family newspaper. We’ll stick with the words of Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania: “Good riddance.” The commission was a transparent sham from the start, nothing more than a cover to justify Mr. Trump’s reckless and unfounded claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election, which he blamed for his losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly three million votes. The lying continued on Wednesday. In a brief executive order, the president said he was ending the commission “despite substantial evidence of voter fraud” — but the commission turned up no such evidence, substantial or otherwise. Not only that, but its short existence was marked by a string of embarrassing missteps. There were the clumsy requests for voter data, in some cases partial Social Security numbers, that at least a dozen states, Republican and Democratic alike, rightly rejected. There were multiple lawsuits alleging that the commission was violating the Constitution by discriminating against voters of color or infringing on Americans’ privacy rights. The commission was even sued by one of its own members, Matthew Dunlap, the Maine secretary of state and a Democrat, who said he was being kept in the dark about the commission’s activities and called any claims of bipartisanship a “facade.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/opinion/voter-fraud-commission.html?searchResultPosition=12

"One of the more alarming anecdotes in “Fire and Fury,” Michael Wolff’s incendiary new book about Donald Trump’s White House, involves the firing of James Comey, former director of the F.B.I. It’s not Trump’s motives that are scary; Wolff reports that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were “increasingly panicked” and “frenzied” about what Comey would find if he looked into the family finances, which is incriminating but unsurprising. The terrifying part is how, in Wolff’s telling, Trump sneaked around his aides, some of whom thought they’d contained him. “For most of the day, almost no one would know that he had decided to take matters into his own hands,” Wolff writes. “In presidential annals, the firing of F.B.I. director James Comey may be the most consequential move ever made by a modern president acting entirely on his own.” Now imagine Trump taking the same approach toward ordering the bombing of North Korea. Wolff’s scabrous book comes out on Friday — the publication date was moved up amid a media furor — but I was able to get an advance copy. It’s already a consequential work, having precipitated a furious rift between the president and his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who told Wolff that the meeting Donald Trump Jr. brokered with Russians in the hope of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton was “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” On Thursday the president’s lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to Wolff’s publisher, Henry Holt, demanding that it stop publication, claiming, among other things, defamation and invasion of privacy. This move would be fascistic if it weren’t so farcical. (While some have raised questions about Wolff’s methods, Axios reports that he has many hours of interviews recorded.) There are lots of arresting details in the book. We learn that the administration holds special animus for what it calls “D.O.J. women,” or women who work in the Justice Department. Wolff writes that after the white supremacist mayhem in Charlottesville, Va., Trump privately rationalized “why someone would be a member of the K.K.K.” The book recounts that after the political purge in Saudi Arabia, Trump boasted that he and Kushner engineered a coup: “We’ve put our man on top!” But most of all, the book confirms what is already widely understood — not just that Trump is entirely unfit for the presidency, but that everyone around him knows it. One thread running through “Fire and Fury” is the way relatives, opportunists and officials try to manipulate and manage the president, and how they often fail. As Wolff wrote in a Hollywood Reporter essay based on the book, over the past year, the people around Trump, “all — 100 percent — came to believe he was incapable of functioning in his job.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/opinion/fire-fury-wolff-trump-book.html?searchResultPosition=15
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday proposed sweeping new rules that could make it easier for small businesses to band together and create health insurance plans that would be exempt from many of the consumer protections mandated by the Affordable Care Act. As many as 11 million Americans “could find coverage under this proposal,” the Labor Department said in issuing the proposed rules, which carry out an executive order signed by President Trump on Oct. 12. The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal before the Trump administration adopts final rules with the force of law. The proposal would allow small business owners, their employees, sole proprietors and other self-employed people to join together as a single group to buy insurance in the large-group market. The new health plans could be exempt from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They would, for example, not have to provide certain “essential health benefits” like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs. “By joining together,” the Labor Department said, “employers may reduce administrative costs through economies of scale, strengthen their bargaining position to obtain more favorable deals, enhance their ability to self-insure and offer a wider array of insurance options.” But consumer groups, state officials and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have strenuously opposed similar ideas for years. Association health plans, they say, will tend to attract employers with younger, healthier workers, leaving behind sicker people in more comprehensive, more expensive plans that fully comply with the Affordable Care Act. That could drive up premiums, which already have risen steadily as Republicans have taken aim at President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. “Those with serious health conditions like cancer would be left paying ever-increasing premiums for comprehensive coverage,” said Chris Hansen, the president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. “The rule proposed today will almost certainly result in more people facing financial distress when an unexpected health crisis happens.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-association-health-plans-obamacare.html?searchResultPosition=28

Spurred by Donald Trump’s election that November, market indexes surged to record levels and went far higher this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 19 percent in 2017, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite leapt 28 percent. There wasn’t a single day last year when the S.&P. 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent, a level of low volatility unseen since the mid-1960s, according to James Stack, a market historian and president of InvesTech Research. In a rare convergence, investor euphoria spread across the globe. A measure of market performance, the MSCI All Country World Index, gained 22.7 percent last year, closing at a record high. And so far this year, stocks have continued their advance. On Thursday, the Dow broke the 25,000 barrier for the first time, and technology stocks are soaring to new highs. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are adding a whiff of bubblelike mania. And that may not be such good news for investors. “If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end,” Mr. Stack said. “A correction would be healthy. The longer we go without one, the greater the risk this will end badly. A lot of people will get hurt. And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility.” That doesn’t mean the end is imminent, according to Mr. Stack and other investment managers and market experts I interviewed this week.

"ISTANBUL — Turkey on Thursday criticized a United States jury’s decision to convict a Turkish banker on charges of conspiring to evade American sanctions against Iran, calling the verdict “unjust” and the trial an “unprecedented interference” in its internal affairs. Yet the sanctions-evasion scandal, in which ministers and even President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were linked to a billion-dollar gold-for-oil trade to help Iran evade American sanctions, appears to have passed in Turkey. The official comments had an air of repetition, and the reaction on social media was muted. The banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, was found guilty on five of six counts, including bank fraud and conspiracies to defraud the United States and violate American sanctions. Mr. Atilla’s employer, Halkbank, said that he would appeal the decision, and noted that it had not been indicted or involved in the court proceedings. Political analysts predicted that the affair would blow over because Mr. Erdogan had not been indicted or badly hurt by new evidence revealed at the trial. The government had successfully framed the case as a plot by its enemies, they said, so the verdict came as no surprise. “It will have zero impact,” said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Ankara, Turkey’s capital. “Erdogan has already persuaded his supporters that it is a conspiracy.” Mr. Erdogan had seemed particularly concerned by the case of another defendant, the wealthy gold trader Reza Zarrab, who pleaded guilty before the trial and became the prosecution’s star witness. Although Mr. Zarrab indicated several times that Mr. Erdogan knew of the sanctions-evasion plan, many in Turkey did not see his testimony as damning.

"Last January, Women’s Marches around the world brought protesters to the streets in droves, unified in our opposition to President Trump and all he symbolized: coarse misogyny, unencumbered male entitlement and the unchecked sexual harassment it enabled, threats to women’s rights and freedoms around the globe. Many of those women marched with one message: I’m doing this for my daughter. It’s a sentiment you often hear from women. We go back to school for our daughters. We alternately drop out of the work force for our daughters or go back to work for them. We eat healthy, lose weight and prioritize self-care to set a good example for our daughters. We vote for particular candidates to ensure a better future for our daughters. We support abortion rights so that our daughters can control their own bodies. We want to save the environment for our daughters. This is not a bad impulse, and there remains much to do for girls around the world. But it can also undercut women’s progress. A woman’s value doesn’t derive from her status as a mother. We are entitled to rights and liberties by plain virtue of our humanness. If 2017 began with women marching for their daughters and ended with a tidal wave of female rage directed at predacious men, perhaps 2018 should be the year women resolve to go after what we want and deserve — simply for us. Imagine what could be if we did the same things we say we do for our daughters out of our own self-interest. There is little more foundational to American womanhood than self-sacrifice, and sacrifice for children in particular. Women are the country’s caretakers: in our houses for children, the elderly and the infirm; in schools and day cares; in elder care and hospice facilities; in hospitals and clinics; in hotels and restaurants. At home, we make sure lunchboxes are packed, food is served, dishes are washed, boo-boos are kissed and doctor’s appointments are attended. At the office, we make sure meetings are scheduled, events are planned and everyone at the table feels heard. We do this out of expectation and upbringing.

Mr. Trump has made a political career out of closing America’s doors to the widow, the orphan and the stranger. He ran a campaign vilifying religious minorities, but as president referred to those marching alongside neo-Nazis in a Charlottesville, Va., rally last summer as “very fine people.” As a Zionist and a current Jerusalem resident, I appreciate the president’s decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over its capital.

If even 20 percent of what Mr. Wolff has written proves to be true, then it becomes crystal clear that Mr. Trump and his band of bunglers are not only unfit to serve, but also a clear and present danger to the safety and stability of this nation. Referring to Donald Trump Jr.’s June 2016 meeting with the Russians to discuss “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, Mr. Bannon says the meeting was “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” In response, Mr. Trump claims that his former friend and chief strategist not only lost his job, but also “lost his mind.” The level of dysfunction in the White House has reached unheard-of dimensions and puts the Trump presidency and the future of America at grave risk. How long will Republicans in Congress allow this farce to continue? HENRY A.

To the Editor: According to your article, President Trump excommunicated his onetime chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, from his political circle, excoriating him, in your words, as “a self-promoting exaggerator.” This is probably the purist example ever of “it takes one to know one.” MARCIA HERMAN, LOS ANGELES ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/opinion/trump-bannon.html?searchResultPosition=24
"Despite his many years as a late-night entertainer, Seth Meyers says there are only certain kinds of parties for which he is well suited. “I don’t get the conga line started,” Mr. Meyers, the host of NBC’s “Late Night,” said in a recent interview. “I’m not a great choice if the goal of the evening is just a celebration. But if we’re going to talk about what’s been going on lately, then I can bring something to the table.” In that sense, Mr. Meyers may be ideally suited to host the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, even if it is a scenario no master of ceremonies would wish for. The program — which has had a reputation as a less stuffy, more raucous cousin of the Oscars and the Emmys — will be Hollywood’s first major award show following a year in which the entertainment industry was roiled by one sexual misconduct scandal after another. Prominent women spoke up to detail the abuses they suffered and once powerful men experienced precipitous falls from grace. When Mr. Meyers takes the stage at the Beverly Hilton Hotel to host the Golden Globe Awards for the first time, he will have to find humorous ways to talk about this unpleasant, extremely painful topic, even while celebrating film and TV accomplishments and roasting a room full of stars wearing black to protest gender inequality.

"TEHRAN — Members of Iran’s ruling establishment took turns on Thursday assigning blame for what they regard as an embarrassing outbreak of protests in more than 80 cities across the country. Iran’s chief prosecutor elaborated on the government’s claims that the United States and other foreign enemies were responsible for stirring up trouble. The United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia planned the “riots” to “subvert the Iranian government,” the prosecutor, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, said on state television. “The U.S., the Zionist regime and the Al Sauds were the three sides of this subversive plan, and Saudi Arabia committed to provide money for it,” Mr. Montazeri said. Mr. Montazeri asserted that Michael D’Andrea, a C.I.A. officer who runs Iran operations, was a “main designer” of the protests and that the C.I.A. hoped to turn the protest into an “armed” revolt by mid-February, the anniversary of the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution. The Trump administration has denied having any involvement in the protests, and the C.I.A. declined to comment. But a former intelligence official who was granted anonymity to discuss Mr. D’Andrea’s thinking said the operative did not believe the United States could do anything to bring about regime change in Iran. Iran did not provide evidence for its accusation, which evoked memories of the C.I.A.’s role in a 1953 coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohammed Mossadegh.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would suspend nearly all security aid to Pakistan, an across-the-board freeze that is the most tangible sign yet of Washington’s frustration with the country’s refusal to crack down on terrorist networks operating there. The decision, which could affect as much as $1.3 billion in annual aid, came three days after President Trump complained on Twitter that Pakistan had “given us nothing but lies & deceit” and accused it of providing “safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.” The move underlines how swiftly relations with Pakistan have deteriorated since Mr. Trump took office. But it echoes several previous rifts between the countries over Pakistan’s role as a sanctuary for extremist groups — a role that has poisoned Islamabad’s relations with Washington since the terrorist attacks of September 2001. Administration officials emphasized that the freeze was temporary and could be lifted if Pakistan changed its behavior. The United States is urging the Pakistani government to cut off contact with militants and reassign intelligence agents with links to extremists, among other measures. United States officials had also demanded access to a member of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network, who was captured by Pakistani forces during the rescue of a Canadian-American family in October, and were angered when Pakistan rejected the request. “It’s hard to argue the status quo has been working, so we are looking at changing it to advance our security objectives,” said Brian H. Hook, the State Department’s director of policy planning. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-pakistan-aid.html?searchResultPosition=20
