"BEIRUT, Lebanon — A tycoon was called home to Saudi Arabia from abroad for a business meeting and detained when he returned. A billionaire was ordered to turn himself in or be picked up like a common criminal. An official was called in to discuss an attack that apparently never happened. Now those three are among the more than 200  people detained in luxury hotels in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, as the government tries to seize hundreds of billions of dollars in assets it says they stole through corrupt means. Two weeks after the crackdown began, Saudi officials and their supporters are attempting to justify the indefinite detentions as an ordinary part of a plea-bargaining process, similar to the approach Western prosecutors use with white-collar criminals. But human rights groups say the comparison ignores critical differences, like legal protections for the accused and an independent judiciary to weigh allegations. Instead, such comparisons appear to point to the desire to raise money as a primary motivation behind the sudden arrests. “This appears to be taking place outside anything that resembles a clear legal process,” said Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch who monitors Saudi Arabia. “If the Saudi authorities don’t offer a chance for legal defense, then this is nothing other than a shakedown.” Defenders of the Saudi approach describe its avoidance of court cases as a benefit, not a drawback. “If you are facing a situation where you have to take in as many people as you do, and of such prominence, if you are going to have a legal process, it will drag on for years, assuming that you have the legal bandwidth to do it,” said Ali Shihabi, executive director of the Arabia Foundation, a research organization in Washington that is close to the Saudi government.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Germany is facing the prospect of new elections after negotiations to form a new government collapsed. The breakdown comes less than two months after the last elections seemed to assure that Angela Merkel, above, an icon of Western democracy and values, would remain Germany’s leader for a fourth term. If the deadlock isn’t broken, Ms. Merkel said, she would prefer to go through new elections rather than try to lead a minority government. _____ "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s charitable foundation increased its fund-raising and giving during his campaign last year, even as it became the subject of criticism that prompted a decision to dissolve it, according to paperwork submitted this month to the I.R.S. The Donald J. Trump Foundation raised $2.9 million in 2016 — almost as much as it had raised in the preceding four years combined — according to its annual tax filing for 2016. It also showed that the foundation donated $3 million last year, more than it had given in the previous three years combined. Most of the money came from a pair of $1 million donations from leading supporters of his presidential campaign — the Las Vegas gambling investor Phil Ruffin and Laura Perlmutter of Lake Worth, Fla., whose husband, Isaac Perlmutter, is the chairman of Marvel Entertainment. They donated in connection with an event that Mr. Trump staged to benefit military veterans, which set off scrutiny of his foundation for giving away only a fraction of the money it raised to charities, and for making payments in a manner that appeared to benefit Mr. Trump. The foundation also attracted scrutiny from the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who found it had violated fund-raising rules and ordered it to cease soliciting contributions the month before the election. After Mr. Trump won, he directed his lawyers to begin the process of closing the foundation to avoid conflicts of interest. This month’s I.R.S. filing indicates that the foundation finished last year with more than $970,000 in the bank, and that it “is seeking approval to distribute its remaining funds to highly qualified and important” charities.

"WASHINGTON — Maybe it was the memory of a long-ago childhood visit to the zoo. Maybe it was a sense of loyalty to the symbol of his political party. But President Trump’s surprise intervention to try to save the elephants of Zimbabwe has drawn praise from across the political spectrum — and the question of why he did it has now become the, well, pachyderm in the room. In what may be one of the most curious moments of his first year in office, Mr. Trump put a sudden halt to a new federal government ruling that would have allowed hunters to bring “trophy” elephants killed in Zimbabwe into the United States, calling big-game hunting a “horror show” that he did not believe helped conservation. “There’s a lot of shock that this president and this administration would roll back a decision on trophy hunting like this,” said Tanya Sanerib, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, which fights to protect species threatened with extinction. “But there’s something about elephants that just crosses party lines. They get to people.” Aides said it was no more complicated than that. The president likes elephants, they said. He did not know about his administration’s decision to lift the trophy ban until learning it from the news media and was annoyed to be criticized for a move he had no part in. So he made his displeasure known in the way he has so many other times this year, through his Twitter feed. As it happened, his decision also coincided with the sentiments of conservative media personalities like Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham and Mike Cernovich, who have defended Mr. Trump through a cascade of controversies this year but protested the administration’s initial announcement.

"LAST week, the editors of GQ named the quarterback Colin Kaepernick its Citizen of the Year for his work protesting racial injustice. Mr. Kaepernick has been heavily criticized by people like President Trump, who claims that an N.F.L. player who kneels during the playing of the national anthem “disrespects our flag” and should be fired; others argue that he is out of bounds as an activist who mixes sports with politics. The problem is that Mr. Kaepernick’s critics, and most of America, don’t really understand how protests work. Our textbooks and national mythology celebrate moments when single acts of civil disobedience, untainted by political organizations, seemed to change the course of history. But the ideal of the “good” protest — one that materialized from an individual’s epiphany — is a fantasy. More often, effective protest is like Mr. Kaepernick’s: it’s collective and contingent and all about long and difficult struggles. Consider what most Americans would agree were two “good” protests: Rosa Parks’s refusal to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Ala., and the student sit-ins at a Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C. Parks, the story goes, was exhausted from a day’s work and took a seat in the “whites only” section. To the astonishment of onlookers, she refused to give up her seat when asked. In Greensboro, black college students decided to eat at the local five-and-dime and initiated the first sit-in at a segregated Southern restaurant. They were idealistic and perhaps naïve. These stories follow a set narrative. They are “firsts”: the first time a black woman refused to give up her seat or the first time students staged a sit-in. They seemed to arise spontaneously when someone fed up with unfair treatment couldn’t take it anymore. Good protesters act as individual citizens, untainted by associations with suspect political organizations. The trouble is that these stories are historically inaccurate and obscure just how protest in the 20th century forged a more democratic country. A narrative with greater accuracy would allow us to better evaluate protests against racial discrimination. Earlier protests, similar to the one that Mr. Kaepernick started, sprang from protesters’ associations with activist organizations, were deeply political rather than individual, and played out in unfamiliar venues in new forms. Protests that change history have their own long histories. They are almost never the first of their kind. Successful protesters plan campaigns, rather than respond to oppression in a single, spontaneous act. Protesters often belong to organizations that lend theoretical, moral and logistical support. Protests don’t reveal previously hidden wrongs to an unaware public. Instead, they cast those wrongs in a new light. They fail, time and time again. When they succeed, they win only partial victories. "
"The Trump administration is ending a humanitarian program that has allowed some 59,000 Haitians to live and work in the United States since an earthquake ravaged their country in 2010, Homeland Security officials said on Monday. Haitians with what is known as Temporary Protected Status will be expected to leave the United States by July 2019 or face deportation. The decision set off immediate dismay among Haitian communities in South Florida, New York and beyond, and was a signal to other foreigners with temporary protections that they, too, could soon be asked to leave. About 320,000 people now benefit from the Temporary Protected Status program, which was signed into law by President George Bush in 1990, and the decision on Monday followed another one last month that ended protections for 2,500 Nicaraguans. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, is still struggling to recover from the earthquake and relies heavily on money its expatriates send to relatives back home. The Haitian government had asked the Trump administration to extend the protected status. “I received a shock right now,” Gerald Michaud, 45, a Haitian who lives in Brooklyn, said when he heard the news. He has been working at La Guardia Airport as a wheelchair attendant, sending money to family and friends back home. He said he feared for his welfare and safety back in Haiti now that his permission to remain in the United States was ending. "
"Along the vast rocky desert that stretches from Mexico into rural West Texas, Border Patrol agents like Rogelio Martinez frequently work alone, miles from civilization and from help. Agent Martinez loved the work, said his father, Jose Martinez. He also knew the risks. The job’s two responsibilities were stopping illegal border crossings and halting drug trafficking. Around 3 a.m. Sunday, Jose Martinez was awakened at home in El Paso with the phone call he had long dreaded. Summoned to the University Medical Center of El Paso, where doctors were trying in vain to resuscitate his son, Mr. Martinez got a sense of what had happened in the desert about 100 miles away when he saw Rogelio’s bloodied head. “It was difficult to look at,” he said. Agent Martinez, 36, was killed, and a second agent who had apparently come to his aid was seriously injured. The F.B.I. was looking into the possibility that the men were attacked, but did not say Monday whether any arrests had been made. Details were thin, but the episode in a remote stretch of Texas quickly made its way into the national conversation on immigration and border security. While Border Patrol fatalities are relatively rare, agents are not infrequently attacked on the job. And despite a dramatic drop in border crossings under the Trump administration, assaults against officers have risen, according to data maintained by the border agency: 720 in the recently-completed fiscal year, the highest number in at least five years.

"AT&T, one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies,  figures prominently in the annals of antitrust law. Since the late 19th century, under various names and configurations, the entity once known as Ma Bell has often been targeted by regulators trying to rein in its size and keep it from amassing monopoly power. Now, AT&T is facing off against the Justice Department again, this time over its proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. And although the details are different, the current situation is a reminder of the complicated balancing act the government must strike in regulating ever-changing companies. “AT&T has been a dominant company from the very beginning and has sought to maintain its dominance through varying government interactions,” said Gerald Brock, a former Federal Communications Commission staff member who is a professor of public policy at George Washington University. “That’s been the sense of AT&T through the ages — that they seem to have a lot of power, but people also want to be able to communicate in a way that AT&T allows them to do.” Alexander Graham Bell receives two patents for his telephone. A year later, the Bell Telephone Company, the precursor to AT&T, issues stock to seven shareholders. In 1881, the company acquires Western Electric Company, a supplier of telephone equipment. "
"As he raised estate tax rates to fund work programs during the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, “The transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes by will, inheritance or gift is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people.” It’s plenty consistent with the ideals and sentiments of President Trump, who began lying about the merits of an estate tax repeal on the day he began the tax overhaul effort. “To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax,” Mr. Trump said in late September. Congressional Republicans echoed Mr. Trump’s whoppers. “You actually create jobs by getting rid of this death tax,” said the House speaker, Paul Ryan. “Because you know what kills one family business from passing their business on to the next generation? The estate tax.” “For too long, this tax has threatened family-owned businesses — including women- and minority-owned businesses — from being passed down to their children and grandchildren,” said Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which produced the tax legislation.

"Driving on Long Island in August, Denis Guerra Guerra was stopped by the police in Nassau County for failing to signal when changing lanes, a traffic infraction punishable by a ticket. Two weeks later, he was deported to El Salvador. A police officer had taken his identification — a passport from El Salvador — and discovered a pending order of removal from immigration authorities. On Monday, lawyers from the Central American Refugee Center, a Long Island immigrant legal services organization commonly known as Carecen, and the Hofstra Law Clinic filed suit against Nassau County in state Supreme Court, saying that the county police department was cooperating with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in ways that break state law. Elise Damas, a lawyer for Carecen, announced the suit at a news conference at Hofstra University. “Carecen seeks an ironclad assurance that Nassau County will act in accordance with New York State law, and not just with federal immigration policies,” she said. “Nassau County police are tasked with ensuring the safety of all communities countywide, a goal which cannot be achieved until immigrants feel protected.” Peter L. Markowitz, a professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, called the lawsuit significant, saying: “New York State laws strictly define when it is O.K. and not O.K. for a state officer to make an arrest. And that does not include the authority to make civil immigration arrests.” Mr. Guerra Guerra, 30, is not named in the lawsuit. He is a client of Ms. Damas’s, though, and she said he was the impetus for the suit. But since he is in El Salvador, the lead plaintiff in the case is “Jane Doe,” a 26-year-old undocumented immigrant living in Nassau County. The woman has had no interaction so far with local police but, the suit claims, is at risk because of county policies; the lawyers declined to name her because she is applying for asylum. "
"One thing you can count on in 21st-century U.S. politics is that Republicans will lie about taxes. They did it under George W. Bush, they did it under Barack Obama and they’re still doing it under Donald Trump. Yet this time is different. It’s not just that the lies have gotten even more brazen. There’s now a combination of incoherence and rage that we, or at least I, haven’t seen before. These days, they can’t even seem to get their fake story straight — and they literally start yelling obscenities when someone tries to point out the facts. G.O.P. lies about taxes generally involve two issues: who is hurt or helped by tax changes, and what these changes will do to the budget. Thus, when George W. Bush cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, he and his party repeatedly insisted that the tax cuts were primarily for the middle class. In fact, while there were some middle-class tax breaks in the package, such as an increase in the child tax credit, these were dwarfed by cuts in tax rates on high incomes, reduced taxes on dividends and repeal of the estate tax. Over all, the richest 1 percent saw a much larger increase in after-tax income than middle-class families did. At the same time, the Bush administration used a series of gimmicks to hide the true fiscal cost of the plan, such as delaying the implementation of some tax cuts while pretending that others would expire when the actual intention was to make them permanent. When Obama took office, these tricks were simply flipped on their head. Republicans insisted, falsely, that Obama had imposed a “massive tax increase” on the middle class; in fact, for the most part he actually cut middle-class taxes. Meanwhile, they insisted that the surge in the budget deficit caused by the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis was permanent, and ridiculed the Obama administration’s claims that deficits would fall sharply once crisis spending ended and tax receipts recovered; in fact, that’s exactly what happened. "
"President Trump accomplished his unlikely rise to the White House powered in large part by an embrace of economic and cultural populism. Yet one year after this victory, the Republican Party still has no idea how to address or incorporate those populist elements into a coherent agenda. Nor, despite their best intentions, do Mr. Trump and his former adviser Steve Bannon. This populism does not sit easily within the Republican Party’s business conservative wing (think Mitt Romney) or its “liberty” conservatives (think Tea Party) faction. So it’s not too surprising that virtually all of Mr. Trump’s signature populist ideas have been watered down or ignored, or are in limbo. Instead, Republicans push tax plans that overwhelmingly benefit their donor and executive class. It’s as though Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz won after all. But they didn’t win, and they didn’t win for a reason. Republican voters want something different from anti-government or establishment Republicanism. And the voters who made Mr. Trump president, the millions of largely white men and women without college degrees who voted for Barack Obama before backing Mr. Trump, definitely do not want Romneyism with a human face. The traditional Republican policy agenda is a political zombie, a relic that once served our nation well but is out of touch with what Americans want today. It doesn’t have to be this way. Mr. Trump and some of his supporters had good ideas for a reformed Republican Party that fuses conservative and populist elements into an alloy stronger than either on its own. This fusion may now seem like a dream, but it can still walk among us if Republicans will it to be so. They need only look back to the man they purport to revere, Ronald Reagan, to make it happen. We tend to forget that the Reagan coalition of the same three groups — non-Republican populists, fiscal conservatives and business Republicans — united behind coherent policy change. "
"WASHINGTON — The fast-moving Republican effort to overhaul the tax code now rests in the hands of a small number of fence-sitting senators with disparate concerns, like how small businesses are taxed and whether health insurance costs will spike after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s requirement to have coverage or pay a penalty. Lawmakers face a challenge in navigating those competing priorities without rankling other members or running afoul of budget rules. For instance, dropping the repeal of the individual mandate from the bill would mollify the concerns of some but could alienate others who wish to see it included, while also upending the delicate fiscal math behind the Republican plan. On Sunday, President Trump fired off a Twitter broadside against one of those undecided senators, Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who is not seeking re-election next year. The president referred to him as “Sen. Jeff Flake(y),” declared him “unelectable” and offered a prediction: “He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is ‘toast.’ ” Mr. Flake, an unapologetic Trump critic, seemed unmoved by the declaration. “What the president says or does or feels has nothing whatsoever to do with how I will vote on that tax bill,” Mr. Flake said during a radio interview on Monday. “That’s just not how I operate.” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, wants the full Senate to consider the tax bill next week. Because Republicans hold a narrow 52-to-48 majority, party leaders can afford only two defections, assuming Democrats are unified against the bill and Vice President Mike Pence provides the tiebreaking vote. The math would grow even tighter if Democrats gain a seat in the special election for Senate in Alabama next month. The concerns expressed by Republican senators are hardly monolithic, and Mr. McConnell will have to walk a delicate line to resolve the issues without setting off additional objections from other lawmakers.

"Last Thursday, after a photograph emerged of Senator Al Franken either groping or pretending to grope a sleeping woman, Leeann Tweeden, with whom he’d been traveling on a 2006 U.S.O. tour, I wrote that he should resign. Almost as soon as it was published I started having second thoughts. I spent all weekend feeling guilty that I’d called for the sacrifice of an otherwise decent man to make a political point. Then I saw the news that a woman named Lindsay Menz accused Franken of grabbing her butt while they posed for a photo at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010, when he was a senator, and I read Franken’s lame non-denial: “I feel badly that Ms. Menz came away from our interaction feeling disrespected.” Yet I am still not sure I made the right call. My thinking last week, when the first accusation emerged, was: cauterize the wound. It doesn’t matter that Franken’s transgression wasn’t on the same level as the abuses that the Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore or Donald Trump have been accused of. That photo — the unconscious woman, the leering grin — is a weight Democrats shouldn’t have to carry, given that they’ve lately been insisting that it’s disqualifying for a candidate to grab a woman sexually against her will. It seemed cruel to expect Democratic women to make Jesuitical arguments that the shadows under Franken’s hands meant he wasn’t really touching Tweeden’s chest. Especially since, with a Democratic governor in Minnesota, the party would maintain control of Franken’s seat. But even as I made the case for resignation, I was relieved that it seemed as if Franken might stick around, because I adore him as a public figure. It’s easy to condemn morally worthless men like Trump; it’s much harder to figure out what should happen to men who make valuable political and cultural contributions, and whose alleged misdeeds fall far short of criminal. Learning about all the seemingly good guys who do shameful things is what makes this moment, with its frenzied pace of revelations, so painful and confounding. Personally, I’m torn by competing impulses. I want to see sexual harassment finally taken seriously but fear participating in a sex panic. My instinct is often to defend men I like, but I don’t want to be an enabler or a sucker. I try not to be a hypocrite, while being aware that the right plays on the media’s desire to seem fair-minded, which is part of what led to wildly excessive coverage of Hillary Clinton’s emails during the presidential campaign, among other distortions. It’s not a coincidence that the post-Harvey Weinstein purge of sexual harassers has been largely confined to liberal-leaning fields like Hollywood, media and the Democratic Party. This isn’t because progressive institutions are more sexist than others — I’m confident there’s at least as much sexual abuse in finance as in publishing. Rather, organizations with liberal values have suddenly become extremely responsive to claims of sexism. Feminists, enraged and traumatized by Donald Trump’s election, know they can’t expect accountability from Republicans, but they’ve forced it from people who claim to share their ideals. As a result, it sometimes feels as if liberal institutions are devouring themselves over sex while conservatives, unburdened by the pretense of caring about gender equality, blithely continue their misrule.

"WASHINGTON — American and Afghan warplanes conducted a series of strikes on Sunday night at what American officials said were Taliban drug depots, as part of what is expected to be a sustained campaign targeting the group’s $200 million-a-year opium trade. Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of the United States operations in Afghanistan, said that B-52 bombers and F-22 warplanes took part in the strikes, the first such attacks under new authorities granted by President Trump to officials conducting the war in Afghanistan. “Heroin’s become a global issue,” General Nicholson told reporters on Monday during a teleconference news briefing from Afghanistan. “These criminals living in Afghanistan who are closely linked to the Taliban are responsible for 85 percent of the world’s opium.” He said that the campaign against Taliban drug labs, which he said numbered about 400 to 500 across the country, would continue into the foreseeable future. The United States alone spends more than $8 billion to fight the drug trade. Regional experts suggest that the campaign is necessary, as the drug trade, estimated to make up at least 60 percent of the Taliban’s income, has helped sustain the war. The Taliban have recently turned to refining heroin from the country’s vast poppy production, which greatly increases their profits. For years, most of the harvest was smuggled out in the form of bulky opium syrup that was refined in other countries. But officials say that now, at least half of Afghan opium is processed in the country. "

"SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump’s re-designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism may have dashed cautious hopes in the region that talks and diplomacy would replace escalating tensions and bellicose threats, analysts said on Tuesday. Despite a two-month hiatus in North Korea’s weapons tests, Mr. Trump has held to his policy of “maximum pressure,” restoring North Korea on Monday to Washington’s list of terrorism-sponsoring states, along with Iran, Sudan and Syria. The move, he said, would be followed by “the highest level of sanctions.” On Tuesday, Treasury Department officials announced a new round of sanctions aimed at disrupting the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. They were levied against Chinese trading companies and several North Korean shipping vessels and companies, freezing their assets and prohibiting Americans from engaging in transactions with them. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had described the sanctions on Monday as extensions of existing prohibitions. “It may, though, disrupt and dissuade some third parties,” he said. “This will close a few additional loopholes off.” Analysts said they doubted that new sanctions would make any real difference on the already heavily penalized country. If anything, they said, the designation will make diplomacy more difficult without increasing Washington’s leverage, warning that North Korea will probably take the naming and shaming as another reason to stick to its hard-line policy of developing and testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles. “It’s hard to see any real impact on North Korea, which has lived through all manners of sanctions for seven decades,” said Paik Hak-soon, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization. “What it does instead is to send a clear message to North Korea that Trump is not interested in talks, another sign and reconfirmation that the Americans remain a hostile force.” "
"Bret Stephens: I know we won’t end this conversation without a discussion of a certain candidate for the United States Senate from the Yellowhammer state. And yes, that’s a “Jeopardy!” answer for our readers. First, though, I wanted to mention how impressed I was by three recent columns by our colleagues Maureen Dowd, Ross Douthat and Michelle Goldberg. Each of them has written a powerful reappraisal of the pass that many liberals gave to Bill Clinton during his impeachment saga, and the consequences of that pass as we enter the #MeToo era. What do you think? Were liberals too soft on President Clinton back then, and how has that shaped the culture since? Gail Collins: Totally agree about the great writing by Michelle, Maureen and Ross. And I’ve been thinking about the Clinton-to-Roy-Moore matter constantly. Particularly about the bottom line when it comes to private versus public behavior. Imagine there’s a big election coming up, and one of the candidates is a guy with a terrible reputation for sexual misdeeds. And the other is a family man who spends his spare time building housing for the poor, who never even dated anybody before his wife of 35 years. But the hound dog is as close as a politician has ever come to supporting your exact hopes and dreams when it comes to both domestic policy and international affairs. And the man of honor is running on all the ideas you hate: say, a platform of doubling domestic spending and paying for it with new taxes on business. Plus he hangs out with every foreign leader who gives you nightmares. Which way would you go? Bret: I’m a big believer in the importance of character when it comes to any executive position, the presidency most of all. It’s one of the reasons I’ve opposed President Trump so strenuously. This is particularly true in my arguments with the conservatives who have shrugged at most of the president’s character defects because they agree with him on court nominees, or the Iran deal, or tax cuts or whatever. Policy decisions are always reversible. Trump’s moral defects are a permanent stain on the presidency itself. "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — Sitting cross-legged on the floor of a sparsely decorated Kabul apartment, the young, bubbly woman told me why she lies to her neighbors. She tells them she’s a nurse when they inquire, as they always do. She leaves the house in civilian clothes and changes into her crisp uniform only when she’s on base. This Afghan woman in her 20s, who asked that her name not be used for her safety, is part of a small, brave group of women serving in Afghanistan’s security forces. If her neighbors found out, she says, they’d surely kill her. Sixteen years into a controversial United States-led war in Afghanistan — one billed in part as a mission to liberate Afghan women — the United States is pouring millions of dollars into bolstering the ranks of women in the police, the army and other branches of the security forces. Last fiscal year, the United States budgeted an additional $93.5 million to help increase recruitment of women and support them with suitable facilities, training and equipment. It’s a worthy cause: Research shows that more women in security forces, generally speaking, means more stable societies. And in Afghanistan in particular — a country where women and girls are still routinely killed for “offenses” as minor as refusing a marriage proposal — the idea of supporting measures that expand gender equality seems like an easy call. And yet as the young woman’s fears demonstrate, bolstering the ranks of women in security forces in a country like Afghanistan is not a simple numbers game. Through its hiring policies, the United States is trying to manufacture gender equality from the top down. In doing so, it is asking women to serve as the leading edge of change — a role that comes with great risks — often without providing adequate protection and support. This month, Afghans expressed their disgust and fury on social media over a graphic video in which a woman in the Afghan Air Force is pressured into having sex with a colonel whom she had asked for a promotion. Women in the security forces routinely face requests for sex, female Air Force members told me last week. If they want to keep their positions, they can almost never turn them down — and this colonel, in particular, was known for his predatory behavior. In this case, however, the woman, remarkably, surreptitiously recorded her encounter and leaked the video herself — even though taking a stand against harassment can itself result in death threats.

"Update: The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday announced plans to dismantle net neutrality regulations, clearing the way for companies to charge more and block access to some websites. Read more here » WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission is preparing a full repeal of net neutrality rules that require broadband providers to give consumers equal access to all content on the internet, putting more power in the hands of those companies to dictate people’s online experiences. Ajit Pai, the chairman of the F.C.C., plans to reveal a sweeping proposal to scrap the net neutrality rules on Tuesday, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are not public. The rules, created during the Obama administration, prohibit broadband providers from blocking, slowing down or charging more for the delivery of certain internet content. The proposal will be presented in a December meeting of F.C.C. commissioners and is expected to pass in a 3-to-2 vote along party lines. A rollback of net neutrality regulations would represent a significant victory for broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast and would amount to a strike against consumers. When the rules were passed in 2015, they underlined the importance of high-speed internet to the lives of Americans and the need to more strongly regulate the communications service like a utility, as essential as electricity and the telephone. But under a repeal, companies like AT&T and Comcast may be able to charge people higher fees to access certain websites and online services. The companies may also be able to prioritize their own services while disadvantaging websites run by rivals. Mr. Pai plans to accompany the repeal of net neutrality with several other measures that will also benefit broadband companies, said the people with knowledge of the matter. That includes suggesting that the Federal Trade Commission, which has traditionally not brought many cases, be the enforcement agency of net neutrality violations, they said. "

I would also welcome recommendations of a couple of free publications you particularly like. Email me at leonhardt@nytimes.com. I’ll share the results later this week. The middle-class tax hike. Each time Congress makes major changes to its tax bill, the independent tax experts who analyze bills need to do another analysis. Yesterday, the Tax Policy Center came out with a new overview of the Senate bill, and it was brutal. You can see a summary in the chart below. In brief, 98 percent of households making at least $5 million (roughly the top 1/1,000th of the income distribution) receive a tax cut by the time the bill is fully implemented. Only about 26 percent of those making less than $150,000 a year (roughly the bottom 4/5ths of the distribution) get a tax cut. The tax bill has a few decent ideas scattered in it. But it is, at root, an enormous tax cut for the very rich, financed by a combination of middle-class tax increases and deficit increases. "
"A little more than a year ago, Cubans were exulting in the normalization of relations between their country and the United States after decades of trade and travel barriers. But on a recent trip to Havana, I found Cubans dismayed by President Trump’s reversal of the détente started by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Mr. Trump had appealed to older Cuban-Americans by taking a tough stance against the Castro regime on the campaign trail, and they helped him carry the Florida in the 2016 election. In August, reports surfaced of American and Canadian diplomats in Havana experiencing mysterious ailments that resulted in hearing losses and cognitive problems. The illnesses, which the United States government has suggested were caused by a “sonic weapon,” appear to have given Mr. Trump the pretext to fulfill his campaign promise and take a harder line on Cuba. The result is a return to a Cold War mentality and a set of failed policies that will do little to improve human rights in Cuba or to hasten the end of the Castro regime. The embargo imposed by the United States for more than 55 years only strengthened Cuba’s authoritarian government by restricting people’s access to opportunities to better their lives. With a return to Cold War-era policies, it is the Cuban people — not their government — who will suffer. Nearly two dozen American diplomats returned to the United States for medical treatment for ailments that included dizziness and nausea. The cause remains a deep mystery. Mr. Trump, providing no evidence, said he believed that the Cuban government was responsible. Yet many experts say it is unlikely that a sonic device could have caused the variety of symptoms experienced by the diplomats. The Cuban government has denied involvement in an attack. In a speech in Miami in June, Mr. Trump had promised that his administration would restrict travel to Cuba and prohibit financial transactions with businesses owned or managed by Cuban security services and the military. At the time, Mr. Trump’s critics held out hope that diplomatic relations, which Mr. Obama had upgraded to the embassy level, would continue and ensure a stable relationship. But in August, following the reports of the illnesses among diplomats, relations rapidly deteriorated. Hard-line Cuban-Americans, led by Senator Marco Rubio, pressured the administration, which later reduced the American Embassy staff in Havana by more than half and ordered an equivalent drawdown of staff at the Cuban Embassy in Washington. The State Department issued a warning advising Americans not to travel to Cuba. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) When Scott Michaels began the “Helter Skelter” tour about eight years ago, he offered it roughly once a month. Now, he guides people around the sites of the Manson family murders at least once a weekend, often selling out weeks in advance. The three-and-a-half-hour tour is often filled with middle-age adults who were children during the murder spree that Charles Manson, who died Sunday, orchestrated in the summer of 1969. “There’s seemingly no end to it,” said Mr. Michaels, who runs several other tours through Dearly Departed, his company and museum. “A lot of it has to do with the feeling that this scared us all. Up until then you thought you were safe in your own bed.” The fact that the murders happened “in the sanctuary of the home” contributed to much of the fear that captivated people at the time, said Steve Oney, who wrote an oral history of the killings for Los Angeles Magazine in 2009. “It was the modern L.A. noir murder because Manson’s cohorts butchered people in their homes and this is a city of homes,” Mr. Oney said. “Until then, this was a very open city, a very porous city, and people weren’t necessarily guarded.” "
"President Trump’s administration is scrambling its media signals. The Department of Justice on Monday sued to block AT&T’s merger with Time Warner over concerns that the two would use content to stiff rivals. But another agency intends to scrap rules that force internet providers to treat web traffic equally. Trying to stop AT&T’s $85 billion offer for HBO’s parent is an unusual move in itself. The success of M&A transactions based on a similar vertical structure, such as Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, certainly left executives at the two companies convinced that their deal would sail through. A Republican-led White House and Congress ought to have bolstered their chances, too, as the Republican Party usually champions looser rules that favor business. In its complaint, the Justice Department cited fears that AT&T could use its ownership of series like “Game of Thrones” and sports rights to, say, NBA games to force other distributors to pay more to carry the content. Any rival that balked at ponying up, for example, could lose access to the programming; AT&T might then screen it exclusively over its own network in the hope of signing up more customers. By contrast, the Federal Communications Commission is in the process of dismantling regulation known as net neutrality, which prevents providers — like AT&T — from throttling the traffic of other programmers. The telecom company and others like it could give its own TV shows and movies priority over other content. The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, who earlier remarked that he planned to take a weed whacker to previous statutes, is also lifting a ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV stations in the same market and making it easier for broadcasters to gobble up peers. The Trump administration and tight coordination of policy are hardly synonymous, so it’s not surprising that watchdogs are roaming all over the field. It stands in contrast to President Barack Obama’s tenure, when the F.C.C. and the Justice Department looked to the same lodestar for guidance on competition. The commission ushered in net neutrality rules that played a part in the Justice Department’s harsh view of Comcast’s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable. Under Mr. Trump, though, the confused approach makes for a blurry regulatory picture. "
"In 2010, Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency, bought a controlling interest in Uranium One, a Canadian-based company that owned valuable extraction rights in Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia. These three countries are the world’s largest uranium producers, and Russia’s acquisition of those rights served its ambitions to build and fuel nuclear power plants around the world. In an ancillary part of the deal, Rosatom also bought mining rights in the United States, where uranium production is sparse. These rights were initially estimated to represent 20 percent of American production, but in practice, this figure has averaged less than 10 percent. Overall, Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One transferred control of what now amounts to about 8 percent of world uranium output. The American portion represented about one-thirtieth of the deal. At the time, none of this was considered remarkable or controversial. The governments of Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia approved the transfer as a normal commercial transaction. Similarly, the United States’ part of the deal was authorized by a panel of officials from nine federal agencies — including the State Department, then led by Hillary Clinton. But in 2016, in the run-up to the presidential campaign, the sale became notorious. A growing chorus of Trump supporters claimed that the sale didn’t happen for business reasons, but in exchange for millions in donations by people associated with Uranium One to the Clinton Foundation, led by Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton. The allegation appeared in a 2015 book, “Clinton Cash,” by Peter Schweizer, a collaborator of Steve Bannon, then head of Breitbart News and later Donald Trump’s chief strategist. Mainstream news organizations, including The New York Times, investigated the deal, and it became the subject of near daily attacks from Breitbart News itself. At campaign rallies, Mr. Trump routinely led chants of “Lock her up” in reference to Mrs. Clinton. Now Mr. Trump, whose campaign is under investigation by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, for possibly collaborating with Russia to manipulate voters last year, is calling once more for an investigation of the deal. In response, the Justice Department is examining whether to assign a special counsel to review the case. Two Republican-led congressional committees have also started investigations. "
"The Federal Communications Commission released a plan on Tuesday to dismantle landmark regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites. The proposal, made by the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, is a sweeping repeal of rules put in place by the Obama administration. The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services. The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points. “Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” Mr. Pai said in a statement. “Instead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them.” Mr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14. The two other Republicans on the commission generally vote with Mr. Pai, giving them a majority over the two Democrats. Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington — and directly to the public — as they did when the current rules were adopted. "
"WASHINGTON — United States officials have tried in recent weeks to cool tensions over the North American Free Trade Agreement by extending the timetable for renegotiating the pact and asking top officials to sit out the current round of talks in Mexico City. But as the fifth round of talks concluded in the Mexican capital on Tuesday, tensions were still simmering, with Canada and Mexico telling the United States that it would make little headway with its current approach and Mexico firing its first warning shot with a tough counterproposal. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, took aim at his Canadian and Mexican counterparts on Tuesday, saying “thus far, we have seen no evidence that Canada or Mexico are willing to seriously engage on provisions that will lead to a rebalanced agreement. Absent rebalancing, we will not reach a satisfactory result.” Mr. Lighthizer said while some progress has been made to modernize Nafta, “I remain concerned about the lack of headway. Our teams will be meeting again next month in Washington. I hope our partners will come to the table in a serious way so we can see meaningful progress before the end of the year.” In an indication of how far the talks have to go, Mr. Lighthizer will not meet again with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts until late January in Montreal, while lower-level negotiators will continue to hash out details in Washington next month. During a week of meetings in Mexico City, negotiators hammered out more technical details of the sweeping trade agreement, including those that govern digital trade, telecommunications, anti-corruption, customs procedures and health and safety standards for food.

"The police in Germany arrested six Syrian migrants on Tuesday, suspected of plotting an attack and having links to the Islamic State, fanning fears that extremists posing as refugees were targeting Europe. Millions of refugees, buffeted by conflict and civil war, have streamed into Europe in recent years, including an estimated one million who came to Germany in 2015. But while many Germans initially welcomed Chancellor Angela Merkel’s embrace of the refugees, viewing it as a powerful emblem of openness and liberalism, a backlash has been simmering after a spate of attacks across the continent. Germans have dark memories of an attack in December, when Anis Amri, a Tunisian who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, hijacked a truck and plowed through a  Christmas market in central Berlin, killing at least a dozen people. On Tuesday, Christian Hartwig, a spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office, said that 500 police officers had stormed eight apartments in the German cities of Essen, Hanover, Kassel and Leipzig in early morning raids, and arrested the suspects. The men, ages 20 to 28, had been posing as refugees, Mr. Hartwig said. He said the men were suspected of acting on behalf of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and were planning an attack using weapons or explosives. They had arrived in Germany between December 2014 and September 2015, he added, a period when millions of refugees were heading to Europe. All six had applied for asylum, though Mr. Hartwig did not say if they had been granted that status. The German newspaper Die Welt said that several cellphones, laptops and documents had been seized during the raids. It said that the suspects had arrived in Germany using fake identity papers and that the arrests had followed a tip from other refugees. "
"WASHINGTON — For two decades, Representative Dana Rohrabacher has been of value to the Kremlin, so valuable in recent years that the F.B.I. warned him in 2012 that Russia regarded him as an intelligence source worthy of a Kremlin code name. The following year, the California Republican became even more valuable, assuming the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee that oversees Russia policy. He sailed to re-election again and again, even as he developed ties to Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia. Then came President Trump. As revelations of Russia’s campaign to influence American politics consume Washington, Mr. Rohrabacher, 70, who had no known role in the Trump election campaign, has come under political and investigative scrutiny. The F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee are each seeking to interview him about an August meeting with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Rohrabacher said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s short-lived national security adviser. At the same time, fellow Republicans — questioning his judgment and intentions — have moved to curtail his power as chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats. And back home in Southern California, where Democrats and Republicans alike smell blood, the 15-term congressman is facing his toughest re-election contest in decades, with well-funded candidates from both parties lining up to unseat him. “I feel like I’m in good shape politically,” he said breezily during an interview last week, a day before he voted against his party’s tax bill. “My constituents couldn’t care less about this. They are not concerned about Russia. They are concerned about the taxes on their home. They are concerned about illegal immigrants coming into their neighborhood and raping people.” Nor is Mr. Rohrabacher, a self-proclaimed veteran of international intrigue, all that perturbed by the interest of federal and congressional investigators. He said he would talk to them when scheduling allows. "
"WASHINGTON — An American military airstrike on Tuesday killed more than 100 people who were identified by the Pentagon as being affiliated with the Islamic militant group Shabab, continuing a stepped-up pace against targets in Somalia, officials said. The United States Africa Command said in a statement that the airstrike was carried out 125 miles northwest of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. The strike comes after President Trump relaxed restrictions on American military commanders in Somalia. Separately, the command also said that it conducted airstrikes in Libya, on Friday and Sunday, against Islamic State militants. Defense officials did not indicate how many people were killed in those attacks. The Trump administration has escalated its campaign to defeat the Shabab, the group responsible for the 2013 attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya. The siege on the upscale mall, where dozens were killed, heightened American concerns that the Shabab’s desire to inflict casualties extended beyond its base in Somalia. For more than a decade, the United States has been trying to fight the Shabab through economic sanctions, missile strikes and commando raids. In 2014, President Barack Obama increased lethal efforts against the extremist group, including an American drone strike that killed the leader of the Shabab, Ahmed Abdi Godane, one of the most wanted men in Africa at the time. But the organization has come back and continues to prove to be a potent and resilient killing force. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Thanking Russia for the military intervention he credited for “saving Syria,” President Bashar al-Assad met with President Vladimir V. Putin amid preparations for new talks aimed at ending the civil war. Mr. Assad’s visit on Monday to the Russian resort town of Sochi was made public on Tuesday, a day before a summit meeting there for the leaders of Iran, Turkey and Russia, who have taken an increasingly prominent role in diplomacy with Syria while the United States has put Mr. Assad’s fate on the back burner. Russian officials have said that their aim is to ensure Mr. Assad’s support for a political process to end a conflict that began more than six years ago. But Mr. Assad has consistently resisted compromise with his Syrian opponents, and doubts remain about how much Russia is willing, or able, to push him to accept significant changes like substantive power sharing or reforms. In another signal that political change in Syria is less and less an international priority, in a phone conversation with Mr. Putin on Tuesday that lasted more than an hour and was mostly about Syria, President Trump did not bring up the issue of political transition, an administration official said. Instead, the White House said the two leaders agreed on the importance of stability, ending the war, fighting terrorism and allowing refugees to go home. The declarations of military victory may also be premature: The Islamic State has lost much of its territory, but its fighters remain an insurgent threat and armed opposition groups still hold significant sections of the country. It was Mr. Assad’s second known trip abroad since the civil war in his country began in 2011; he visited  Moscow in 2015, soon after Russia began its pivotal air campaign in support of his forces. The Sochi stop came as his other main allies, Iran and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, declared that they had defeated the Islamic State in its last major Syrian stronghold, Bukamal, near the Iraqi border.

"BRUSSELS — The European Union has long had to deal with the challenge of being led by a dominant Germany. But suddenly it finds itself facing a different realization — the only thing worse than a strong Germany may be a weak one. Germany is hardly collapsing, but the failure of Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a coalition government presents a profound crisis of leadership for Europe and a protracted period of uncertainty, at a time when it can least afford it. Serious decisions on the eurozone, migration, asylum, defense and other issues — let alone negotiating Britain’s exit from the bloc — were already put off until after the French and German elections this year. Now they will be further delayed, waiting for plodding Germany to work through this new political quandary. The looming sense of paralysis is a credit to the stature Ms. Merkel has gained in 12 years as chancellor. She defined Europe’s response to the euro debt crisis. Along the way, she has borne criticism for German overweening. But she has also earned respect for her ability to forge compromise. She has been central in forcing through stiff sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, winning praise in Europe for standing up to both President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. "
"Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, made a relaxed appearance at New York University on Tuesday night, answering questions about her life in economics and her time at the Fed one day after she announced plans to leave the central bank next year. Ms. Yellen said nothing new about the Fed’s policy plans for the coming months, leaving unaltered the widespread expectation that the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-December. Instead, Ms. Yellen entertained the audience with her description of her first day at the Fed almost four years ago, and a firsthand report on the typical topics of conversation at her dinner table. “We do have a heavier dose of economics in our diet than some might find appetizing,” she said. Ms. Yellen announced Monday in a letter to President Trump that she would step down from the Fed’s board at the same time she ends her term as Fed chairwoman in early February. Mr. Trump has nominated Jerome H. Powell to succeed Ms. Yellen as the Fed’s chairman. On Tuesday, Ms. Yellen kept a longstanding engagement to be interviewed on a stage at the Stern School of Business by Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England. In one of her final public appearances as the Fed’s chairwoman, Ms. Yellen answered questions about policy in her trademark clear and steady style that has eliminated much of the guesswork that was once required to divine the Fed’s intentions.

"SEOUL, South Korea — Fully armed North Korean troops violated the truce that halted the 1950-53 Korean War when they fired weapons across the border last week while chasing a fellow Communist soldier defecting to South Korea, the United Nations Command said on Wednesday. One of the North Korean chasers briefly crossed the borderline before turning back in a hurry, another violation of the Korean War armistice, the command said. The American-led United Nations Command, which oversees the armistice, notified the North Korean People’s Army of its findings and demanded a meeting to discuss ways to prevent future violations, the command said in a statement. The command also released closed-circuit television footage that illustrated the North Korean’s dramatic defection through the Joint Security Area north of Seoul, the South Korean capital, on Nov. 13. It was a close escape for the soldier, who bolted toward the border line just yards ahead of former comrades who had started to shoot. At the signing of the Korean War armistice, a 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone, or DMZ, was created to keep the warring sides apart, and the heavily guarded Joint Security Area serves as the only point along the DMZ where troops from both sides face off, separated by only a few feet. They could also meet there to discuss enforcing the truce. According to the footage, the defector sped a drab, olive-colored military jeep along a tree-lined road and into the Joint Security Area after crossing a North Korean landmark known as the 72-Hour Bridge.

"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is investigating whether three service members assigned to the White House broke curfew and had improper contact with foreign women while traveling this month with President Trump in Asia, Defense Department officials said Tuesday. The three service members, all assigned to the White House Communications Agency as part of a military unit that sets up secure communications for the president, have been reassigned pending the investigation, the officials said. The allegations of improper contact were first reported by The Washington Post. Laura Seal, a Pentagon spokeswoman, confirmed the investigation. The communications agency serves as a unit dedicated to providing both routine and emergency communications for the president, wherever he may be. The allegations come three months after four service members from the same agency were accused of consorting with foreign women after-hours in a secure area in Panama, as they prepared for a visit there by Vice President Mike Pence. Those service members were flown home before Mr. Pence arrived. "
"David Cassidy, the actor, singer and teen heartthrob best known as the band member with the green eyes and the feathered haircut on “The Partridge Family,” the 1970s television show about a family band, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 67. His publicist, Jo-Ann Geffen, said the cause was liver failure. Mr. Cassidy, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, had recently been admitted to the hospital in critical condition. Mr. Cassidy rose to fame on “The Partridge Family” playing Keith Partridge, the eldest of five children in a family that forms a band and goes on tour in a multicolored bus. His character, a high school student, was swooned over by young women as he learned to navigate his newfound fame. It was 1970, with the turbulent late 1960s of the Vietnam War, race riots, psychedelia, Woodstock and Altamont barely past, when Mr. Cassidy got the lead role on the show. “The Partridge Family” was produced by Screen Gems, which had also been the company behind “The Monkees,” another sitcom about a pop band, which had its own heartthrob in Davy Jones. Mr. Cassidy had a face youthful enough to portray a teenager, a shy smile and friendly eyes, and he could sing well enough to portray Keith Partridge without having to lip-sync someone else’s voice. Even in the FM-radio heyday of Black Sabbath, the Allman Brothers and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, there was a place for a well-groomed, unthreatening young pop singer. Mr. Cassidy became one of the teen idols of the early 1970s, arriving between Bobby Sherman and Donny Osmond and decades before Justin Timberlake or Charlie Puth. He was marketed through Top 40 radio and fan magazines as a wholesome fantasy figure for girls. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump broke with leading Republicans on Tuesday and voiced support for Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama who has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers and has seen his campaign’s prospects imperiled. In his first extensive remarks on the accusations that date back decades, the president cited the vigorous denials by Mr. Moore, who is facing off in a high-stakes special election against Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate. “He totally denies it,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Moore, who has been accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl and sexually assaulting another teenager. Mr. Trump also said he was “very happy” that women in the United States are now coming forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against lawmakers and media figures, many of them Democrats. Asked by a reporter about whether electing “a child molester” was better than electing a Democrat in the Alabama race, Mr. Trump responded by insisting that Mr. Moore denies the charges against him. “He says it didn’t happen,” the president told reporters at the White House. “You have to listen to him, also.” "
"In a matter of hours this week, the Trump administration twice weighed in on one of the central issues shaping business and society today — just how much market power big companies should be allowed to amass. Yet in back-to-back developments, two federal agencies arrived at starkly different conclusions, and one company, AT&T, found itself on opposite sides of the debate. On Monday, the Department of Justice sued to block AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, a deal that would unite one of the country’s biggest internet providers with the company that owns CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. film studio. It was a signal from antitrust enforcers that an era of breakneck consolidation might be coming to an end, and that mergers would be evaluated by a new set of standards. Then on Tuesday morning, the Federal Communications Commission announced plans to dismantle net neutrality rules. The move would let companies charge higher fees and block access to some websites, and was effectively a green light for big internet service providers — including AT&T — to freely wield their influence against rivals. In each development, there are signs that the Trump administration is trying to reckon with a media and telecommunications industry that has become intensely concentrated in recent years; most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies. But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain in the future. "
"WASHINGTON — A second federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s proposed ban on transgender troops Tuesday, saying President Trump’s announcement of the ban in a series of tweets this summer was “capricious, arbitrary, and unqualified.” In a preliminary injunction, Judge Marvin J. Garbis of the Federal District Court for Maryland halted a policy that would have discharged all current transgender troops and barred prospective ones from enlisting, saying it likely violated equal protection provisions of the Constitution. Judge Garbis’s 53-page order went further than a similar ruling last month by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, which also said the ban likely violated the Constitution. “There is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender people would have any negative effective on the military at all,” the ruling said. But while Judge Kollar-Kotelly did not specifically block a Trump administration policy prohibiting gender-reassignment surgery for service members at the government’s expense, Judge Garbis’s order does. The ruling leaves in place an Obama-era policy, announced in 2016, that allows transgender troops to serve openly and receive the required medical care for their gender transition through the military. Shortly after the ruling the Trump administration appealed last month’s decision, signaling it would continue to press for the removal of transgender troops. In July, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the military could not afford the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” of transgender troops, and that the government “will not accept or allow them to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” A presidential memorandum released in August said all transgender service troops would be discharged.

"Fox News’s prime time has tilted Trump-ward this year, adding the talk-radio personality Laura Ingraham to the White House-friendly lineup of Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. On Tuesday, the network announced that another hard-line conservative is set to join its ranks: Mark Levin, one of the country’s most prominent right-wing radio hosts, who will host a weekly Sunday show starting in February. Mr. Levin is an influential figure in conservative circles whose radio show is syndicated on more than 300 stations. He rivals his fellow talk-radio hosts, Mr. Hannity and Ms. Ingraham, in audience size, but not in name recognition, a situation that could change with his new perch on Fox News. A champion of tea party politics who also served in the Ronald Reagan administration, Mr. Levin is an idiosyncratic conservative who, in the midst of last year’s Republican primary, declared that he would never vote for Donald J. Trump. By last September, he changed his mind, and in an interview on Tuesday, he acknowledged that he recently visited the president in the Oval Office. “It was very positive, very friendly,” Mr. Levin said of his conversation with Mr. Trump. “No plotting or planning or conspiracy theories of any sort.” Although Mr. Levin may fly below the radar of many liberals, he was in the news in March when he informed radio listeners about a “big scandal”: that President Obama had wiretapped Mr. Trump’s campaign. There was no evidence supporting that claim, but Mr. Trump picked up on it anyway, accusing Mr. Obama of spying on him and setting off a political storm. Speaking by phone on Tuesday from Virginia, where he is based, Mr. Levin spoke admiringly, if wryly, about Mr. Trump. “I don’t wed myself or tie myself to any particular politician,” Mr. Levin said. “On the other hand, I don’t see my role as trying to sabotage the president, either.” Mr. Levin said he had visited the White House at the invitation of Vice President Mike Pence, a longtime friend. “It was a social lunch,” he said, “and then I was told that the president would like to say hello.” His Fox News program, “Life, Liberty & Levin,” will involve “in-depth interviews with people of consequence — some of them will be prominent, some of them won’t be,” Mr. Levin said. “I want to cover history and philosophy and politics and economics, and of course, emphasize Americanism: our founding principles, our constitution and the Declaration of Independence.” Like Ms. Ingraham and Mr. Hannity, Mr. Levin plans to continue his daily radio duties. Asked if he ever expected to host a Fox News show, Mr. Levin said, “I never really envisioned it.” “I just try and do the best I can at what I’m doing,” Mr. Levin added. “That said, I think it’s a wonderful opportunity, for me and for them.” "
"Very few criminal prosecutions in New York have likely drawn as much public criticism from a foreign leader as that of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was charged along with eight other defendants with conspiring to evade the United States sanctions on Iran. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called the charges a plot against the Turkish Republic, and raised the issue in a phone call with President Trump in September. Turkey’s foreign minister claimed that the prosecution’s evidence was concocted by Gulenists, a movement led by an Islamic cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania; the movement has been banned in Turkey as a terrorist group and blamed by Mr. Erdogan for the failed coup in 2016. On Saturday, Turkey opened an investigation of Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan whose office filed the original charges, and of his successor, Joon H. Kim, who is overseeing a trial in the case that starts next week. On Tuesday, Mr. Kim and the judge, Richard M. Berman, took the unusual step of responding publicly to the Turkish officials’ criticism. Mr. Kim, the acting United States attorney, said he was aware of claims that the prosecution was “being driven by domestic Turkish politics” and that his office, the Justice Department and the court had been “infiltrated by Gulenists.” “Needless to say, it’s our view that those claims are ridiculous on their face,” Mr. Kim said. He added, “It displays a fundamental misunderstanding or lack of understanding of how our system of justice works and, frankly, the rule of law works.” "
"The Trump administration’s lawsuit to block AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner not only threatens an enormous corporate deal. It also has ignited a guessing game on Wall Street about whether the booming market for mergers and acquisitions is about to be derailed. Roughly $2.78 trillion worth of deals have been announced worldwide so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters. While that is down 2.7 percent from the same period last year, 2017 ranks as the third-best year for mergers over the past decade. But the Justice Department’s lawsuit on Monday to block the $85.4 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal could rapidly cool the deal-making climate. The fundamental question is this: Is the lawsuit taking aim at one particular transaction, or is it a signal that the White House is opposed to corporate consolidation in general? After all, President Trump specifically denounced the deal on the campaign trail last year. “Is it idiosyncratic, or a different perspective on what the regulatory framework to going to be? We don’t know yet,” said Blair Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a boutique bank that has been an adviser on many deals this year. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump weighed in again on the deal. “Personally, I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not good for the country,” he said outside the White House. “I think your pricing is going to go up.” Nobody expects the lawsuit to shut off the deals spigot. Big companies still have reasons aplenty to pursue mergers and acquisitions — not least, the rapid, technology-fueled transformations of many industries — and the possibility of government opposition is just one factor influencing their decisions. “This event does not eliminate the need for transformational events or scale in these industries,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, the founder of the investment bank LionTree and an adviser on media deals. Yet Mr. Bourkoff and others said the specter of government opposition to mergers had begun to weigh on deal makers’ minds. Investment bankers said they were especially wary of mergers that affected big consumer brands or could lead to job losses. The Justice Department lawsuit, Mr. Bourkoff said, “has created a heightened level of uncertainty in the deal environment.” Few, for example, believe that Comcast — which is in discussions to buy significant portions of 21st Century Fox — would be allowed to complete that potential deal unless the Justice Department was defeated in its AT&T lawsuit. In its suit, Justice Department lawyers argued that AT&T would amass enough power by acquiring Time Warner to undermine competitors and raise prices for consumers. But on a conference call on Monday, a Justice Department official argued that the regulator was not reflexively opposed to so-called vertical mergers, which combine companies from two different industries, as a union of AT&T and Time Warner would do. Mr. Effron said there still were more compelling reasons to pursue mergers than not. But, he added, there is now a greater need to “factor in the downside.” "
"It was just a month ago this Friday that Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican, rose in the Senate to insist that we “must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue,” laying a hefty share of the blame for it on “the tone set up at the top.” He used those remarks to condemn President Trump for “the daily sundering of our country.” He lashed out at the president’s “flagrant disregard for truth and decency” and uttered the syllables “enough.” It was some speech. And if he follows it by handing Trump a victory on tax reform, it was merely that: words. Pretty, yes. But pointless in the end. The House of Representatives has already approved its own legislation to overhaul the nation’s tax code. The Senate’s version could come to a vote as soon as next week. No Democrat in the chamber supports it, so the G.O.P. can afford to lose only two members of its caucus. Along with the votes of a few other Republicans, Flake’s is in doubt, and that colored another chapter of feuding between him and the president over recent days. Flake attended a town hall in Arizona and, apparently unaware that his microphone was still on, said that if Republicans “become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast.” Trump took this in customary stride, which is to say that he fired up his Twitter account and mocked “Sen. Jeff Flake(y),” who, he predicted, would “be a NO on tax cuts.” Flake responded that he had not made up his mind. "
"SPOKANE, Wash. — Six years ago, a police officer in this city in eastern Washington was convicted of beating a disabled man to death and trying to cover it up. After other alarming episodes involving Spokane officers came to light, the city asked federal officials to suggest changes to the police department as part of an Obama-era policing program. Ever since, use of force by officers has declined, as have complaints from residents. “It is a great program,” said Craig Meidl, the Spokane police chief. “As a C.E.O. of a law enforcement organization, you’ll appreciate having an outsider come in and give you advice.” But in September, the Justice Department announced it would significantly scale back the program, known as the collaborative reform initiative, and reorient it toward more hands-off “technical assistance.” The decision to soften what was already a voluntary program was aligned with the Trump administration’s general approach to law enforcement — cracking down on violent crime, not regulating the police departments that fight it. The changes to collaborative reform reflect the administration’s broader effort to overhaul programs that the Obama administration used to ease tensions between communities and the police, according to interviews with current and former law enforcement officials and documents obtained through freedom of information laws. Since President Trump took office, for example, the Justice Department has not entered into a single court-monitored consent decree with a troubled police department, even in towns with widespread constitutional violations, records show. It has also ordered reviews of existing consent decrees — which are a tougher, more punitive alternative to the collaborative reform initiative — negotiated under President Barack Obama’s Justice Department. The changes, designed to ease pressure on law enforcement, have actually encountered some resistance from police chiefs in cities that participated in the programs. And those chiefs work not only in big-city Democratic strongholds, but also in places like Spokane, which has a Republican mayor and is the largest city in a county that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The F.C.C. unveiled a plan to repeal net neutrality rules, which require broadband providers to give consumers equal access to all content on the web. The F.C.C. chairman appointed by President Trump, Ajit Pai, above, said the change would allow the government to stop “micromanaging the internet.” It’s expected to be approved on Dec. 14 in a party-line vote by the agency’s five commissioners. But some companies will probably put up a legal fight to prevent it from taking hold. This video explains how net neutrality works. In other business news, Uber announced that hackers gained access to the personal data of 57 million drivers and riders — and the company kept it a secret for a year. It has since fired its top security executive. "
"(Updated: On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal net neutrality, rules that regulated the businesses that connect consumers to the internet.) For you and me, the repeal of net neutrality can be boiled down to two questions: What might happen? And whom do you trust? Here’s our guide for internet users looking for answers. The net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 during the Obama administration when Democrats controlled the F.C.C. The goal was to adapt regulations in such a way as to acknowledge the essential role of high-speed internet access as a gateway to modern communication, information, entertainment and economic opportunity. So the F.C.C. opted to regulate broadband service as a utility — making the internet the digital equivalent of electricity and the telephone. The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast have argued that utility-style regulation represents unnecessary government meddling that will reduce their incentives to invest and improve service. The result, they say, will be worse service for everyone in the long run. The biggest concern is that the internet will become pay-to-play technology with two tiers: one that has speedy service and one that doesn’t. The high-speed lane would be occupied by big internet and media companies, and affluent households. For everyone else there would be the slow lane. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is threatening to sue Harvard University to force it to turn over student and applicant records, as the Justice Department presses forward with an unusual civil rights investigation into whether the university’s affirmative-action admissions practices amount to unlawful discrimination, documents show. The investigation, which came to light in August, centers on a complaint filed in 2015 asserting that Harvard, in seeking to ensure a racially diverse student body, is illegally discriminating against Asian applicants. It mirrors the allegations in a lawsuit against Harvard filed by a group called Students for Fair Admissions, a nonprofit formed to challenge the use of race in college admissions. In August, the Justice Department set up a special project in its Civil Rights Division — run out of its front office, where political appointees work, rather than its education section — to scrutinize race-conscious college admissions practices. After initially refusing to talk about it, the department said it was looking at a complaint filed on behalf of Asian applicants, describing it in a way that clearly matched the Harvard dispute. Letters that emerged Tuesday between Civil Rights Division officials and Seth P. Waxman, a former solicitor general who is representing Harvard, show that little has progressed since then because of an impasse over access to Harvard’s applicant records. In a letter to Mr. Waxman last week, John M. Gore, the acting assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, accused Harvard of dragging its feet on turning over the material and threatened to sue if the university failed to meet a Dec. 1 deadline. “More than two months have passed since our September meeting, and Harvard has not yet produced a single document,” Mr. Gore wrote. “We sincerely hope that Harvard will quickly correct its noncompliance and return to its collaborative approach.” "
"WASHINGTON — It began with a familiar pledge: President Trump’s audience, he promised, was going to be very proud of him. “Hi, Drumstick,” Mr. Trump called out on Tuesday, preparing to exercise his least controversial executive authority. “Oh, Drumstick, I think, is going to be very happy.” It ended with characteristic introspection. “I feel so good about myself,” the president said softly, appraising his own clemency, laying a hand on the bird after seeking permission to touch it from turkey professionals. Mr. Trump looked upon the crowd in the Rose Garden and announced his decision: The animal was hereby pardoned for the crime of being born a turkey. Such was Mr. Trump’s inaugural take on a Washington tradition that seems to exist mostly because it existed the year before, a sort of “Apprentice” for the long-necked set, superimposed on the White House for a statelier feel. “Very special people, a very special country,” Mr. Trump summarized, a bit mechanically, before heading off to Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday. "
"WASHINGTON — Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, moved swiftly on Tuesday against the House’s longest-serving lawmaker, calling for the House Ethics Committee to investigate sexual harassment charges against Representative John Conyers Jr., the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Conyers, 88, who has represented parts of the Detroit area in the House since 1965, confirmed the settlement of a wrongful termination complaint in 2015 from a staff member who had accused him of sexual harassment. But he denied that the staff member was fired for refusing to have sex with him. The settlement was first reported by BuzzFeed News on Monday. Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats on the Judiciary Committee offered little support, and the Ethics Committee said it had opened an investigation. “Any credible allegation of sexual harassment must be investigated by the Ethics Committee,” Ms. Pelosi said, adding that there should be “zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, bullying or abuse in the House.” President Trump weighed in on the widening sexual harassment scandal on Capitol Hill, saying that Congress should release the names of lawmakers who have settled harassment claims. The president has himself been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, including harassment and assault, and has called his accusers liars. But on Tuesday, he praised women for speaking out. “Women are very special. I think it’s a very special time because a lot of things are coming out, and I think that’s good for our society, and I think it’s very, very good for women,” Mr. Trump said. “And I’m very happy a lot of these things are coming out, and I’m very happy it’s being exposed.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump will soon have to decide whether to impose the types of tariffs on imported products that he has long championed after a federal body again recommended stiff levies, this time on foreign-made washing machines. The United States International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial body that rules on trade cases, unanimously recommended that the president take action to limit imports of washers, a move that could help the domestic manufacturer Whirlpool better compete with its foreign rivals Samsung and LG. The trade officials recommended that the United States impose what is known as a “tariff-rate quota” — a tax on imports that would go into effect after a certain number of foreign products entered the American market. In this case, they recommended that the United States impose a tariff starting at 50 percent on all washers imported after the first 1.2 million units for the next three years, with the tariff rate to decrease slightly in the next few years. Two of the four commissioners issuing the decision also recommended an additional charge. The trade body will submit its recommendations on Dec. 5 to Mr. Trump, who will have to make a final decision by February. A decision to impose tariffs could further exacerbate trade tensions with South Korea, which is home to Samsung and LG. While South Korea has typically been a strong economic and strategic partner of the United States, particularly in dealing with North Korea, Mr. Trump has taken a more antagonistic approach to a foreign ally. South Korean officials said they would wait to see whether the result would breach the rules of the World Trade Organization. “We will make our best effort along with the industry to ensure that the final decision minimizes damage to Korean companies by reaching out to the U.S. administration, Congress, local governments and other officials to proactively explain our position,” said Kang Sung-cheon, the country’s deputy minister of trade.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Robert Mugabe — who once proclaimed that “Only God will remove me!” — resigned as president of Zimbabwe shortly after lawmakers started impeachment proceedings. Jubilant residents poured into the streets at what seemed to be an abrupt capitulation from the world’s longest-serving head of state. Mr. Mugabe, 93, said he was stepping down for “the welfare of the people.” Zimbabwe will have a new leader for the first time in 37 years. This video looks at the mix of hope and skepticism its people have about the future. _____ • The U.S. authorities are holding a former Hong Kong government official and a former foreign minister of Senegal on charges of bribing high-level officials in Chad and Uganda. Prosecutors said the money was meant to secure contracts for a mysterious, private Chinese conglomerate, CEFC China Energy, which has global ambitions and enormous wealth. "
"The Trump administration is making it harder to find government information about climate change on the web. If you searched Google for the words “climate change” a little over six months ago, one of the first hits would have been the Environmental Protection Agency’s website. But that was before April 28, when the agency began systematically dismantling its climate change website, which had survived Democratic and Republican administrations and was a leading source of information on a global problem that the president, as a candidate, labeled “a hoax.” If you search those words today, a link to the E.P.A. site may not appear until the second or third search results page, and sometimes not even then, depending on your browser settings. The site has fallen in Google’s search results because its address, or URL, no longer directs you to the climate change site or a related page. If you click that link, you’ll be redirected to a notice page that says, “We are currently updating our website to reflect E.P.A.’s priorities under the leadership” of President Trump and Scott Pruitt, the agency’s administrator. That page, in turn, contains a link to an archived version of the E.P.A.’s website. Well, you might think, at least the old site has been preserved. But the archive is far from complete. A significant number of pages and PDFs are not available, and entire portions of the site, like the Student’s Guide to Global Climate Change, have been left out. Some of these pages and PDFs can no longer be found anywhere within the government’s web presence. The E.P.A. climate-related web pages that are still live continue to provide valuable information, but many links from those pages to other pages have been removed. And now-broken links that previously led to the E.P.A. climate change pages are scattered across federal and nonfederal websites. Since January, our organization, the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, has monitored changes to tens of thousands of web pages across federal agencies. While we haven’t found examples of altered data, it is clear that the administration is intent on making it difficult or impossible to find information on its web pages about climate change. "
"WASHINGTON — Since getting crushed by the recession a decade ago, the state of Oregon has been on an economic upswing. The jobless rate has dipped below 4 percent from a high of 12 percent in 2009, home values are up and people are flocking to the state. Net migration accounted for roughly 88 percent of Oregon’s population growth between 2016 and 2017, according to a Portland State University study. But state officials worry that all the economic progress is about to be undercut by the $1.5 trillion Republican tax plan sailing through Congress. While lawmakers say the plan will boost growth and strengthen the economy, Oregon officials say the bill could have the opposite effect by making the state a less affordable place to live and putting a squeeze on state and local budgets. “What I am concerned about is that this will impede our forward momentum,” Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said in an interview. “This tax plan will basically burst the balloon that’s happening here.” Oregon is not alone in its concerns. State and local officials in other high-tax, largely blue states like New York, New Jersey and California are warning the tax plan will strain budgets, shake real estate markets and prompt residents to flee expensive coastal states for places with lower taxes. Of primary concern is the Senate’s plan to repeal the state and local tax deduction, which currently allows people who itemize their tax returns to deduct state and local income, sales and property taxes paid. The tax break is claimed by people across the nation, but is more heavily utilized in higher-tax states like Oregon, California, New Jersey and New York. Eliminating the deduction has long been a goal of many Republican lawmakers, who view the tax break as a subsidy that poorer red states provide to richer blue ones that spend heavily on government services.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise its benchmark interest rate in December despite the concerns of some Fed officials about the persistent weakness of inflation, according to an account of the Fed’s most recent policy meeting. The account, which the Fed published Wednesday, described officials as united in confusion about the reasons that inflation is weak but divided about the consequences. While some officials favored watching and waiting, a majority of Fed officials — including the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen — have made clear that they are inclined to keep raising the Fed’s benchmark rate. At the two-day meeting that ended Nov. 1, those officials were “reasonably confident that the economy and inflation would evolve in coming months such that an additional firming would likely be appropriate in the near term,” the Fed said. The group made no changes to monetary policy at the meeting; it had signaled in advance of the meeting that it would not act before December. It left its benchmark rate in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent, and did not alter the instructions for the gradual reduction of its $4 trillion portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds now underway. But the meeting account, released after a standard three-week delay, is likely to solidify investor expectations that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point at the December meeting. The continued debate about the weakness of inflation has divided officials into two broad camps. Most, including Ms. Yellen, regard slow inflation as somewhat mysterious but not a cause for great concern because they expect tightening labor market conditions to eventually drive up prices. As a result, they want to keep raising interest rates at a gradual pace. "
"The announcement came on his television show, “The Apprentice.” Donald J. Trump would open his second luxury hotel in New York, a “work of art” in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan that would become “an awe-inspiring masterpiece.” That was 11 years ago. The 46-story skyscraper, it turned out, was actually an albatross for Mr. Trump — drawing local opposition soon after its unveiling, partisan protests when he became a candidate for president and political scrutiny because of its early ties to a dubious Russian deal maker. Now, in the latest sign of strain in the president’s family business, the Trumps want no more. The Trump Organization has reached a deal that will allow the company to exit the property by the end of next month, the company said Wednesday. It is the second time this year the Trump name was erased from a hotel development, after a June announcement in Toronto. Located in an upscale neighborhood in a deeply Democratic city, the SoHo hotel has struggled to attract guests at five-star prices and has dropped its rates to keep rooms occupied. The property also includes condominiums that have been slow to sell. And when the building’s main restaurant decided to close in April, a lawyer for the restaurant attributed it to a decline in business “since the election.” Under the exit deal, the Trump Organization will sever its contract with the building’s owner, an investment firm in California that focuses primarily on real estate. As with many of their properties, the Trumps do not own the SoHo hotel, but instead manage the day-to-day operations. The Trump Organization is entitled to a cut of the hotel’s revenue, although the contract also requires the Trumps to pay the owner, CIM Group, if the property fails to meet certain financial performance standards. With years remaining on the contract, CIM will pay the Trumps to end the arrangement early, according to people briefed on the matter, who described the negotiations as amicable. A buyout enables CIM to either rebrand the property, or to buy more condo units and expand the hotel before eventually selling it. The company did not disclose the proposed price of a buyout. "
"IF WISHES WERE BOOKS: It’s holiday time. So in keeping with a loose tradition at Inside the List, I asked a handful of best-selling authors to talk up their favorite reads of 2017, old or new. Granted, not everybody will find a limited 1909 edition of “Gulliver’s Travels.” But we can wish. Jacqueline Woodson, author of “Brown Girl Dreaming”: As someone who doesn’t read a lot of nonfiction, I was pleasantly surprised by David Friend’s “The Naughty Nineties” — basically a sexual history of that decade (and a guidebook for this one!). Friend brings us right back to all the amazing drama of that time: from Clinton and Lewinsky to Lorena Bobbitt to O. J. Simpson. It’s funny, scandalous, whip-smart and infinitely readable. Celeste Ng, author of “Little Fires Everywhere”: In a year that made me furious, Daisy Johnson’s “Fen” was a howl I didn’t know I needed. This linked collection takes place in the marshes, where things that some might wish to keep hidden refuse to stay buried, and resurface in unexpected ways. It’s hauntingly written and full of unabashedly, refreshingly angry women who are hungry — both figuratively and literally — for things long denied them. Kurt Andersen, author of “Fantasyland” and (with Alec Baldwin) “You Can’t Spell America Without Me”: In college, I couldn’t get through Hannah Arendt’s “The Origins of Totalitarianism”; it just didn’t seem applicable to modern America. In this first year of President Trump I finally read its third and final part, “Totalitarianism.” The contemporary relevance is uncanny. “Leaders … could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had all known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.” Neil de Grasse Tyson, author of “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry”: This year I obtained a copy of Jonathan Swift’s 1726 classic “Gulliver’s Travels,” illustrated and signed by Arthur Rackham, in a limited 1909 edition. Most of us know this satire from childhood, via cartoons. But those tend to focus only on Lemuel Gulliver’s voyage to Lilliput, the land of little people, where the animations hardly ever portray how Gulliver actually put out the fire in town — by urinating on the flaming buildings. A possible comment on what big people do to little people, even on the premise of helping them. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.N. Command is demanding to meet with officials of the North Korean People’s Army, accusing its troops of violating the truce that halted the Korean War when they fired on and chased a defecting comrade across the border last week. South Korean cameras recorded the escape. And North Korea called the Trump administration’s imposition of new punishments — restoring the North to the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors and yet more sanctions — a “serious provocation.” In the U.S., the death of an American who had been held in harsh conditions by the North in 2010 raised concerns that he had committed suicide. _____ • Security forces in Papua New Guinea stormed a controversial detention center on Manus Island, in an attempt to end a standoff that has drawn international scrutiny to Australia’s refugee policy.

"To the Editor: Re “Bucking National Party, Trump Defends Moore” (front page, Nov. 22): After granting pardons to two turkeys for Thanksgiving, President Trump proceeded to “pardon” Roy Moore. Mr. Trump defended the Senate candidate by saying Mr. Moore had denied the sex charges against him. In effect, Mr. Trump took Mr. Moore’s word over the word of several women accusing him. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump defended Vladimir Putin by saying he was sincere in his denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Our president took the word of the Russian autocrat over the findings of America’s intelligence agencies. Mr. President, you may believe both Roy Moore and Vladimir Putin. But pardon us, sir, if more and more Americans don’t believe in you. FRANK RICHTER, CLAWSON, MICH. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Two days after President Trump re-designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, the country responded on Wednesday by calling the decision “a serious provocation” and vowed to keep up its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against the “hostile” United States. “The U.S., the kingpin of all kinds of terrorism who cannot even prevent terror in its own territory, is acting like an ‘international judge on terrorism’ while attaching or removing the label of ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ on sovereign countries,” a spokesman of the North’s Foreign Ministry told its official Korean Central News Agency. “This is a serious provocation and a violent infringement upon our dignified country.” The comments were North Korea’s first official reaction to Mr. Trump’s decision on Monday to restore the country to Washington’s list of terrorism-sponsoring states, along with Iran, Sudan and Syria. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department announced a new round of sanctions to impede the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, targeting North Korean companies and ships as well as Chinese trading companies. The re-listing raised fears in the region that North Korea might take it as an excuse to resume weapons tests. It last launched a missile on Sept. 15. On Wednesday, the unidentified North Korean spokesman did not mention any direct threat to launch missiles. But he said that the North’s “deterrence will be further strengthened” — and that the country “must continue to keep the treasured nuclear sword in our hands more tightly” — as long as Washington continued with its “hostile policy” against the North. He said that the re-designation reflected Washington’s “intention to destroy our ideology and system,” and that its army and people were “hardening their will to settle all accounts with those gangsters at any time in any way.” "
"A man who was freed from North Korean imprisonment in 2010 after former President Jimmy Carter interceded was found dead in San Diego last week. The authorities were notified by a witness that the man, Aijalon M. Gomes, 38, had been seen on fire in a field off the Pacific Highway late on Friday. An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer stopped to help him, and the San Diego Fire Rescue responded to a dispatch call, but Mr. Gomes, who had recently moved to San Diego from Boston, was pronounced dead at the scene. The San Diego Police said in a statement on Tuesday that they believed Mr. Gomes’s death had been either an accident or a suicide. A police spokesman, Billy Hernandez, said the cause of the fire was still under investigation. In April 2010, Mr. Gomes was sentenced to eight years of hard labor in a North Korean prison for crossing into the country illegally. Mr. Carter made a special visit to Pyongyang, the country’s capital, to negotiate for his release in August of that year. Mr. Gomes is the second American to have died this year after having been imprisoned in North Korea. Otto Warmbier, an American college student, died in June, a week after he was released in a vegetative state. A coroner determined in September that he had suffered extensive brain damage after his circulation was cut off. "
"At the start of Spike Lee’s 1986 breakthrough debut, “She’s Gotta Have It,” the artist Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) sits up in bed, filmed in cool black and white. “I want you to know,” she says, “the only reason I’m consenting to this is because I wish to clear my name.” At the start of Spike Lee’s series “She’s Gotta Have It,” arriving Thursday on Netflix, the artist Nola Darling (DeWanda Wise) sits up in bed, filmed in bold color. “I would like you to know,” she says, “the only reason I’m doing this is ’cause folks think they know me. They think they know what I’m about, and the truth is, they don’t know me.” It’s the same, but different: sharper, more pointed. “She’s Gotta Have It” is full of quotes, from literature, music, history — above all, from “She’s Gotta Have It,” the film. (The song “Nola,” written for the film by Bill Lee, the director’s father, is not only the series’ title music but also Nola’s ringtone.) But the 2017 model is more than the sum of its references. More expansive than interior, more defiant than dreamy, it’s a vibrant if uneven work in heated conversation with itself. Even in a boom time for remakes and revivals, it’s unusual to see a vaunted director using TV for a do-over. The original film was a low-budget, high-voltage jolt about a free spirit who refused to be judged for her sexuality. It also had its own sexual-representation problems, particularly an ugly rape scene that Mr. Lee has since regretted, saying, “I was immature.” This year’s Nola is still seeing a trio of men. Jamie Overstreet (Lyriq Bent), an investment banker semi-separated from his wife, is mature but paternalistic; Greer Childs (Cleo Anthony), a model and photographer, is gorgeous but vain; Mars Blackmon (Anthony Ramos, “Hamilton”), an update of Mr. Lee’s basketball-obsessed B-boy of Nike commercial fame, is childlike but childish.

"In the early 1980s, Harvey M. Schwartz was working weekends in the cold room of a kosher butcher shop in New Jersey, shaping beef into hamburger patties. Two hundred miles away in upstate New York, David M. Solomon was a frat brother playing rugby and mulling an entry-level banking position. More than three decades later, the two men are competing for what may be the most coveted job on Wall Street: running Goldman Sachs. Longtime managers of separate arms of the company, Mr. Schwartz, 53, and Mr. Solomon, 55, were named co-chief operating officers and presidents of Goldman last December when Gary Cohn, who previously held the titles, joined the Trump administration. The dual promotions made the men overnight adversaries in the race to run Goldman — that is, whenever Lloyd C. Blankfein, its longstanding chairman and chief executive, steps aside. The 63-year-old Mr. Blankfein once joked that he planned to die at his desk. But at 11 years, his tenure exceeds those of his recent predecessors, and guessing his replacement has become a popular Wall Street parlor game. Goldman now faces a choice between two distinct characters. Mr. Solomon, when he isn’t jetting around the world or locked in all-day client meetings, likes to spin electronic-dance records at nightclubs and do yoga with his adult daughter. "

And should that exploration turn up evidence that running for president is a dumb idea — it happens — it’s easier to step away. Not Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles. He is making no secret that he — as unlikely as it may seem, given his lack of national experience — is considering a race for the White House. Mr. Garcetti recently discussed his intentions with The Times. (Here’s my article.) His ambitions drew a somewhat mixed reaction — ranging from incredulity to some saying this is just what the Democratic Party needs — in one decidedly unscientific sampling (a blast of comments on the story on Twitter).

"WASHINGTON — President Trump began his first Thanksgiving vacation in office with an early-morning Twitter rage in which he again vented about some of his favorite targets: sports figures he thinks have defied him. The president called LaVar Ball, the father of one of three U.C.L.A. players arrested in China for shoplifting, a “poor man’s version of Don King,” the black sports promoter. He also called Mr. Ball an “ungrateful fool!” and insisted that “IT WAS ME” who deserved more thanks for rescuing Mr. Ball’s son from the Chinese authorities. Mr. Trump followed the angry rant toward Mr. Ball, who is African-American, with a return to his monthslong demand for football players to be more respectful while the national anthem is played — an issue that has strong support among some Americans. On the idea of asking players to stay in locker rooms during the anthem, Mr. Trump tweeted: “That’s almost as bad as kneeling!” Together, the posts were a reprise of Mr. Trump’s personal attacks against sports figures — many of them African-American — for what he judges to be poor behavior on their part and a failure to demonstrate enough deference to others. White House officials deny that the president is focused on race when he comments about sports and athletes. But to historians and black activists, the tweets are clear evidence of an attempt by the president to send a message of solidarity to many supporters. “President Trump appears to have a peculiar overfascination with African-American athletes and a negative fascination,” said Douglas A. Blackmon, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Slavery By Another Name” and the host of “American Forum,” a weekly show produced by the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. "
"THE HAGUE — It was the closing of one of Europe’s most shameful chapters of atrocity and bloodletting since World War II. With applause inside and outside the courtroom at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Gen. Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander, was convicted on Wednesday of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison. It was the last major item of business for the tribunal in The Hague before it wound down, a full quarter-century after many of the crimes on its docket were committed. From 1992 to 1995, the tribunal found, Mr. Mladic, 75, was the chief military organizer of the campaign to drive Muslims, Croats and other non-Serbs off their lands to cleave a new homogeneous statelet for Bosnian Serbs. The deadliest year of the campaign was 1992, when 45,000 people died, often in their homes, on the streets or in a string of concentration camps. Others perished in the siege of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, where snipers and shelling terrorized residents for more than three years, and in the mass executions of 8,000 Muslim men and boys after Mr. Mladic’s forces overran the United Nations-protected enclave of Srebrenica. Sitting impassively at first in the court in a blue suit and tie, Mr. Mladic seemed much smaller than the burly commander in fatigues who had often appeared before the news media during the war to defend himself and his forces.

"WASHINGTON — The heightened scrutiny of sexual impropriety on Capitol Hill has swept up a senior House Republican who apologized Wednesday for a sexually explicit photograph that wound up on the internet and raised the possibility that he had been the victim of a crime. Representative Joe Barton of Texas, who was once the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and is now its vice chairman, said that he was reconsidering his political future after the photograph appeared on an anonymous Twitter account. Mr. Barton, who has hired a crisis communications firm, made clear he was ready for a fight. In a statement Wednesday night, he said that he had suffered “a potential crime.” A Texas law, the so-called revenge pornography law, makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally publicize images or videos of someone’s genitals or sexual activity without consent. Hours after his initial apology, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Barton, 68, had threatened in 2015 to report to the Capitol Police a woman with whom he had shared explicit photographs, videos and messages if she exposed him. The woman, who spoke anonymously, shared with The Post a recorded phone conversation in which the congressman confronted her about communications she had with other women connected to Mr. Barton, including sexually explicit material he had shared with her. Mr. Barton did not dispute the woman’s account. But in his statement, he said that she “threatened to publicly share my private photographs and intimate correspondence in retaliation” when he ended their relationship. "
"In an unpredictable world, it’s always a pleasure to claim vindication for one’s own prophetic powers, and the political crisis in Germany — the inability of Angela Merkel to form a coalition government that keeps her country’s far right sidelined — could easily inspire an “I told you so” from those of us who have criticized the German chancellor and doubted her leader-of-the-free-world mystique. That mystique is undeserved because it is too kind to her decision, lauded for its idealism but ultimately deeply reckless and destabilizing, to swiftly admit a million-odd migrants into the heart of Europe in 2015. No recent move has so clearly highlighted the undemocratic, Berlin-dominated nature of European decision making and the gulf between the elite consensus and popular opinion. And no move has contributed so much to the disturbances since — the worsening of Europe’s terrorism problem, the shock of Brexit and the rise of Trump, and the growing divide between the E.U.’s Franco-German core and its eastern nations. So it’s fitting that the immigration issue has finally come back to undercut Merkel directly, first costing her votes in Germany’s last election, which saw unprecedented gains for the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, and then making a potential grand coalition impossible in part because the centrist, pro-business Free Democrats now see an opportunity in getting to Merkel’s right on migration policy. Yes, thanks to the continued fallout from her rash decision, and just as her critics predicted, Germany stares into the abyss of … … well, actually, no, it doesn’t really stare into the abyss at all. It just has to choose between a new election, which would probably deliver the same divisions but would still leave the nationalists stuck at 10-15 percent of the vote and Merkel’s party with a plurality, and a minority government led by Merkel herself, which would be a novelty in Berlin but which is normal enough in other stable Western countries. Both options promise problems that Germany hasn’t had to deal with in its modern and unified shape, but also problems that are quite routine for developed-world democracies. Neither option is going to suddenly elevate the AfD to power, unravel the European Union, or bring National Socialism lurching back to life. As political crises go, the one Merkel has brought upon her country isn’t exactly a Weimar moment, or even a Trump-scale shock. And for all the pleasures of “I told you so,” those of us who never bought into the Merkel mystique should not pretend that she’s delivered some sort of catastrophe just yet. "
"To the Editor: “The Men We Used to Admire,” by Michelle Goldberg (column, Nov. 21), shows how the earnest and important reckoning with sexual harassment by those on the left is turned against us through false equivalencies (Al Franken/Roy Moore) and lack of established procedures for responding to allegations aired through the press or social media. With liberals readily admitting “mea culpa” to accusations or demanding resignations of other liberals, and conservatives exploiting liberals’ sensitivity and political correctness, I fear that this important moment is turning into a liberal circular firing squad. Will Al Franken and Louis C. K. face real consequences, while we end up having to live with Roy Moore in the Senate, and continuing to live with Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court and Donald Trump in the White House? AMANDA AARON, BROOKLYN To the Editor: I am glad Michelle Goldberg has given more thought to her position on the spate of sexual harassment accusations, including that Al Franken should resign. The rush to judgment does not serve us well. This reader, at least, cares more about how my representatives vote and what policies they back than I do about their personal lives and misdemeanors. As is so often the case, there is a failure to make distinctions: As Ms. Goldberg notes, there is a world of difference between force, violence or intimidation by those in power and obnoxiousness. There is a vast distance between the behaviors of Harvey Weinstein and Louis C. K., and between Roy Moore and Al Franken, and yet we respond as if they were equivalent. Some behaviors are criminal; others are inappropriate, unwelcome and obnoxious. If we destroyed careers on the grounds of obnoxious behavior, I daresay no one, man or woman, would remain employed for long. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration declared on Wednesday that Myanmar’s brutal crackdown on its Rohingya minority constituted “ethnic cleansing,” a long-anticipated designation that will open the door to sanctions against the country’s military commanders and intensify pressure on its civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who visited Myanmar last week, said that “horrendous atrocities” by Myanmar’s military, security forces and vigilantes had forced “hundreds of thousands of men, women and children to flee their homes” and seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. “After careful and thorough analysis of the facts,” Mr. Tillerson said in a statement, “it is clear that the situation in northern Rakhine State constitutes ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.” The United States, he said, will pursue “targeted sanctions,” most likely against military leaders implicated in the crackdown. But administration officials continued to rule out broader sanctions against Myanmar’s government because they said it could jeopardize the country’s delicate transition to democracy after decades of repressive military rule. Mr. Tillerson also stopped short of explicitly calling for an international investigation into the atrocities, which disappointed some human rights advocates, though he did call for a “credible, independent investigation.” Critics said that Myanmar’s government had proved itself, through previous investigations, unable to uncover the truth of its persecution of its Muslim minority, which has included executions, gang rapes and burnings of villages.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Robert Mugabe — who once proclaimed that “Only God will remove me!” — resigned as president of Zimbabwe shortly after lawmakers started impeachment proceedings. Jubilant residents poured into the streets at what seemed to be an abrupt capitulation from the world’s longest-serving head of state. Mr. Mugabe, 93, said he was stepping down for “the welfare of the people.” A new leader could be sworn in as early as today, the state broadcaster said. _____ • For the European Union, the only thing worse than a strong Germany may be a weak one. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s failure to form a coalition government has further delayed serious decisions the bloc faces on the eurozone, migration, asylum and defense, as well as Britain’s exit. "
"The collapse of coalition talks in Germany is not simply a political problem for the Germans; it portends a period of serious uncertainty for all Europe and the West. In a Europe shaken by Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, Russian meddling and much more, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Germany was supposed to be a beacon of prosperity and stability, an indomitable defender of the international liberal order. Suddenly there is talk of new elections and possibly the start of a post-Merkel era. The deadlock was a result of national elections in September that demonstrated that Germany, for all its economic strength, was also vulnerable to the divisive social forces sweeping through the West. The 2015 refugee crisis, in which Ms. Merkel courageously declared “We can do it” and opened Germany’s doors to a million refugees, also shifted votes, especially in the east, to the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which won a stunning 13 percent of the vote. Ms. Merkel’s conservative Christian Democrats won the most seats, but they and their former coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party, took a drubbing. The Social Democrats opted out of the coalition, leaving the chancellor to seek the support of two smaller parties — the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats. After four weeks, the talks finally collapsed Sunday night when the Free Democrats’ leader, Christian Lindner, walked away saying, “It is better not to govern than to govern badly.” The Social Democrats have still shown no interest in teaming up again with the Christian Democrats, and Ms. Merkel indicated that she prefers to hold new elections. The politics will play out as President Frank-Walter Steinmeier sounds out the political players. However it ends up, Germany and the West are in for a stretch of considerable uncertainty on a broad range of fronts in which Germany’s leader of 12 years often had the decisive voice: refugees; the stumbling negotiations with Britain on its exit from the European Union; the ambitious plans by President Emmanuel Macron of France to join with Germany in forging a more integrated eurozone and a European military force; European relations with the United States, Turkey, Russia and China; the Greek debt. Optimists in Germany and the union see in new elections a potential opening to a new generation of leaders who could imbue Germany with a fresh dynamism. Others fear even more votes for the far-right and the emergence of leaders reluctant to take bold risks or to follow Ms. Merkel’s lead on refugees. And then there is the possibility that Ms. Merkel will emerge strengthened by the brush with the unknown. For now, she has retained her signature pragmatism, pledging to “do everything possible to ensure that this country is well governed through these difficult weeks ahead.” "

t was early November, the day before Virginia’s elections, and the Democratic cavalry — in the form of four podcast hosts crammed into a Lyft — was coming to the aid of Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. “Do you want to kick things off with something light and funny?” Jon Favreau asked Jon Lovett as their ride — an S.U.V. outfitted with neon lights and a disco ball that were a bit discombobulating before 9 o’clock in the morning — took them to a Richmond campaign office. They’d be rallying volunteers canvassing for Northam, the Democratic candidate for governor, who was at the time commanding a perilously narrow lead in the polls. “I want to go toward the end for some earnestness,” Favreau said. “You should do something real message-y,” Tommy Vietor proposed. “I’m expecting the ‘race speech’ for G.O.T.V.,” Dan Pfeiffer chimed in. It was a joke from the podcasters’ past lives. As Barack Obama’s chief speechwriter for eight years, Favreau had a hand in some of his most memorable oratory — none more so than the 2008 campaign speech about race that followed questions about Obama’s relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Whenever a knotty issue arose in Obama’s White House, Pfeiffer and Vietor, who worked in the communications department, and Lovett, a fellow speechwriter, would taunt Favreau: “We need a ‘race speech’ for Simpson-Bowles,” or: “Write a ‘race speech’ for the BP oil spill.” The night before, at the National, an 800-seat theater in Richmond, Favreau and his co-hosts performed a sold-out live taping of “Pod Save America,” a liberal political podcast and the flagship offering from Crooked Media, the media company that Favreau, Lovett and Vietor started in January. “Pod Save America” scored its first million-listener episode within its first several weeks, and it now averages 1.5 million listeners per show — about as many people as Anderson Cooper draws on prime-time CNN. Their podcast has come to occupy a singular perch in blue America; where an NPR tote bag once signified a certain political persuasion and mind-set, in the age of Trump, it’s a “Friend of the Pod” T-shirt. “ ‘Pod Save America,’ ” says the Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, “is the voice of the ‘resistance.’ ” Its hosts have not shied away from making use of their newfound influence. In 2017, “Pod Save America” has pointed its audience toward an array of grass-roots groups on the left, partnering with MoveOn to send nearly 2,000 listeners to Republican town-hall meetings, with Swing Left to raise more than $1 million for challengers to House Republicans next year and with Indivisible to deluge Republican senators with tens of thousands of phone calls in favor of preserving Obamacare. And in Richmond, the hosts were lending their activist cachet and charisma to Northam, a candidate who, Democrats worried, could use a lot more of both. “With Donald Trump winning the presidency, we have decided — we’ve realized — that democracy is not just a job for politicians,” Favreau told the crowd at Northam’s campaign office, amid half-empty doughnut boxes and carafes of coffee. “It’s a job for every single American, and that job doesn’t just end on Election Day — that job is an every-single-day job. It is a fight.” "
"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’re asking whether the United States will have a permanent credibility gap with the rest of the world in climate negotiations. Plus, how to talk about global warming at your holiday dinner. Applause greeted Todd D. Stern, former President Barack Obama’s climate change negotiator, when he addressed delegates at a global warming summit in 2009 and declared, “We’re back.” After the George W. Bush administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol, Mr. Stern promised America would “make up for lost time.” Now another president has vowed to abandon another climate pact, the Paris agreement of 2015. But Mr. Stern and other Democrats who traveled to the climate conference in Bonn, Germany, last week said they were certain the United States would stay in the deal in the long run. Even if President Trump makes good on his promise to withdraw from the Paris agreement, they said, a future president will one day rejoin it. "
"Earlier this month, Twitter did something radical: The social network famous for its 140-character limit doubled it to 280. Weirdly, the world didn’t end. There was some whining from old-timers, which quickly died out. Mostly, everything was O.K. Some might even say the change was for the better. There’s a lesson in this for Twitter: It should be bolder in how it manages its network. It can slay more sacred cows. And after a year in which it became blindingly obvious that Twitter was rife with abuse and harassment, and that it has become a haven for propagandists, bots and other manipulators, there’s one sacred cow in particular that deserves to be roasted more thoroughly than your Thanksgiving bird. It’s time for Twitter to scrap one of its founding principles: the idea that it is an anything-goes paradise, where anyone who signs up for a voice on its platform is immediately and automatically given equal footing with everyone else, and where even the vilest, most hateful and antisocial behavior should be tolerated. The company is currently remaking its unworkable verification system — the blue check mark it awards to some high-profile accounts, an icon whose precise meaning is unclear, but that confers many privileges. Last week, Twitter removed the icon from several accounts belonging to white supremacists. Now it says it is rethinking the whole system, and looking for ways to better police its network. It ought to consider a radical, top-to-bottom change like this: Instead of awarding blue checks to people who achieve some arbitrary level of real-world renown, the company should issue badges of status or of shame based on signals about how people actually use, or abuse, Twitter. In other words, Twitter should begin to think of itself, and its users, as a community, and it should look to the community for determining the rights of people on the platform. "
"Back in the 1980s, a comedy boom built a nationwide circuit of hundreds of clubs, a crowded new TV genre showcasing stand-up sets, and the blockbuster careers of Jerry Seinfeld and Roseanne Barr. The next decade, the boom went bust, with nearly a quarter of the clubs closing and two struggling cable channels merging into one, which later became known as Comedy Central. We’ve been in another boom for nearly a decade. This time around, there’s an even greater proliferation of outlets, with an explosion of arena shows; free or cheap stand-up nights; and cable, YouTube and streaming channels devoted to comedy. Perhaps most important has been the expensive push this year by Netflix to become the home of the special. But it’s easy to see telltale signs of oversaturation. “Netflix is releasing a new comedy special every week,” the stand-up Andy Kindler joked in his annual State of the Industry speech this year. “It’s exciting because now you can binge-watch America getting tired of stand-up comedy again.” There’s already been some contraction online: NBC’s comedy streaming service Seeso folded; the pioneering site Funny or Die has made cutbacks. And even before the sudden downfall of Louis C.K. inspired a necessary reckoning, a sense of anxiety filled clubs about the possibility of a second bust. “One of the things I hear repeated regularly is that comedy clubs are dying,” Sean Joyce, a Washington, D.C., promoter and host, said by email. Louis Faranda, the booker at Carolines on Broadway, who had a front-row seat for both booms, is outright predicting that a bust is coming and that smaller rooms will close. Greg Godbout, who owns spaces in Virginia and Washington, said he could sense the mood was shifting at this year’s Just for Laughs festival, the huge industry retreat in Montreal. “I saw a longtime comedy club owner offer to sell his club,” Mr. Godbout recalled. ‘He said, ‘Name your price.’” But a crash may be just what comedy needs.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. The late-night hosts on Tuesday took jabs at Charlie Rose, who lost his positions at CBS and PBS after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment. Jimmy Fallon imagined how the firing at CBS might have gone down. Stephen Colbert focused on the account of one woman who said that while she was meeting with Mr. Rose at his home, he changed into a bathrobe and walked around with it untied. Gayle King, Mr. Rose’s longtime co-host on “CBS This Morning,” was Mr. Colbert’s first guest on “The Late Show” on Tuesday. Her appearance had been scheduled far in advance, but she admitted to Mr. Colbert that she “came this close to canceling.” Later, she added: “I was wincing at your monologue, though, Stephen.” On “Late Night,” the correspondent Amber Ruffin started off her latest edition of “Amber Says What” with a reminder that these many sexual assault allegations may be shocking, but to many women, they’re not necessarily surprising.

"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Wednesday ordered a federal review of a database that is used to check gun buyers’ backgrounds, after a man who shot and killed more than two dozen people at a Texas church this month was omitted from the system despite a criminal record. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was asking the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to conduct a comprehensive review of the database, known as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Mr. Sessions said in a statement that the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Tex., showed that “relevant information may not be getting reported” to the database and that the agencies needed to determine “the steps we can take to ensure that those who are prohibited from purchasing firearms are prevented from doing so.” The suspect in the shooting, Devin P. Kelley, a former Air Force serviceman, had served 12 months’ confinement after striking and choking his first wife and breaking the skull of his young stepson. Federal law prohibits selling a gun to a person who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child. After the attack, the Air Force confirmed that the information about Mr. Kelley’s conviction had not been properly reported to the F.B.I. Mr. Kelley, who killed himself after the massacre at the church, bought guns from a Texas store in 2016 and 2017. It is unclear whether those guns were used in the attack. Mr. Sessions instructed the two agencies to ensure that the Defense Department and other federal agencies were reporting complete and accurate information, calling it “alarming” that there had been discrepancies. In the weeks since the shooting, there has been a bipartisan legislative push to require criminal records to be included in the database to increase the reporting of domestic assault convictions. The House of Representatives Armed Services Committee also said it would investigate the Air Force’s failure to notify the government about Mr. Kelley’s criminal record. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has recently come under increased scrutiny over an apparent lack of regulation of bump stocks, the gun conversion kits that a gunman used in October to kill 58 people and wound hundreds during a music festival in Las Vegas. The agency has said it has no jurisdiction over the kits because they do not qualify as guns. "
"CARACAS, Venezuela — The administration of President Nicolás Maduro called it a necessary move to ferret out “putrid” corruption and end impunity. Outside the government, however, many observers saw it as yet another strong-arm move by Mr. Maduro to consolidate power. Whatever the motivation, the arrests this week of six senior executives at Citgo, the United States refining subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, have purged the American company’s leadership and stunned the energy sector. The move, announced on Tuesday by Venezuela’s attorney general, was the latest in an inquiry that has led to the arrests in recent months of about 50 people associated with the vital national oil industry. The purge has come as the state-owned company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, teeters on the brink of default on billions of dollars in bond debt amid the nation’s worsening economic crisis. Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the six Citgo executives, including the acting president, faced charges of embezzlement and other crimes in connection with a refinancing deal worth as much as $4 billion that had not been authorized by the appropriate authorities in the Maduro administration. He said the officials had offered the subsidiary as a guarantee, putting it “at risk.” The deal, he insisted, amounted to “corruption of the most putrid kind.” Four of the men are United States citizens, The Wall Street Journal reported. Corruption has been a chronic and well-known problem for years at Pdvsa and has helped to undercut its operations and profits. "
"MOSCOW — Leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran announced an agreement on Wednesday to sponsor a conference aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement of the Syria war. The announcement by the three leaders, who were meeting in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, underscored Russia’s increasingly influential role in determining the outcome of the war, which appears to be winding down after nearly seven years. The conference they proposed, also to be held in Sochi, was announced just days before a new round of peace talks was planned in Geneva, convened by a special United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura. It was another sign that Mr. de Mistura’s efforts, frustrated for years, have now been overshadowed by Russia’s actions. The Sochi announcement also came a few days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, an indication that Mr. Assad had agreed to the idea. Mr. Putin also called President Trump and other regional leaders, reflecting what appeared to be a coordinated effort that highlighted Russia’s role. Mr. Putin sought to use the Sochi announcement to portray Russia as a flexible diplomatic intermediary in the Syria conflict, despite Russia’s military backing for Mr. Assad, widely regarded by opponents as a war criminal.

"WASHINGTON — The party not occupying the White House seizes control of governor’s offices in New Jersey and Virginia. An unexpectedly competitive special Senate election threatens the chamber’s balance of power. Major legislation being forced through along partisan lines heads for a climactic holiday-season vote. Veteran lawmakers of the governing party race for the exits. Such was the state of play at this moment in 2009 when President Barack Obama and Democrats ruled the roost. Such is the virtually parallel political landscape now with President Trump and Republicans in charge: Substitute Doug Jones of Alabama, a Democrat, for Scott Brown of Massachusetts, a Republican, and switch the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with the Affordable Care Act. It ended badly back then for Democrats, who lost the House in the 2010 midterm elections and suffered setbacks in the Senate, severely limiting Mr. Obama’s ability to pursue his agenda during his remaining six years in office. History is already repeating itself. And the striking comparisons are not lost on either Democrats or Republicans. “Republicans who rode the wave eight years ago undoubtedly can sense the shifting tides,” said David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. “As one who was washed over, I can tell you, it’s an unpleasant feeling.” "
"SAN FRANCISCO — Have you ever wondered whether you have fallen prey to a Russian misinformation campaign? Soon, you will be able to find out. Facebook said on Wednesday that it planned to roll out a new tool later this year to help figure out if that new page you followed on Facebook or account you added on Instagram was secretly being run by Russia’s troll army. The tool, which you will find through a newly created portal on your Facebook or Instagram page, is part of an effort to “protect our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors who try to undermine our democracy,” Facebook said in a blog post. The social network is trying to assuage critics who said Facebook did not do enough to stop Russian propaganda from spreading on its platform ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The social media giant, along with Twitter and Google, were grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill several weeks ago about their role in the election and the unintended consequences of their technology. Facebook has said that 29 million Americans saw content created by Russian agents directly in their news feed, while 126 million shared posts that were shared or linked to by their friends, with that number rising to roughly 150 million when including Instagram. On Election Day itself, about 10 million people saw ads purchased by the Kremlin on Facebook, the company has said. Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company hoped the tool would help Americans who liked a page or followed an account created by a Russian agent, though he acknowledged that it stopped short of being able to help the much wider circle of people who viewed Russian propaganda shared by their friends. Facebook executives previously said they doubted whether they had the ability to reach out to every single American who was exposed to Russian government-backed propaganda. “It’s a much more challenging issue to identify and notify reliably people who may have been exposed to this content on an individual basis,” Colin Stretch, the company’s general counsel, said during the appearance before Congress. For now, the tool may only be able to help you if you chose to follow one of the accounts or pages set up by Russian agents on Instagram or Facebook. According to experts who have studied disinformation campaigns, that accounts for only a tiny sliver of the people Facebook estimate were affected by content Russian posted online. “People are much more affected by content shared by their friends, they are more likely to click on it and spend time reading it and considering its merits when a trusted friend shares it on their Facebook page,” said Jonathon Morgan, chief executive of New Knowledge, which tracks the spread of misinformation online. “People don’t know the extent to which they are influenced by what their trusted social circles post online.” The lesson? Choose your friends carefully. "
"WASHINGTON — Representative John Conyers Jr., the House’s longest-serving lawmaker, does not plan to resign over accusations of sexual harassment despite facing a House Ethics Committee investigation, his lawyer said on Wednesday. His lawyer, Arnold E. Reed, said in a phone interview that Mr. Conyers, 88, denied any wrongdoing and believed that some people suggesting that he step down, including fellow Democrats, had been scheming for years to push him out as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Asked about the credibility of the accusations of harassment, which have been made by women who were former staff members, Mr. Reed stopped short of calling the women liars. “You have to ask the women, are they lying or not,” Mr. Reed said. “Mr. Conyers has not engaged in sexual harassment or harassment otherwise with regard to any staffer that he has had.” He suggested that many others in Washington, including the president, would also have to resign were they to face repercussions over similar claims. President Trump himself has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, including harassment and assault, as have others in Congress. “If we are talking about resignation and resignation over allegations, then half the people in the House, half the people in the Senate, including the president of the United States of America, would have to step aside, step down and or resign,” Mr. Reed said.

Here’s what you need to know: • “Most Americans now get their internet and phone services from one of a few providers, and most TV shows and movies are produced by a handful of big companies. But there is so far no clear view about how Washington will navigate this constantly shifting terrain.” One of our business reporters, David Gelles, examined the differing stances that the Trump administration has taken this week on one of the central issues shaping business and society. On Tuesday, the F.C.C. announced plans to dismantle rules that prevent internet service providers from charging higher fees and blocking access to some websites. (This video explains how net neutrality works.) That followed Monday’s lawsuit by the Justice Department to block AT&T’s proposed takeover of Time Warner. • “You’ve got one agency saying that marrying content and distribution results in too much market power, and another agency saying there’s no problem with a distributor favoring their content over someone else’s,” one analyst said.

"Many years ago, I committed an offense for which famous men are now being publicly, and rightly, shamed. I patted an office secretary on her behind. I won’t offer the usual lame defense that I didn’t know my advance was unwanted or that social attitudes were different back then. My only excuse is that at the time of the incident I was about 7 years old. I remember the moment because of what happened immediately afterward. The secretary, who worked at my father’s business in Mexico City, turned around and slammed a heavy stack of papers on my head. I marched indignantly over to my dad’s office to report her behavior — only so that he could march me over to her desk and have me apologize. He followed that up with a stern warning never to do anything of the sort again. I don’t remember the secretary’s name. But what a service she did me by giving me a knock I’ll never forget, one that took courage and self-respect considering I was her boss’s son. What a service, too, that my dad defended her and gave me the talking-to that he did. It’s a lesson every boy should get — loud, clear, and early — from a male role model. As it’s Thanksgiving, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I owe my late father. Living in Mexico, he was keen that his kids should never behave in the manner of los niños bien — the entitled and often abusive princelings of the upper class. A family acquaintance had once said he intended to raise children who would “know how to command the servants.” My dad would sometimes mention this to us as one of the most atrocious things he’d ever heard. His own way of being was shaped by a phrase he used often and in an expansive sense: “Give with a warm hand.” Don’t wait till you’re dead to give your money away. Be exceptionally considerate of those depending on you, most of all those born with a lot less. Be present. Be generous with your time and energy. Oh, and be tender. Most kids endure a sex talk with a parent. Mine with him, on a winter’s evening drive when I was 12, was light on the mechanical issues but heavy on the subjects of gentleness, respect and love. I sat through it in mortified silence. But I remember it vividly as I attempt to pass along the same wisdom to the next generation. "
"Last Thanksgiving I wrote a column titled, “No, Trump, We Can’t Just Get Along,” in which I committed myself to resisting this travesty of a man, proclaiming, “I have not only an ethical and professional duty to call out how obscene your very existence is at the top of American government; I have a moral obligation to do so.” I made this promise: “As long as there are ink and pixels, you will be the focus of my withering gaze.” I have kept that promise, not because it was a personal challenge, but because this is a national crisis. Donald Trump, I thought that your presidency would be a disaster. It’s worse than a disaster. I wasn’t sure that resistance to your weakening of the republic, your coarsening of the culture, your assault on truth and honesty, your erosion of our protocols, would feel as urgent today as it felt last year. But if anything, that resistance now feels more urgent. Nothing about you has changed for the better. You are still a sexist, bigoted, bullying, self-important simpleton. But now all of the worst of you has the force of the American presidency. The degree to which Russia aided your ascendance, and the degree to which people connected to your campaign were willing and eager to entertain entreaties from Russia, are coming into clearer focus everyday.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Europe closed what may be its most shameful chapter of bloodletting since World War II. After a trial that lasted years, the Bosnian Serb warlord Ratko Mladic, 75, was sentenced to life in prison by a U.N. tribunal. He was convicted of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Above, celebrating the sentence in Srebrenica, where 8,000 men and boys were executed by Mr. Mladic’s forces. Our reporters note that European nationalist passions are once again on the rise. In an Op-Ed, a journalist who covered the Bosnian war says Mr. Mladic’s conviction was too long in coming and sends a discouraging message to victims of conflicts in Syria, Zimbabwe, Yemen and elsewhere: “Will Mr. Mladic’s verdict, 22 years in the making, inspire hope that justice can be delivered fairly and without delay? I think not.” _____ • The U.N. Command is demanding to meet with officials of the North Korean People’s Army, accusing its troops of violating the truce that halted the Korean War when they fired on and chased a defecting comrade across the border last week. South Korean cameras recorded the escape. "
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani court has ordered the full release of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the Islamist militant group that carried out the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks, 10 months after the government placed him under house arrest, his lawyer said. The move will free Mr. Saeed to participate more directly in Pakistan’s politics. And at a time when the United States has been pushing Pakistan to do better in curbing militants, it presents another example of how the most extremist voices in the country seem to be moving more into the mainstream. Mr. Saeed had long been one of the most-wanted militant leaders in the region, but he had been living in the open in Pakistan for years despite a $10 million American bounty on him. India, in particular, has criticized Pakistan for not bringing him to justice after the militant group he founded, Lashkar-e-Taiba, killed 166 people in the Mumbai attacks. But to many Pakistanis, Mr. Saeed is a hero: the architect of a long militant campaign to fight India in Kashmir, and a prominent voice for fundamentalist Islam. Some love how he has mocked efforts by the United States to capture him, and he drew large crowds as he continued to lead public gatherings, especially in his home city, Lahore. The Pakistani government long ago formally banned Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was widely listed as a terrorist group. But Pakistan had made few public advances against Mr. Saeed even after he founded a charity, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, that is openly considered a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba and that recently began moving into political campaigning. In January, the government declared him under house arrest, seeming to bow to international pressure and also keeping him from fund-raising for Jamaat-ud-Dawa. The arrest order was extended several times until Wednesday, when a three-member judicial body reviewed and rejected a government request to extend Mr. Saeed’s detention for 90 more days. His current detention order expires overnight Thursday. "
"“Junk,” the riveting reincarnation of the junk bond era now playing at Lincoln Center, “is a fictionalized account suggested by events in the historical public record,” according to an author’s note in the program. “The characters in this play are dramatic concoctions,” it reads, “stitched together — at times — with details pulled from history, but these characters are never anything other than fictions.” But make no mistake about it: “Junk” is about as close to reality as theater gets. I should know: I’m the author of “Den of Thieves,” which chronicled the rise and fall of Michael Milken and his junk bond empire and the cast of characters that whirled around him. The author of “Junk,” Ayad Akhtar, has cited my book and “The Predators’ Ball,” Connie Bruck’s pathbreaking account of Mr. Milken’s heyday at Drexel Burnham Lambert, as works that influenced his play. Part of the fun of watching “Junk” is matching the characters to their real-life counterparts: the junk bond trader Robert Merkin (Mr. Milken); the arbitrageur Boris Pronsky (Ivan Boesky); the United States attorney Giuseppe Addesso (Rudolph Giuliani). Even their fictional names seem alliterative of those of their actual counterparts. Other characters are less obvious. Is the “private equity” magnate Leo Tresler really Teddy Forstmann? Of the many old-line industrial firms that succumbed to Mr. Milken’s junk bond onslaught, which one is Everson Steel and United? It’s a credit to Mr. Akhtar’s skills as a dramatist that such questions soon fade as deeper truths and questions emerge. No one unfamiliar with Michael Milken or even junk bonds should be deterred from seeing “Junk.” People who think they already know the story should be prepared to leave the theater with unsettling new thoughts. Perhaps it has taken the perspective gained over nearly three decades to see what a turning point in American history the late 1980s turned out to be, and how they shaped, as Mr. Akhtar puts it, “the world we inhabit today.” "
"Even though there’s been nothing subtle about the current push to fill dozens of judicial vacancies kept open by the Republican-controlled Senate during the final years of the Obama administration, a document now making the rounds inside the Beltway is head-snapping. It is a proposal by a leading conservative constitutional scholar to double or even triple the number of authorized judgeships on the federal Courts of Appeals, now fixed by law at 179. Why so many, and why now? The author, Steven G. Calabresi, a law professor at Northwestern University, a founder and the current board chairman of the conservative Federalist Society, declares his goal boldly: “undoing the judicial legacy of President Barack Obama.” The 37-page document is styled as a “Memorandum to the Senate and the House of Representatives.” On one level, it tells us little that we don’t already know: that the Republicans, seemingly unable to accomplish much of anything else, are desperate to gain control of the federal courts. Sure, President Franklin D. Roosevelt failed 80 years ago with his plan to remake the Supreme Court to his liking by adding up to six new justices. But that’s evidently no reason not to aim just a little lower with a court-packing plan for the federal appeals and trial courts. (Professor Calabresi also advocates adding 185 District Court judgeships to the current 673.) There is something bracing about the naked activism of a leader of a movement that has spent the past generation railing against judicial activism. In his memorandum, Professor Calabresi explains that when President Obama came into office, 10 of the 13 federal appeals courts had majorities of Republican-appointed judges. By the time the Obama administration ended eight years later, that number had shrunk to four, with results that Professor Calabresi regards as calamitous. Calling out individual Democratic-appointed judges by name, he gives as examples last year’s decision by the Fourth Circuit invalidating North Carolina’s voter ID requirement, and a decision by the federal appeals court in Washington rejecting challenges to the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rule, as “another instance of the administrative state run amok.” In ordinary times, one might expect a document like this to be passed quietly among like-minded Capitol Hill staff members. But conservatives these days put their cards on the table. Professor Calabresi posted a link to his memorandum on National Review’s website and uploaded it to the Social Science Research Network, a widely used web-based index of newly published scholarship. I learned of it from a post by Ian Millhiser on the liberal Think Progress website. And the memo does have a scholarly cast, consisting of a lengthy discourse about a purported “caseload crisis” that has led judges to take quality-compromising procedural shortcuts like delegating work to staff members, omitting oral argument, and writing casual “unpublished” opinions that decide the case at hand without setting a precedent for other cases. Since 1990, Professor Calabresi argues, Congress has added no new seats to the appeals courts and only a few dozen to the district courts, while caseloads have grown. Thus, “the need for a new judgeship bill can be justified by the crisis in volume,” he writes, adding: “One of the most straightforward ways for Republicans to address this problem is to make the case for a new judgeship bill that would enable the president to appoint a sufficient number of new judges that would help to change the balance of power of each of the circuit courts back to a conservative majority.” "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: = • In Pakistan, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the Islamist group that carried out the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks, is expected to enter the country’s political arena directly, now that he has been freed from house arrest. Mr. Saeed had long been one of the most wanted militant leaders in the region, but until he was restricted in January, he lived openly in Pakistan despite a $10 million U.S. bounty. India, in particular, has criticized Pakistan for not bringing him to justice. _____ • Myanmar and Bangladesh said they had moved closer to the possible repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, but neither side gave many details apart from a vague commitment to begin the process within two months. And how many Rohingya would return? The U.S. and others have called the campaign of violence conducted by Myanmar’s security forces crimes against humanity. "
"From an empty hallway at one of his jobs in Manhattan, Abdulaziz Marwan Hussin Mohammed watched his own wedding celebration through a fuzzy WhatsApp connection. His family called from Khartoum, Sudan, so he could see his fiancée, Hind Sirelkhatim Hamid Mukhtar, receive their marriage license. Relatives passed the phone around the banquet hall, congratulating him via the messaging app. Guests ate fried chicken and falafel. “And I guess they had cake, but I didn’t see it,” Mr. Mohammed, 32, added recently with a laugh. Missing the ceremony in August was yet another in a series of challenges for the long-distance couple, who had struck up a romance after he moved to New York in 2014. They met in Khartoum while they both worked at a heavy equipment company. Mr. Mohammed, who is soft-spoken and describes himself as shy, was fixing a computer four years ago when Ms. Mukhtar, an accountant, introduced herself. She shook his hand with the warmth and confidence of friend, he said. “She’s really outgoing,” he added. “The opposite of me.” "
"WASHINGTON — Wherever I go, people ask me the same question: “How can he?” How can Kevin support President Trump? Why isn’t he bothered by all the things others find appalling and frightening? Thanksgiving weekend is here, so it’s time for my Republican brother to share his bounteous harvest of thoughts: Every time I hear Neil Gorsuch’s name, I smile. It has been a year since Donald Trump was elected, and his thrill-a-minute White House is still causing acid reflux for half the country and all of the mainstream media. There is always a lot of background noise buzzing around the president, and it’s catnip for his detractors. Full disclosure: I am not a Trump disciple. His manners offend me and the tweeting is overdone, but I do admire his resiliency against an unrelenting and unfair press. His tweeting is annoying, but it can be an effective defense. He has 43.2 million Twitter followers. The New York Times has 3.1 million subscribers. Trump got into office because of Congress’s inability or unwillingness to do its job. The voters were so fed up, they turned to a reality TV star instead of the 20 politicians on the menu. (Or 20.5 if you want to count Martin O’Malley.) Trump delivered on his promises to shake things up with a slew of executive orders undoing much of Barack Obama’s burdensome regulations and, more important, started to reshape the lower courts decimated by Obama’s appointments. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court may be his most lasting legacy. Trump’s presidency is unorthodox, but his blustering against Kim Jong-un is the only way to deal with a bully. And since Kim will want to get back at Trump, and Kim’s rockets may be able to reach only the West Coast, we’re probably all right until he can hit a red state. Democrats say Obamacare needs only a tweak. My youngest son just received his bill for health care. It came with an annual premium of $8,100. At that price, I think he will continue to vote Republican. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. I want to start this Thanksgiving edition of the newsletter with a short story about The New York Times. The Times, like the rest of the media, is suffering from a drop in advertising. Print advertising is shrinking, and much of the new digital ad revenue is flowing to only two companies, Facebook and Google. The Times’s ad business remains robust relative to the competition, but it’s not immune. Our print advertising revenue dropped 16 percent — or $43 million — during the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period in 2016. A rise in digital advertising — of $23 million — wasn’t enough to make up for the decline. But something else was more than big enough to make up for the decline: Subscribers. Revenue from digital-only subscriptions jumped 44 percent — or $75 million — in the first nine months of this year, compared to the same period last year. (And print subscriptions remain strong. So don’t worry, print subscribers: The newspaper isn’t going away. It’s still a great technology.) In practical terms, Times subscribers are increasingly paying for Times journalism. If you’re a subscriber, you are helping to pay for the investigations of the Trump administration and Harvey Weinstein, for the correspondents and photographers bearing witness around the world, for the interactive graphics, podcasts and videos, for the expert journalists covering culture, business, government and — as seems worth emphasizing today — food. “We’re a reader-supported institution, driven by people like you, who believe in truth and independence, rigor and fact,” as Jodi Kantor, one of the reporters who broke the culture-changing Weinstein story, recently wrote to readers. Or as my fellow columnist Nick Kristof has written: “We sometimes fall short — and I hope you’ll tell us when we screw up — but it’s never been more crucial that we play the role of a serious watchdog.” So thank you. It’s a privilege for my colleagues and me to be part of your eyes and ears on the world. I especially want to thank all of you who read this newsletter, including those who frequently write to me with their thoughts. Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. In The Times. My colleagues have put together a selection of Thanksgiving-themed pieces from our archives. It includes Frank Bruni on his family’s Italian-American celebration; Jennifer Finney Boylan on her first Thanksgiving away from home; a 2014 blog post on how the Civil War created the national holiday; and two pieces from the latest Sunday Review: one on intuitive eating and one on staying on campus during break. Also, on Facebook yesterday, Frank Bruni and Bari Weiss talked about politics at Thanksgiving. "
