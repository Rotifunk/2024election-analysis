"News item #1: The Trump administration is taking thousands of children away from their parents, and putting them in cages. News item #2: House Republicans have released a budget plan that would follow up last year’s big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy with huge funding cuts for Medicare and Medicaid. If you think these items are unrelated, you’ve missed the whole story of modern American politics. Conservatism – the actually existing conservative movement, as opposed to the philosophical stance whose constituency is maybe five pundits on major op-ed pages — is all about a coalition between racists and plutocrats. It’s about people who want to do (2) empowering people who want to do (1), and vice versa. Until Trump, the ugliness of this deal was cloaked in euphemisms. As Lee Atwater famously put it, But the reality was always there. The conservative economic agenda has never been popular, and it is objectively against the interests of working class voters, whatever their race. In fact, whites without a college degree are the biggest beneficiaries of the social safety net. Nonetheless, these voters supported the GOP because it spoke to their racial animosity. Now, to be fair, for a long time the GOP establishment managed to pull off a kind of bait-and-switch with this strategy, using race to motivate voters who would otherwise oppose its agenda, then putting the racism back in the closet once in office. George W. Bush did a lot of terrible things, but give him this much credit: he tried to dampen the xenophobia that was trying to break out after 9/11, rather than fanning the flames.

"Wildly ambitious, thoroughly entertaining and embellished with some snaky moves, Eugene Jarecki’s documentary “The King” is a lot like its nominal subject, Elvis Presley. In part, it tells the familiar story of the poor little boy who became a king. But Mr. Jarecki has a second, larger and more complicated story he wants to address, too: that of the United States. Tying one man’s body to the body politic, he seeks to turn Presley’s life — from ravishing, thrilling youth to ravaging, putrefying fame — into the story of the country, an arc that takes the documentary from Graceland to Trumpland. Why Elvis? For Mr. Jarecki, the answer seems to be, why not? Mostly, though, there is the 1963 Rolls-Royce Phantom V, which came into Mr. Jarecki’s sights a few years back and serves as both the documentary’s roving stage and silent co-star. It’s a silver beast: huge, cumbersome-looking and temperamental. (It breaks down.) Rigged with cameras, it has to be among the more expensive picture cars in the history of cinema, having been bought by the movie’s production company in 2014 for almost $400,000.

A day after reversing his hard-line position of separating immigrant children from their families, President Trump took to Twitter with demands: Change the laws, build a wall, and do not hire immigration judges. An American official told us that the Department of Health and Human Services asked the Pentagon to make preparations to house thousands of migrant children on military bases. And Melania Trump went to Texas to visit one of the facilities where some of the separated children are being held, raising eyebrows by boarding her plane in Washington in an olive green coat that read in white capital letters, “I really don’t care.

"WASHINGTON — Behind the White House’s plan to punish China with tariffs and other restrictions is a growing concern that Beijing is using industrial policy to dominate industries of the future, at the expense of the United States and other nations. On Thursday, the Trump administration laid out its case in a 35-page report entitled “How China’s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World.” It exhaustively details the steps Chinese officials take to protect and promote their domestic industries and disadvantage foreign competitors, including the use of government subsidies, cyberespionage and forced intellectual property transfers to Chinese companies from American and other foreign firms. The United States is trying to derail China’s dominance by punishing Beijing. But it has yet to detail how it plans to build America’s dominance in industries that will power economic and job growth in the future, or cultivate what the administration officials call the “crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property.” Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, a senior administration official said Mr. Trump’s tariffs are designed to benefit American high-tech industries from the sort of “predation” China has used in the past. Many economists say those steps are insufficient — and possibly counterproductive — to position American companies to compete in emerging, high-tech, globalized industries. They say the administration needs a proactive strategy to bolster American innovation and technology. That includes investing in federal research and development spending, worker skills and attracting more high-caliber foreign students to American graduate programs and fostering advanced industries such as biodefense and artificial intelligence. Whether industries like semiconductors thrive going forward in the United States “will depend not on America’s success in curbing China’s progress, but rather on its ability to sustain and support innovation by U.S. companies,” Laura D’Andrea Tyson, a former top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, wrote this week.

"THE END OF THE FRENCH INTELLECTUAL
From Zola to Houellebecq
By Shlomo Sand
Translated by David Fernbach
278 pp. Verso. $29.95. Shlomo Sand explains that, when he was growing up in Israel, he read a novel by Simone de Beauvoir, who conjured for him the ideal of the lofty intellectual in its loftiest version, which is Parisian. He took Beauvoir herself to be the noblest possible exemplar of Parisian loftiness, together with her comrades Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. And he dreamed of the day when he, too, would unsheathe his mighty pen to do battle in the name of universal principle against the forces of injustice and ignorant prejudice. But then, having advanced to what sounds like a later stage of adolescence, he discovered that he had been naïve, and Beauvoir and Sartre had played less than heroic roles during the German Occupation of France. Wartime cowardice made them feel guilty about the Jews, and guilt led them in later years to overcompensate by offering too much sympathy to Israel, which was appalling. And Camus turned out to be just as bad. It was not just that, during the Algerian War, Camus declined to endorse the terrorism of the independence fighters. He, too, displayed a dismaying sympathy for Israel. And, as Sand explains in the opening pages of “The End of the French Intellectual,” the scales fell from his eyes. Sand’s readers will recognize that scales falling from his eyes is the dominant theme of his oeuvre. In the best-known of his books, “The Invention of the Jewish People,” he discovered that the Jews are not the Jews — or, at any rate, are not the descendants of their own ancestors that Jews have spent thousands of years supposing themselves to be. He discovered that, over the millenniums, Jewish communities have come into existence with no connection to the ancient Hebrews — e.g., the little-known Khazars of Central Asia, who converted to Judaism, or the Jewish Berbers of North Africa, who were led by a fabulous queen. He discovered that Jewish historians are unreliable on these questions because they have drawn their inspiration from the volkisch and racist traditions of Germany. He discovered that, even if the Jews do constitute a nation, which they do not, a Jewish state would be, by definition, an outrage against civilized political thought — as explained in still another of his books, “The Invention of the Land of Israel.” And then, having disabused himself of every possible modern Jewish belief about the Jews, still more scales dropped from his eyes, and he composed a book called “How I Stopped Being a Jew.” It is hard to know who is more colorful, the Jewish Berber queen or Shlomo Sand, the Israeli professor. In “The End of the French Intellectual,” he strings together a set of personal reflections, historical annotations and topical commentaries on the ideal of the lofty intellectual, in the course of which he finds 10 ways to say, with suitable references to master thinkers across the centuries, that intellectuals ought to uphold universal principles. And, at the same time, they ought to be honest about any biases or circumstances that might influence their thinking. He contemplates the right-wing writers of France in the 1930s, with passing notation, for some reason, of whoever among them, a few, might have had Jewish roots. He contemplates the sociology of intellectuals. He proposes a Marxist interpretation, with invocations of Karl Kautsky and Antonio Gramsci, according to which the intellectual ideal in its Parisian version rose and fell in tandem with the workers’ movement, from the late 19th century to the late 20th. And then, having polished off these desultory points, he inquires into the intellectual scene in our own time, now that the “great Parisian luminaries” are gone — the scene in Paris, that is.

"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher President Trump signed an executive order to keep parents and children together at the border. What does it mean for his immigration policy — and for the families who have already been split apart? On today’s episode: • Caitlin Dickerson, a national immigration reporter for The New York Times. Background reading: • President Trump’s executive order, issued in the face of intense public and political pressure, aims to end to family separation by enabling the administration to detain parents and children together indefinitely — a plan that will almost certainly face swift legal challenges. • The executive order upholds the administration’s “zero tolerance” border policy, and it does not address the circumstances of more than 2,300 children who have already been separated from their families.

"President Trump recently made an offer to National Football League players like us who are committed to protesting injustice. Instead of protesting, he suggested, we should give him names of people we believe were “unfairly treated by the justice system.” If he agrees they were treated unfairly, he said, he will pardon them. To be sure, the president’s clemency power can be a valuable tool for redressing injustice. Just look at Alice Johnson, age 63, who was serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction until her sentence was commuted by President Trump. He should be commended for using his clemency power in that case. But a handful of pardons will not address the sort of systemic injustice that N.F.L. players have been protesting. These are problems that our government has created, many of which occur at the local level. If President Trump thinks he can end these injustices if we deliver him a few names, he hasn’t been listening to us. As Americans, it is our constitutional right to question injustices when they occur, and we see them daily: police brutality, unnecessary incarceration, excessive criminal sentencing, residential segregation and educational inequality. The United States effectively uses prison to treat addiction, and you could argue it is also our largest mental-health provider. Law enforcement has a responsibility to serve its communities, yet this responsibility has too often not met basic standards of accountability. These injustices are so widespread as to seem practically written into our nation’s DNA. We must challenge these norms, investigate the reasons for their pervasiveness and fight with all we have to change them. That is what we, as football players, are trying to do with our activism. President Trump could help. He could use his powers, including the clemency power, to make a real dent in the federal prison population. People like Alice Johnson, for example, should not be given de facto life sentences for nonviolent drug crimes in the first place. The president could stop that from happening by issuing a blanket pardon for people in that situation who have already served long sentences. Of the roughly 185,000 people locked up in federal prisons, about 79,000 are there for drug offenses of some kind — and 13.5 percent of them have sentences of 20 years or more. Imagine how many more Alice Johnsons the president could pardon if he treated the issue like the systemic problem it is, rather than asking professional football players for a few cases. There is also a systemic problem in federal prison involving the elderly, who by next year will make up 28 percent of the federal prison population. Releasing these prisoners would pose little to no risk to society. And yet from 2013 to 2017, the Bureau of Prisons approved only 6 percent of roughly 5,400 “compassionate release” applications. About half of those applications were for people who had been convicted of nonviolent fraud or drug offenses. Of those denied release, 266 died in custody. President Trump could order the release of any drug offender over the age of 60 whose conviction is not recent. That would be the morally right thing to do. Apart from using the pardon power, there are policies the president and the attorney general could implement to help. For instance, they could eliminate life without parole for nonviolent offenses. Currently, more than half of those sentenced to die in federal prison are there for nonviolent offenses, and 30 percent of people sentenced to life (or de facto life) are there for a nonviolent drug crimes. Compare that with the state level: Only 2 percent of those sentenced to life (or de facto life) are there for drug offenses. These changes, if President Trump were to make them, would positively affect the lives of thousands of people and have a lasting beneficial effect on many more people in the future. The president can implement these changes with his pardon power and other executive decisions. His ability to change the lives of people for the better is immense. We hope he uses it, not just for the few, but for the many. President Trump, please note: Our being professional athletes has nothing to do with our commitment to fighting injustice. We are citizens who embrace the values of empathy, integrity and justice, and we will fight for what we believe is right. We weren’t elected to do this. We do it because we love this country, our communities and the people in them. This is our America, our right. We intend to continue to challenge and encourage all Americans to remember why we are here in this world. We are here to treat one another with the kindness and respect every human being deserves. And we hope our elected officials will use their power to do the same. "

"To the Editor: Re “Trump Administration Leaves U.N. Human Rights Council” (news article, June 20): The main problem with the United Nations Human Rights Council is not merely “frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.” Instead, it is the council’s Agenda Item 7, which dedicates an entire agenda item to scrutiny of only Israel. All other 192 United Nations member states are not subject to a specific agenda item. The Human Rights Council will not be effective until it eliminates this discriminatory policy. SALO AIZENBERG
