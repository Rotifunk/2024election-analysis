"Mr. Trump is referring to comments by James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence under former President Barack Obama, that were made on “The View” on Tuesday. But Mr. Clapper never said what Mr. Trump claimed he did. In fact, he said the opposite. Here’s the exchange: In other words, Mr. Clapper used the word “spy”  to describe intelligence gathering on Russian efforts to influence the election. He explicitly denied that the F.B.I. “spied” on Mr. Trump’s campaign. There is no evidence that the intelligence agents planted an informant inside Mr. Trump’s campaign to spy on him for political purposes. As The New York Times has reported, “F.B.I. agents sent an informant to talk to two campaign advisers only after they received evidence that the pair had suspicious contacts linked to Russia during the campaign.” The informant, an American academic who teaches in Britain, did not secretly infiltrate the Trump campaign. He met with Trump campaign aides who were under scrutiny for their links to Russia. Mr. Clapper described the use of this informant as “a fairly benign tool” that the F.B.I. employs “all the time.” "
"Update, June 6: We have chosen some of the work honored below to be included in the new Times education section, Learning, which you can find in print on June 6. _________ We received a record 9,275 essays — or, put another way, nearly four million words — from students around the world this year in response to our fifth annual Editorial Contest, so choosing the nine winners, 26 runners-up and 38 honorable mentions you can find below was no small task. Participants tackled the big issues of the day, like gun control, climate change and #MeToo, but they also took on niche topics, like the need for female priests or the dangers inherent in treating “true crime” as entertainment. Many students wrote about problems they had confronted personally, such as sitting too long during the school day, discussing politics at a family Thanksgiving meal, or participating in civil disobedience so school-sanctioned that Thoreau would have been “rolling in his grave.” To be recognized at all in a contest as popular as this one, an editorial needed to grab our attention from the first paragraph and hold it until the end. The argument had to be sound, the evidence solid and counterarguments addressed. The piece also had to have voice and personality and not merely sound like a summary of the basic pros and cons on an issue. Minimum requirements were important too. Essays that moved on to second, third and fourth rounds had to adhere to the rules by, for example, listing both a Times and a non-Times source. At least one wonderful entry had to be removed from consideration because the “works cited” featured five Times articles, but none from anywhere else. Starting May 24, we will be publishing one of the top nine essays each school day in posts that we hope you will spread on social media, hang on school bulletin boards and perhaps even use as “mentor texts” for next year’s contest. After that, we’ll publish all the runners-up together in one post. You can find them all in this column. "
"First, Pete Souza became an Instagram celebrity by documenting the White House. Then he became an even bigger one by criticizing it. The former chief White House photographer for President Barack Obama, Mr. Souza has been developing a huge following on his Instagram account since the early days of the Trump administration. That is when he began posting nostalgic photos from the Obama era that, because of their captions and Mr. Souza’s timing, also read as sly commentary on President Trump. People caught on, and Mr. Souza, who also spent more than five years photographing the Reagan White House, became the subject of numerous media headlines lauding his “shade-throwing” skills. While he declined to comment about Mr. Trump at the time, Mr. Souza kept the visual digs coming. Now he is adapting his strategy into a book titled “Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents.” The book, scheduled for publication on Oct. 16, is intended to be a “portrait in contrasts,” according to a news release from the book’s publisher, Little, Brown and Company. In it, Mr. Souza’s photography will be juxtaposed with “tweets, headlines, quotes and other material from the first 500 days of the Trump administration.” The contrast, Mr. Souza said in an Instagram post announcing the book, is meant to express his concern over “the future of our democracy” by framing the current presidency through a look at the previous one. Mr. Obama “respected democracy and the rule of law,” he wrote. “Unlike his successor, he respected the office of the presidency.” "
"[Jessica Walter has died at 80. Read her obituary.] Perhaps no moment better defines “Arrested Development” than a recent attempt by Tony Hale, who plays the high-strung, blissfully immature (and one-handed) Buster Bluth, to set up a promotional clip on “Conan.” “I don’t even know how to explain this,” Mr. Hale said. The show, created by Mitchell Hurwitz, has always been difficult to characterize. The zany, self-referential sitcom tracking a narcissistic family as they dodge the claws (or hook!) of justice was critically adored when it debuted in 2003, but failed to build an audience over three seasons on Fox. It remained a cult favorite, its disciples ever clamoring for more banana stands, stair cars, cousins in love and $5,000 suits (Come on!). But Netflix’s convoluted revival in 2013 left many fans cold. (Mr. Hurwitz recently re-edited those episodes.) Now it’s back for a fifth season — debuting May 29 — and there’s a cloud hanging over the Bluths’ model home. One of the show’s stars, Jeffrey Tambor (George Sr.), was accused of sexual misconduct on the set of “Transparent,” allegations he denied but that still resulted in his being fired from the show. When the accusations emerged, “Arrested Development” had nearly finished production; Mr. Hurwitz and the cast members expressed support for Mr. Tambor. This week many of the actors got together for a group interview about the new season, including Mr. Tambor, Mr. Hale, Jason Bateman (Michael), Alia Shawkat (Maeby Fünke), Jessica Walter (Lucille), Will Arnett (Gob) and David Cross (Tobias Fünke). In a freewheeling, at times emotional conversation that had the air of a family Thanksgiving dinner, the group candidly discussed Mr. Tambor’s behavior on set, reflecting in particular on the time he blew up at Ms. Walter, his onscreen wife. Ms. Walter spoke publicly for the first time about the incident, which Mr. Tambor first mentioned in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. "
"A federal regulator on Wednesday encouraged banks to offer small, short-term loans to people in need of emergency cash, the Trump administration’s latest relaxation of banking regulations and a rare moment of common ground with consumer groups that oppose payday lending. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, said it will start allowing banks to make small loans — typically in the range of $300 to $5,000 — outside of their standard underwriting processes. Joseph Otting, the agency’s leader, said the new guidance is intended to help extend banking services to Americans whose credit scores are too low to qualify for conventional loans or credit cards. Mr. Otting offered the example of the owner of a vehicle in need of immediate repairs who had few options other than seeking a quick loan from a check-cashing shop or even a liquor store. “It’s not like that credit demand went away, it just got displaced into the most expensive segment,” he said. “I personally believe that banks can provide that in a safer, sound, more economically efficient manner.” A handful of large and midsize banks, including Wells Fargo and Regions Bank, once offered so-called deposit advance loans that let customers quickly borrow small sums, which would typically be repaid from their next paycheck. The banks stopped making such loans in 2014, after federal regulators warned banks against providing products that “can trap customers in a cycle of high-cost debt that they are unable to repay.” "
"Through Sunday. Derek Eller, 300 Broome Street, Manhattan; 212-206-6411, derekeller.com. Nancy Shaver’s exhibitions often overload the senses. They are extravaganzas of stuff, colorful and tactile, mostly society’s castoffs recycled into forms that expose false binaries, like high versus low, form versus function, masculine versus feminine and art versus craft. Ms. Shaver operates simultaneously as artist, curator, hoarder and stylist. She is also an astute frequenter of flea markets, seeking items for both her work and her secondhand store, Henry, in Hudson, N.Y. Her latest New York show, at Derek Eller, demonstrates her complex proclivities with special clarity. Its title, “A Part of a Part of a Part,” suggests a parsing of her efforts. Some of the art is cobbled together from found materials or objects, most notably her signature wall pieces, called “Blockers”: little wood blocks, individually covered with paint, fabric, paper or wallpaper, and arranged into grids, which evoke projects ranging from quilts to scrapbooks to works by Piet Mondrian and Joseph Cornell. A similar process is achieved in a beautiful, porous sculpture, “Drawing #30 — Light and Air,” in which stacks of little thread spools evoke Brancusi’s “Endless Column,” in embryo. But Ms. Shaver also uses things as they are, frequently in large numbers, as in the ambitious “Collections — Love and Work.” It includes wooden drawer knobs; baby hats from China, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan; beaded evening bags; and a handmade snow shovel.

"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — With the might of incumbency and New York State’s Democratic machine at his back, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo cruised to the nomination for a third term on Wednesday, as Hillary Clinton and other powerful friends touted his administration as a model for the state and, perhaps, the nation. For Mr. Cuomo, who effectively controls the state party, the endorsement was inevitable. But the rhetoric surrounding his coronation was geared to ratchet up enthusiasm for the governor, who is dealing with an unexpectedly prickly challenge from the left from Cynthia Nixon. And while Ms. Nixon dropped in here on Wednesday — shaking hands, doing interviews, and leaving before noon — the moment undeniably belonged to Mr. Cuomo, with an assist from Mrs. Clinton, whose support in the convention hall here at Hofstra University seemed little dimmed by her loss to Donald J. Trump in 2016. “Now more than ever, we need leaders who will stand up for progressive values,” Mrs. Clinton said, after reeling off a laundry list of Democratic priorities, from fighting climate change to fighting for the rights of immigrants. “Most of all, we need leaders who believe in producing results and getting things done, leaders like Andrew Cuomo.” Though not nominated by the party on Wednesday, Ms. Nixon, who drew less than 5 percent of the delegate vote, intends to collect petitions to appear on the ballot, and she is still gunning to defeat Mr. Cuomo in a Sept. 13 primary. “This is our party, too,” Ms. Nixon said of her and her progressive supporters. Wednesday, however, was dominated by Mr. Cuomo and his anointed allies, including Letitia James, who secured the party’s nod for attorney general, a position suddenly vacated in early May after the resignation of Eric T. Schneiderman, who has been accused of physically abusing several romantic partners. Kathy Hochul, the lieutenant governor, was also nominated for another term. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Of all the questions hanging over Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, one stands out: How will President Trump fare in the end? Here are several possible outcomes. An indictment while Mr. Trump is in office would be the most aggressive option, but it has grown increasingly unlikely. In a series of Twitter posts about the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump repeated allegations that federal investigators had used spies against his campaign, and gave the supposed scandal a name: “SPYGATE.” In related news, a judge ruled that the president’s Twitter feed is a public forum and that he cannot block anyone from following him. ____ "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate gave final passage on Wednesday to a multibillion-dollar revamp of the veterans health care system, consolidating seven Veterans Affairs Department health programs into one and making it far easier for veterans to take their benefits to private doctors for care. The legislation, which passed 92 to 5, also expands popular stipends to family caregivers of veterans who served during the Vietnam War era or after. And it establishes a nine-member commission to study the department’s current infrastructure to determine where its health system should expand and contract. The comprehensive bill had been a year in the making, and ultimately won the support of Republicans and most Democrats. The House passed it last week, 347 to 70, and President Trump plans to sign it into law. The bill rounds out an ambitious legislative agenda on veterans issues that has bridged the administrations of President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump, and largely united moderates in both parties who set out to make major changes to the department after a 2014 scandal over the manipulation of data on patient wait times. Mr. Trump has already signed laws that make it easier for the department to remove and fire employees and for veterans to appeal benefits decisions, as well as a rewrite of the G.I. Bill for post-9/11 veterans. Wednesday’s vote is “the last piece of a great mosaic to reform the benefits for our veterans to make them contemporary with the 21st century,” said Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Dozens of military and veterans groups, including the largest congressionally chartered organizations, such as the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, also touted the changes. But beneath the surface, deep mistrust remains over the Trump administration’s mission to increase the use of private care. Many of the largest veterans groups, as well as Democrats and some moderate Republicans, fear that the White House’s push to unfetter veterans’ ability to choose their care is a backdoor effort to tip the scales in favor of private medicine and to starve the federal government’s second-largest department and its vast government-run health system.

"BETHPAGE, N.Y. — A week after President Trump used the word “animals” to describe dangerous criminals who enter the country illegally, he traveled to the epicenter of MS-13 gang killings on Wednesday to press his demands for tougher immigration laws. Robert Mickens, a grieving father, told the president that the murder of his teenage daughter by MS-13 members validated Mr. Trump’s crusade to eradicate the gang by shutting America’s borders to violent criminals. “Obviously, this is a very touchy subject because there is immigration involved,” Mr. Mickens said while his wife wept quietly by his side at a forum on Long Island organized by the White House. “America is based off immigration. Everybody who came here wanted the American dream,” said Mr. Mickens, whose daughter, Nisa Mickens, was killed in 2016. “The American dream is still there. But if you’re going to come here with acts of violence, you can stay in your own country with that, because we don’t need it here anymore.” The emotional moment came during a highly stage-managed event in which Mr. Trump came to Long Island for the second time as president to address the problem of MS-13 — a transnational gang that has ties to El Salvador and uses machetes to kill — and to insist on the passage of tougher immigration laws. Outside the Morrelly Homeland Security Center, both a large group of immigrant rights advocates and a smaller group of supporters for Mr. Trump chanted in a circuslike atmosphere. Inside the tight room of about 150 formally dressed officials, law enforcement officers and the families of five victims of the gang, the atmosphere was one of subdued defiance. "
"President Trump has asked for a sweeping trade investigation into whether autos imported into the United States pose a threat to national security, a move that could ultimately result in tariffs on foreign-made cars and further strain relations with global allies. In a statement released Wednesday evening, the Commerce Department said it had begun an investigation “following a conversation” with Mr. Trump. The announcement followed a statement from the president, in which he said he had instructed the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to investigate imports of cars, trucks and auto parts “to determine their effects on America’s national security.” “Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a nation,” Mr. Trump said. In a separate announcement, the Commerce Department said that imports of passenger vehicles had grown from under a third of cars sold in the United States 20 years ago to nearly half today, while employment in the sector had declined. Automobile manufacturing has long been a source of technological innovation in the United States, and the investigation would consider whether the decline of the auto industry threatens to weaken the American economy by reducing research and development in cutting-edge technologies, the statement said. “There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,” Mr. Ross said. The investigation, which will take months, will be carried out under the same legal statute that the administration used to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The statute gives the president broad authority to restrict imports that threaten national security. "
"NEWARK — Roberta Harrington, a retired nurse of the same vintage as Philip Roth, remembers a visit a year ago by Mr. Roth to his clapboard boyhood home, which she now lives in, on Summit Avenue. He recalled with pleasure the many times that as a child “he’d run up the stairs and come back down again” just for the fun of it and how he prized a cherry tree that was no longer there. That house, that quiet tree-lined street, that neighborhood, this treasured city was the setting of many of Mr. Roth’s novels just as William Faulkner set many of his stories in the region around his hometown, Oxford, Miss. Though Faulkner used the fictional name Yoknapatawpha County, Mr. Roth, who died Tuesday at 85, rarely bothered to camouflage Newark in any way. In his breakthrough debut novella, “Goodbye, Columbus,” his alter ego Neil Klugman, working at the Newark Public Library for a summer, is bewitched by the fetching and much better-heeled Brenda Patimkin. In “American Pastoral,” another Roth stand-in, Nathan Zuckerman, idolizes Swede Levov, the star athlete of Weequahic High School, a character based on the school’s real-life star athlete when Mr. Roth attended in the 1940s. His last novel, “Nemesis,” recalls the panic that enveloped his tightly knit Jewish neighborhood in 1944 when a polio epidemic maimed and paralyzed some of its children. Mr. Roth was regarded with Saul Bellow, John Updike and one or two others as the titans of American literature of the second half of the 20th century. He earned that regard, in part, by milking the everyday people, buildings, streets and mores of the humble Weequahic neighborhood and other city landmarks, often with palpable and wistful affection. “This passion for specificity, for the hypnotic materiality of the world one is in is all but at the heart of the task to which every American novelist has been enjoined since Herman Melville and his whale and Mark Twain and his river: to discover the most arresting, evocative verbal depiction for every last American thing,” Mr. Roth said when he celebrated his 80th birthday in Newark in 2013.

"ATLANTA — Stacey Abrams, who won the Democratic primary for governor, was born and raised in Mississippi. But in many ways she is a product of Georgia’s capital city, which she once represented in the state House of Representatives. Atlanta is a place black people call a mecca — home to black colleges, black culture, black businesses and black political power. It is, in short, a city where a woman like Ms. Abrams — a Yale-educated, unapologetically liberal, African-American transplant — does not stand out at all. But now Ms. Abrams, the first black woman in American history to win a major political party’s nomination for governor, must run statewide in a general election against one of the two conservative white Republicans locked in a runoff battle. And the rest of Georgia is decidedly not Atlanta. While every Southern state has its liberal-leaning cities surrounded by conservative countryside — blueberries floating in tomato soup, as Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, once described Austin — the divide is particularly pronounced in Georgia because of metropolitan Atlanta’s immensity, its central role in the American civil rights movement, and the rapidly growing number of nonwhite people who have been choosing to live in the city’s sprawling suburbs, which were once destinations for white flight. The Georgia countryside certainly has swaths of racial moderation and iterations of conservatism that are detached from white grievance. But there are also political attitudes in rural Georgia, and ways of expressing them, that stand in stark contrast to a capital city that has long offered itself to the world as a beacon of racial comity. Rural Georgia is a place where the Confederate flag, for complex reasons, is still embraced by many white residents as a proud symbol of heritage. And some still display it as an overt symbol of white supremacy. "
"The Trump administration wants to streamline the process for exporting American firearms, a change sought for years by domestic gun companies as a way to increase sales. A proposed rule expected to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday would transfer jurisdiction of consumer gun exports from the State Department, where the licensing process is expensive and extensive, to the Commerce Department, which has a simpler application process. Publication of the rule kicks off a 45-day comment period, after which departments including State and Commerce will review corrections and suggestions and then send a revised draft to Congress before final publication. Gun industry groups said that the shift, which was first conceived during the Obama administration but halted after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, would pare down a bureaucratic process that currently discourages American firearms companies from sending their products abroad. Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation called the proposal “a significant positive development for the industry that will allow members to reduce costs and compete in the global marketplace more effectively, all while not in any way hindering national security.” But critics of the proposal worry that American guns, including AR-15s and similar semiautomatic rifles frequently used in mass shootings, could more easily find their way into the hands of foreign criminals. Among the reasons: a change in the disclosure rules for certain sales. The State Department is required by the Arms Export Control Act to submit any commercial arms sale worth $1 million or more to congressional review. The Commerce Department has no equivalent mandate. "
"As many of New York’s top Democrats gathered on Long Island on Wednesday for the party’s state convention, one prominent Democrat was noticeably absent: Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. de Blasio, who holds one of the most recognizable political offices in the country, and who has traveled to Iowa and other cities and states around the country to promote progressive Democratic ideals, was apparently not quite as welcome in his home state. “There was not an invitation to play a meaningful role at the convention,” he said on Wednesday at an unrelated news conference in the Bronx. “I got a lot of other good things I can do with my time and so I’m not worried about it.” The mayor did not say why he thought he had not been given a significant role, but it seemed likely that it had to do with the main attraction at the convention: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who will formally receive the State Democratic Party’s backing on Thursday. Mr. de Blasio did attend the Democratic State Convention in 2014 and had a speaking role, but not a major one, said Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s press secretary. But Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo’s relationship has grown much more difficult during that time. Over the last four years, the two men have been embroiled in a very public and nasty feud. As the state’s top elected official, Mr. Cuomo is considered the head of the New York Democratic Party. "
"The owners of the National Football League have concluded, with President Trump, that true patriotism is not about bravely standing up for democratic principle but about standing up, period. Rather than show a little backbone themselves and support the right of athletes to protest peacefully, the league capitulated to a president who relishes demonizing black athletes. The owners voted Wednesday to fine teams whose players do not stand for the national anthem while they are on the field. Let us hope that in keeping with the league’s pinched view of patriotism, the players choose to honor the letter but not the spirit of this insulting ban. It might be amusing, for example, to see the owners tied in knots by players who choose to abide by the injunction to “stand and show respect” — while holding black-gloved fists in the air. Or who choose to stand — while holding signs protesting police brutality. We look forward to many more meetings of fatootsed gazillionaires conducting many more votes on petty rules to ban creative new forms of player protest. Many players, African-American by and large, have been kneeling during the anthem since 2016, when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began sitting, and later kneeling, during the ceremony to protest racism and police brutality. Many football fans and team owners thought Mr. Kaepernick was showing disrespect for the flag, or even for the military, as though the Stars and Stripes were a battle standard and the football field a hallowed battleground. The owners responded in the grand old American tradition of blackballing people you disagree with. "
"After the school shooting last Friday in Texas claimed 10 lives, the incoming president of the National Rifle Association, Oliver North, blamed not guns but a “culture of violence” arising from violent movies and the like. North fueled that culture by working as a pitchman for a shoot-em-up video game, but never mind. Meanwhile, Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, was even more imaginative: He blamed too many school entrances and exits, and liberal abortion laws that he claimed had “devalued life.” Really? Folks, look at Japan. Japanese kids relish the same violent entertainment as Americans, and abortion is widely available. Yet at most nine Japanese were murdered with guns across the entire country in all of 2016 — fewer than the 10 killed just last week at the Texas high school. One reason Americans in their late teens are 82 times more likely to be murdered with guns than their peers in other advanced nations is simply that we are awash with guns, some 300 million of them. Yet Congress and President Trump have been paralyzed in part because of the N.R.A. refrain: There’s nothing to be done! It’s us, not the guns. It’s hopeless! In fact, there’s plenty we can do. Here are modest steps consistent with the Second Amendment and public opinion: 1. Require universal background checks to see if a purchaser is a felon or a threat to others. The latest study finds that 22 percent of guns are obtained in the U.S. without a background check, and polls find that more than 90 percent of the public supports making these checks universal. Yet the federal government balks. "
"It’s not every day we start our discussion of current events with the president’s sex life. Well, actually, it’s gotten to be pretty frequent. But today we’re going to talk less about what Donald Trump does in bed and more about his efforts to interfere with other people’s intimate affairs. “When I ran for office, I pledged to stand for life. And as president, that’s exactly what I’ve done,” he told a cheering anti-abortion crowd Tuesday night. Abortion opponents like to call themselves “pro-life,” but the Trump administration has gone further than simply making it more difficult for women to terminate a pregnancy. Trump’s had a virtual war on birth control, beginning with an attempt to eliminate the rule that employer health insurance cover contraceptives. Now he’s built a Department of Health and Human Services that wants to promote family planning methods that involve … not having sex. And he’s come a long way from the guy who once told a national TV audience that he was “very pro-choice.” Although to be fair, that was way back in 1999, when he was still in his 50s and presumably hadn’t had time to work out a mature position on the subject. Ever since he came into office, Trump has been letting right-wing activists run federal family planning programs. They’re at war with Planned Parenthood, which doesn’t get any government money for abortions. But it does provide reproductive health services to an enormous number of low-income women under the federal Title X program. Under a  new rule, the doctors and nurses would have to refuse to even answer patient questions about how to terminate a pregnancy. That’s not going to happen and we’ll see this one in court. Meanwhile, clinics with very conservative views can edit down their information and eliminate any discussion of, say, IUDs. Or just restrict the conversation to abstinence. Yes, a Donald Trump presidency is pushing a no-sex agenda. Cue the irony. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Thursday that it would have second thoughts about a summit meeting between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump if American officials continued to make what the North considers threats against its leadership. The North Korean official who issued the warning singled out Vice President Mike Pence for remarks that she called “ignorant and stupid.” In an interview broadcast on Monday on Fox News, Mr. Pence warned that North Korea’s government could end up like that of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the former Libyan leader. Mr. Qaddafi gave up his nascent nuclear program in the apparent hopes of staving off Western intervention and sanctions, and of negotiating economic integration with the West. But little of that happened, and years later he was killed by rebels after he was weakened in a military action against Libya by the United States and its European allies. In a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Thursday, the North Korean official, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, referred to “unlawful and outrageous acts” by top American officials and said that Mr. Pence had made “unbridled and impudent remarks that North Korea might end like Libya.” Ms. Choe’s comment was the second time in a week that North Korea has threatened to withdraw from Mr. Kim’s planned summit meeting with Mr. Trump, which is slated for June 12 in Singapore. “As a person involved in the U.S. affairs, I cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the U.S. vice president,” Ms. Choe said. “In case the U.S. offends against our good will and clings to unlawful and outrageous acts, I will put forward a suggestion to our supreme leadership for reconsidering the D.P.R.K.-U.S. summit.” "
"By blocking users on Twitter, President Trump has violated the First Amendment, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. The lawsuit was brought by seven Twitter users — including a Texas police officer, a New York comedy writer and a Nashville surgeon — who claimed that Mr. Trump’s Twitter feed was an official government account and that preventing users from following it was unconstitutional. In her ruling, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote that the plaintiffs who sought to view and engage with Mr. Trump’s tweets alongside those who were not restricted were “protected by the First Amendment.” The judge, though, did not require the president or Twitter to unblock anyone. The number of users blocked from the president’s account @realDonaldTrump, which has more than 52 million followers, is known only to Mr. Trump, to those who have access to his account and to Twitter. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Twitter said that the company would not comment on the ruling, and stressed that Twitter was not a party to the lawsuit on either side. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which joined the plaintiffs in the suit, posted personal statements from some of them on its website, including one from Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza, a legal analyst from Washington.

"HONG KONG — Canada has blocked a $1 billion takeover of a construction company by a state-controlled Chinese company over national security concerns, a rare move by a government that until now has largely welcomed such deals despite growing skepticism over Chinese money elsewhere. The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said late on Wednesday that it stopped the deal for the Aecon Group, a construction company that helped to build the landmark CN Tower in Toronto, following a review that began earlier this year. The deal became politically charged after members of Canada’s opposition party raised concerns about Aecon’s access to government contracts — particularly in the nuclear power industry — and the Chinese company’s ties to the Chinese state. “As is always the case, we listened to the advice of our national security agencies throughout the multistep national security review process under the Investment Canada Act,” Navdeep Bains, the Canadian minister of innovation, said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Aecon said the company was “aware of the government’s decision and will be issuing a response in due course.” Chinese companies are increasingly facing hurdles as they go overseas to spread their wealth and acquire technology. Governments from Germany to the United States and Canada are pushing back, often citing national security concerns. "

"Marcus J. Molinaro, a moderate county executive from the Hudson Valley, was formally designated on Wednesday as the Republican Party’s choice to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a two-term Democrat, in November. His task will be daunting: The last time a Republican captured a statewide office in New York was in 2002, when George E. Pataki won his third and final term as governor. But Mr. Molinaro is no stranger to political upheaval; at 19, he was elected mayor of the village of Tivoli, making him the youngest such official in the nation. He then ascended to county legislator, state assemblyman and, finally, Dutchess County executive. As Mr. Molinaro addressed Republican committee members assembled at the party’s quadrennial convention in Midtown Manhattan, he quoted Theodore Roosevelt and reached across party lines to beckon to Democrats and independents — a necessity given that Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2 to 1 in the state. But he also took care to rip into Mr. Cuomo, alluding to the presidential aspirations and transactional politics that have quickly become his favorite talking points. "
"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo skirmished with a senior House Democrat on Wednesday in a bitter back-and-forth over his treatment of Hillary Clinton in the aftermath of a 2012 deadly attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The striking exchange in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — over the security of diplomats abroad — came during Mr. Pompeo’s first Capitol Hill appearance since taking over the State Department. It bared the simmering but fierce partisanship on a House committee that prides itself on being among the most evenhanded panels in Congress. And it was a reminder that while Mr. Pompeo now largely projects an image of moderation as the United States’ chief diplomat, he was once one of the most partisan warriors in Washington. The hearing touched on a range of foreign policy issues and hot spots — including North Korea, Iran and South Sudan — and Mr. Pompeo displayed a deep knowledge on most subjects and candidly admitted when he did not know an answer. He came to the hearing with a “to do” list of 22 items that photographers captured. Ninth on the list was “Call Lavrov,” most likely referring to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia. “Carlos Slim,” the Mexican billionaire, was the 11th item. "
"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. came under fire from electronic privacy and security advocates on Wednesday after acknowledging that it has repeatedly exaggerated the number of locked smartphones and other mobile electronic devices it has been unable to access because of encryption, including in congressional testimony and public speeches. The miscount, which the bureau said was because of an inadvertent programming error in a system that gathered statistics from F.B.I. databases, was a significant embarrassment at a time when the bureau has been pushing for a legal mandate that tech companies build unlocking tools into such devices for law-enforcement access to potential evidence. Electronic privacy and security activists have opposed the F.B.I.’s push to mandate an unlocking mechanism — which the government calls “extraordinary access” and critics call “back doors” — saying it would make devices too vulnerable to hacking. Among those who seized on the disclosure to rain criticism down upon the bureau was Greg Nojeim, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Freedom, Security, and Technology Project. “The factual basis of the F.B.I.’s arguments to weaken encryption has been called into doubt,” Mr. Nojeim said, calling for an investigation by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog. Kevin Bankston, director of New America’s Open Technology Institute, questioned the F.B.I.’s competence and trustworthiness on encryption. He, too, called for an inspector general investigation to determine “just how the F.B.I. could have made such a massive mistake on such an important issue, and repeatedly given false information in sworn testimony for Congress.” The F.B.I. said it was conducting its own “in-depth review of how this overcounting previously occurred, and how the methodology can be corrected to capture future data accurately.” "
"The N.F.L. tried to straighten up its messy bed. Now it will see how sleeping in it goes. After nearly two years of hand-wringing, the league’s 32 owners decided on Wednesday to overhaul N.F.L. policy on protocol for the national anthem. At their two-day meeting in Atlanta, the owners said that the league would allow players to stay in the locker room during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” but said that teams would be fined if players “do not stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.” Then there is this hammer: Those teams can then punish players however they see fit. “It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of N.F.L. players were unpatriotic,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said, explaining the need for the new policy. “We believe today’s decision will keep our focus on the game and the extraordinary athletes who play it — and on our fans who enjoy it.” Yet the rule change figures to go a long way toward pleasing no one — least of all the players. In a text message sent as the owners voted, George Atallah, assistant executive director for external affairs for the N.F.L. Players Association, made it clear the new rule was “not a compromise.” “We were not consulted or included,” he wrote. The league has set itself up to take criticism both from those who want it to require that all players stand for the national anthem — including President Trump — and those who feel the league is trying to silence players who have chosen that moment to protest social injustice. In a statement released after the vote, the players’ union said, “The vote by the N.F.L. club C.E.O.s today contradicts the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Chairman of the N.F.L.’s Management Council, John Mara, about the principles, values and patriotism of our league.” The new protocol also may lead to a host of challenges and recriminations if players decide to test the limits of the rules, and their owners’ tolerance. Giving clubs the authority to punish players sets up a situation where players in Seattle or Philadelphia may have one set of workplace rules while those in Houston or Dallas may have another. "
"Stacey Abrams is flying high. The former Georgia state legislator secured the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor Tuesday evening, making her the first black woman in the United States to secure a major party’s nomination for governor.   Ms. Abrams’s triumph has been hailed as a potentially transformative moment for a party that is still searching for its soul in the era of President Trump,  but she still has a difficult road to securing a general election victory in a deeply conservative state. Georgia hasn’t had a Democratic governor since 2003. On Wednesday morning, just hours after her victory party in downtown Atlanta, Ms. Abrams spoke to The New York Times about her win, her vision for the state, what it means to be a “progressive” in Trump’s America, and her love of romance novels. Some responses have been edited and condensed. There’s obviously a historic aspect to this. You’re the first black woman to be nominated for governor by a major party. How does the weight of that history feel? I am humbled by the opportunity to, you know, sort of tile this ground for folks. But I'm also excited about what it means for everyone who has yet to see themselves reflected in leadership in America. And my goal is to make certain everyone has a seat at the table and that folks can see themselves and their values reflected in our government. Much has been made about how this primary was a bellwether for the current state of the Democratic Party. What do you think your win says about where Democrats are right now? "

"For the past six years, Travis Brenda voted like nearly everyone else in his part of rural central Kentucky. In 2012, 2014 and 2016, he helped send Jonathan Shell to the State House of Representatives, re-electing him again and again as he eventually rose to House majority leader. He watched as Mr. Shell and other politicians failed to add meaningful dollars to public education, embraced charter schools and cut state services. Then over a few hours on March 29, Mr. Shell helped introduce and pass a surprise 291-page plan to significantly overhaul the state’s struggling pension system that the governor later signed into law. Suddenly, years of bubbling anger among state employees and teachers in Kentucky erupted in protests and chants at the Capitol, fueling a sustained backlash that helped lift Mr. Brenda to an unlikely victory on Tuesday night. Mr. Brenda, a first-time candidate and a math teacher, knocked off Mr. Shell, who had both name recognition and fund-raising prowess, by 123 votes in the Republican primary for House District 71. “We trust those we elected to do the right thing,” Mr. Brenda, 43, who teaches at Rockcastle County High School in Mount Vernon, Ky., said in an interview on Wednesday morning. “What we are seeing is that they are not doing the right thing.” In November, he will face Mary J. Renfro, a Democrat who serves on a local school board, in the general election in a part of Kentucky that President Trump easily won in 2016. "
"Gene Talmadge must be turning over in the grave. On Tuesday, Georgia Democrats chose an African-American woman, Stacey Abrams, as their party’s candidate for governor. And not just any African-American woman. Ms. Abrams, the former minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, ran as an outspoken progressive and was endorsed by, among others, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the liberal group MoveOn.org. When Mr. Talmadge served as Georgia’s governor for three terms during the 1930s and 1940s, the Georgia Democratic Party was viewed as the defender of segregation and white supremacy in the state. After African-Americans began voting in large numbers following the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Georgia Democrats like Jimmy Carter and Roy Barnes campaigned and governed as moderates and forged biracial coalitions that included a substantial minority of white voters along with the overwhelming majority of African-American voters. But in recent statewide elections, moderate Democrats have had little success in Georgia. Mr. Barnes was defeated in his bid for a second term in 2002 by a little-known state senator named Sonny Perdue (who is now the secretary of agriculture). That election began a string of Democratic losses running through 2016. Republicans now hold every statewide office, including both of Georgia’s United States Senate seats. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. The Democratic strategy of nominating candidates who hoped to win over moderate-to-conservative white voters received its most recent test in 2014. In that year, Democrats nominated Jason Carter, the grandson of the former governor and former president, as their candidate for governor, and Michelle Nunn, the daughter of Sam Nunn, a former senator, as their candidate for the Senate. Both lost decisively. In her successful campaign for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, Ms. Abrams adopted a different strategy than that followed by Mr. Carter, Ms. Nunn and most Democrats who have run for statewide office in Georgia. While extolling her success in working with Republicans while minority leader, Ms. Abrams emphasized her progressive positions on issues like expanding Medicaid in the state, along with the personal challenges she had overcome as an African-American from a family of modest means. Rather than focusing on increasing the Democratic share of the vote among moderate-to-conservative whites, Ms. Abrams emphasized her ability to energize and mobilize young voters and the state’s growing nonwhite electorate.

"WASHINGTON — After the body of Jesse Lewis, age 6, was recovered from his classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary School, his father, Neil Heslin, cradled him for a final time. At the top of Jesse’s forehead was the gunshot wound that ended his life. “It meant a lot to be able to see him,” Mr. Heslin said in an interview. “When he was born, I was the first to see him, and I was the last one to hold him.” Alex Jones, an online conspiracy theorist whose InfoWars website is viewed by millions, seized on this agonizing recollection to repeat the bizarre falsehood that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., was an elaborate hoax invented by government-backed “gun grabbers.” On his radio show, Mr. Jones said Mr. Heslin needed to clarify “because the coroner said no, the parents weren’t allowed to have touched the kids or have seen the kids.” He played a video in which the InfoWars “reporter” Owen Shroyer says of Mr. Heslin, “He’s claiming that he held his son and saw the bullet hole in his head.” “That is not possible,” Mr. Shroyer said. More than five years after one of the most horrific mass shootings in modern history, the families of Sandy Hook victims are still enduring daily threats and online abuse from people who believe bogus theories spread by Mr. Jones, whom President Trump has praised for his “amazing” reputation. Now, for the first time, the families are confronting Mr. Jones in court. “When anybody’s behind a machine, whether it’s a gun or a computer or a car, a dehumanization takes place that makes it easier to commit an act of violence,” Veronique De La Rosa, the mother of Noah Pozner, another victim, said in an interview. She is suing Mr. Jones, she said, because she wants to force him to admit to his devotees that “he peddled a falsehood, that Sandy Hook is real and that Noah was a real, living, breathing little boy who deserved to live out the rest of his life.” In three separate lawsuits — the most recent was filed on Wednesday in Superior Court in Bridgeport, Conn. — the families of eight Sandy Hook victims as well as an F.B.I. agent who responded to the shooting seek damages for defamation. The families allege in one suit, filed by Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder in Bridgeport, that Mr. Jones and his colleagues “persistently perpetuated a monstrous, unspeakable lie: that the Sandy Hook shooting was staged, and that the families who lost loved ones that day are actors who faked their relatives’ deaths.” "
"RICHMOND, Ky. — People have been telling Amy McGrath “no” for a long time. No, you cannot compete against the boys in sports. No, you cannot serve in combat or fly fighter jets. And no, you certainly cannot defeat the popular mayor of the largest city in your congressional district as a first-time candidate. A wall of trophies, a degree from the Naval Academy, 89 combat flight missions and one stunning House Democratic primary victory later, Ms. McGrath is growing more used to the sound of “yes,” even as she moves to turn around the toughest “no’s” yet, Republican voters in the suddenly bellwether Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky. On Tuesday, she easily defeated Jim Gray, the well-liked mayor of Lexington, for the Democratic nomination in Kentucky’s Sixth. Republicans moved immediately to define her as the far-left candidate who triumphed despite a rejection by the Democratic establishment. But Democrats united around her just as quickly, turning the fight this summer and fall for Kentucky’s Sixth into a critical test of the Democrats’ vaunted “blue wave.” The story of how Ms. McGrath became an avatar for that wave is a narrative that combined a compelling biography, risk-taking, the virtues of the digital age and the willingness to compete even when party elders in Washington were trying to stop her. She slogged through a grueling climb in the polls, suffered a personal tragedy just last month, then fended off a late and unexpected negative attack — all for the chance to compete against an incumbent Republican, Representative Andy Barr, who won his last re-election race by 22 percentage points. “I have never heard someone so persistent,” said Mark Putnam, her campaign’s ad maker.

"In response to both the election of Barack Obama in 2008 and the backlash in favor of Donald Trump in 2016, analysts and commentators have focused mostly on racial attitudes on the right. Both scholarship and journalistic accounts of American politics have drilled down on the increased opposition to immigration and high levels of racial resentment among Obama opponents and Trump supporters. But few have investigated the countervailing trend on the left, the increasing racial liberalism of Democratic voters, which I’ve been thinking about for a while. Though Mr. Obama’s presidency ended up being defined in many ways by America’s reaction to his race, he carefully avoided racially liberal appeals during his original campaign, even taking the time to criticize the purported excesses of campus liberalism. Mr. Obama had begun his national political career with a speech at the Democratic convention in 2004, declaring that “there’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America.” During his 2008 campaign, to give just one example, he turned down an invitation to Tavis Smiley’s State of the Black Union, an event Hillary Clinton attended. During her 2016 campaign, Mrs. Clinton invoked concepts like intersectionality, white privilege, implicit bias and systemic racism. She warned of “deplorables,” while Mr. Obama once gave a speech arguing that “to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns” was something that “widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding.” According to the American National Election Studies 2016 survey, Democrats perceived Mrs. Clinton as more racially liberal than they had perceived Mr. Obama in 2012, when his strategy was not notably different. This shift in political rhetoric has coincided with an underappreciated trend: the rapid increase in the racial liberalism of Democrats, including white Democrats, which I analyzed in a recent report by my think tank, Data for Progress. The General Social Survey asks a question about the causes of racial inequality and allows respondents to select whether they think various factors contribute to inequality. Two possible answers are “discrimination” and “willpower,” which are the two variables I explore here (respondents could select both if they chose). The first roughly measures whether respondents take a structural view of racial inequality and the second whether they take a more individualistic view of racial inequality. "
"WASHINGTON — The same symptoms of a mysterious attack that sickened American diplomats in Cuba have been reported at a United States consulate in southern China, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told lawmakers on Wednesday. At least one American government employee in China recently reported what the State Department’s consulate in Guangzhou described as subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure. “The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba,” Mr. Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He said medical teams were heading to Guangzhou to address what he described as one incident. “We are working to figure out what took place, both in Havana and now in China as well,” Mr. Pompeo said. Twenty-four United States personnel in Havana suffered a slew of health problems that resemble those that result from mild brain trauma such as a concussion, including sharp ear pain, dull headaches, tinnitus, vertigo, disorientation, nausea and extreme fatigue. The Cubans repeatedly denied any responsibility for the problems and decried the plunge in relations with the United States under Mr. Trump. "
"ROME — The populist parties that won Italy’s elections two months ago by demonizing the political establishment, the European Union and illegal migrants in often vulgar terms were granted the go-ahead on Wednesday to form a government, crystallizing some of the biggest fears of Europe’s leaders, who were already bracing for turbulence. The rapid ascent of populists in Italy — the birthplace of Fascism, a founding member of the European Union, and the bloc’s fourth-largest economy — shattered the nation’s decades-old party system. It also gave fresh energy to the nationalist impulses tugging at the Continent and moved the greatest threat to the European Union’s cohesion from newer member states on the periphery, such as Hungary and Poland, to its very core. After 80 days of arduous talks, President Sergio Mattarella gave a mandate to form a government to the parties’ consensus pick for prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, a little-known lawyer with no government experience. Critics assert that he will be but a pawn of the populist parties behind him: the Five Star Movement, a web-based protest party untested at a national level; and the League, a hard-right party that campaigned on a stridently Italians-first platform. Mr. Conte promised “a government of change” that would “safeguard the interests of Italians” after emerging from a nearly two-hour meeting with the president at the Quirinal Palace and greeting a throng of reporters.

"To the Editor: Re “ ‘This Is Not a Drill’: The Growing Threat of Nuclear Cataclysm,” by Clyde Haberman (Retro Report, May 14): Denuclearization is a term no one has been able to clearly define or agree on, and yet it is at the center of the talks between the Koreas and the United States. The bravado of President Trump has helped renew a threat of nuclear war. There is already side-taking and talk of subterfuge and failure. Faith and an attitude of positivity are essential at a time like this. Negotiation with the idea of consensus, not ego, should guide the talks. Having grown up in the “duck and cover” generation of the 1950s, I clearly remember the fear I felt huddled under my desk. I don’t want my 1-year-old grandchild ever to have to grow up in an era of fear and insecurity. The United States is faced with an opportunity to negotiate a chance to end or at least minimize the threat of nuclear war. The world cannot squander an opportunity that may not come again. War is clearly not the answer. BRUCE CHARLICK, JENKINTOWN, PA. "

"WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials gave no indication that they are likely to speed up their pace of interest rate increases during their most recent two-day meeting, suggesting instead that they would be willing to allow the inflation rate to rise slightly above 2 percent for a “temporary period,” while the economy continues to expand. Minutes from the meeting, which ended May 2 and are released after a typical three-week delay, reveal Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June. The minutes also indicate officials are less worried about inflation rising above 2 percent, its current level and the Fed’s target rate, than they are about the rate of inflation dipping again. Officials continue to see the economy as strong, but they remain worried about global trade tensions, including potential damage from American and Chinese tariffs and the possibility that uncertainty over trade policy could already be crimping business investment in the United States. Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to leave the Fed’s benchmark interest rate unchanged, at a range from 1.5 to 1.75 percent. The Fed last raised interest rates in March, by a quarter of a percentage point. It is widely expected to raise them by the same amount at its next meeting in June. The minutes from the May meeting reported that officials said recent economic indicators “had increased their confidence that inflation on a 12-month basis would continue to run near the committee’s longer-run 2 percent symmetric objective.” But the minutes noted that some officials believed “it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the committee’s 2 percent objective.” Some officials noted, the minutes added, that “a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the committee’s symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective.” "
"The references come pouring out of André Leon Talley, discriminating and indiscriminate. About midway through the documentary “The Gospel According to André,” Mr. Talley — a fashion world Zelig for more than four decades — is expounding on a Vogue photo shoot he supervised featuring Cindy Crawford as a grieving widow in a veil. A nod to Jackie Kennedy, of course. But also the films of Luchino Visconti, he says. And Empress Sisi of Austria. Earlier in the film, discussing a designer’s collection, he declares, “Eskimos were treated like the aristocrats, and the aristocrats were treated like the serfs.” Mr. Talley’s kinetic word association is loud, geyserlike and inspiring. And as a figure, he is joyous, absurd, leonine but tender. Yet even with this raw material, “Gospel” doesn’t rise to Mr. Talley’s vitality. The director, Kate Novack, has delivered a film that’s detailed and affectionate, but also frustratingly static, making a point not to get in its subject’s way. The parts of Mr. Talley’s story told through archival footage are fascinating — a staggeringly tall gay black man from the American South inventing himself as a bon vivant (“You can be aristocratic without having been born into an aristocratic family”) and making himself welcome, and essential, at the pinnacle of the Paris and New York fashion world. As high fashion was becoming pop culture, Mr. Talley was there, first as a kind of aide-de-camp to Diana Vreeland, and later as an essential compatriot to Anna Wintour in her early Vogue days. (In the film, Ms. Wintour says he knows more about fashion history than she does.) "
"Apart from the man himself, perhaps nothing has defined President Trump’s political persona more than Twitter. But on Wednesday, one of Mr. Trump’s Twitter habits — his practice of blocking critics on the service, preventing them from engaging with his account — was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Manhattan. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, addressing a novel issue about how the Constitution applies to social media platforms and public officials, found that the president’s Twitter feed is a public forum. As a result, she ruled that when Mr. Trump or an aide blocked seven plaintiffs from viewing and replying to his posts, he violated the First Amendment. If the principle undergirding Wednesday’s ruling in Federal District Court stands, it is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump’s feed and its 52 million followers, said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight First Amendment Institute’s executive director and the counsel for the plaintiffs. Public officials throughout the country, from local politicians to governors and members of Congress, regularly use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public about government business. [Read more: Twitter users talk about getting blocked by the president.] “This ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win,” he said of public officials. Asked whether the administration would unblock the users or appeal the ruling, Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s civil division, demurred from making any specific pronouncement. “We respectfully disagree with the court’s decision and are considering our next steps,” she said.

"“The indigenous American berserk,” Philip Roth’s encapsulation of the country he loved, is a resonating phrase in this time of repetitive school shootings, incontinent presidential tweets, tawdry abuse of public office, rule by mob incitement, manipulation through falsehood, wall obsessions, and the truncation of the English language to a 77-word lexicon “better called Jerkish,” as Roth described Donald’s Trump’s miserable linguistic impact in The New Yorker. Perhaps Roth timed his exit on Tuesday, at the age of 85, as an admonition to a disoriented nation. His “berserk,” alongside his full-throated celebration of the American panoply and riotous exploration of “the great pervasive Anti-You that someone with a grudge might prefer to call God,” often had a menacing side. In “American Pastoral,” perhaps his greatest novel, the American dream of Seymour “Swede” Levov, the assimilated Jew of Viking-evoking athletic ability and appearance during his Newark youth, comes apart in the vortex of his daughter’s descent into terrorism. In “The Plot Against America,” it is the whole country that succumbs in 1940 to a president of Nazi sympathies, the flying ace Charles A. Lindbergh. The novel was published in 2004. After Sept. 11, the United States was no longer synonymous with sanctuary, an enduring change in its sense of self. It, too, could be gripped by the unspeakable. For Roth the imagination was also counter-history. He teased out, with extraordinary energy and wit, the full literary potential of every “What if?” He embarked, imagination irrepressible, down every road not taken at the fork. I found Roth liberating. I am grateful to him above all for the way he introduced me, in wonder, to the exuberance and stubbornness, the unabashed sexual and social complexes, of American Jewishness; and for the rollicking cavalcade of the United States he set before me, an English Jew of South African descent raised not to make a fuss about the odd anti-Semitic remark and to assimilate in England, the land, at least when I grew up in it, of Lewis Namier’s “trembling Israelites.” Roth offered American space, which is also ever-renewed American possibility. He personified another way of living as a Jew. In his novel “Deception,” Roth has his American protagonist say to his British lover, “In England, whenever I’m in a public place, a restaurant, a party, the theater, and someone happens to mention the word ‘Jew,’ I notice that the voice always drops a little.” She challenges him, prompting the American to insist, yes, that’s how “you all say ‘Jew.’ Jews included.” "
"When President Trump signed an executive order this year directing federal agencies to review adding work requirements to federal assistance programs, he said such requirements would “increase self-sufficiency, well-being and economic mobility.” Paul Ryan reportedly cast requirements as an attempt at “getting people the skills and opportunity to get into the work force.” Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said they would improve “health and well-being through incentivizing work and community engagement.” Ignore the platitudes. Work requirements have never been about helping the poor or unemployed. They’ve always been about punishing black people. This has become abundantly clear over the last few weeks as states drafting policies requiring Medicaid recipients get a job or engage in other employment activity have added exemptions. These carve-outs would, in effect, spare white, rural residents from work requirements but not black ones in urban areas. These proposals have turned the subtext that was there all along into legible text. Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia are seeking waivers from the Department of Health and Human Services that would allow them to impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, but not all of them. They all included exemptions for counties with the highest unemployment levels, which are rural, mostly white areas. Urban centers where lots of black people are unemployed, but whose county-level unemployment rates are lower, would be subject to the work requirement. In Michigan, lawmakers are backing off from a similar exemption after it was criticized for its racial inequality. As the University of Michigan law professors Nicholas Bagley and Eli Savit recently argued, it doesn’t matter whether this was done on purpose. It’s still racial discrimination when it’s so clearly going to have such a disparate impact on black people. Michigan provided clear evidence of how race plays out in the push for work requirements: White people, who are 57 percent of the state’s Medicaid population, would have constituted 85 percent of those exempted. Black people, who make up 23 percent of enrollees, would have made up just 1.2 percent of the exempted. "
"BRUSSELS — As Italy’s new populist leaders prepare to form a government, European leaders are bracing for potential new confrontations over migration and some of the core principles of the common currency, the euro. They were already trying to tame a rebellion against Europe’s shared democratic values in the east, led by Hungary and Poland. They now face the prospect that Italy, a founding member and Europe’s fourth-largest economy, could be next to challenge the bloc’s cohesion, finances and democratic principles. If nothing else, anxiety about the economic plans of the new Italian government may finish off the ambitious reform agenda for a more integrated euro area proposed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “The new Italian government will give Germany every excuse not to do what Macron would like and it will destabilize the markets,” said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institution. “It will increase the risk of another eurozone banking crisis, not reduce it.” Last week Italy’s populist parties, the Five Star Movement and the hard-right League, said they would sharply increase spending and repeal reforms of the labor market and the pension system, violating financial limits imposed by Brussels and meant to apply to any country using the euro. The plans would throw an already weak Italian economy into further debt. And the consequences are certain to ripple through the bloc, where leaders worry about another financial crisis just as Greece finally seems to be exiting from its eight-year bailout program. "
"Congress is picking apart the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, just in time for the 10th anniversary of the Great Recession, the type of economic conflagration the law was supposed to prevent. You remember the Great Recession, don’t you? It consumed trillions of our dollars because banks had overinvested in risky securities few people really understood, which were tied to riskier mortgages that they were underwriting. Apparently, Congress thinks that can’t be repeated. They will probably be proven wrong, like others who have thought economic disasters were one-shot deals. Our history is rife with them. The Panic of 1873 was set off by the failure of the investment bank Jay Cooke & Company, which had overinvested in leading edge technology — railroads. The collapse of some 100 banks would soon follow. In 1907, the Knickerbocker Trust keeled over after making bad loans to that era’s version of hedge funders. Serial bank failures ensued, requiring a bailout organized by J. Pierpont Morgan. At least that led to some reform, the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, to supply liquidity to markets. But when banks invested in the red-hot stock market, the Fed could not stop the Great Depression that followed. "

There are several possible outcomes, with the most agressive being an indictment against the president. In a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday about the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump repeated allegations that federal investigators had used spies against his campaign. He gave the supposed scandal a name: “SPYGATE.” Meanwhile, a judge ruled that the president’s Twitter feed is a public forum and that he cannot block anyone from following him.

"WASHINGTON — The United States has disinvited China from participating in a multinational naval exercise scheduled for this summer, further escalating tensions with Beijing that have spanned from trade to North Korea to the military. The Pentagon cited China’s rapid military buildup on disputed islands in the South China Sea for withdrawing the invitation for Beijing to participate in the large-scale naval exercise known as Rim of the Pacific, or RimPac. Defense Department officials said on Wednesday that China’s decision to place surface-to-air missile systems and other offensive weaponry on the islands spurred the move. The military snub comes after President Trump suggested the Chinese might be influencing North Korea’s recent talk of withdrawing from a summit meeting set for June 12 to discuss the dismantling of Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Washington and Beijing also are in the middle of a major trade fight that is part of a perennial battle over market access and technology policy. The conflict over China’s military buildup in the disputed islands adds another layer to the overall tensions between the two global economic powers. “We have strong evidence that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems, and electronic jammers to contested features in the Spratly Islands region of the South China Sea,” Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. "
"WASHINGTON — Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been granted his permanent security clearance, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday, ending a period of uncertainty that had fueled questions about whether Mr. Kushner was in peril in the special counsel investigation. Mr. Kushner is a senior presidential aide with a prominent role in Middle East diplomacy. But his F.B.I. background checks dragged on for a year and became one of many political distractions for the White House. Even some inside the administration suspected that Mr. Kushner’s delay reflected legal problems on the horizon. The permanent clearances make Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, eligible to view some of the United States’ most closely guarded secrets, including the daily intelligence briefing that Mr. Trump receives and the delicate intelligence on the Israelis and the Palestinians that former diplomats said can be valuable in negotiations. Top-secret clearances are typically required for people viewing foreign intelligence or sitting in on high-level White House meetings. White House officials were adamant that the lengthy process was not unusual for a government official who has a complicated financial history and many foreign contacts. But with the special counsel investigating some of Mr. Kushner’s meetings with Russian officials, it left open the question of whether investigators had uncovered evidence that made him a security threat. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating whether anyone around Mr. Trump conspired with the Russian government to help influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Kushner’s meetings with the Russian ambassador, a Kremlin-connected lawyer and a prominent Russian banker have all attracted scrutiny. The resolution of his clearances does not guarantee that Mr. Kushner faces no legal jeopardy. But Mark S. Zaid, a veteran Washington lawyer who handles security clearances, said it was highly unlikely that the special counsel would uncover evidence of improper foreign entanglements and not flag it for security officials.

nnovators come in many forms. Take Tom Smith. He’s a pig farmer in rural Victoria, a quiet man with a white beard who you’d walk right by in Bunnings without even noticing. But in 2008, without any guidance, he went out on a limb and posted a help wanted ad in a Manila newspaper. Then he went there, found a few people he liked and started sponsoring worker visas. It was a bold if simple act that has led dozens of Filipino families to move to a town called Pyramid Hill — reversing population decline, and laying the groundwork for a model of multiculturalism far healthier than what can be found in many cities. “When you’re desperate, it’s just what you do,” Tom told me when we first met. But it wasn’t just that. There was a glint of mischief in his eye. “I saw it as a bit of a challenge,” he said, smiling, “to try and do something different.” That urge to break the mold, to resist conformity and decline, ran through the story I wrote about Pyramid Hill’s transformation.

"An anti-establishment leader takes power after a contentious election. His administration quickly proves itself remarkably corrupt; but he subverts the legal system and is able not only to suppress investigations into his corruption — his supporters denounce it all as a “witch hunt” — but also to consolidate his rule and undermine institutions (the “deep state”) that might have limited his power. Am I talking about Donald Trump? I could be. But the figure I actually have in mind is Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, whose success in getting away with obvious corruption by politicizing law offers a disturbing preview of how Trump may become the authoritarian ruler he clearly wants to be. Not surprisingly, Trump, who basically seems to like dictators in general, has expressed admiration for Erdogan and his regime. Authoritarian instincts and contempt for rule of law aren’t the only things Erdogan and Trump have in common. Both also have contempt for expertise. In particular, both have surrounded themselves with people notable both for their ignorance and for their bizarre views. Erdogan has advisers who believe that he is under psychic assault; Trump has advisers who yell profanities at each other while on trade missions. But does it matter? In America, stocks are up and the economy keeps chugging along. Erdogan has presided over an actual economic boom. Investors and markets don’t seem to mind the craziness at the top. The fact that economic policymakers have no idea what they’re talking about doesn’t seem to make any difference. Until it does. The truth is that most of the time the quality of economic leadership matters much less than most people — economic leaders included — believe. Really destructive policies, like those driving Venezuela into the ditch, are one thing. But run-of-the-mill policies like changes in tax law, even if they’re pretty big and clearly irresponsible, rarely have dramatic effects. Last year, for example, Trump and his allies in Congress rammed through a nearly $2 trillion tax cut. That’s a pretty big number, even for an economy as large as ours. But aside from fueling an unprecedented wave of stock buybacks, the tax cut is having little discernible effect, good or bad. There’s no sign of the investment boom advocates promised, but there’s also no sign that investors are losing faith in U.S. solvency. "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump likes to keep allies and adversaries guessing, but his decision to begin a trade investigation that could trigger auto tariffs was met by surprise at home and abroad, and prompted warnings that it could destabilize global supply chains. Mr. Trump has argued that tariffs would encourage companies to move production back to American soil after years of offshoring and he has seized on levies as a way to force trading partners to make concessions, such as limiting exports to the United States. But critics of Mr. Trump’s approach say the president is sowing uncertainty that threatens to undercut economic growth and send trading relations to a previously unseen level of disarray. Mr. Trump’s latest tariff threat came Wednesday, in the middle of a series of foreign policy challenges: White House officials canceled a meeting with North Korea, drew the ire of lawmakers by considering easing penalties on a Chinese telecom firm and said they had secured a $200 billion trade concession with China, only to have the deal fall through. But that wasn’t all. This week, India filed formal challenges to Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs at the World Trade Organization, joining the European Union, Japan, Russia and Turkey. Even members of the president’s own party warned of the debilitating uncertainty businesses are facing from his scattershot approach. "
"WASHINGTON — The artillery barrage was so intense that the American commandos dived into foxholes for protection, emerging covered in flying dirt and debris to fire back at a column of tanks advancing under the heavy shelling. It was the opening salvo in a nearly four-hour assault in February by around 500 pro-Syrian government forces — including Russian mercenaries — that threatened to inflame already-simmering tensions between Washington and Moscow. In the end, 200 to 300 of the attacking fighters were killed. The others retreated under merciless airstrikes from the United States, returning later to retrieve their battlefield dead. None of the Americans at the small outpost in eastern Syria — about 40 by the end of the firefight — were harmed. The details of the Feb. 7 firefight were gleaned from interviews and documents newly obtained by The New York Times. They provide the Pentagon’s first public on-the-ground accounting of one of the single bloodiest battles the American military has faced in Syria since deploying to fight the Islamic State. The firefight was described by the Pentagon as an act of self-defense against a unit of pro-Syrian government forces. In interviews, United States military officials said they had watched — with dread — hundreds of approaching rival troops, vehicles and artillery pieces in the week leading up to the attack. The prospect of Russian military forces and American troops colliding has long been feared as the Cold War adversaries take opposing sides in Syria’s seven-year civil war. At worst, officials and experts have said, it could plunge both countries into bloody conflict. And at a minimum, squaring off in crowded battlefields has added to heightened tensions between Russia and the United States as they each seek to exert influence in the Middle East. "
"“The big black” and “the big negro” are just two of the phrases that The New York Times used to describe Jack Johnson. “Johnson Weds White Girl” was the headline when he married Lucille Cameron in 1912. He has been called a “negro pugilist and convicted white slaver,” who left a stain “on boxing and on his race” and abused “the fame and fortune that came to him.” Yet, condescendingly, he also was described as being “far above the average negro both mentally and physically.” For The Times, Johnson, who in 1908 became the first black boxer to win the world heavyweight title, was inseparable from his race. It permeated how the newspaper covered every detail of his life, from his boxing to his legal troubles to his demeanor and success. The Times’s coverage illuminates the challenges for broad acceptance faced by Johnson, who inspired the 1967 play and 1970 movie “The Great White Hope,” an account of his life and career and the resolve of white society to dethrone him, both in the ring and outside it. Johnson resurfaced in the news last month when President Trump tweeted that he would consider pardoning Johnson, who was convicted on federal charges of transporting a woman across state lines “for immoral purposes.” Johnson, who served a year in prison, had been a lover of that woman, Belle Schreiber, who was white and had worked as a prostitute. President Trump announced the pardon on Thursday. The campaign for it had been complicated in part by allegations that Johnson had a history of domestic violence, as historians have chronicled. It was one reason the Obama administration cited for not granting a pardon. "
"To the Editor: Re “Plan to Revive Abortion Limit Set by Reagan” (front page, May 18): The Trump administration plans to impose a domestic gag rule on abortion counseling and provision. Only 18 percent of Americans polled in July 2017 reported that abortion should be illegal in all or most instances. Yet the president is allowing this minority to impose its beliefs on the entire American population. This country was built on the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and freedom of religion, and the domestic gag rule directly opposes those rights. Those who find contraception and abortion objectionable for religious reasons can adhere to those beliefs, but enforcing those beliefs in a secular society amounts to religious discrimination.

"If you happened to turn your attention to the sand pit of New York politics this week, you might have found yourself beset by a series of vexing questions. Why, for instance, at the state’s Democratic Convention on Wednesday, where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo received the support of 95 percent of delegates in his bid for a third term, did he greet Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and presidential candidate, with a bouquet of flowers? Would perfume have been better? If she was getting roses and baby’s breath, what was the governor planning for Joe Biden, set to speak the following day? Gerber daisies and a half-dozen hydrangeas? You might rummage around the oddity of all that for a bit and then wonder what was going on with the Women’s Equality Party, about which you have probably heard very little over the past few years, if you have ever heard anything all. First and foremost, the W.E.P., as it is called, is not to be confused with the W.F.P., which is to say the Working Families Party. Put it this way: If the Working Families Party is Fleetwood Mac, the W.E.P. is Rumours, Binghamton’s premier Fleetwood Mac tribute band. Although the actress and education activist Cynthia Nixon, an actual woman, won the nomination of the W.F.P. to challenge the governor in the Democratic primary this year, she did not receive the endorsement of the W.E.P. This went instead to Mr. Cuomo himself because, really, to whom else would it go? He conceived the party four years ago when he was running for re-election the first time, as a means of appealing to female voters. “Yes, Cynthia is woman, and yes she represents a lot of our values, but we have a governor who literally created the party,” Susan Zimet, the chairwoman of the W.E.P. told me. During the 2014 election, Mr. Cuomo drove around the state in a bus called the Women’s Equality Express, which had a pink stripe adorning its side. Some found the entire enterprise craven and patronizing — and an obvious effort to peel off votes from the W.F.P., which had been fighting for paid sick leave and other causes vital to women’s lives for many years. Others found it duplicitous, given the rampant culture of sexual harassment that had been permitted to fester for so long in the state capital. During that race, Mr. Cuomo was challenged by an unknown law professor, Zephyr Teachout, who wound up, to great surprise, receiving a third of the vote. In the wake of former Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman’s downfall over allegations that he had physically abused four women he had been dating, Ms. Teachout announced this week that she will be running to replace him. But given the history, she is as likely to receive the backing of the W.E.P. as Noam Chomsky is of getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Donald Trump. It seems a lot like a political shell company. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Cancels Meeting With Kim, Citing ‘Open Hostility’ ” (nytimes.com, May 24): As surely as the Russian downing of an ill-advised U-2 flight doomed the Eisenhower-Khrushchev summit of 1960 that might have averted the arms race, the deliberately insulting remarks by Vice President Mike Pence and the national security adviser, John Bolton, doomed a Trump-Kim summit. By touting the Libyan model (nuclear disarmament, then United States-backed regime change), they stoked fears that they should have been working to assuage. This administration has also snatched war from the jaws of peace by renouncing the nuclear deal with Iran. It is now the urgent responsibility of Congress to bar President Trump from launching an attack on North Korea without specific congressional authorization. Nuclear disarmament will occur not through the caprice of an egocentric president, but through a renewed grass-roots global movement to halt a gratuitous nuclear arms race and to rid the Earth of nuclear weapons before we suffer an actual nuclear catastrophe. DAVID KEPPEL, BLOOMINGTON, IND. To the Editor: What an incredibly childish letter President Trump has sent to Kim Jong-un of North Korea, canceling the summit meeting. Here are the standard Trumpisms of “a wonderful dialogue” and “a beautiful gesture,” offset by a reference that our massive nuclear capability is much bigger than Mr. Kim’s. Whether some White House flunky wrote this, using Mr. Trump’s limited vocabulary, or Mr. Trump himself doesn’t matter. What matters is that South Korea’s efforts to produce a saner modus vivendi with the North, and perhaps even a peace treaty, have been deeply undercut. Once again, it’s all about Mr. Trump’s grandstanding rather than intelligent international negotiations. SHEILA K. JOHNSON, CARDIFF, CALIF. To the Editor: This should surprise no one. Here’s why this outcome was predicted by many: First, process: Real diplomacy isn’t carried out via Twitter. Second, institutional decline: Many highly skilled diplomats within the State Department have left, leaving major gaps. Third, understanding: President Trump has demonstrated little patience to even attempt to grasp many issues. This is a man who doesn’t take the time to read summarized daily intelligence briefings, let alone to master complicated global problems. Fourth, leadership: Mr. Trump has proven himself incapable of mustering enough support even within his own party to win major legislative achievements, in spite of controlling both the House and the Senate. On top of this all, in the coming months, Mr. Trump will be facing a serious test of his legitimacy as president. The world knows this, and it may help explain why he was just trolled by Kim Jong-un.

"Yesterday, the National Football League announced it would fine teams whose players refuse to stand for the national anthem on the field. The owners were responding to President Trump’s call last September to fire any “son of a bitch” who “disrespects our flag.” Among those protesting police brutality and racial injustice were 10 players from the New Orleans Saints who sat on the bench during the national anthem. My good friend Kenny Vaccaro was one of them. We had no idea, however, that Kenny’s decision would incite such rage in our donors that it would hinder our project to help kids in Kenya. Kenny and I had become friends while I was training at the University of Texas at Austin. I was a professional rugby player from New Zealand recovering from spine surgery. Kenny, a junior from Brownwood, Tex., was a starting safety on the Texas football team. We bonded quickly. Kenny had lost his father to emphysema at a young age, and my father was battling leukemia that proved fatal. We felt the same passion for our sports, and we talked of one day using our platform as athletes to make a difference in the world. I was with Kenny’s family at Radio City Music Hall when the Saints selected him in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft. My father became involved in philanthropy toward the end of his life, and I remember his saying that he wished he hadn’t waited so long. Almost three years to the day after his death, I took his advice. Then I retired from rugby at 28. I flew to Kenya to volunteer at Blessed Hope Primary School in the Kibera slums of Nairobi. "
"When I married in 2000, I changed my name. I expanded it — kept my name but added my husband’s name, Kaplan, without a hyphen. I wanted my name to reflect a conjoining that was also an evolution, literally one thing following another. This was an experiment, as all marriages are, that felt exciting and open-ended, not least because I’m black and my husband was white. I wasn’t excited because I thought we’d be some kind of symbol of racial resolution. I was hardly that naïve, and neither was Alan. I am a journalist who had been covering black matters for years at that point, and Alan was a locally famous high school teacher of American history who believed that race and racism had shaped America far more than it was willing to admit. Not surprisingly, he didn’t think changing my name was a great idea. “Black people know you as Erin Aubry,” he said bluntly. “They’ll resent a name so obviously white and Jewish. It’ll get in your way.” He wasn’t being snide or heroic. One of the many things he’d figured out is that white people showing up in a black space, including the intimate space of a relationship, is seen by many black folks as an incursion, even if they don’t say so. That he understood and was even sympathetic to this view impressed me, but I changed my name anyway. It felt romantic. We were married nearly 15 years. In the summer of 2015, Alan died unexpectedly from complications following a routine surgery. He was only 60. A little more than a year after that, Donald Trump was elected president. Since then I have wrestled with two kinds of grief: losing Alan and losing the singular honesty and clarity he brought to the issue of race not just as my husband but as a white man in America. The griefs are related, one compounding the other. In this new age of racial retrenchment, without the incisiveness Alan brought to our discussions of whiteness and its vastly underestimated impact on the national psyche, I feel more alone than at any other time in my life. Throughout our relationship, we shared a political lens and a common language around the import and meaning of race that was a big part of our intimacy, and part of my certainty that however estranged I might feel from the larger white world, I always had someone at home to talk to. And talk freely: I never had to explain or defend my racial frustrations, anxiety or even paranoia. That isn’t to say Alan agreed with me all the time. We routinely questioned each other’s orthodoxies about white and black. Sparks flew because the stakes were high on both sides, personally and professionally. "
"To the Editor: Re “All Must Rise for Anthem, N.F.L. Insists” (front page, May 24): If commercial football continues to insist that it knows the only way to respect flag, anthem and country, I would see nothing wrong with taking a knee myself in the stands when they play the anthem or fly warplanes over the field. It would cost me nothing — nothing close to the financial risks of some conscientious athletes. I love my country and its songs and flag. I am a Navy veteran whose brother died flying in World War II. So I am secure in my own patriotism, unwilling to be instructed about it by a draft-dodging president or his kowtowing sports flag-wavers. JOHN P. MACKENZIE
LONG ISLAND CITY, QUEENS To the Editor: While I do not disagree that employers have a right to set rules about how their employees represent them on the job, I do take issue with employers misrepresenting and besmirching the employees. The Times quotes Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, as stating that the players’ protests created “a false perception among many that thousands of N.F.L. players were unpatriotic.” The players’ actions did not create this perception. Many on the right, including Donald Trump and Mike Pence, did that. I think it’s time we took a step back and looked at the phenomenon of a group of rich white men who refer to themselves as “owners” telling their mostly black employees to “show some respect.” The players were always clear that this was not about patriotism but about inequality and police brutality. When white owners are telling black men to show some respect by telling them when they can kneel and when they can stand, they have really clarified that this has nothing to do with patriotism and everything to do with racism and control.

EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. To the Editor: Re “The N.F.L. Kneels to Trump” (editorial, May 24): I agree that the N.F.L.’s ham-handed policy to fine teams whose players kneel during the national anthem is silly.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump calls off the North Korea meeting, Burkina Faso cuts ties with Taiwan, and Saudis crack down on female activists. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump has canceled the June 12 summit meeting with Kim Jong-un. He wrote a letter to Mr. Kim citing “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North Koreans. He was referring to Pyongyang’s reaction to comments by Vice President Mike Pence that North Korea could end up like Libya, a model that has always loomed large for North Korea and prompted two threats of withdrawal from talks. A top North Korean official called Mr. Pence’s remarks “ignorant and stupid.” Mr. Trump’s decision came hours after North Korea destroyed its only known nuclear test site, inviting a select group of journalists — but no outside nuclear monitors — to bear witness. One leader may be pleased by Mr. Trump’s cancellation of the meeting: President Xi Jinping of China, who can use his influence with North Korea as leverage while negotiating a trade deal with Washington. _____ "
"Updated on June 1, 2018 They’re back on. President Trump on Friday announced that the summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, would be held after all on June 12 in Singapore. The highly anticipated rendezvous was canceled last week, when Mr. Trump sent an emotional letter to Mr. Kim lamenting the missed opportunities. [Read the text of full letter.] But Mr. Trump, who at times sounded like a jilted partner, also held out the possibility for future talks. “If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit,” he wrote, “please do not hesitate to call me or write.” Which Mr. Kim did. On Friday, a high ranking North Korean emissary delivered a personal note to Mr. Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office. That meeting led the announcement of the makeup. Here are the developments in a rocky relationship that got us to this point: “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,” Mr. Trump told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. “They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump attempted a revolutionary approach to North Korea — a gamble that negotiating prowess and deal-making charm in a face-to-face meeting with Kim Jong-un could accomplish what no American president or diplomat had dared to attempt in the 65 years since an uneasy armistice settled over the Korean Peninsula. It was a bold and innovative approach, and one worth trying, to take on the related goals of a peace treaty and eradicating the North’s now-substantial nuclear arsenal. The fact that it fell on Thursday before getting out of the starting gate, though, underscored how little the two men understood about each other, or how their words and maximalist demands were resonating in Washington and Pyongyang. Mr. Trump approached Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, as if he were a competing property developer haggling over a prized asset — and assumed that, in the end, Mr. Kim would be willing to give it all up for the promise of future prosperity. So he started with threats of “fire and fury,” then turned to surprise initiatives, then gratuitous flattery of one of the world’s more brutal dictators. “He will be safe, he will be happy, his country will be rich,” Mr. Trump said of the North Korean leader on Tuesday, as he met again with Moon Jae-in, the over-optimistic South Korean president whose national security adviser predicted, that same day, it was “99.9 percent” sure that the summit meeting in Singapore would go ahead. But it was already becoming clear to Mr. Trump and his team that the techniques involved in negotiating real estate do not translate easily into negotiations over nuclear weapons. "

"“The Fourth Estate,” which chronicles 16 months in the life of The New York Times, is reasonably competent, but it’s also superficial and oblivious a little more often than one might like. That said, as is the case with the Gray Lady, it’s a good thing that “The Fourth Estate” exists at all. When both the film and the publication are on their A-game, they’re quite good — and occasionally gripping. The documentary, which debuts Sunday on Showtime, also has a lot in common with bloated Netflix dramas, padded and too easily distracted, especially in the first two of its four installments. (The premiere runs 87 minutes, and other segments are about an hour.) It has an irritating habit of darting toward an interesting story and then pivoting away again too quickly. Much of the documentary, which opens on the day Donald J. Trump was inaugurated into office, plods along like a dutiful recap of a show we watched not too long ago. The director Liz Garbus — a veteran documentary filmmaker who received an Oscar nomination for her 2015 film “What Happened, Miss Simone?” — diligently shows what it’s like to work inside a pressure-filled workplace that has no “off” switch. In doing so, she humanizes names like Maggie Haberman and Michael Schmidt, familiar from Twitter and blockbuster stories. It’s odd, though, that so little conflict is on display; it comes as a jarring shock when a reporter talks about how he and some valued colleagues are “at each other’s throats” now and then. It’s hard to delve all that deeply into an institution filled with people who appear to be hyperaware of the scrutiny directed at their workplace, wary of the idea of becoming the story themselves. Add in another distancing factor — a defensive mind-set that often frames critiques of the publication as exercises undertaken in bad faith — and “The Fourth Estate” at times comes off as a portrait of different kinds of awkwardness. The final episode, however, fulfills what was most likely part of the mission statement, as least as far as Times leadership was concerned: to be more accountable and even transparent to The Times’s partisans and critics. In an era in which sexual harassment and other abuses of power have become high-profile stories — in large part due to reporting by The Times — “it was not surprising that, you know, The Times would be in somebody’s sights,” the Washington bureau chief, Elisabeth Bumiller, says in an interview. She’s referring to a November account in Vox of misconduct by the former White House reporter Glenn Thrush, who was suspended for two months after a Times investigation and then reassigned. "
"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday dismissed as “bizarre” and “outrageous” a Democratic senator’s question about whether President Trump’s business interests could be affecting his administration’s foreign policy. In an exchange before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pompeo grew testy when Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, asked how Mr. Trump’s finances might impact his foreign policy decisions. It was the second time in two days that the nation’s new chief diplomat displayed a flash of anger during congressional testimony. “Given that the president refuses to disclose his tax returns, how can you assure the American people that American foreign policy is free of his personal conflicts of interest?” Mr. Udall asked. Mr. Pompeo first dismissed the question as “bizarre” and then grew heated. “I have been incredibly involved in this administration’s foreign policy now for some 16 months, and I have seen literally no evidence of what you are scurrilously, scurrilously suggesting,” Mr. Pompeo said, and then added: “It is an outrageous suggestion.” At a hearing on Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Pompeo also got into a testy exchange with a top Democrat.

"LONDON — The notices are flooding people’s inboxes en masse, from large technology companies, including Facebook and Uber, and even from parent teacher associations, children’s soccer clubs and yoga instructors. “Here is an update to our privacy policy,” they say. All are acting because the European Union on Friday enacts the world’s toughest rules to protect people’s online data. And with the internet’s borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe. In Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook and other tech companies have been working for months to comply with the new rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. The law, which lets people request their online data and restricts how businesses obtain and handle the information, has set off a panic among small businesses and local organizations that have an internet presence. Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe’s lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley’s power. “We want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,” said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in São Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was “pushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward.” Europe is determined to cement its role as the world’s foremost tech watchdog — and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union’s 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies.

"The Trump administration plans to crack down on international students and visitors who overstay their visas, stoking fears in the higher education community that President Trump’s aggressive immigration policies will hinder university efforts to attract the brightest minds from overseas. In a policy memorandum, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced this month that it plans to change how it calculates “unlawful presence” for foreigners in the student visa and exchange program. It will also impose harsher punishments — up to a 10-year ban from the country — for graduates who overstay their visas. The policy, due to take effect in August, has been criticized by higher education institutions and student advocates who say the change shows the indiscriminate nature of the Trump administration’s “America First” policies. They say Mr. Trump’s aggressive immigration efforts are shutting out the nation’s leading scholars, who contribute billions of dollars to the economy in the United States, staff its leading research institutions, support its most high-skilled jobs, and contribute to the president’s own goal of strengthening the pipeline to science, technology, mathematics and engineering jobs. “It is clear that in an attempt to ‘enhance public safety,’ the administration seeks to further close the door on academic talent,” said Jill Welch, the deputy executive director for public policy at Nafsa, the Association of International Educators. “This is yet another policy which makes the United States less attractive to talented international students and scholars.” So far, the president has focused his policy efforts on the nation’s borders, and his harshest rhetoric has targeted gang members. But Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 signaling that visa overstays would also be a target. “Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety,” the order said. "
"Thursday morning’s letter from President Trump to Kim Jong-un, apparently ending their nuclear negotiation bromance, should come as no surprise. But by once again catching American allies off guard and publicly antagonizing North Korea, the administration has further undermined its own leverage. Over the past year, the president has repeatedly underestimated the importance of making real trade-offs in diplomacy. These choices appear to be anathema to his “go big or go home” style of deal-making. The Trump administration has been eager to jettison the “weak,” “terrible” deals negotiated by previous presidents — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate agreement, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. With North Korea, he was seeking something bigger and better, “a very special moment for World Peace.” Instead, the United States may now walk away with nothing. While it’s true that deals like the Iran nuclear agreement had inherent shortcomings, they also effectively advanced America’s national security. In fact, their limitations reflect a hard-nosed assessment of the risk of the alternatives, the broader geostrategic interests in play and the constraints on America’s leverage. In diplomacy, every deal is an imperfect deal. The question is, how imperfect? And at what cost? Unless you can produce a better alternative, tossing out a less-than-perfect agreement that does advance some concrete goals is an exercise in peril. “Repeal” is almost always simpler than “replace.” There may still be time to avoid the all-or-nothing trap with North Korea. While it will not be easy to overcome the fallout of provoking a thin-skinned dictator, the United States might now have a chance to focus on a more credible strategy: a deal that constrains, even if it does not immediately eliminate, North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs without offering unacceptable concessions in return. Whether such a deal is possible depends on Mr. Trump’s ability to embrace the art of the imperfect deal. Developing a stronger negotiating strategy requires acknowledging the obvious: The United States has less leverage than it thinks in this negotiation. Over the last few months, the Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that near-term denuclearization is achievable. This assessment flies in the face of North Korea’s pointed recent statements and long history to the contrary, and it contradicts a new Pentagon report that suggests Mr. Kim views nuclear weapons as essential. No amount of wishful thinking, or even the possibility of reduced American sanctions, will change this reality. The Trump administration will also need to address the divisions among its partners in the region, where Mr. Trump’s inconsistency has weakened his hand in negotiations and allowed our Asian partners to more skillfully maneuver toward their own goals. "
"The Trump administration, over the objections of lawmakers, is continuing to try to soften its punishment of ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications firm that has emerged as a key sticking point in trade negotiations between China and the United States. The company is on the verge of shutting down after the United States banned it from buying American components and has become a bargaining chip between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, as the two leaders work to resolve a brewing trade war. Mr. Xi asked Mr. Trump to revisit the ZTE decision because thousands of Chinese jobs could be lost if the company is shuttered. On Thursday, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said the administration was considering placing an American compliance team inside ZTE to ensure that the company was meeting its requirements and not violating sanctions. The company was punished for violating United States sanctions against Iran and North Korea and then lying about it. “We’re developing a matrix of things and while we haven’t come quite to a final decision yet, we think there may very well be an alternative that will be quite punitive to them, but really modify behavior,” Mr. Ross said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. It is not clear if China would allow the United States to exert such a high level of control over a company that is controlled by the Chinese state, but Mr. Ross insisted that the Trump administration had substantial leverage in the matter. ZTE buys many of its components from American companies, including the San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm. In return for lifting the ban on purchasing American components, the administration could be considering a substantial fine, changes to ZTE’s management and other limits on its ability to operate in the United States. "
"President Trump’s abrupt decision to cancel the planned summit meeting with Kim Jong-un is not surprising, given the decades of volatile relations between the United States and North Korea. It’s also not necessarily bad news — if it means that the Trump administration will now take the time to do the preparation needed to make such a high-stakes meeting successful. But it will prove deeply regrettable, and ultimately dangerous, if it winds up meaning that the two hotheaded leaders sulk off and resume the schoolyard taunts that they exchanged over the past 16 months. That would only make conflagration more likely. In yet another sign of Mr. Trump’s carelessness even with his allies, he failed to consult with South Korea, which had helped broker the meeting, before calling it off. “We are trying to figure out what President Trump’s intention is and the exact meaning of it,” a South Korean spokesman said. Even under American administrations that brought more time, expertise and discipline to the task, negotiations and engagement with North Korea have proceeded in fits and starts, ultimately ending in failure and greater mistrust. We hope the president can now find a way to continue the dialogue with Pyongyang and reschedule the meeting, as he suggested he was willing to do in his breakup letter to Mr. Kim on Thursday. Late Thursday, a North Korean vice foreign minister, Kim Kye-gwan, said his government is set “to resolving problems at any time in any way.” Mr. Trump made the right call when he abandoned Republican orthodoxy by pursuing diplomacy with North Korea and, in an impulsive stroke, agreeing to meet Mr. Kim on June 12 in Singapore. It would have been the first face-to-face encounter between American and North Korean leaders since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953. Since engaging with North Korea, Mr. Trump has scored some diplomatic gains. After halting nuclear and missile tests and releasing three American detainees, the North Koreans on Thursday apparently blew up their only known nuclear test site. Of course, having made those concessions, Mr. Kim may now feel he needs to do something to demonstrate that he is not truckling to the Americans. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook and Twitter announced plans on Thursday to increase transparency of political campaign ads, changes aimed at preventing foreign manipulation of the coming midterm elections. Facebook said it would begin including a “paid for” label on the top of any political ads in the United States. Clicking on the label will take people to a page where they can view the cost of the ad and the demographic breakdown of the audience that viewed the ad. Facebook also promised to keep an archive of all political ads for the next seven years, or through a full congressional election cycle. The ads are available to Facebook members at facebook.com/politicalcontentads. Twitter said it planned to restrict who could run political ads on its service, requiring those running political ads for federal elections to identity themselves and certify that they are in the United States. Foreign nationals will not be able to target political ads to people in the United States, Twitter said. In addition, Twitter said it would start giving prominent visual cues, including a badge and a disclaimer, to campaign ads. Accounts used for political campaigning must have a profile photo , and any advertiser’s Twitter biography must include a website link that provides valid contact information. Candidates and political committees will be required to provide their identification number from the Federal Election Commission. Those who are not registered must submit a notarized form. Enforcement of the policy will begin this summer. "

"President Trump made a version of this claim on Wednesday morning, misquoting James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama. It was not true at the time and it remains inaccurate. Mr. Clapper was asked on “The View” on Tuesday whether the F.B.I. was spying on Mr. Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election. “No, they were not. They were spying on, a term I don’t particularly like, but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage or influence, which is what they do,” he responded. As The New York Times wrote on Wednesday: Mr. Clapper made several other television appearances following Mr. Trump’s claim on Wednesday. Throughout, he maintained that F.B.I. agents did not infiltrate Mr. Trump’s campaign for political purposes. He also repeatedly called the use of an informant “benign.” Here’s what Mr. Clapper said in a CNN interview on Wednesday afternoon: And on PBS NewsHour on Wednesday night:   "
"Donald Trump is squandering the best chance the United States has had in years to remake the bilateral trade relationship with China. It’s a remarkable turn of events. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised that, if elected, he would bring wholesale change to what he called a “totally unfair” trading relationship. That hasn’t happened. Instead, a Chinese trade delegation left Washington on May 19 without agreeing to any of the structural market reforms, such as an end to subsidies for advanced technology companies, that Trump administration officials were seeking. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin walked back threatened tariffs, and the president himself inexplicably introduced the idea of resuscitating ZTE, the Chinese telecom giant that faced a crippling United States export ban after violating American embargoes against Iran and North Korea. With the tariffs removed, what did the Chinese side offer? The purchase of more American agriculture and energy products, which they would have done anyway, and lower tariffs on auto imports, a concession they had already agreed to weeks ago. By May 20, the Chinese state media had announced that the trade war was off, and Secretary Mnuchin confirmed it on a Sunday morning talk show. The president then retired to Twitter to defend these results as a great win for American agriculture exports, as if that was the point all along. If a trade war has been averted, what kind of peace is this? Chinese officials didn’t concede to anything of substance. Mr. Trump has often said China is “laughing at us.” After this round of negotiations, China must be laughing directly at him. "
"The California primary is June 5. It’s one of the most anticipated voting days in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections. LOS ANGELES — It was supposed to be a cutting-edge election reform, a way to take the party out of politics: an open primary in which labels like Republican and Democratic were tossed out and candidates were chosen, presumably, on their merits. The system, adopted by California voters in 2010, was meant to make politics less polarizing. But eight years later, the highest-stakes midterm election in a long time is causing all sorts of angst for Democrats and Republicans in California. And that’s in no small part because of what is known as the jungle primary. O.K., before we get to how it’s working, can you explain the system? In the old days, each party nominated a candidate — at a party convention or in a primary — with the idea that a Republican and a Democrat would face off in the November election. In theory, that would present voters with a choice of two governing philosophies. But critics — including Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was the Republican governor at the time — argued that the system was producing ideologically extreme candidates who were forced to appeal to the most fervent wings of their party, and that was leading to gridlock instead of governance. The solution? An open, nonpartisan primary in June, with the first- and second-place candidates heading to the November election, no matter which party they represented. The theory was that candidates would be forced to moderate their appeals to win a broader section of the electorate. That sounds reasonable enough. So what’s the problem? Election reforms that might sound good in a political science class produce, as often as not, unintended consequences. And at the time, party leaders from both sides in California warned that one such consequence of the top-two system could be that major parties would get shut out in the primary, leading to a November ballot between two candidates from the same party. That would happen if multiple candidates from the same party crowded the ballot, canceling each other out as they divided a finite group of voters. And what kind of choice would that be? "
"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — The giant banner hanging above Cynthia Nixon’s head was as clear as it was ominous: “Welcome to the lions’ den.” Technically, the sign was for the mascots of Hofstra University, where New York Democrats were gathered for their state convention. But it was a more than fitting welcome for Ms. Nixon into a convention hall in the tight grasp of her rival, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. With the sign looming above, Ms. Nixon addressed the party’s progressive caucus on Wednesday without the aid of a microphone, straining to be heard. Nearby, the party’s executive leadership was meeting in a space fully equipped for audio amplification. “This is his turf,” Ms. Nixon said knowingly. The two-day Democratic convention, which concluded on Thursday with Mr. Cuomo’s formal acceptance of his party’s backing, punctuates the challenge facing Ms. Nixon’s insurgent candidacy; to win, she must expand her appeal beyond the faction of die-hard activists who despise Mr. Cuomo, to the broader Democratic electorate. In a 45-minute speech on Thursday before delegates cheering “four more years,” Mr. Cuomo cast New York as the bulwark of Democratic politics against a Republican-controlled Washington. “New York is the alternative state to Trump’s America,” Mr. Cuomo said moments before a celebratory balloon drop.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump on Wednesday continued his barrage of attacks on the F.B.I. and the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Trump has been suggesting over the past few days that the F.B.I. embedded a “spy” within his 2016 presidential campaign, but he has provided no evidence of this. On Wednesday, he began using the term “spygate” to describe those accusations. Stephen Colbert said that Trump should pick a more original phrase, pointing out that spygate has been used before. Trump sent out a tweet suggesting spygate represented a comeuppance for the F.B.I. — a suggestion Colbert called hard to justify. Jimmy Kimmel made fun of Trump for a different, pithier tweet he sent on Wednesday. In an interview this week, the CBS journalist Lesley Stahl claimed President Trump once told her that he deliberately attacks journalists in order to “discredit” them in the public eye. Kimmel said the statement sounded atypical of Trump, in one big way. See if you can figure out whether these people are still living with their parents. David Blaine remains astonishing. Anne Hathaway, a star in the new movie “Ocean’s Eight,” will talk with Colbert on Thursday. A conversation with the cast of “Arrested Development” got very raw very quickly. "
"BEIJING — President Trump’s decision on Thursday to cancel his planned summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, will disappoint some allies in Asia, hearten others — and perhaps put China in the strongest position of all. Mr. Trump’s announcement put the brakes on disarmament negotiations that had been hurtling ahead at an unprecedented pace. Instead of a meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump vowed that “our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest in history, and maximum pressure campaign will continue.” But applying that pressure depends in large part on cooperation from China, which may now be able to use any delays in negotiations with North Korea to its advantage in trade talks with the United States. Much will depend, of course, on how North Korea reacts to Mr. Trump’s decision to pull out of the talks. After a year of breakthrough missile launches and a sixth nuclear test, Mr. Kim abruptly put his nation on a path toward peace — suspending weapons tests, releasing American prisoners and, just hours before Mr. Trump’s announcement, destroying its nuclear test site. It is unclear how Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the meeting with Mr. Kim will affect the internal politics of North Korea’s secretive regime. If Mr. Kim feels compelled to resume weapons tests and his drive to demonstrate that he can strike the United States with a nuclear warhead, the region will be on edge once again. But if he refrains, Mr. Kim may have already earned enough good will among his neighbors — especially China, his country’s main trading partner — to see some softening of the economic sanctions against his isolated nation, without agreeing to give up his nuclear arsenal. "
"If it seems as if the noose is tightening around women’s access to abortion, that’s because it is. Iowa just enacted a flagrantly unconstitutional law to ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected — at about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they’re pregnant. Mississippi recently banned abortion at 15 weeks, a point well before fetal viability and thus also clearly unconstitutional. A similar bill in Louisiana cleared the legislature and is on the governor’s desk. And of course there’s the Trump administration’s plan to forbid medical professionals in clinics that receive federal money from providing their patients with pertinent and truthful information about abortion. This proposal, aimed at Planned Parenthood, is a clear suppression of free speech that flies in the face of the robust First Amendment that has evolved since the Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4 vote, upheld an earlier abortion gag rule 27 years ago. Some or all of these measures will reach the Supreme Court in due course. Indeed, part of the anti-abortion strategy is to serve up a diet of far-fetched cases: While there is no chance the Supreme Court will uphold the fetal heartbeat law, a defeat serves the greater purpose of keeping the base attentive to the court and motivated at the polls. There is a case already at the court that presents the justices with a more immediate test. It is scheduled for consideration at Thursday’s private conference, where the justices decide which new cases to accept. At issue is whether the court will choose to respond to a bold act of judicial defiance: the refusal by a federal appeals court to apply the Supreme Court’s most recent abortion precedent to a situation that is all but indistinguishable. The new case is an appeal by Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma from a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Eighth Circuit refused to block an Arkansas law that requires doctors who provide medication abortions — the two-pill regimen that is used during the first nine weeks of pregnancy — to have a contract with an obstetrician/gynecologist who has hospital admitting privileges. Two years ago, in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Supreme Court overturned a Texas law that required doctors who provided abortions either by surgery or medication to have admitting privileges in a local hospital. The court concluded that there was no demonstrable need for the requirement and that any health-related benefit would be outweighed by the drastic limitation the law would have imposed on access to abortion in Texas. The law, which also imposed new physical requirements on abortion clinics, would have led two-thirds of the state’s clinics to close, leaving large areas of Texas without an abortion provider. "
"There has been no shortage of analysis of Donald Trump’s rhetorical tics, the way he overuses particular phrases, the way he falls back on others. The way he lies. The way he threatens, bullies and whines with language. All of these observations are at different points hilarious or infuriating, abundantly silly or deadly serious. But there is a strand of these that I find significant: the way Trump’s use of indeterminate language is a way of weakening the fundamental supports of truth itself. Truth is absolute. Things happened or they didn’t, at a particular time. They can be counted and accounted for. But not the way Trump constructs language. It is not just his outright lies that degrade our discourse; it is also his use of language that muddles to the point of meaninglessness, language that rejects exactitude, language that elevates imprecision as a device to avoid being discovered in his deceit. He uses this language to give a false impression that he knows that which he clearly doesn’t, to blame or to bolster, to pretend that he has developed a plan of action rather than admit that he is acting extemporaneously. It all fits into the illusion of competence Trump has built for himself, a fake it-is-how-you-make-it philosophy of advancement in which being studious is for stooges, a world in which passionate vocalization, even of gibberish, is far more valuable than knowledgeable elucidation of fact. "
"There has always been a relatively innocent and eminently plausible interpretation for why Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had so many suspicious ties to Russia. Let’s review: First, the candidate himself took an indulgent view of Vladimir Putin. This was naïve, but it was no crime: Barack Obama also sought rapprochement with Moscow in 2008, despite Russia’s invasion of Georgia that year and the Kremlin’s notorious human-rights abuses. Second, Trump had extensive business ties to Russians, both as customers and partners. This, too, isn’t criminal, even if some of those customers and partners were. Third, Trump ran a chaos campaign. It lacked the kind of vetting procedures that might have excluded political grifters like Paul Manafort or Carter Page. Trump hired Manafort in part because he owned an apartment in Trump Tower and promised to work for free. Page came aboard on the casual recommendation of Ed Cox, chairman of the New York Republican Party. Fourth, Trump talks (or tweets) a lot of trash. When, at a rally in October 2016, he said “I love WikiLeaks!” because of its publication of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s hacked emails, did the candidate even understand that the U.S. government saw WikiLeaks as a vehicle for Russian political interference? Perhaps not. Finally, Trump was ill-served by his inept son, Don Jr., whose bungled efforts to solicit damaging information on Hillary Clinton from a Russian lawyer would have constituted collusion, if anything had come of it. But Trump himself claims to have been unaware of the infamous Trump Tower meeting at the time. "
"President Trump has an almost Apollonian daytime argument in favor of his continued political dominance, which is “Jobs Jobs Jobs!,” “MAGA!” and so forth. He also has a nighttime argument about decline, racial resentment and ethnic hatred. He pushes both strains hard, but the evidence suggests that his heart is really in the hate. Through gut (or gutter) instinct, Trump has adopted a political strategy designed to exploit anger at and resentment toward immigrants as well as racial and ethnic minorities. This is the linchpin of his approach to the 2020 election. Trump’s demonization of nonwhites was and remains essential to his takeover of the Republican Party. His unabashed embrace of insults, epithets and name-calling is well established. In January, my colleagues David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick argued in The Times that I asked Stephen Utych, a political scientist at Boise State and the author of a 2017 paper, “How Dehumanization Influences Attitudes toward Immigrants,” whether he saw Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric as part of a larger political war plan. He wrote back by email: This tactic, Utych added, “denies out-groups traits that are uniquely human — things such as the ability to reason, think critically, or feel emotions.” In fact, well before the 2016 election, the white American electorate was becoming increasingly receptive to derogatory language as adherence to standards of the liberal democratic tradition had already begun to waver. Steven Miller and Nicholas Davis, political scientists at Clemson University and Texas A&M, report on poll data collected by the World Values Survey between 1995 and 2011 in their recent paper, “White Outgroup Intolerance and Declining Support for American Democracy”: Intolerance, they continue, Because the Miller-Davis study is based on survey data collected well before the 2016 election, the two authors write, “our analysis might undersell the strength of the relationship between intolerance and anti-democratic attitudes.” Their research suggests that anti-democratic attitudes are on the rise. The percentage of whites who qualified as socially intolerant doubled from 12.6 percent in 1995 to 24.9 percent in 2011, when the most recent World Values Survey was conducted. If that rate of increase were to continue, the percentage of whites in 2020 who would qualify as intolerant would be almost a third. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump has canceled the June 12 summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, citing in a letter to Mr. Kim this morning “tremendous anger and open hostility” from the North Koreans. Read the full letter here. Earlier today, a top official from the North had said that remarks by Vice President Mike Pence were “ignorant and stupid” and could lead Pyongyang to reconsider the talks. • Mr. Trump’s decision came the same day North Korea destroyed its only known nuclear test site, inviting a select group of journalists — but no outside nuclear monitors — to bear witness. It is unclear if the mountainous Punggye-ri test site, where North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests, was dismantled in a way that would allow it to be used again. • “If I were Jared Kushner, I’d be sighing a breath of relief today.” That was a veteran Washington lawyer summing up the news that President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser had been granted his security clearance after an extended F.B.I. background check. Mr. Kushner had spent the first year of the administration working under provisional clearances. White House officials had said the long process was not unusual, but some observers had wondered if Mr. Kushner faced problems because of the special counsel’s investigation of his meetings with Russians. • Separately on Wednesday, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Trump’s practice of blocking Twitter users who criticize him is unconstitutional, a decision that will have implications far beyond the president. We spoke to some of those blocked. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — The moment had been portrayed by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as a show of good faith ahead of his meeting with President Trump: the destruction of North Korea’s only known nuclear test site. With foreign journalists watching on Thursday, the North Koreans detonated explosives to destroy tunnels and buildings at the site in the country’s remote mountains. But then, only hours later, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled the June 12 summit meeting, turning North Korea’s seeming gesture of good will into a potential embarrassment by its longtime enemy, the United States. Mr. Trump’s move blindsided the North Koreans so completely that the invited foreign journalists learned about the cancellation on their smartphones — even before some of their hosts did. One of the journalists, Will Ripley from CNN, read the text of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal letter to their official North Korean chaperones on the return train ride from the remote nuclear test site, Punggye-ri. “I can tell you there was a real sense of shock,” Mr. Ripley said in a phone interview with CNN. “They immediately got up and left.” Mr. Trump’s letter to Mr. Kim attributed the cancellation to what the American president called the “tremendous anger and open hostility” displayed by North Korean officials in recent statements. But the timing of the letter coincided almost precisely with North Korea’s public relations effort to present itself as transparent and flexible on the nuclear issue. "
"Elon Musk, the billionaire who has ambitions to colonize Mars and whose companies make electric vehicles and rockets, spent part of his Wednesday criticizing an already beleaguered and much-maligned group of humans on Earth. Yes, Mr. Musk, 46, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, could not help unloading on the news media — members of which have written articles, especially in recent months, about the many problems that have plagued his companies. (Among them: delays in the production of Model 3s; a deadly crash that occurred when a Model X’s Autopilot system was engaged; and questions about Tesla’s ability to pay off its debt amid continued quarterly losses.) In a series of tweets that ranged from bizarre to pithy, Mr. Musk called the media “holier-than-thou,” argued it had lost its credibility, blamed it for the election of President Trump, and suggested that journalists wrote negative stories about Tesla because they seek page views and because companies that make cars that rely on gas and diesel — some of Tesla’s competitors — “are among world’s biggest advertisers.” He also proposed creating what he called a “media credibility rating site,” which he suggested calling “Pravda” — the Russian word for “truth” and also the name of a longtime Communist newspaper.

The irony, of course, is that Mr. Musk and his companies have benefited greatly from media coverage, as Dan Primack of Axios points out. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A day after 200 faculty members at the University of Southern California demanded that the university president, C.L. Max Nikias, step down, the Academic Senate officially called on him to resign, saying that “new leadership is in the best interest of the university now and going forward.” Earlier Wednesday, the executive committee of the board of trustees announced plans to hire an independent lawyer and conduct a full investigation “into the misconduct and reporting failures that occurred at the U.S.C. student health center.” The vote and investigation, which is likely to take months, come a week after U.S.C. officials said they should have acted more quickly to dismiss and report Dr. George Tyndall, who was the primary gynecologist at the student health center for decades. An internal investigation had found that Dr. Tyndall performed pelvic exams inappropriately and made comments that amounted to sexual harassment, but university officials allowed the doctor to resign quietly with a payout, rather than report him to the medical board. The revelations have led to considerable outrage — The Los Angeles Times’s editorial board called for Mr. Nikias to step down and a petition started by a former student body president that also called for his resignation had gathered more than 3,000 signatures by Wednesday. The nearly unanimous vote of elected faculty representatives came hours after a packed town hall meeting with hundreds of professors who voiced frustration with Mr. Nikias and called for a no-confidence vote. There were 24 votes in favor of the resolution and four abstentions, but no votes opposing it. "
"The new super-skinny 432 Park is one of the five most expensive condo buildings in New York City, according to the most recent CityRealty 100, an index of Manhattan’s priciest condominiums. Some older buildings made the top five as well, including the 2008 Trump International, at 1 Central Park West, which has been appreciating in value. The index uses information on recent sales to calculate investment potential. And while there is some subjectivity involved in determining which 100 condominiums are included, the units in every building on the list must sell for at least $1,000 a square foot on average, and all buildings must be south of West 125th Street, Central Park North (110th Street) and East 96th Street. For the year ending March 31, 2018, the average price per square foot of homes in the buildings on the list was $2,445 — or about $1.22 million for a 500-square-foot apartment. But the top five buildings were much more expensive: In those condominiums, one square foot, about the amount of floor space occupied by a pair of Gucci slippers, sold for an average of more than $5,000.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday pulled out of a highly anticipated summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, accusing the North Koreans of bad faith and lamenting that “this missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history.” The president made his announcement in a remarkably personal, at times mournful-sounding letter to Mr. Kim, North Korea’s leader, in which he cited the North’s “tremendous anger and open hostility” in recent public statements as the specific reason for canceling the meeting. Mr. Trump said later that the meeting, which had been scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, could still happen, and North Korea issued a strikingly conciliatory response, saying it hoped Mr. Trump would reconsider. The president emphasized that conciliatory tone with a tweet early Friday, saying “the warm and productive statement from North Korea” could lead “hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace.” But Mr. Trump also renewed talk of military action against the North and vowed to keep pressing economic sanctions, guaranteeing that for now, at least, his unlikely courtship of Mr. Kim will give way to a more familiar cycle of threats and tension.

"President Trump on Thursday sent a letter to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, canceling their highly anticipated summit on June 12 to discuss denuclearization. Mr. Trump dictated the entire letter on Thursday morning, according to a senior administration official. [Read more about the president’s decision to cancel the meeting.] The following is the text of that letter, as released by the White House, with annotations by The Times’s David E. Sanger. ______________________________ The Trump administration, especially Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has taken to calling Kim Jong-un “Chairman Kim.” It has echoes of Mao. The United States was “informed” of the request by South Korea, but Mr. Kim himself confirmed it to Mr. Pompeo. This was shorthand for saying, “Hey, this meeting was your idea.” "
"A Border Patrol agent shot and killed a woman who had crossed the border illegally near Laredo, Tex., on Wednesday after the officer came under attack, federal authorities said. The officer was searching for “illegal activity” in a culvert on a residential street in Rio Bravo, a border town about seven miles south of Laredo, when a group of undocumented immigrants started to hit him with “blunt objects,” United States Customs and Border Protection said. The officer, whose name was not released, fired at least one shot with his handgun, fatally striking the woman in the head. A woman who lives next door to the site of the shooting disputed the federal agency’s account of the events, saying that the property does not have a culvert and that she did not see any weapons that the group could have used. “They were on the very corner on that lot where there was a tree,” the woman, Marta V. Martinez, said in an interview Thursday morning. “There was no weapon. They were hiding.” The confrontation, which unfolded shortly before 12:30 p.m. on an empty lot about a quarter mile from the Rio Grande, came at a time when the Border Patrol agency is under intense pressure from President Trump to crack down on unauthorized immigration. Ms. Martinez said the gunshot rang out about 10 feet from her house. “I didn’t hear any yelling or ‘stop’ or ‘don’t run,’” she said. "
"In a sense, all books are black box flight data recorders: They put us at the scene and grant us access to conversations and events we couldn’t otherwise witness, even when the flights in question are only (or “only”) flights of fancy. But the metaphor is especially apt for this week’s list of recommended titles, which includes Rachel Slade’s “Into the Raging Sea” — a true-life disaster tale that’s heavily informed by the actual black box recovered from the wreck of the cargo ship El Faro. Other books this week drop us into the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide (“The Girl Who Smiled Beads”), unexpected motherhood (“And Now We Have Everything”) and Eleanor Roosevelt’s relationship with the reporter Lorena Hickok (“White Houses”). And since books, unlike black boxes, can also show us what people are thinking, we have two books puzzling out the fate of democracies, one taking on the modern world’s biggest ideas, and a posthumous collection of psychologically astute stories from a master of the form, William Trevor. As with El Faro, the best thing about black boxes is their ability to resurrect the dead. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books WHEN EINSTEIN WALKED WITH GÖDEL: Excursions to the Edge of Thought, by Jim Holt. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) In these essays, taken from the last 20 years, Jim Holt writes about infinity and the infinitesimal, the illusion of time, the birth of eugenics, the so-called new atheism, smartphones and distraction, among other weighty subjects. This is an elegant history of recent ideas. “Holt is an amphibious kind of writer, so capably slipping from theology to cosmology to poetry, you’re reminded that specialization is a modern invention,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. “Part of what makes Holt so exciting is his ability to gather these disciplines under his shingle, to make their knottiest questions not only intelligible but enticing, without sacrificing rigor.” LAST STORIES, by William Trevor. (Viking, $26.) The great Irish writer, who died in 2016 at the age of 88, captured turning points in individual lives with effective understatement. This seemingly quiet but ultimately volcanic collection is his final gift to us, and it is filled with action sprung from human feeling. “His stories open with comments so blandly informational, so plain and unnoticeable, that they arouse no expectation and appear to promise little,” Cynthia Ozick writes in her review. “Yet such flat and unhurried beginnings are subversions concealing a powerful slyness. Trevor’s stories traffic in plots, fated or willed, and hurtful. They may be coiled in pity, but they are never benign.” FASCISM: A Warning, by Madeleine Albright with Bill Woodward. (Harper/HarperCollins, $27.99.) Drawing on her long experience in government service and as an educator, the former secretary of state warns about a new rise of fascism around the world, and cautions America not to turn its back. “Albright worries that Trump’s isolationism, protectionism and fondness for dictators are eroding America’s ability to lead and help solve international challenges,” our reviewer, Sheri Berman, writes. “Despite all this, Albright is hopeful. She ends her book referencing leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela, who helped their countries move past periods of intense violence and division. Democracy’s problems can, Albright assures us, be overcome — but only if we recognize history’s lessons and never take democracy for granted.” INTO THE RAGING SEA: Thirty-Three Mariners, One Megastorm, and the Sinking of the El Faro, by Rachel Slade. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $27.99.) Pieced together from texts, emails and black box recordings, this is a tense, moment-by-moment account of the 2015 sinking of the cargo ship El Faro during Hurricane Joaquin. According to Douglas Preston’s review, it “makes for a powerful and affecting story, beautifully handled by Slade, a journalist who clearly knows ships and the sea. The book tells of the heroic search-and-rescue operations, the hunt for the black box, the investigations and hearings and the nature of hurricanes. … One can’t help reading it, page after page, in disbelief and disgust.” "
"On its 60th anniversary, the civilian age of nuclear power in America appears to be almost over. But with the country awash in radioactive waste and plutonium stockpiled for warheads, the task of managing this atomic legacy grows ever more urgent. Opening a long-delayed waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada is imperative. President Dwight Eisenhower formally opened America’s first commercial nuclear power station at Shippingport, Pa., near Pittsburgh, on May 26, 1958. He declared it would “put the atom to work for the good of mankind, not his destruction.” His nuclear cheerleader, Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, had promised power “too cheap to meter.” Today, with cheap gas and falling prices for wind and solar energy, nuclear power is often now too expensive to sell. Six plants closed from 2013 to 2017. At least seven more — from the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey to the Diablo Canyon plant in California — have been earmarked for final shutdown, often years before their operating licenses expire. About a quarter of the nation’s nuclear power plants don’t cover their operating costs, according to a recent analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. America is still the world’s leading generator of nuclear power. But economics, more even than environmental concerns, is consigning nuclear power in its present form to history’s technological trash can. With well over a third of the country’s power reactors over 40 years old, the questions now are how long the accountants will allow them to keep going and what we will do with these power plants and the radioactive waste they produced. President Eisenhower’s “atoms for peace” program was a spinoff from the nuclear weapons industry. The world’s first large nuclear reactors, erected at Hanford in Washington State in the 1940s, turned uranium fuel into plutonium for use in nuclear warheads. The Cold War production at Hanford has left the country with all the plutonium it could possibly need. The surplus 54 tons, mostly stockpiled at a weapons assembly plant northeast of Amarillo, Tex., is enough to be recycled into tens of thousands of new warheads. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s chief of staff and a White House lawyer representing the president in the Russia investigation were present on Thursday at the start of two classified meetings requested by members of Congress to review sensitive material about the F.B.I.’s use of an informant in the inquiry. The two men left both meetings after sharing introductory remarks “to relay the president’s desire for as much openness as possible under the law” and before officials began to brief the lawmakers, the White House said in a statement. But the presence of John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and Emmet T. Flood, the president’s lawyer, infuriated Democrats, and legal experts said their visit, at the least, could give off the appearance that the White House abused its authority to gain insight into an investigation that implicates the president. The president’s legal team was unapologetic. “We are certainly entitled to know” what information the government has on the F.B.I. informant, Rudolph W. Giuliani, another lawyer representing Mr. Trump in the investigation, said in an interview. The meeting “cuts off a long subpoena,” he said, referring to a legal fight for the information. At least two lawmakers participating in the briefings told Mr. Flood to his face that his presence was inappropriate. “Although he did not participate in the meetings which followed, as the White House’s attorney handling the special counsel’s investigation, his involvement — in any capacity — was entirely improper,” Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. "
"WASHINGTON — For more than 100 years, Jack Johnson’s legend as the first black heavyweight boxing champion has been undisputed, but his legacy had been tarnished by a racially tainted criminal conviction. His battles against white opponents, in the ring and outside of it, gave rise to “The Great White Hope” play and movie and he came to be lionized as a barrier breaker. But the criminal conviction from 1913 that most would find abhorrent today — for transporting a white woman across state lines — haunted Johnson well after his death in 1946 and motivated politicians and celebrities for years to advocate for a pardon, however symbolic. On Thursday in the Oval Office, Johnson posthumously found an unexpected champion: President Trump. Although his own record on civil rights has come under question, often harshly, Mr. Trump, flanked by boxing champions and Sylvester Stallone, the actor who brought the case to his attention, signed an order pardoning Johnson. The president called Johnson “a truly great fighter” who “had a tough life” but served 10 months in federal prison “for what many view as a racially motivated injustice.” Mr. Trump said the conviction took place during a “period of tremendous racial tension in the United States.” Mr. Trump has often found himself in the center of fiery debates over race and sports, and civil rights in general, repeatedly admonishing N.F.L. players, a majority of them black, who have knelt during the national anthem at games to protest racism and police brutality.

"This isn’t diplomacy that President Trump is practicing with Kim Jong-un. It’s a roller-coaster ride — and it may be leading us to a more dangerous period in relations with North Korea. Trump again proved his exceptional talent on Thursday by following his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal with his cancellation of the June 12 summit meeting with Kim; few presidents manage such diplomatic ineptitude over a four-year term, let alone in a single month. Then a day later, Trump suggested that the meeting could be rescheduled after all — maybe even back on June 12. Man, those inscrutable Occidentals! I’ve been covering and visiting North Korea since the 1980s, and this may be the moment of greatest risk and opportunity. It is maddening that the U.S. is handling the moment so chaotically. North Korea’s initial response to the cancellation was calm and conciliatory, presumably because Kim wants the summit and because he wishes to appear more statesmanlike than Trump. If restraint doesn’t succeed soon, then the risk is that we’re back to confrontation — and if so, look out. Kim may choose to create a new crisis, perhaps by conducting a missile test or an atmospheric nuclear test (which could send radiation drifting toward the U.S.). The U.S. could respond to new tensions by sending B-1 bombers off the coast of North Korea. If North Korea scrambled aircraft or fired antiaircraft missiles, we could very quickly have an enormous escalation. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. For tactical reasons, I’m not a big fan of kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest. I worry that kneeling N.F.L. players distract from their important political message — calling out police violence against African-Americans — and needlessly alienate otherwise persuadable people. (I’ve made the full case here and here and discussed the players’ broader protest movement here.) But if kneeling is problematic because it seems unpatriotic, the N.F.L.’s response is outrageous because it actually is unpatriotic. By instituting a policy yesterday to punish players who exercise their right of free expression by kneeling, the league is rejecting a basic American value. Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, and the league’s owners are evidently so insecure about their own patriotism that they have felt the need to bully their employees into a ritual sign of respect. “I am a fan of free speech on college campuses,” E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post tweeted. “So I ask my conservative friends who talk about this issue so much if they will also stand up for protesting #NFL players. Or do they think owners can make stadiums conservative ‘safe spaces’ where even silent protest is banned?” The Daily Beast’s Jay Michaelson notes that the N.F.L. is for-profit entertainment that receives huge subsidies from American taxpayers. His piece is headlined, “The NFL Can Punish Kneeling Players Because It’s a Private Corporation. Let’s Start Taxing It Like One.” "
