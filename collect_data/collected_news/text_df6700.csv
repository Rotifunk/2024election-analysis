"WASHINGTON — Trade clashes with Europe are brewing. Border tensions with Mexico are boiling. Negotiations with North Korea and Iran are murky as ever. What can Americans expect in these uncertain times? We’ll see what happens. President Trump, a new-to-the-game politician who once campaigned on a promise of “I alone can fix it,” has spent the past month speaking with a decidedly less definitive stance, shrugging off a series of diplomatic high-wire acts that may come to define his presidency with a bit of well-worn Trumpese. “We’ll see,” when a reporter asked Mr. Trump on Tuesday whether he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to arrange peace talks between North and South Korea. “We’ll see what happens, I often say,” the president said a day earlier about relations with North Korea, apparently aware of his tendency to take an indefinite view on timely negotiations. “So the end result is, we’ll see,” Mr. Trump said last week, again broaching the summit meeting with North Korea. At least two dozen times in the past month, the president appears to have shifted into full-on verbal tic mode, deploying some variation of “We’ll see what happens” as a cast of world leaders from France, the Baltic States, Japan and Nigeria rotated in and out of the White House or his Florida estate. Mr. Trump’s one-person guessing game came into play as he addressed topics including Mexico, Nafta, Russia, Amazon, North Korea, Mike Pompeo, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Iran and the special counsel’s investigation into his presidential campaign. "
"The embattled political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica announced on Wednesday that it would cease most operations and file for bankruptcy amid growing legal and political scrutiny of its business practices and work for Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. The decision was made less than two months after Cambridge Analytica and Facebook became embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal that compromised the personal information of up to 87 million people. Revelations about the misuse of data, published in March by The New York Times and The Observer of London, plunged Facebook into crisis and prompted regulators and lawmakers to open investigations into Cambridge Analytica. In a statement posted to its website, Cambridge Analytica said the controversy had driven away virtually all of the company’s customers, forcing it to file for bankruptcy in both the United States and Britain. The elections division of Cambridge’s British affiliate, SCL Group, will also shut down, the company said. But the company’s announcement left several questions unanswered, including who would retain the company’s intellectual property — the so-called psychographic voter profiles built in part with data from Facebook — and whether Cambridge Analytica’s data-mining business would return under new auspices. “Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company’s statement said. Cambridge Analytica also said the results of an independent investigation it had commissioned, which it released on Wednesday, contradicted assertions made by former employees and contractors about its acquisition of Facebook data. The report played down the role of a contractor turned whistle-blower, Christopher Wylie, who helped the company acquire Facebook data, calling it “very modest.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering executive action to further restrict the sale of Chinese telecommunications equipment in the United States, people briefed on the discussions said, in a move that could ratchet up tensions between China and the United States as the countries vie for technological dominance. The executive order, which could be released within days, is expected to raise the barrier for government agencies to buy products from foreign telecom equipment providers like Huawei and ZTE, two of China’s most prominent technology firms. Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption. The order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology that is seen as a national security threat. In March, the Federal Communications Commission took action to block broadband companies that receive federal subsidies from buying equipment from suppliers that are deemed a risk to national security. In April, the Commerce Department barred ZTE from purchases of American technology for seven years, saying that the company failed to punish employees who violated United States sanctions. The Trump administration increasingly views national security and emerging technology as intertwined and has used its authority to protect national security as a way to block China from gaining an economic edge, particularly as it relates to that nation’s ambitious industrial policy, known as Made in China 2025. Both nations are racing to claim dominance in cutting-edge technology like autonomous vehicles and the next generation of wireless services, known as 5G. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said the Pentagon was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns. While the Pentagon cannot stop service members from buying the phones elsewhere, the spokesman, Maj. Dave Eastburn, said in an email that the Defense Department was directing American military personnel to be “mindful of the security risks posed by the use of Huawei devices, regardless of where they are purchased.” "
"WASHINGTON — Top Trump administration officials are arriving in China this week armed with tough talk about Beijing’s need to change its trade practices. But within the United States delegation there is little consensus about what concessions America should try to extract — or the best approach to getting the Chinese to agree. Instead of a single point person with a clear set of demands, the White House is sending six trade and economic officials with differing ideas on how to approach China and who are deeply divided over the desirability of a trade war. Some advocate goals that do not align with what the American business community wants or what China is prepared to offer, raising questions about how productive a dialogue will be, and whether talks can prevent the world’s two largest economies from tipping into a deeper conflict. What unites the group is a view that China’s trade practices are unacceptable and that Washington will now call the shots. “The discussions will take place in Beijing, the decisions will take place in Washington,” said Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser and longtime China critic who is among those traveling to Beijing. China experts have said the trip is very likely to be more of a listening session, in which administration officials will wait to hear what the Chinese will offer. But without agreement or a clear list of goals from the American side, the Chinese may try to mollify officials by meeting only the most modest of their trade demands. That could include agreeing to buy additional American products to lower the trade surplus with the United States, reviving old economic dialogues between the countries, or cracking open some domestic markets to foreign competition — but only those where Chinese companies are already securely dominant.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. President Trump’s signature phrase, Beijing’s turnaround on tech and a soccer star shatters barriers. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.S. has an “unprecedented opportunity” when President Trump meets soon with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Those were the words of Mike Pompeo, who spoke beside Mr. Trump at his ceremonial swearing-in as the new U.S. secretary of state. The president, noting the applause, said it was “more spirit than I’ve heard from the State Department in a long time.” On other issues, Mr. Trump has a go-to line: “We’ll see what happens.” He’s used it more than two dozen times in the past month, and on issues ranging from trade clashes with Europe and China to negotiations with North Korea and Iran. Those who study his speech patterns are starting to wonder: What happens when we finally see what happens? _____ "
"ATLANTA — Nine people were believed killed Wednesday when an Air National Guard transport plane crashed near the Georgia coast, prompting a new inquiry into one of the military’s most widely used aircraft. The plane, a WC-130, crashed on a clear morning close to Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. It was the second time in less than a year that a version of the C-130, a workhorse of military aviation, was involved in a fatal episode. “To our knowledge, at this point, there are no survivors,” Gena Bilbo, a spokeswoman for the Effingham County Sheriff’s Office, said Wednesday night. The military said that the plane was from the 156th Airlift Wing, a unit of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard, and that it was bound for Arizona when it crashed. “The airplane just took off and quickly fell,” said Brig. Gen. Isabelo Rivera, the adjutant general of Puerto Rico, who said nine people were listed on the flight’s manifest. Officials did not publicly name any of the people aboard the plane who were confirmed or believed dead, except to say they were all Puerto Ricans. General Rivera said the National Guard had not yet made official notifications to family members, but that relatives had been learning about the crash on their own. "
"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has transferred a Guantánamo Bay prisoner to the custody of Saudi Arabia, a spokeswoman announced on Wednesday. The handoff is the first time a detainee has left the wartime prison under President Trump, who vowed to fill it back up but has now instead overseen a reduction in its population. The prisoner, Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi, is unlikely to be set free soon. American officials intend for him to serve the roughly nine years remaining in a 13-year sentence he received after pleading guilty before a military commission to terrorism-related offenses involving a 2002 Qaeda attack on a French-flagged oil tanker off Yemen’s coast. “My words will not do justice to what I lived through in these years and to the men I leave behind in prison,” Mr. Darbi said in a statement provided through his volunteer lawyer, Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at the City University of New York. “No one should remain at Guantánamo without a trial. There is no justice in that.” Mr. Darbi’s departure leaves 40 detainees at Guantánamo, down from 41 when President Barack Obama left office. The transfer comes as the Trump administration has been struggling to fulfill the president’s strong desire to back up his chest-thumping campaign rhetoric about Guantánamo, even as counterterrorism and security professionals, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have repeatedly argued that other approaches made more practical sense. Mr. Darbi was one of about 780 men whom the Bush administration took to the American naval base in Cuba during the early chaotic years of the war on terrorism. President George W. Bush’s claims that he could hold people there indefinitely without trial or judicial review and without obeying the Geneva Conventions — as well as early photos of men in orange jumpsuits kneeling before the cages of Camp X-Ray, the hastily constructed initial phase of the prison — turned Guantánamo into a charged symbol around the world of prisoner abuses and American power. But over time, court interventions gave prisoners rights to hearings and to humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions, and conditions improved at the prison. In his second term, Mr. Bush started trying to close it because, as he wrote in his memoir, “the detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies.” "
"ABUJA, Nigeria — Twin suicide bombings at a mosque and at a market have left at least 27 people dead and scores wounded in northeastern Nigeria, leading the authorities on Wednesday to tighten security in the region, which has been targeted repeatedly in recent years by Boko Haram, the rebel Islamist insurgency. The bombings took place around 1 p.m. on Tuesday during afternoon prayers in Mubi, a town roughly 120 miles north of Yola, the capital of Adamawa State. The suicide bombers, two young men, detonated a first bomb after prayers began and a second one outside as people fled, according to the police. Usman Abubakar, a local police spokesman, said 27 people were killed and 58 were wounded by the suicide bombers, which he said were believed to have been Boko Haram militants. “For a long time we haven’t experienced anything on this scale,” Mr. Abubakar said. Some news reports, citing local residents and witnesses at burial ceremonies, said the death toll could be much higher, with over 60 victims. The news agency Agence France-Presse quoted gravediggers as saying that they had buried 86 bodies after the bombings, but it was not immediately possible to verify that figure. Mr. Abubakar said that many victims were “seriously injured” but that the police had “no information regarding an increase in deaths.” Conflicting accounts of the number of deaths in attacks in the region are not uncommon, and the authorities have been keen to play down the severity of such attacks ahead of elections next year. Dr. Edgar Sakawa, the director of the hospital in Mubi, said that most of the wounded were adults and that 11 victims had been transported to a larger, federal hospital in Yola because of the severity of their wounds.

"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week: Do we still have an acid rain problem? Are electric cars really clean? And what’s been happening at the E.P.A.? You remember acid rain, right? The fight to protect forests, streams and lakes from the effects of what is now often referred to as acid deposition is one of the great environmental success stories in the United States and Western Europe. But acid rain is still a problem in some parts of the world, notably India and much of Asia. In case you’ve forgotten, acid rain is produced primarily by emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from coal and other fossil-fuel-burning power plants and vehicles. The gases react with water vapor to form acids, which are washed out of the air by rain, snow, hail or even fog. The precipitation makes wetlands more acidic, which can be lethal for some fish. It also leaches aluminum from the soil, which can be toxic to both plants and aquatic organisms. The acidic water can also corrode stone buildings, sculptures and other objects. "
"As the rogues’ gallery of fallen world leaders grows, you might be tempted to conclude that ours is the most corrupt era in history. Early last month, the former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $17 million for bribery, extortion and abuse of power. That same day, the former South African president Jacob Zuma, forced to resign in February by his own party, appeared in court to face charges over a $2.5 billion arms deal. The next day came an even bigger blow: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s former president and current front-runner in polls for October’s presidential election, began serving a 12-year jail term on corruption charges — in a federal police building he himself inaugurated more than a decade ago. Lula is a casualty of what may be the largest corruption scandal ever. An octopuslike bribery scheme carried out by the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht has spawned investigations in more than a dozen countries, implicating leaders from Chile to Colombia, Mexico to Mozambique. (The scandal has also led to a $3.5 billion fine levied by the United States Justice Department against Odebrecht and inspired a new Netflix series.) In Peru alone, three former presidents are facing trial or serving jail time on Odebrecht-related charges. With the crisis still metastasizing, it was hard not to be cynical when, in mid-April, the region’s presidents gathered in Lima for the Summit of the Americas to deliver high-minded speeches on this year’s theme: “Democratic Governance Against Corruption.” Donald Trump skipped the meeting, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. It was a measure of the speed of these unfolding scandals that the White House couldn’t keep up. Pence’s official schedule initially included “a banquet hosted by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru.” The only problem: Kuczynski was forced to resign three weeks earlier, one day before he was to face certain impeachment on corruption charges. Behind all these grim headlines, however, lies a larger and more encouraging truth: Corruption is being exposed, denounced and prosecuted more vigorously, and at higher levels, than ever. In Latin America, at least, these are not just momentary flare-ups at the scandal du jour; they seem to be the rumblings of a historic shift. “Judges, journalists and the public now have the strength to take on high-level corruption,” says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue. “It’s not that corruption is getting worse or better, but that societies are more willing and able to uncover it.” Corruption, of course, is an ancient temptation. Aristotle pondered its significance back in the 4th century B.C.E., around the same time the Indian philosopher Kautiliya enumerated the “40 ways of embezzlement.” Throughout history, there has been a spirited debate about whether corruption acts like “grease” (smoothing the way past red tape) or “sand” (clogging the system with unproductive costs and scaring off investment). In the 18th century, the Anglo-Dutch economist Bernard Mandeville contended, in his “Fable of the Bees,” that private vices by the “dextrous management of skilful politicians” could be turned into “publick benefits.” More recently, some academics have argued that corruption can serve as an economic lubricant in societies that have low levels of trust, weak legal institutions or feckless governments. As the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington wrote: “In terms of economic growth, the only thing worse than a society with a rigid, overcentralized, dishonest bureaucracy is one with a rigid, overcentralized, honest bureaucracy.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump plunged into a dispute between conservative House Republicans and the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, over access to information about some of his biggest cases — including the Russia inquiry. Mr. Rosenstein, above center, who is overseeing the special counsel investigation, has given the lawmakers access to hundreds of thousands of pages of documents. But he has also made it clear in recent days that he does not intend to go further. Mr. Trump sided with the lawmakers, writing on Twitter: “At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!” And the president plans to hire Emmet Flood, the veteran lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment, to replace the White House lawyer Ty Cobb, who is retiring. Mr. Flood is expected to take a more adversarial role than Mr. Cobb had in dealing with the special counsel investigation. _____ "
"JERUSALEM — In three bold moves this week — with F-15s, a PowerPoint presentation and the passage of a contentious new law — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strengthened his hand in trying to foil Iran’s strategic ambitions, while potentially pulling the two nations closer to direct conflict. In Syria late Sunday, F-15s, widely assumed to be Israel’s, struck facilities where Iran and its proxies had entrenched themselves. The attack on a storage site near Hama destroyed 200 missiles and killed at least 16 people, 11 of them Iranians. In Tel Aviv the next evening, Mr. Netanyahu gave a bravura PowerPoint performance on live television from inside the Defense Ministry, flaunting the booty pilfered from a secret Tehran warehouse by an intrepid Mossad team — evidence, he said, of Iranian deceit about its long-running efforts to develop a nuclear bomb. The revelation came less than two weeks before President Trump is to announce a decision on whether to withdraw from the international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Israeli officials portrayed it as an attempt to provide Mr. Trump — Mr. Netanyahu’s close ally — with backing for the decision, which they believe the president has already made. Even as Mr. Netanyahu was speaking, his coalition in Parliament was pushing through a bill that would shift the power to go to war or carry out a military operation from the full cabinet to the smaller security cabinet — and, under “extreme circumstances,” allow the prime minister and defense minister alone to order such action. In short order, Mr. Netanyahu had managed to exploit important political, military and intelligence advantages to advance his agenda on both the nuclear and conventional fronts, intensify the pressure on Iran, and free his hand under Israeli law to take the country to war without cabinet approval. "
"RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian leader’s long, rambling speech was laced with deeply anti-Semitic tropes, including that the Jews of Europe brought persecution and the Holocaust upon themselves because of usury, banking and their “social function.” Israel, he said, grew out of a European colonial project that had nothing to do with Jewish history or aspirations. And citing a widely discredited book from the 1970s by Arthur Koestler called “The Thirteenth Tribe,” he posited that Ashkenazi Jews were descended not from the biblical Israelites but from the Khazars, a Turkic people who converted to Judaism in the eighth century. Opening a rare gathering of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s legislative body in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday night, Mahmoud Abbas, the chairman of the group and the president of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, also declared that he wanted the Palestinians to live in peace in an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. But instead of stirring international sympathy for his cause, he stirred outrage. The furor following his speech underscored what many critics view as the increasing irrelevance of Mr. Abbas, now in his 80s, the bankruptcy of the organization he leads, and the chasm between his stated goal and any imminent prospect of the Palestinians achieving it. “Such statements are unacceptable, deeply disturbing and do not serve the interests of the Palestinian people or peace in the Middle East,” said Nickolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, in a statement on Wednesday. "
"For several years now, Central Americans seeking to flee violence in their countries have banded together around Easter to cross into Mexico, some to stay there and some to take a chance on applying for asylum in the United States. They have joined forces in “caravans” for safety and to attract attention to their plight. Few in the United States have paid much heed. Until President Trump did, opening another ugly chapter in his anti-immigration crusade. In a barrage of tweets starting in early April, Mr. Trump transformed about 1,200 people on the northward trek into a dangerous horde bent on flooding the United States and confirming the need for that big wall that is his obsession. “Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming,’ ” he tweeted. His allies picked up the cry, warning of an invasion of illegal immigrants exploited by left-wing activists. On Saturday, Mr. Trump told a raucous rally in Michigan, “Are you watching that mess that’s going on right now with the caravan coming up?” Against that hysteria, a few facts are in order. First, the caravan is hardly an anarchic and lawless endeavor. It is a group of desperate people fleeing, in accordance with internationally accepted rules, the very real horrors of the “northern triangle” of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, one of the most violent regions in the world. Under international treaties and its own laws, the United States is obliged to allow foreigners inside the country or at its ports of entry to apply for asylum. It’s a daunting process, beginning with a “credible fear” interview to determine if there’s evidence that the applicant faces persecution or death back home. If the applicant passes that, the next step is plunging into an immigration court system that can take years to reach a decision. More than three-quarters of asylum-seekers from the northern triangle who came before the court were rejected from 2011 to 2017, according to TRAC, a research institute at Syracuse University. "
"Feeding reprehensible anti-Semitic myths and conspiracy theories in a speech on Monday, the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, shed all credibility as a trustworthy partner if the Palestinians and Israelis ever again have the nerve to try negotiations. Speaking to the Palestinian legislative body, Mr. Abbas, 82, said the mass murder of European Jews in the Holocaust was the result of the victims’ financial activities, not their religious identity and anti-Semitism. “So the Jewish question that was widespread throughout Europe was not against their religion, but against their social function, which relates to usury (unscrupulous money lending) and banking and such,” he said, according to the BBC. Mr. Abbas’s anti-Semitic tendencies are not new. In the 1980s, he wrote a dissertation that seemed to question the widely accepted Holocaust death toll of six million Jews. While seen as a successor to the longtime Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, in 2003 he played down that notion, saying, “The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind.” Things looked more hopeful in 1993 when, in glorious sunshine on the White House lawn, Mr. Abbas, then the foreign policy aide for the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, signed the Oslo Accords, which were supposed to eventually lead to two states and peace.

"Justin Simien, the 35-year-old creator of “Dear White People,” is no stranger to provocation. The satirical comedy, first a movie and now a Netflix show, revolves around five black students — Sam, Coco, Troy, Lionel and Reggie — at a fictional elite university who revel in the sorts of intemperate and intoxicating polemics that can sour a Thanksgiving dinner. A story line from the first season about an app called “Woke or Not,” for example, mercilessly parodied the characters’ self-conscious commitment to social justice. But even Mr. Simien was not prepared for the controversy that engulfed the TV show’s rollout. After Netflix first released a teaser trailer last February, Mr. Simien was inundated with critical messages online, promoting the hashtag #BoycottNetflix and excoriating him for “reverse racism.” “I read this review on some conservative site because I was so curious where it all was coming from,” Mr. Simien recalled in an interview at the Netflix offices in Manhattan late last month. “It was like they’d watched the show just enough to give their readers the impression that they’d watched it and then came up with the most insane interpretations. It wasn’t that they didn’t get it, it was that they refused to get it.” That lesson, and Mr. Simien’s own reaction to the backlash, inspired Season 2 of “Dear White People,” which begins streaming May 4. In addition to online trolls, the show offers up irreverent takes on white allies, the strain of Afrocentric conservatives known as “Hoteps,” and campus free speech, among other hot topics. Mr. Simien, who speaks in paragraphs and variously quoted Malcolm X, Eckhart Tolle and RuPaul, discussed why the new season never mentions President Trump by name, what black auteurs owe to their audiences and his upcoming horror film about a (literal) killer weave.

That would be Don Blankenship, whose other problems include a history of dumping coal waste into West Virginia waters and the fact that he actually seems to reside in Las Vegas. “I pay probably more taxes than anybody on this stage to West Virginia,” Blankenship responded during a debate on Tuesday. Which is not quite the same as saying you live there. One of Blankenship’s Republican opponents, State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, is running as a super-conservative. His wife is a lobbyist for large pharmaceutical companies, which makes things rather sticky when the subject turns to West Virginia’s massive opioid problem. "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump learned this week that his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, reportedly called him “an idiot” on several occasions, he expressed little in the way of frustration or anger, an uncharacteristically low-key response from someone with little tolerance for slights. Attending a fund-raising dinner on Monday, Mr. Trump told a confidant that he did not believe Mr. Kelly would say something like that, a point he made directly to Mr. Kelly in the Oval Office not long after the comment was reported. It was “fake news,” the president concluded, an assessment that he repeated in a pair of tweets. Many current and former officials said Mr. Trump’s response was less a vote of confidence in his top adviser than a sign of indifference — a reflection of the kind of cold truce that exists between two powerful and mercurial men who have grown tired and irritated with each other, but are in no immediate rush to part ways. The president has come to believe that Mr. Kelly is hiding things from him, in the view of people who work in the White House and insist on anonymity to describe private conversations. He has complained that Mr. Kelly has not been forthcoming about the pasts of some staff members, who either opposed him during the 2016 presidential primaries or had connections to the Bush family. And he has taken to venting about Mr. Kelly to an array of friends and supporters, while expressing confidence that recent successes — such as the continued strength of the economy and progress toward nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea — are proof that he is his own best adviser. Mr. Kelly complains aloud about Mr. Trump, telling colleagues, “I don’t need this” after dressing-downs from the president. While several current and former officials said they had not heard the chief of staff call his boss “an idiot,” as NBC News reported on Monday, many said that Mr. Kelly had given the impression over many months that he did not hold the president in high regard. He speaks as if he sees himself as the lone bulwark against potentially dangerous decisions by the commander in chief, they say. And whether he used the word or not, they added, the story itself could serve to accelerate his departure. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to keep a pornographic film actress from going public before the 2016 election with her story about an affair with Mr. Trump, according to Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s lawyers. That statement, which Mr. Giuliani made Wednesday night on Fox News, contradicted the president, who has said he had no knowledge about any payment to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, to keep quiet before the election. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] Asked specifically last month by reporters aboard Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said, “No,” and referred questions to Mr. Cohen. He was then asked, “Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?” “No,” Mr. Trump responded. “I don’t know.” In an interview with The New York Times shortly after his Fox News appearance, Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and longtime Trump confidant who recently joined the president’s legal team, said that he had documentation showing that Mr. Trump had personally made the payment. Mr. Giuliani indicated that the goal was to conclusively demonstrate that there was no campaign finance violation involved. “That removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,” he said. Mr. Giuliani added that when the initial payment was made, Mr. Cohen did it “on his own authority.” "

"Speaking truth to power has long been central to how Kanye West navigates his art and his business. He lambastes the executives who don’t grant him full creative and financial freedom. He calls into question the empathy of a president on live television. He lays bare his emotions in ways that disrupt tidy narratives about celebrity comity. He is a lit match in search of a fuse, setting fires that people (largely) cheer for. But in the last couple of weeks, as Mr. West has begun his return to public life after a quiet year, the roles have switched: He is the power, and speaking truth to Kanye West has become the norm. This has manifested in many forms. T.I. recorded a song with him directly challenging Mr. West’s embrace of President Trump, including wearing a Make America Great Again hat. The radio personality Ebro Darden pushed back forcefully against Mr. West’s support of the black conservative pundit Candace Owens. On “TMZ Live,” Van Lathan, one of TMZ’s producers, berated Mr. West full-throatedly for his recent behavior, including his statement on the show that slavery was “a choice.” [What Kanye West said about slavery, Barack Obama and mental health.] These are behaviors, statements and sentiments that potentially pose the largest existential threat ever to the Kanye West empire. And so what’s played out over the past two weeks is a kind of psychological tug of war, with Mr. West reinforcing his most unsettling positions while, all around him, what amounts to a collective global rescue effort for his mind and soul (and, in truth, his legacy) is playing out in real time. The seeds of this moment are traceable to the final months of 2016, the last time Mr. West was so public, and one of the most troubled periods of his life. Within a period of weeks, his wife was robbed, his tour was canceled, and he was hospitalized. On “TMZ,” he said that during those months, he developed an addiction to prescription opioids. "
"Summer Zervos, a former contestant on “The Apprentice” who accused President Trump of sexual assault, is seeking records to prove that he defamed her by calling her a liar. A lawyer for Ms. Zervos, who is suing Mr. Trump for defamation in New York, said on Wednesday that subpoenas had been issued both to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns archives of the reality show, and to the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Ms. Zervos says he groped her in 2007. “We’re gathering evidence that we believe will prove that the defendant lied when he falsely denigrated Ms. Zervos and when he denied sexually assaulting her,” said the lawyer, Mariann Wang of Cuti Hecker Wang. Ms. Zervos, a Republican, was among the more than 10 women who came forward during the 2016 presidential campaign to accuse Mr. Trump of inappropriate sexual contact. He denied all of their claims. Ms. Zervos publicly revealed her account during an emotional news conference just weeks before the November election, accusing Mr. Trump of forcibly kissing her at meetings in New York and California as she sought his mentorship after her run on “The Apprentice,” in which contestants vied to work for Mr. Trump. During one encounter at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007, she said, Mr. Trump made repeated advances and grabbed her breasts. “You do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star,” she said at the news conference, borrowing a phrase he used in the “Access Hollywood” tape, in which he could be heard making vulgar comments about women. After that recording was leaked late in the campaign, many speculated that recordings from “The Apprentice” would show the same. "
"Rudolph W. Giuliani said on Wednesday that President Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for a payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress widely known by her stage name, Stormy Daniels. The payment of $130,000 was to keep her from speaking publicly before the 2016 election about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani, a member of the president’s legal team, made the statement during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. [Read our article about the interview.] Below is a transcript of the exchange. _________ SEAN HANNITY: My question is, are you concerned within the process of this, we did discover that a foreign national, Christopher Steele, was paid through Fusion GPS, used Russian sources that not only weren’t verified, but were debunked — are you concerned that was paid for, to manipulate the American people in the lead-up to an election? RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI: Isn’t that closer to the mandate than Michael Cohen? HANNITY: Why isn’t that happening? Where’s Mueller on that, sir? GIULIANI: Having something to do with paying some Stormy Daniels woman $130,000? Which, I mean, is going to turn out to be perfectly legal. That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I’m giving you a fact now that you don’t know. It’s not campaign money. No campaign finance violation. HANNITY: They funneled it through a law firm. GIULIANI: They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it. "
"WASHINGTON — A Washington consultant who was removed from President Trump’s transition team for using his business email address for government work played a central role last year in planning a trip to Australia for Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and then took steps to disguise his role, new documents show. The consultant, Matthew C. Freedman, who is also a former lobbyist for foreign governments, runs his own corporate advisory firm and is treasurer of the American Australian Council, a group that helps promote business for American-based companies in Australia. Two prominent members include Chevron and ConocoPhillips. Though the Australia trip never happened — it was canceled after Hurricane Harvey devastated much of the Texas Gulf Coast — it shows a pattern in which Mr. Pruitt has repeatedly relied on people with clear business interests to shape the agenda of his foreign travel. Separately last year, a trip to Morocco was organized by a lobbyist who later was hired by Morocco as a $40,000-a-month foreign agent to represent its interests abroad. Mr. Freedman has spent decades as an international political consultant and lobbyist, starting in the 1980s as an employee of Paul Manafort when the two men worked together to help the embattled Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Mr. Manafort later became Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, and many of his former lobbying associates entered Mr. Trump’s orbit, with some remaining in influential positions well after Mr. Manafort resigned from the campaign amid scrutiny of his work for Russia-aligned Ukrainian politicians. Mr. Manafort has since been indicted on charges related to that work by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Freedman worked on Mr. Trump’s transition team in late 2016 on national security-related issues. He was removed after conducting government business using an email address associated with his consulting firm, Global Impact Inc., which fed the impression that he was using his position with the transition team to drum up business, according to an adviser to the transition.

"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — From the perspective of the White House, the United States had negotiated a preliminary deal with Brazil, as well as Argentina and Australia, to exempt the countries from punitive steel and aluminum tariffs. From the perspective of Brazil, it was issued an ultimatum. Brazil accused the Trump administration on Wednesday of breaking off negotiations over the tariffs last week and issuing a take-it-or-leave-it offer. According to the Brazilian authorities, the United States said the country’s steel and aluminum industries could opt for tariffs or quotas. That account appears to contradict the White House’s version of the events. On Monday, White House officials said they had reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia and Brazil with regard to steel and aluminum, saying the details would “be finalized shortly.” The disconnect between the United States and Brazil echoes the broader state of the trade negotiations, which have been clouded by confusion, miscommunication and a general state of uncertainty over the rules of engagement. When President Trump issued the worldwide tariffs in March, he granted temporary exemptions to Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea. Almost immediately, countries scrambled to make them permanent. Just hours before those exemptions were set to expire, the Trump administration extended the deadline for the European Union, Canada and Mexico. It also said Brazil, along with Argentina and Australia, were finalizing the details of “satisfactory alternative means” to address national security threats posed by steel imports and avoid tariffs. (South Korea had previously reached an agreement as part of a broader trade deal.) "
"GLENDALE, Ariz. — The latest wave of foreign workers sweeping into American jobs brought Donato Soberano from the Philippines to Arizona two years ago. He had to pay thousands of dollars to a job broker and lived for a time in an apartment with five other Filipino workers. The lure is the pay — 10 times more than what he made doing the same work back home. But Mr. Soberano is not a hospitality worker or a home health aide. He is in another line of work that increasingly pays too little to attract enough Americans: Mr. Soberano is a public school teacher. As walkouts by teachers protesting low pay and education funding shortfalls spread across the country, the small but growing movement to recruit teachers from overseas is another sign of the difficulty some districts are having providing the basics to public school students. Among the latest states hit by the protests is Arizona, where teacher pay is more than $10,000 below the national average of $59,000 per year. The Pendergast Elementary School District, where Mr. Soberano works, has recruited more than 50 teachers from the Philippines since 2015. They hold J-1 visas, which allow them to work temporarily in the United States, like au pairs or camp counselors, but offer no path to citizenship. More than 2,800 foreign teachers arrived on American soil last year through the J-1, according to the State Department, up from about 1,200 in 2010. “In these times, you have to be innovative and creative in recruiting,” said Patricia Davis-Tussey, Pendergast’s head of human resources. “We embrace diversity and really gain a lot from the cultural exchange experience. Our students do as well.” The district, which covers parts of Glendale, Avondale and north Phoenix, is a hotbed of activism in the teacher walkout movement, known as #RedforEd. Picketing educators say they have had to move in with their parents, apply for food stamps and pay out of pocket for classroom essentials like graph paper and science supplies. They argue that taxes are too low to adequately fund schools, or for teachers to secure a middle-class lifestyle. "
"BEIJING — For the last decade or so, China has defied the truism that only free and open societies can innovate. Even as the Communist Party has kept an iron grip on politics and discourse, the country’s technology industry has grown to rival Silicon Valley’s in sophistication and ambition. President Xi Jinping’s tilt toward strongman rule could put all that to the test. As Mr. Xi starts his second term, the Chinese government, which once viewed the internet primarily as a threat to its stranglehold on information, is harnessing big tech companies’ capital and knowledge to realize its broader goals for the country. At a time when the Trump administration is moving to counter China’s tech prowess, Beijing’s heavier hand could pose its own threat to the country’s competitiveness, and to the innovation that has transformed Chinese firms into global heavyweights. For China’s government, WeChat, the country’s most popular messaging and social media service, has become a key tool for policing what people say and do. Political activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations; chat records have turned up as evidence in court. The e-commerce titan Alibaba, meanwhile, is helping city authorities manage traffic. The police have used technology from WeChat’s parent company, Tencent, to monitor crowds at public events. JD.com, Alibaba’s main rival in online shopping, is helping China’s military to upgrade its procurement and logistics systems, state media reported recently. (A JD.com spokesman said, however, that its military cooperation was limited to the procurement of goods available to all customers on its site.) In scientific research — a focus for Mr. Xi as economic growth becomes harder to sustain — tech giants have joined with government institutes to run labs in fields like quantum computing, deep learning and human-computer interaction. Soon, Chinese citizens may even be able to use their accounts on Tencent’s and Alibaba’s apps as digital versions of their national ID cards. "
"LOS ANGELES — A caravan of migrants from Central America that recently trekked to the California border has grabbed the attention of the news media and President Trump. Of the 300 or so who made it to Tijuana, at least 150 are expected to claim asylum in the United States. “The likelihood of them getting asylum is very minimal,” said Thomas Haine, a former trial attorney for Immigration and Customs Enforcement who is now in private practice in San Diego. The biggest hurdle for the migrants is convincing an immigration judge that they belong to a particular social group — gay, transgender or a child soldier, for example — that could entitle them to asylum, since they cannot argue that they face persecution based on race, religion, nationality or political opinion. Generally, Central American migrants are fleeing gangs, drug cartels or other violence. But fearing for one’s life isn’t reason enough for asylum, Mr. Haine said. Border inspectors late Monday began allowing some asylum seekers into the country. Once processed at a port of entry, they will be transferred to a detention facility where they must pass a “credible-fear” interview. Those who clear the first hurdle will be referred to an immigration court for hearings that can stretch for months or longer. (Those who fail can be deported.) "
"KIEV, Ukraine — In the United States, Paul J. Manafort is facing prosecution on charges of money laundering and financial fraud stemming from his decade of work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. But in Ukraine, where officials are wary of offending President Trump, four meandering cases that involve Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, have been effectively frozen by Ukraine’s chief prosecutor. The cases are just too sensitive for a government deeply reliant on United States financial and military aid, and keenly aware of Mr. Trump’s distaste for the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into possible collusion between Russia and his campaign, some lawmakers say. The decision to halt the investigations by an anticorruption prosecutor was handed down at a delicate moment for Ukraine, as the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country sophisticated anti-tank missiles, called Javelins. The State Department issued an export license for the missiles on Dec. 22, and on March 2 the Pentagon announced final approval for the sale of 210 Javelins and 35 launching units. The order to halt investigations into Mr. Manafort came in early April. Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament who is an ally of President Petro O. Poroshenko, readily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort’s activities “in the long-term box.” "
"[Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] “President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize.” It is hard to imagine anyone other than Mr. Trump expressing that sentiment. But the quote is from his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, citing Mr. Trump’s work to engineer talks between the two Koreas and the tantalizing prospect of a long-sought peace and denuclearization on the peninsula. If Mr. Trump feels triumphant, he’s not without justification — for now. The dramatic images beamed around the world from Panmunjom — with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, setting foot in the South for the first time since the war, smiling, holding hands with Mr. Moon and signing onto a broad peace declaration — owe something to Mr. Trump’s crazy-like-a-fox foreign policy. His administration smartly built on the economic pressure and isolation campaign initiated by President Barack Obama. His infamous “fire and fury” threat seems to have spooked Mr. Moon as much as it did Mr. Kim into redoubling efforts to avoid a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea that might unleash a devastating war. His swift agreement to meet with Mr. Kim effectively raised the diplomatic ante. It’s also true that North Korea’s remarkable progress over the past two years in developing an intercontinental nuclear weapon, coupled with a cave-in at its main testing site, allows Mr. Kim to press the pause button, de-escalate the tension he generated and go for the diplomatic high ground. So, should Mr. Trump start taking seriously talk about a trip to Oslo? The long litany of aborted efforts in the past, the sheer complexity of any negotiations and the many traps along the way suggest not yet. Twice before — in 2000 and 2007 — Seoul and Pyongyang made joint peace pledges that crashed on the rocks of North Korean aggression. The vague language of the two Korean leaders’ Panmunjom Declaration on denuclearization falls well short of commitments that Pyongyang made — and then promptly violated — in 2005 and 2012. Despite Mr. Kim’s forward-leaning rhetoric, it is unlikely he is prepared to fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he sees as his best insurance policy against regime change and a ticket to international recognition.

"Fifty years ago, NASA’s manned space program was grounded, still recovering after the Apollo1 disaster in 1967. “Lost in Space” was on television. This week — a generation later — we find NASA’s manned space program grounded again, in the wake of the decision to discontinue American flights after the conclusion of the shuttle program in 2011. And “Lost in Space” is again on television. The new head of NASA is Jim Bridenstine, a former Republican representative from Oklahoma. Would you be shocked to learn that President Trump’s choice to run the space agency is not an actual scientist or engineer? Or that he is a climate change skeptic? Or that he has never run a large organization? You probably wouldn’t. In fact, Mr. Bridenstine’s lack of qualifications make him a perfect fit for the Trump administration, a place that sometimes feels like what the kids in “Stranger Things” call the Upside Down, a world just like our own, except that everything there is inverted, darkened and corrupted. What would Bridenstine’s main asset be, you ask, other than not having any science background? Well, he’s no fan of L.G.B.T.Q. people. Calling the Supreme Court ruling that made marriage equality the law of the land “disappointing,” he’s also on record as describing the Obama-era executive order supporting transgender students as “lawless federal bullying.” So he’s got that going for him.

"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Tesla’s plan to cut back on capital expenditures. • Why Apple’s share repurchases have been good for investors. • Will the Fed offer clues about future rate increases? • How activist investors shook Xerox. • On the earnings calendar: Tesla, where Elon Musk will face plenty of questions. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Tesla in recent weeks has faced concerns that it is consuming too much cash as it tries to produce a new model of electric car. Now, Tesla itself seems to share those worries. While reporting its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the company made the surprising announcement that it was going to “significantly cut back” the amount of money it spends on its facilities and equipment.. Such capital expenditures will most likely total slightly less than $3 billion this year, Tesla said, down from its earlier forecast of more than $3.4 billion. The announcement came as the company said it spent $656 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter, and its negative cash flows from its operations reached nearly $400 million during the period, causing Tesla to burn through over $1 billion of cash. Cash generation should, in theory, pick up as it sells more of its newest car, the Model 3. But it’s not clear when Model 3 sales will reach targeted levels, because Tesla has had problems producing the car in large numbers. In its earnings report, Tesla suggested that its spending on capital expenditures would rely on how much cash its operations bring in. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. One big potential bulwark against President Trump’s attempts to subvert the law is his own administration. If Trump’s aides and appointees go along with his various power grabs, Trump may well succeed. If other officials refuse, he is likely to fail. All of which makes Rod Rosenstein’s comments yesterday noteworthy. Rosenstein, of course, is the deputy attorney general, overseeing Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump. In an appearance at the Newseum in Washington, Rosenstein said that people have for “quite some time” been threatening him privately and publicly. “I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,” he added. “We’re going to do what’s required by the rule of law.” Who exactly has been threatening him? The president of the United States who appointed him, as well as members of the president’s party in Congress. Put in a terribly uncomfortable position, Rosenstein showed how to stand up for the rule of law. In doing so, he is keeping faith with a tradition of Justice Department independence that spans both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past half-century — but that Trump is trying to break. Rosenstein’s example is particularly important, because he hasn’t always been willing to stand up to his boss. But he now seems to have found his courage. If only more members of Congress and Republican elders would do the same. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Austin Beutner has been an investment banker, a Los Angeles deputy mayor, a candidate for mayor (briefly) and publisher of The Los Angeles Times (also briefly). On Tuesday, Mr. Beutner, 58, was named superintendent of the Los Angeles school district. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Q. A slightly cheeky question: Do you find it at all odd that Los Angeles of all places should be picking a middle-aged white guy with no experience in public education to run its schools? A. I’m a bit of an unconventional choice, that’s clear. But if you put it in the context of where the district is, well, hard choices lay ahead. Maybe an unconventional choice is just what you need. An unconventional choice who understands the complexity of Los Angeles. An unconventional choice who understands how to frame the complexity about budgets. Q. What do you see as your biggest challenges? A. There’s still a big opportunity gap between what kids can achieve and what they are actually achieving. All the resources that need to go to the communities most in need are not getting to the communities most in need. Less than a third of the kids are proficient in math. That’s the language of the future. Less than 40 percent are proficient in English. I think we are looking at some hard choices ahead. There’s no way around it. Q. Do you have ideas on how to deal with these? A. I’ve got some ideas. Stay tuned. I’m humble enough to know I have a lot to learn. Q. How severe are the district’s budget woes? A. Fairly ominous. I’ll learn more. We’ll have a further and careful look. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s lawyers have been trying to talk him out of accepting an interview with investigators for the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Legal experts say the questions Mr. Mueller wants to ask show why a meeting would be risky. Mr. Trump would need a detailed command of a range of issues, and his lawyers don’t know exactly what the special counsel has learned. Read our story, and if you missed it yesterday, here’s an annotated list of the questions themselves. As the president often likes to say, “We’ll see what happens.” • A group of House Republicans has drafted articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, over the Justice Department’s investigations of the president and his associates. On Tuesday, Mr. Rosenstein warned that the department “is not going to be extorted.” • The Trump administration has embraced Israeli claims that the Iran nuclear deal is flawed because it is based on false pretenses. That’s not how it’s seen in Europe, where officials said Israel’s disclosures broke little new ground and only reinforced the case for the 2015 agreement. "
"VANCOUVER, British Columbia — At the Paris climate summit meeting in December 2015, Canada’s freshly elected prime minister, Justin Trudeau, took the podium before his new international fan club and declared, “Canada is back, my friends!” The young, charismatic Mr. Trudeau promised “sunny ways.” He was ideally positioned to shift the country to a greener future, away from its reliance on resource industries and toward improved relations with Indigenous peoples whose territories are imperiled by energy projects. Yet more than halfway through his mandate, he has adopted the backward energy and economic policies of his predecessor Stephen Harper, an ardent fossil-fuel promoter. Mr. Trudeau has revealed himself to be not a climate crusader, but a pipeline pitchman who tells the world one thing while doing the opposite at home. Within a year of committing in Paris to ambitious targets, Mr. Trudeau and his federal Liberal Party had rendered his pledge meaningless. The government approved a pair of heavy-oil pipelines and a liquefied natural gas plant. Its members secretly cheered as Donald Trump was elected, and moved toward resurrecting the Keystone XL pipeline. (Two other pipeline projects were terminated earlier in Mr. Trudeau’s term, but he can’t take credit; one was quashed in court and the other was canceled by the company.) Hanging in the balance now is the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Edmonton, Alberta, to the outskirts of this city. The project, led by a subsidiary of the Texas-based energy company Kinder Morgan, and with investment from Canadian banks, would triple the flow of bitumen to the coast to 890,000 barrels a day and produce a sevenfold bump in tanker traffic. A heavy-oil spill could be catastrophic for Canada’s largest wild salmon run, many whale species and British Columbia’s multibillion-dollar tourism industry. The estimated carbon dioxide emissions associated with the project would equate to adding about 3 million cars a year to the road. Environmental activists have “warriored up.” The Trudeau government is now being pressured to answer an ultimatum by month’s end from the company, which is threatening to quit the project, said to cost 7.4 billion Canadian dollars ($5.9 billion). While campaigning, Mr. Trudeau made assurances about fixing the farcical environmental review process for prospective energy projects that was cultivated by Mr. Harper’s Conservatives. The Liberal government later announced it would adhere to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which requires “free, prior and informed consent” from First Nations where an industrial project threatens their traditional lands and waters. Canadians had good reason to believe he would take real steps toward change. "
"Over the last decade, the United States has pursued a foreign policy toward Latin America that married regional security and stability with democracy promotion and economic development. Under the Trump administration, that has begun to change — in an echo of the Cold War, narrowly defined national security concerns increasingly occupy center stage, with fear of invading migrants replacing fear of invading Communists. The word is out within the corridors of power in Latin America. Authoritarian and corrupt leaders and their allies are exploiting the new environment to discredit their opponents and position themselves as partners of the United States. Allowing them to advance their repressive and criminal agenda unchecked would be disastrous for Latin American citizens and American security. In many cases, President Trump has explicitly counteracted his predecessors’ policies. A long overdue thaw in American-Cuban relations, put in motion under President Barack Obama, was short-lived. The Trump administration refused to condemn the elections last November in Honduras, widely considered fraudulent, because a pro-American conservative won. The State Department subsequently turned a blind eye to the widespread repression of Hondurans who peacefully protested the results, certifying instead that Honduras was making progress on human rights. In Guatemala, the country where I have worked for over two decades since the end of a 36-year genocidal civil war, a similar and potentially catastrophic shift is in the making. For more than a decade, the United States has been an outspoken advocate of justice and the rule of law. It figured among the most avid supporters of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known by its Spanish initials as Cicig, a United Nations body established to root out organized criminal networks and promote judicial and legislative reforms aimed at consolidating democracy. It supported the election of attorneys general committed to working with the commission. American ambassadors attended human rights trials in a public show of support for victims of crimes against humanity. Ambassadors joined ranks with civilian protesters. I had the opportunity to travel with one former ambassador in to remote rural communities to highlight the economic needs and emphasize the equal citizenship rights of Guatemala’s indigenous people, who make up about 40 percent of the country and are overwhelmingly poor.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump plunged into an angry dispute on Wednesday between conservative House Republicans and the deputy attorney general, siding with hard-line lawmakers over his own Justice Department as they pressed for access to sensitive documents related to the special counsel’s investigation and other politically charged cases. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump called the legal system “rigged” and amplified the lawmakers’ complaints that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, was not moving fast enough to turn over the documents they want. The president stepped in just as Mr. Rosenstein appeared to mollify three key committee chairmen who were also demanding internal documents. “They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal ‘justice?’ Mr. Trump wrote. “At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!” Which presidential powers Mr. Trump was referring to was not immediately clear. Distrust between Mr. Rosenstein and Congress has been building over months. In recent weeks, he has made significant gestures to release documents demanded by prominent congressmen, only to be threatened with impeachment by lawmakers from the far right. Mr. Rosenstein responded on Tuesday to that threat by declaring that the Justice Department would not be “extorted.” "
"On Monday, The Times gave us the first glimpse of 49 questions the special counsel Robert Mueller could ask President Trump, as told to Mr. Trump’s legal team during negotiations for an interview. The questions reveal the topics Mr. Mueller believes could lead to potential liability for the president and help explain why Trump’s team has urged him not to agree to an interview. Last night, we learned that the specific questions were actually created by a Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, his interpretation of 16 specific subjects presented by Mr. Mueller’s team. Mr. Sekulow broke down the subjects and subtopics into the separate questions. This explains why Mr. Trump’s team had these questions — it would be highly unusual for a prosecutor to give a witness questions in advance, but it is fairly common for a prosecutor to preview potential topics for a defense attorney before an interview. For that reason, I think it’s fair to assume that Mr. Sekulow’s questions track what Mr. Mueller’s team wants to cover in an interview. Mr. Trump’s team plans to use the questions to attack the special counsel as “overreaching” and going “beyond his mandate,” but the questions themselves suggest that Mr. Mueller has carefully stayed within his bounds. They contain nothing about obscure business deals or real estate transactions; the questions focus on coordination with Russia, obstruction of justice and topics that have been covered at length in the news media. None of the topics should have come as a surprise to Mr. Trump’s team, aside from an explosive question about efforts by the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to seek aid from the Kremlin, which is squarely about coordination with Russia. What should concern Mr. Trump’s team is how the questions zero in on Mr. Trump’s criminal liability. They leave little doubt that Mr. Trump is in serious jeopardy, particularly regarding obstruction of justice. I concluded months ago that Mr. Mueller would likely determine that the president obstructed justice, but the questions show that Mr. Mueller has already thought about how he would prove his case. The queries ask about Mr. Trump’s state of mind when he fired James Comey, when he erupted in anger at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself and when he considered firing the special counsel. The questions are intended to prove the case against Mr. Trump through his own words. But it would be a mistake to count the number of questions focused on obstruction and conclude that Mr. Mueller’s investigation of the president focuses primarily on that topic. The inquiries on topics other than obstruction are broad. For example, the question “What discussions did you have during the campaign regarding any meeting with Mr. Putin?” encompasses a lot of ground. You could ask a similar broad question regarding the Comey firing — ”What discussions did you have about or with James Comey?” — and cover much of the ground covered in the 18 questions related to him. The fact that the questions on topics other than obstruction are so broad does not necessarily suggest that Mr. Mueller has less evidence regarding those topics. A more likely possibility is that Mr. Mueller is not willing to tip his hand on those topics because the evidence he has regarding them hasn’t been extensively covered in the press. "
"WASHINGTON — A year ago Friday, Representative Claudia Tenney of New York stood among dozens of enthusiastic colleagues in the Rose Garden to celebrate passage of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. When President Trump made his way onstage, Ms. Tenney clapped and smiled. On this not-so-happy anniversary, a Democratic “super PAC” is on the air with a television commercial reminding her constituents of a repeal vote that Republicans were once convinced would be a political winner. Ms. Tenney’s Democratic challenger, Anthony Brindisi, a state assemblyman, said health care is consistently one of the top issues in a vast district that runs from Lake Ontario through Utica and Rome to the Pennsylvania border. “I think her vote is wildly unpopular among constituents in the district,” Mr. Brindisi said. “And what adds insult to injury is that she celebrated her vote by snapping selfies of herself at the White House, gleefully cheering a vote that would take health insurance away from thousands of her constituents.” House passage of the Obamacare repeal bill left that chamber’s Republicans in a no-win situation. They took the hard vote, but because the Senate failed to follow suit, no one can claim a victory. Now Democrats hope to extract a price. Far from the liability that the Affordable Care Act has been in past elections, Democrats believe health care will be a key advantage heading into this fall’s midterm elections. Though President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement has endured, Democrats accuse the Trump administration and congressional Republicans of sabotaging the health law’s insurance marketplaces through actions such as ending the requirement that most people have coverage or pay a penalty. And in the weeks before this fall’s elections, consumers are expected to learn of another wave of premium increases. Mr. Brindisi said the repeal bill, the American Health Care Act, would have had devastating effects on the district that Ms. Tenney represents in upstate New York, harming hospitals that are important to the local economy and diminishing access to opioid treatment.

"Eric Reid, the San Francisco 49ers safety who has knelt during the national anthem at games for the past two seasons, filed a grievance against the N.F.L., saying the league had blackballed him because of his actions. Reid’s move mirrors that of the former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who led a wave of sideline protests against social injustice and police brutality against African-Americans and filed a grievance last season after being unable to land an N.F.L. job. Like Kaepernick’s, Reid’s case would be heard by an arbitrator. The taking of depositions is underway in Kaepernick’s case. In a New York Times op-ed in September, Reid wrote that his protests during the national anthem were motivated by “the incredible number of unarmed black people being killed by the police.” Of Kaepernick, he said, “Anybody who has a basic knowledge of football knows that his unemployment has nothing to do with his performance on the field.” Reid, whose contract with the 49ers expired after the season, met with the Bengals last month. No contract offer was forthcoming. Reid was present at a meeting in October of owners, players and executives about the sideline protests, which several players were participating in, and which had drawn much criticism, up to and including from President Trump. At that meeting, a tape of which was obtained by The New York Times, Reid said of Kaepernick: “I feel like he was hung out to dry. Everyone in here is talking about how much they support us. Nobody stepped up and said we support Colin’s right to do this. We all let him become Public Enemy No. 1 in this country, and he still doesn’t have a job.” The N.F.L. Players Association said in a statement that it was aware of Reid’s collusion claim, adding “Our union supports Eric, and we are considering other legal options to pursue.” The N.F.L. said in a statement, “We are abiding by the confidentiality provision of the CBA and have no comment.” In November, Reid said that he knew that kneeling might cause him to be blackballed: “I’m aware of it,” he told The San Jose Mercury News. “I know it’s a possibility. I knew what I signed up for when I started doing this.” “Eric played well for us last year,” 49ers General Manager John Lynch told The Mercury News last month. “I think he’s kind of stuck in a safety market that’s been quiet.” Reid played five seasons for the 49ers after they selected him in the first round of the draft out of Louisiana State.

"Jane Chu, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, announced that she would step down from her post in June, according to a statement released by the N.E.A. last week. Now, it will fall on President Trump to appoint the new head of an agency that he has tried and failed to eliminate twice. Even so, Ms. Chu’s statement contained no reference to the uncertainty the N.E.A. has faced since Mr. Trump took office. “I am so appreciative of having had this opportunity,” Ms. Chu, the endowment’s 11th chairwoman, said. She cited the N.E.A.’s “effective and meaningful work” in “communities large and small, densely populated, rural, and remote” — a subtle pushback against some conservatives who have said for years that the endowment is an example of wasteful government spending, even though the actual cost to taxpayers is a tiny fraction of the federal budget. (Last year, the Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson said the N.E.A. was an example of “welfare for rich, liberal elites.”) Since Ms. Chu was appointed by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2014, the agency has doled out more than $400 million in grants in all 50 states. She was on the road often, making hundreds of trips to arts communities all over the country. Her efforts have earned the agency widespread bipartisan support, including from key Republican senators like Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. In the recent $1.3 trillion spending bill, a Republican-controlled Congress actually gave the N.E.A. a slight increase in its budget, a direct rebuff to Mr. Trump. Before becoming chairwoman, Ms. Chu, an accomplished pianist, was the president and chief executive officer of the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Mo. “Children from all walks of life are expanding their skills artistically and academically through the arts,” Ms. Chu added in her statement. “And arts organizations are not only providing programs for audiences, they are also seen as leaders in their communities because the arts can bring people together.” It’s unclear who the front-runners are to replace Ms. Chu. Mary Anne Carter, the endowment’s senior deputy chairwoman, will serve as its acting leader. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump hired on Wednesday a Washington lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment, a sign that the White House sees no immediate end to its legal problems and is girding for a combative relationship with a new Congress after the midterm elections. The new lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, will replace Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer who persuaded Mr. Trump to cooperate with the special counsel for the first year of its investigation. Mr. Cobb assured the president that doing so would bring the investigation to a swift end. That has not happened, and lawyers say the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is unlikely to conclude his work soon. Mr. Trump’s advisers see a new peril on the horizon: If Democrats win control of the House, they would have the authority to issue subpoenas or even convene impeachment hearings. Mr. Flood’s résumé is well suited for such fights. He jousted with Congress and an independent counsel during the Clinton administration. As a White House lawyer during George W. Bush’s second term, he helped fend off congressional investigations into the firing of federal prosecutors. And in private practice, he represented former Vice President Dick Cheney. “Emmet Flood will be joining the White House staff to represent the president and the administration against the Russia witch hunt,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement, adopting the president’s derisive label for the special counsel investigation. “Ty Cobb, a friend of the president, who has done a terrific job, will be retiring at the end of the month.” Like many veterans of the meandering, yearslong Clinton investigation, Mr. Flood has told people he is wary of special counsel inquiries. He has expressed concerns about the scope of Mr. Mueller’s investigation in particular, a view that resonates with the president. Mr. Cobb, by contrast, has expressed admiration for Mr. Mueller and has never adopted the president’s “witch hunt” language. "
"To the Editor: Re “Kim Says He’d End Nuclear Pursuit for a U.S. Truce” (front page, April 30) and “Koreans Think Trump Has Earned Nobel Peace Prize” (news article, May 1): I’m suspicious. Very suspicious. All of a sudden, as if by magic, Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, is raising a white flag, proposing (vaguely) to give up the nuclear weapons that are his only bargaining chip against the United States. Calls are already circulating for President Trump to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing Mr. Kim to his knees. A Nobel Prize? For Donald Trump? Really?! Does it occur to anyone that this appears to be a simple ploy by China and North Korea to get Mr. Trump to scale back America’s presence on the Korean Peninsula? Would Mr. Trump refuse such a ploy, even if it harms America’s long-term interests, when a quick, high-profile “peace” deal, broadcast around the world, offers Mr. Trump a potential public relations lifeline to counter the impending conclusions of the Mueller investigation? BRAD RAFFLE, EUGENE, ORE. To the Editor: President Trump repeatedly threatened to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea and ordered his secretary of state to stop “wasting his time” on diplomacy. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, extended the olive branch by offering to enter peace talks and diplomatically de-escalated tensions. Only in this new world order of post-truth and alternative facts would it make sense for Mr. Trump to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. ERIC MULLEN, NEW YORK To the Editor: As President Trump and others take a victory lap for progress on a resolution to the crisis in Korea, it behooves us to consider the generalizability of the administration’s approach. While threats and bluster may have contributed to the current movement toward an agreement, will brinkmanship work elsewhere? On trade? On Iran? This is a risky lesson to draw from this (partial) success. MICHAEL G. HUELSHOFF
NEW ORLEANS The writer is chairman of the political science department at the University of New Orleans. To the Editor: Congratulations to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Kim Jong-un of North Korea for setting a framework for formally ending a 68-year war and bringing an end to North Korea’s nuclear program. Although numerous other countries and individuals have contributed to these spectacular events, we cannot forget Dennis Rodman, the former N.B.A. star who has made several trips to North Korea and has met with Mr. Kim. Perhaps Mr. Rodman and Mr. Trump could share the Nobel Prize. MICHAEL H. LANE

"JERUSALEM — As Israel faces rising tensions with Iran, Syria and Gaza, its Parliament passed a new law allowing the prime minister and defense minister to decide alone whether their nation will go to war. The legislation, which comes after multiple attacks inside Syria widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, makes it much easier for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare war. Although the new law restricts the use of that power to “extreme circumstances,” it has provoked domestic criticism for concentrating it in the hands of just two people. The law is “nothing less than insane,” said Ofer Shelah, a legislator from the centrist Yesh Atid party, which sits in opposition. “I am deluged with calls from experienced security officials who are shocked, and rightfully so,” he wrote on Twitter. The measure, an amendment to the Basic Laws that serve as Israel’s constitution, passed on Monday night by a vote of 62 to 41 in the 120-seat Knesset. The vote was initially overshadowed by Mr. Netanyahu’s dramatic, televised news conference the same night in which he presented evidence that he said proved that Iran had been lying about its efforts to build a nuclear weapon. The presentation, based on a cache of stolen Iranian documents, capped a long campaign by Mr. Netanyahu to kill the international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program. President Trump faces a May 12 deadline to decide whether to pull the United States out of the agreement. And it comes amid an escalating shadow war with Iran. Airstrikes on a suspected missile storage site near Hama, Syria, on Sunday which destroyed a cache of missiles and killed at least 16 people, many of them Iranians, were reported to have been carried out by Israel. Israel is believed to have conducted several previous attacks in Syria on assets belonging to Iran and its allies, and is bracing for promised Iranian retaliation for a strike on an air base in Syria last month.

"THE ASSAULT ON INTELLIGENCE
American National Security In An Age Of Lies
By Michael V. Hayden
257 pp. Penguin Press. $28. Michael Hayden — the retired Air Force general who has directed both the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, now a principal in a Washington consulting group — went on a fact-finding mission in August 2017. The subject of his inquiry, however, was not a foreign espionage service. What Hayden was after were clues to why America had elected Donald Trump. He began by talking to several dozen of his brother’s friends, all Trump supporters, over beers in a Pittsburgh bar. “I knew many of the participants, indeed had grown up with several,” Hayden writes. “But we could have been from different planets.” While Hayden was curious about and civil to the men and women who voted for Trump, he is less kind to the president himself. Trump’s statements during the campaign drove Hayden to become more involved and outspoken than he anticipated in the months before the election. Indeed, it is something of an irony that this military and intelligence veteran — whose 2016 book, “Playing to the Edge,” defended controversial policies of surveillance, interrogation and targeted killing — is among Trump’s most prominent and incisive critics. Hayden, a self-described “internationalist,” opposes Trump’s trade, immigration and foreign policies. He also blasts Trump’s record of exaggeration, falsehood, misstatement and conspiratorial thinking. “All candidates shape their message,” he writes, “but Trump just seemed to say whatever came into his head.” Having led one agency where some operatives wore T-shirts saying “Deny everything, admit nothing,” Hayden is nonetheless impassioned about the importance of empirical data to decision-making.

"BEIJING — China is struggling to find people in Washington who can provide insight into the Trump administration’s aggressive moves on trade. One senior American trade insider tried to help — and wound up in Beijing with little to do but check out the pottery. That insider, Alan Wolff, a veteran senior adviser to the top United States trade representative and a frequent visitor to Beijing, came to China two weeks ago to speak at a conference on agricultural trade and sought to make contact with top Chinese policymakers. But they did not respond to his requests for meetings, and they said days later that they had not known who he was. Mr. Wolff, an admirer of ancient pottery, instead spent a quiet Saturday in a Beijing museum browsing 2,200-year-old bowls. As members of the Trump administration delegation arrived in Beijing on Thursday for two days of high-level talks, they sat across from Chinese officials with limited experience in trade matters. After a bureaucratic reshuffling, the members of China’s new negotiating team have deep backgrounds in economics and finance, but they are less comfortable with the minutiae of trade laws. And although they are familiar with the American delegation’s main players, they are less acquainted with who does what among lower-level advisers and officials when it comes to United States trade policy. Both countries have played down the possibility that the negotiations will resolve the simmering tensions between them. Still, Chinese officials’ lack of experience in international trade law could make it even harder for the two sides to find common ground before the talks end on Friday. "
"Just last month, President Trump told the American people that he knew nothing about how Stormy Daniels received $130,000 in hush money. His lawyer, Michael Cohen, has insisted for months that he had kept Mr. Trump completely in the dark and that he had handled the entire matter on his own as a personal favor to the man for whom he would “take a bullet.” Enter Rudy Giuliani. On Wednesday night, the former mayor of New York and Mr. Trump’s latest legal fixer went on Fox News — where else? — to offer a new version of the Stormy Daniels affair. The president, Mr. Giuliani insisted, had in fact reimbursed Mr. Cohen the $130,000. Even the show’s host, Sean Hannity — another Cohen client — appeared stunned. What in the world was going on? The most generous read of Wednesday night’s showpiece is that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump have made a calculated decision that Mr. Cohen faces real legal peril for having given an illegal campaign contribution in the form of the Stormy Daniels payment, and that Mr. Trump might be subject to co-conspirator liability. The best defense against a Cohen conviction — or worse, a plea deal — on these grounds would be for Mr. Trump to take credit for the payment, since the candidate can give as much money as he wants to his own campaign. But whatever the plan, Mr. Giuliani’s comments have turned the heat up on the president. Judging from Mr. Giuliani’s contrived and ham-handed delivery, it seems likely that this was a highly coordinated affair. Indeed, according to Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Mr. Giuliani said the president was “very pleased” with his remarks. In the middle of a friendly conversation with Mr. Hannity, Mr. Giuliani incongruously shifted the subject to the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. “Which, I mean, is going to turn out to be perfectly legal,” he said. “That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I’m giving you a fact now that you don’t know. It’s not campaign money. No campaign finance violation.” The former mayor continued, “They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it.” "

"If prison holds a dark mirror to society — reflecting our fissures and anxieties and our blinkered faith in institutional bureaucracy — then prison literature offers one way to restore a human element to the system. This week we recommend two books set in prisons: Rachel Kushner’s novel “The Mars Room,” about a single mother and former stripper serving time in California, and “Wrestling With the Devil,” a memoir by the Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o about the year he was jailed as a politically subversive artist. You’ll also find books on motherhood, embattled Iraqi women and the legacy of freethinking female writers, along with a magical story collection, a look at the new space race and, for people who haven’t been paying attention, a memoir by James Comey about his time in government. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books THE MARS ROOM, by Rachel Kushner. (Scribner, $27.) Rachel Kushner’s follow-up to “The Flamethrowers” is about a woman named Romy. The novel shifts from a strip club in San Francisco, where Romy works, to a women’s prison, where she is sent after killing a stalker. “Kushner’s portrait of life inside the women’s prison is grainy and persuasive,” our critic Dwight Garner writes. “Like Denis Johnson in ‘Jesus’ Son,’ a book this novel references, she is on the lookout for bent moments of comic grace.” MOTHERS: An Essay on Love and Cruelty, by Jacqueline Rose. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) Many recent books have combined to offer dispatches from almost every corner of motherhood. Jacqueline Rose’s latest is “a sort of Rosetta Stone for the moment that examines the particular mix of fascination and dread that mothers engender,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes. Rose’s contribution is “a useful synthesis of and loving engagement with many of the writers who have shaped our thinking on motherhood.” A HIGHER LOYALTY: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, by James Comey. (Flatiron, $29.99.) In this memoir, the former F.B.I. director calls the Trump presidency a “forest fire” that is seriously harming the country.”The central themes that Comey returns to throughout this impassioned book,” Michiko Kakutani writes in her review, “are the toxic consequences of lying; and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty to an individual over truth and the rule of law.” THE SPACE BARONS: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the Cosmos, by Christian Davenport. (PublicAffairs, $28.) The new space race involves a number of competitive and highly ambitious entrepreneurs who want to make their mark by taking us into orbit. Davenport explores this new frontier, in an in-depth account that Walter Isaacson calls “an exciting narrative filled with colorful reporting and sharp insights. The book sparkles because of Davenport’s access to the main players and his talent for crisp storytelling.” "
"Over the opposition of lawyers for a company owned by President Donald J. Trump, State Supreme Court Judge Eileen Bransten ruled Thursday that a condominium on the Upper West Side could remove the bronze letters spelling out his name from its 46-story building. The ruling opens the door for the 377 condo owners at 200 Riverside Boulevard to formally vote on whether to keep or remove the T-R-U-M-P letters that have adorned the building, between 69th and 70th Streets, for the past 19 years. Reading a 12-page document from the bench, Judge Bransten repeatedly rejected, dismissed or found the Trump lawyers’ arguments to be unpersuasive and granted summary judgment to the condominium’s board. The ruling came in response to a request in January by the board, asking the judge to declare that a licensing agreement between the building and DJT Holdings, one of Mr. Trump’s companies, that gave the condo the right to use the Trump name on its facade, did not require it to use the name. After Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, a straw poll of building residents found that two-thirds of the 253 condo owners who participated wanted to remove the name, while 23 percent wanted to keep it. But a lawyer for a Trump subsidiary sent a letter promising to file suit if the board took any action. In the letter, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alan Garten, said that if the condo made any effort to remove the Trump lettering, Mr. Trump would “commence appropriate legal proceedings to not only prevent such unauthorized action, but to also recover the significant amount of damages, costs and attorney’s fees.” "
"To the Editor: “Feeling It Has an Edge, China Sets a Hard Line on U.S. Trade Demands” (news article, May 1) reveals the Trump administration’s weak negotiating position. For the United States to demand that China scale back its $300 billion plan to bankroll the country’s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft is equivalent to my asking my neighbors to curb their vocational ambitions, limit their children’s education and stop saving for retirement. An economically robust China is in the long-term interests of the world, and particularly the United States. The times they are a-changin’, and we have to adapt. We’ve done it before. President Trump’s preposterous “demand” is a loser’s whine that the competition is unfair because his competitor is better at it. MARK MILLER, SAN FRANCISCO "
"TEHRAN — Deep in the pit, liberated from its tomb beneath a thick slab of concrete, lay a mud-colored mummy. It was discovered near the shrine to a Shiite saint, Shah Abdol Azim, where kings and noblemen have been laid to rest. An excavator working nearby suddenly fell silent, and workers could be heard crying out in amazement. Had this been Cairo, it would hardly have merited a mention in the local news media. But while Egypt is known for its mummies, Iran certainly is not. Here, the dead are buried in loose white cloth, and the bodies quickly decompose. The operator of the excavator snapped a selfie with the mummified corpse last month and posted it on social media, where it spawned an enticing theory that spread widely: The remains must be those of Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Cossack Brigade officer whom the British helped install as shah in 1925, beginning a family dynasty that lasted 54 years. The excavator driver was brought in for questioning, family members told foreign-based satellite channels. Some people even said he had been arrested, but this could not be independently verified. "
"LOS ANGELES — Two and a half years ago, the playwright David Henry Hwang approached the composer Jeanine Tesori with an idea for a show. Mr. Hwang had seen a recent revival of “The King and I” at Lincoln Center, which got him thinking about how much he loved that classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical (the songs, the story, the moment the king dies, which never failed to make him cry), and yet, how much he didn’t (the play’s history of showing a mostly white cast in yellowface, its implicit racism). How about a story that took all that and upended it? What if, instead of an English governess meeting the king of Siam and bringing the blessings of civilization to his backward-thinking country, we had a Chinese guy meeting Hillary Clinton on the eve of the 2016 election? And then what if, 50 years on, à la “The King and I,” that chance encounter became the stuff of myth, the basis of a blockbuster musical in China? The music would be gorgeous and entrancing — that’s where you come in, Jeanine — in the tradition of the golden age of Broadway musicals. It would be a play with music, or maybe a play that becomes a musical. “There was nothing on paper,” Ms. Tesori recalled. “I don’t even remember an outline.” Even so, she assented, persuaded by Mr. Hwang’s “genuine and ferocious” passion for the project. The product of their alliance, “Soft Power,” has its world premiere at the Ahmanson Theater here when it opens on May 16, signifying the first collaboration between the Tony Award-winning creators (Mr. Hwang for “M. Butterfly,” Ms. Tesori for “Fun Home”). Joining the pair is Leigh Silverman, who has directed several of Mr. Hwang’s plays, including “Yellow Face” and “Chinglish,” and who received a Tony nomination for her work on Ms. Tesori’s “Violet” in 2014. The play is a homecoming of sorts for the Brooklyn-based Mr. Hwang, who was born and raised in the Los Angeles suburb of San Gabriel, and whose Tony-nominated reimagining of “Flower Drum Song” had its premiere at the nearby Mark Taper Forum in 2001. About a half mile east of the Ahmanson is the David Henry Hwang Theater, home of the East West Players, the nation’s longest-running Asian-American repertory company, which partnered with the Center Theater Group on the premiere of “Soft Power.” "
"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has come under fire for interfering in a handful of Democratic primary races around the country. In trying to clear the primary field for the more moderate candidate they think will be the strongest in the general election, party leaders have drawn the anger of some progressive Democrats who think that the mere attempt to do so is corrupt and undemocratic. I beg to differ. No other political parties in democracies in the world have abdicated their leadership role as much as America’s have, weakening themselves and their ability to govern in the process. Party leaders have essentially given away the most important power they have — to determine who can run and win under the party’s banner. This power now rests exclusively with primary voters. This is not to say that there is no role for primaries. But the pendulum between the party’s leaders choosing its candidates and primary voters choosing them has swung so far in the direction of the voters that even the smallest, most modest efforts to intervene in nomination races are deemed illegitimate. The debate over party meddling erupted anew this week when the House Democratic whip, Steny Hoyer, was secretly taped by Levi Tillemann, a candidate in Colorado’s Sixth Congressional District primary. When Mr. Tillemann asked if he should step aside for Jason Crow, an Army veteran who many people think is the stronger candidate, Mr. Hoyer agreed. There were also complaints in February when the D.C.C.C. painted Laura Moser, a primary candidate in Texas’ Seventh Congressional District, as a “Washington insider.” It was a ham-handed attempt to push her out of the race, and the attention may have helped her secure a spot in a runoff. Mr. Tillemann’s handing over of the tape to the press seems to have backfired. Melissa Byrne, a former Bernie Sanders staff member and leader in the progressive movement, tweeted her agreement with Mr. Hoyer — calling Mr. Tillemann, a grandson of former Representative Tom Lantos of California, “an entitled guy expecting to get support because of family legacy.” "
"SEOUL, South Korea — The last time his liberal political party was in power, Moon Jae-in saw his boss at the time, Roh Moo-hyun, then South Korea’s president, walk across the Demilitarized Zone into North Korea for a summit meeting that resulted in a peace declaration and promises of abundant aid. He then saw those deals discarded a year later, in 2008, by a newly elected president who sought closer ties with President George W. Bush, who had branded the North part of an “axis of evil.” Now, as president of South Korea, Mr. Moon is keen not to repeat past failures as he stakes his own political career on brokering a deal between the unpredictable leaders of the United States, his nation’s protector, and North Korea, long its mortal foe. As chief of staff during the Roh administration, from 2003 to 2008, Mr. Moon did not participate in the negotiations with the North, led at the time by Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, or join Mr. Roh’s overland visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. But he did help Mr. Roh organize those talks, held in October 2007. He has clearly taken to heart what he sees as the lessons of that stillborn peace initiative. One lesson was that advancing inter-Korean relations with generous offers of aid was a nonstarter so long as the United States remained locked in a standoff with the North over its nuclear weapons program. Another was that any deal with North Korea must be struck and carried out early in the terms of the South Korean and American presidents. This ensures that the agreement does not die with a change of governments and political ideologies in Seoul and Washington, as the 2007 agreement and other past deals did. "
"The New York Times Company added 139,000 digital-only subscribers in the first quarter of 2018, a 25.5 percent increase from the same period a year ago, helping to fuel total revenue growth and offset a decline in digital advertising. The company said on Thursday that about 40,000 of the new subscribers came from digital products like the cooking and crossword apps. The gains helped push the company’s total digital-only subscribers to roughly 2.8 million. The company said total revenue was about $414 million, a 3.8 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017. Subscription revenue increased 7.5 percent to about $260 million, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the company’s total revenue. “Retention of our core digital news product remains a very encouraging story,” Mark Thompson, the company’s chief executive, said during an earnings call with investors. “We continue to retain the postelection cohorts, some of whom are now well over a year into their subscriptions at least, as well as earlier cohorts.” Despite the growth in subscribers, however, the company saw a 6 percent decline in digital advertising revenue from the same period a year ago. It was the first time since the second quarter of 2016 that digital advertising declined. In the first quarter of 2017, digital advertising increased 19 percent, part of the so-called Trump bump. “The character of our advertising model, with its increasing reliance on strategic commercial partnerships and often large individual campaigns, means more lumpy results than was the case, say, three years ago, as individual partnerships and campaigns come on and off stream,” Mr. Thompson said.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Much about Rudy Giuliani’s Fox News interview last night is still unclear — including whether he helped or hurt his client, President Trump. But one thing is clear: Giuliani has forfeited any claim to being a patriot who believes in this country’s system of law and government. He is now going out of his way to besmirch honest law-enforcement officials who present a risk to Trump. Giuliani, like Trump, has decided that the law is an instrument of power, not justice. “Giuliani just referred to federal law enforcement agents from the district where he used to be US attorney as ‘stormtroopers,’ ” Matt Miller, a former Justice Department official, tweeted last night. “What a despicable human being he is.” For anyone who remembers Giuliani’s years as mayor of New York — which included a lot of good and a lot of bad, but never sank to these depths — his new job as Trump’s enforcer is a sad sight to behold.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday directly contradicted his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress who says she had an affair with him. Mr. Trump said he paid a monthly retainer to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and suggested that the payment by Mr. Cohen to the actress could not be considered a campaign contribution. The president’s comments reiterated an explosive announcement late Wednesday by one of his recently-hired attorneys, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said on Fox News that the president reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment to the actress Stephanie Clifford, who performs as Stormy Daniels. Though Mr. Giuliani described his interview as part of a strategy, the disclosure caught several Trump advisers by surprise, sending some scrambling on Thursday morning to determine how to confront the situation. In three Twitter posts Thursday morning, the president repeated some of what Mr. Giuliani said a day earlier, specifically that Mr. Trump repaid a $130,000 payment Mr. Cohen made to Ms. Clifford just days before the presidential election in 2016. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump said this removed the question of whether it was a campaign finance violation. Mr. Trump also continued to deny the affair. "

"We may never stop arguing about which historic currents swept President Trump into the White House. Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, is unlikely to have had Trump in mind when he described the fourth industrial revolution in Davos in January 2016: Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued, First Schwab looked at the bright side: Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many “workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,” he said, and the “middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.” We tend to think of immigration — now fracturing parties of the left and right both here and in Europe — as distinct from technological innovation, but the two issues are intertwined on many levels, even down to the fact that most unauthorized immigrants are people who fly here and overstay their visas, not those who cross rural borders on foot. And air travel is the least of it. In an August 2015 Times story, “A 21st-Century Migrant’s Essentials: Food, Shelter, Smartphone,” Matthew Brunwasser described the situation that obtains now: Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, “Patterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century”: There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative. “The IT revolution improved living standards and its great technical achievements enjoy a high level of consumer and political support,” Mordecai Kurz, an economist at Stanford, wrote in a June 2017 paper. “However these sources of social benefits are also the cause of social losses and rising inequality that threaten the foundation of democratic society.” Schwab, a year earlier, had put it this way: There is an “inexorable shift from simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution).” With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences: Just to give a sense of the exponential nature of the rate of technological change, here’s how Sergey Brin described it in this year’s “Founders’ Letter,” which was released earlier this week: In point of fact, the use of robots — and of other methods of replacing workers with machines — has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe.

"The government of President Bashar al-Assad is resurgent in Syria, steadily retaking terrain lost to the rebels. This may bring to an end one set of conflicts, but it could spark newer, potentially more dangerous confrontations. The key to preventing the Syrian civil war from splintering into an even more chaotic and deadly phase will be Russia, whose September 2015 military intervention gave it control of Syrian airspace and placed it politically in the driver’s seat. But the United States, too, could still play an important role in preventing matters from getting worse. To understand how perilous the situation in Syria is, look at the map: In the northwest, in Idlib Province, a “de-escalation zone” that is monitored by the Turkish Army remains tenuous. The Assad government is keen to drive the Turks out, as well as jihadists and other rebels. In the northeast, the Kurds have established a form of self-government, led by the militia called Y.P.G., an American ally in the fight against Islamic State. But that group is the Syrian affiliate of the P.K.K. in Turkey, and is therefore in the Turkish military’s cross hairs. Further to the east, remnants of the Islamic State still roam the desert near the Iraqi border, pursued by the United States and the Y.P.G. as well as by the Syrian regime, and backed by Iran and associated militias. The greatest danger lies in the south, along the armistice line that divides Israel and Syria. Recent tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran and its allies have raised the risk of escalation. In February, only a phone call from President Vladimir Putin of Russia to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel induced Israel to call off further airstrikes against Syrian government and Iranian targets after an Iranian drone invaded Israeli airspace. More recently, Israel piggybacked on international outrage over an apparent regime chemical attack to carry out a second round of strikes, reportedly killing 10 Iranian military personnel and several others at a Syrian airfield. Iran vowed to respond, and is likely to do so at a time of its choosing. This is a game of chicken that could easily spiral out of control. As Mr. Putin’s intervention in February showed, Russia is ideally placed to prevent an outright war between Israel and Iran across Syria’s smoking remains. Unlike the United States, Moscow has strong working relationships with nearly everyone: Tel Aviv as well as Tehran, Damascus as much as Ankara, and Hezbollah to boot. And Russia has an overriding interest in preventing a war in Syria between Israel and Iran, if only to preserve its own gains, starting with Mr. Assad’s survival. But is Russia able and ready to play this role? The best way to prevent a confrontation between Iran (and Hezbollah) and Israel would be to establish a communications channel for all parties directly with the Kremlin and Russian military. Mr. Putin, though, might not have much interest in this kind of proactive measure when he can currently magnify his personal role by simply picking up the phone to defuse a crisis. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen  for a $130,000 payment to the pornographic film actress Stephanie Clifford before the 2016 election, Rudolph Giuliani, now one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, said in an interview Wednesday night. That contradicts earlier versions of what happened. Mr. Trump said last month that he had no knowledge of the payment, made in exchange for Ms. Clifford’s silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump more than a decade ago. Here’s a partial transcript of Mr. Giuliani’s interview on Fox News, as well as a recap of the diverging statements that Mr. Trump and his team have made about the money. • There has been a legal debate about whether the payment amounted to a campaign contribution. Mr. Giuliani said his disclosure served to demonstrate that campaign finance rules weren’t violated, a point that Mr. Trump reiterated this morning. • The man who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment is now working for President Trump. In a sign that the White House sees no immediate end to its legal problems, Emmet Flood will replace Ty Cobb, the lawyer who had persuaded Mr. Trump to cooperate with the special counsel in the Russia investigation. Mr. Flood is expected to take a more adversarial approach with Robert Mueller’s inquiry. • Separately on Wednesday, Mr. Trump warned that he might have to “get involved” in a dispute between a group of House Republicans and the deputy attorney general. The lawmakers want access to documents related to the special counsel’s investigation and other politically charged cases. "
"To the Editor: Re “Giuliani Asserts Trump Refunded Payment to Star” (front page, May 3): So, Rudolph W. Giuliani says the $130,000 “hush money” payment that Michael Cohen made to a pornographic film actress was eventually paid by Donald Trump, who had previously declared that he knew nothing about any payment or where the money came from, thereby absolving Michael Cohen of any Trump campaign finance law violation, but now opening the possibility that Mr. Trump may have violated campaign finance laws. “Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive” (Sir Walter Scott).

PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. To the Editor: Donald Trump is hardly the first president or politician to lie to the American people about his sexcapades. Bill Clinton was a master at that game. But with Mr. Clinton, at least as far as we know, he didn’t pay anyone through back-channel fixers to keep them quiet — all in order to influence a campaign. Mr. Trump’s dismissal of hush money payments and nondisclosure agreements as no big deal (“very common among celebrities and people of wealth”) reeks of entitlement and sexism, but he’d be foolish to think the American people and the justice system won’t figure out why Stormy Daniels got paid out. This whole episode is sadly emblematic of our morally compromised president, and the party that continues to defend him. CODY LYON, BROOKLYN To the Editor: For those who regard the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York as a model of what a prosecutor’s office should be, it was distressing to see the former leader of that office, Rudolph Giuliani, telling Sean Hannity that F.B.I. agents acting under the supervision of that office were “storm troopers.” Et tu, Brute? JOHN S. MARTIN JR., NEW YORK The writer was the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980 to 1983. "

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump’s former doctor Harold Bornstein recently said that Trump crafted the language in a glowing health report Bornstein signed off on in 2015. The letter read: “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” The late-night hosts were far from surprised to learn that Trump was behind the hyperbole. Stephen Colbert said he had copies of letters that Trump had dictated to his other doctors. President Emmanuel Macron of France slipped up during a joint news conference with Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, calling Turnbull’s wife “delicious.” Trevor Noah had some fun with that. As it turns out, it was an innocent mistake: The French word for delicious — délicieux — can also be used to mean “charming.” But for a moment, Noah was concerned. Samantha Bee is concerned about Facebook’s privacy policies, and she’s not satisfied by the apology the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, offered before Congress last month. She pointed out that he has apologized at various points throughout Facebook’s history for the way the social media platform handles users’ data. Bee had some sharp words for Zuckerberg. But then she cleverly pointed out that like almost everyone else in the media, she depends on Facebook to get content to viewers. "
"At the time, Martin Torres Reyes thought he had found a path to a green card. It was early 2015, and Mr. Torres, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, heard about a lawyer who was promising legal permanent residency to people who had lived in the United States for 10 years and had American-born children. Mr. Torres went to see the lawyer, Thomas T. Hecht, at his Times Square office, and for an initial fee of $750, the lawyer said that he would get a work permit in six months, and then some time later, the green card. According to a lawsuit filed late Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, this was fraud. Mr. Hecht and his son, Leonard H. Hecht, the complaint said, tricked Mr. Reyes and at least 25 other undocumented immigrants from New York. The plaintiffs all thought they were applying for a green card, but instead, they claimed in the suit that the lawyers filed different paperwork, for asylum, without their knowledge. “Our community is under attack from all directions, and they know it,” Mr. Torres, 40, said in Spanish in an interview this week, referring to immigration lawyers. He paid a total of $1,100 to the Hechts in installments before leaving the firm. The “10-year scheme,” lawyers say, is a two-step process, beginning with an asylum application. To qualify for asylum, applicants must show they were persecuted or fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion in their home country. Applications must be filed within a year of arrival, with narrow exceptions. "
"TEHRAN — Iran’s intelligence operatives have arrested two, and possibly three, Iranians with British connections in the past two months, human rights activists and others said Thursday. At least two of the three Iranians in question are also British citizens, and the arrests may be part of an attempt by the Iranian authorities to gain leverage in an old dispute with Britain over more than $400 million in undelivered weaponry. Aras Amiri, a 32-year-old art student and an employee of the British Council, a cultural organization governed by royal charter that promotes Britain abroad, is the latest known to have been arrested. Ms. Amiri, an Iranian citizen who has lived in Britain for about 10 years and traveled to Iran at least three times a year, has been in custody in Iran since March 14, a cousin in the United States, Mohsen Omrani, confirmed on Thursday. While some members of her family in Iran sought to keep the arrest quiet, Mr. Omrani said in a telephone interview, he had decided to publicize it, beginning with a Twitter post on Tuesday. "
"The Volkswagen emissions scandal reached the highest echelons of the company on Thursday after its former chief executive was charged with conspiracy in the company’s rigging of diesel vehicles to feign compliance with federal pollution standards. The indictment of the former executive, Martin Winterkorn, who resigned shortly after the emissions scandal erupted in September 2015, significantly raises the stakes for Volkswagen. The charges contradict the German carmaker’s steadfast insistence that no members of its management board were involved in the emissions fraud. They also weaken the company’s defense in a related suit by shareholders — potentially adding billions of dollars to the scandal’s already astronomical cost. Despite President Trump’s efforts to water down auto emissions standards, the indictment indicates that the Justice Department continues to pursue an investigation of Volkswagen that began during the Obama administration. And it provides a rare spectacle: a chief executive facing criminal charges. “If you try to deceive the United States, then you will pay a heavy price,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Thursday. “These are serious allegations, and we will prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law.” Many in the industry have long said it was implausible that the illegal software could have been installed in millions of diesel models worldwide for nearly a decade without the knowledge of top management — especially at Volkswagen, known for its top-down culture.

"The Republican Debbie Lesko’s shockingly close margin of victory in a recent special election in Arizona’s Eighth Congressional District — she won by five percentage points where Donald Trump won by over 20 — again raises the prospect of a blue wave in the midterms. It is true that Republicans have performed abysmally in special elections during the Trump presidency, not only losing a host of previously safe seats but also winning the rest with sharply reduced margins like Ms. Lesko’s. If these results truly depict the state of the electorate, Republicans could be looking at a historically large wipeout. But special elections differ from the midterms in two important respects. Because they are one-off elections with no other races on the ballot, turnout is often lower than it is for regularly scheduled elections like the midterms. They also do not, by definition, feature incumbents. The combination of both factors in these special elections may be painting a darker picture for Republicans than a fuller analysis warrants. The Virginia general elections of November 2017 are a case in point. The media takeaway was that the Democrats won all three statewide races and picked up 15 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. But virtually all of those seats had been carried by Hillary Clinton the previous year. Moreover, Republican candidates ran ahead of President Trump’s percentage in 25 of the 26 closest races. Non-incumbents ran about 2.5 percentage points ahead of the president, while incumbents ran over four points ahead. If Republican candidates did this well in the fall, Democratic gains would be well short of enough to take over the House. This is the opposite of what has happened in special congressional elections since Mr. Trump’s inauguration. With two exceptions, the Republican candidate has run between five and nine percentage points behind Mr. Trump’s results. One exception, the special election for Third Congressional District in Utah, also should not give Republicans comfort. While the Republican winner John Curtis ran well ahead of Mr. Trump’s percentage, that number was artificially low because of the candidacy of the conservative Mormon independent Evan McMullin. Mr. Curtis ran 19 percentage points behind Mitt Romney’s percentage in 2012; even when the votes from two conservative minor party candidates are added, the combined Republican-conservative vote was seven percentage points lower than Mr. Romney’s. The other exception, however, is in line with what we saw in Virginia. The Republican Karen Handel, in a special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, had been a local and statewide official for over a decade before her House campaign. She had also twice run for statewide office, carrying the areas in this district in both races. She was not an incumbent, but voters throughout the district knew her and had previously supported her as they would an incumbent. Despite her Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, spending a record $31 million against her, she prevailed relatively easily, winning by 52-48 percent. More important, she ran about 3.5 percentage points ahead of President Trump’s showing in that district, in line with what we saw incumbents do in the Virginia elections. "
"The Pentagon and the Trump administration apparently have misled Americans about growing military involvement in a war in Yemen that we should have nothing to do with. In the latest expansion of America’s secret wars, about a dozen Army commandos have been on Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen since late last year, according to an exclusive report by The Times. The commandos are helping to locate and destroy missiles and launch sites used by indigenous Houthi rebels in Yemen to attack Saudi cities. This involvement puts the lie to Pentagon statements that American military aid to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen is limited to aircraft refueling, logistics and intelligence, and is not related to combat. When senators at a hearing in March demanded to know whether American troops were at risk of entering hostilities with the Houthis, Gen. Joseph Votel, head of the Central Command, assured them, “We’re not parties to this conflict.” In at least 14 countries, American troops are fighting extremist groups that are professed enemies of the United States or are connected, sometimes quite tenuously, to such militants. The Houthis pose no such threat to the United States. But they are backed by Iran, so the commandos’ deployment increases the risk that the United States could come into direct conflict with that country, a target of increasing ire from the administration, the Saudis and Israelis. Such significant military decisions require public debate to force presidents and their generals to justify their decisions and be held accountable for the consequences. But checks and balances have eroded since Sept. 11, 2001, as ordinary Americans became indifferent to the country’s endless wars against terrorists and Congress largely abdicated its constitutional role to share responsibility with the president for sending troops into battle.

"SunPower is the nation’s No. 2 commercial solar-power company, employing thousands of workers directly and indirectly. But it makes most of its solar panels abroad, and with the tariffs recently imposed by President Trump costing it as much as $2 million a week, SunPower is fighting for an exemption. One of its rivals, SolarWorld Americas, produces panels domestically. Buffeted by foreign competition, it was behind the original push for the tariffs. Now the two American companies are merging. It’s all part of the disruption, distortion and uncertainty from an escalating trade offensive aimed primarily at China. In barely three months, the tariffs — the first shot fired by Mr. Trump in that campaign — are fundamentally reshaping the solar industry and its prospects. A Chinese player announced plans to open a factory in Florida as early as this fall. With its SolarWorld acquisition, SunPower moved to prevent further loss to its business by locating a bigger share of its production in the United States. Both companies are being hit with tariffs on high-efficiency panels they produce in Malaysia. Those efforts only blunt the negative effects of the industry fallout. While producing more panels in the United States will create a few hundred jobs, the tariffs could cost tens of thousands, largely on the installation side of the business. Dozens of solar companies are now petitioning to be exempted from the tariffs, and a bipartisan group in Congress has introduced a bill to overturn them altogether. “I think that any action that brings new investment to the United States is welcome,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “But the tariffs have slowed down the growth of our industry. The growth has been muted, and that means jobs are not being created.” Her group said the tariffs could cost as many as 23,000 American jobs this year. "
"President Trump, his aides and Republicans in Congress tried their best last year to mislead the public about legislation that would cripple the Affordable Care Act and cut taxes for corporations while doing little to help workers. Now, a few of these Republicans have come clean — at least momentarily. Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida and former presidential candidate, told The Economist recently that the big corporate tax cut he voted for late last year was passed under the false pretense that businesses would use their tax windfall on their employees. As Mr. Rubio accurately said in the interview, “There’s no evidence whatsoever that the money’s been massively poured back into the American worker.” Mr. Rubio later walked back his assessment of the tax bill, writing in National Review that he thinks it “has been good for Americans.” But it was refreshing to see him clearly acknowledge, even once, what many economists and voters have long known. Sure enough, what we have seen so far is that companies are buying back stock — which benefits a small group of well-heeled investors — while giving their workers modest bonuses at best. Then there’s Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s first health and human services secretary, who was ousted from the administration for blowing tax dollars on private plane trips. Last year he said, contrary to available evidence, that the provision in the health care act that requires people to be insured was driving up the cost of health insurance. On Tuesday, Mr. Price did a 180 in a speech at a health care conference in Washington, noting correctly that, in fact, it was Congress’s decision to eliminate the health insurance mandate that “drives up the cost” of insurance.

"MEXICO CITY — Have you heard the “news”? The Mexican presidential hopeful Ricardo Anaya wants to help the United States build a wall on the Rio Grande. And the campaign of his leftist rival Andrés Manuel López Obrador is being organized out of authoritarian Venezuela. Meanwhile, Mexico’s first lady, Angélica Rivera, has called Mr. López Obrador a “pobreton,” or pauper. All of those stories are totally false. They were summarized in a roundup of fake news stories by Mexico’s leading legitimate news network, Televisa. They represent just a sample of the mountain of false stories circulating on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and WhatsApp in advance of Mexico’s presidential election on July 1. This flurry of misinformation illustrates the ways in which, in the age of social media, fake news has become a global problem that can affect any political election in any country on the planet. Even this newspaper got pulled into the fake news of the Mexican election. A Facebook page showed a poll claiming to have been conducted by The Times putting José Antonio Meade of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party in first place. In reality, there had been no such poll. (A Bloomberg poll tracker puts Mr. Meade in third.) So far, it is hard to discern whether the sea of misinformation is having a significant impact on the Mexican race — or whether dark forces have aligned to support a particular candidate, as they appeared to in the United States presidential election. The fake news could be coming from several angles. Mr. López Obrador leads by a chasm of over 18 percentage points, according to the Bloomberg tracker. That is despite his being on the end of his share of fake smears, including one that he would seize second homes and another that his son secretly drives a Lamborghini. Mother Jones identified four “sketchy” websites — three of them designed to look like traditional news websites — that appeared to be mounting coordinated attacks on Mr. López Obrador, 64, a former mayor of Mexico City.

"Republican candidates have pretty much stopped talking about their party’s only major legislative achievement under Donald Trump, the 2017 tax cut. Ads touting the tax law have largely vanished from the airwaves. But the Koch brothers — big boosters of the cut and among its biggest beneficiaries — haven’t given up. Their latest move: spending $20 million to mobilize an army of salespeople who are going door to door trying to disabuse voters of the perception that the tax cut was a big giveaway to the wealthy, offering little to ordinary working families. But they have a problem: Public perceptions about who benefits from the tax cut, and who doesn’t, are accurate, a point Apple just nicely demonstrated with its announcement of a huge stock buyback. To be fair, the notion that a big tax cut for corporations — which was the main element of last year’s law — might eventually redound to the benefit of workers isn’t crazy. But the two key words here are “might” and “eventually.” The story tax-cut boosters tell runs as follows: America is part of a global capital market in which capital flows wherever it yields the highest after-tax rate of return. By cutting taxes on corporations, Trump and his allies have given corporations an incentive to invest here. Investment will expand capacity, driving up the demand for workers and thus lead to higher wages. And for a little while Apple seemed to be following the script: Back in January the company announced that it would be bringing most of the $252 billion in cash it was holding abroad back to America.

"AUBURN, Wash. — President Trump likes to keep negotiating partners on their toes. But workers like Charles Cesmat have been just as unnerved by the president’s recent moves on trade. Mr. Cesmat is a parts manager at a Boeing plant in Renton, Wash., just south of Seattle. One of every four planes Boeing assembles is sent to China. Each time Mr. Trump attacks Beijing on Twitter, or announces a new set of tariffs, Mr. Cesmat winces. “I’m concerned a potential trade war could affect work for our members and work for me,” Mr. Cesmat said. “Thousands of people’s jobs rely on a working relationship with China.” Nowhere is that truer than in Washington, which sent $18 billion in goods to China last year, more than any other state. A congressional race here has become a crucial test of whether Mr. Trump’s upending of the norms of international trade will come at the expense of Republican candidates. The spat with Beijing has rattled the state’s juggernaut aerospace industry, as workers and business owners reckon with the possibility that their livelihood could be at risk. Boeing shares economic dominance with giants like Amazon and Microsoft, but trade still supports 40 percent of all jobs in Washington, according to a Seattle consulting firm. “Trade issues are high on people’s minds,” said Chris Mefford, president of Community Attributes Inc., the firm that produced the estimate. “They are wondering and worrying how it’s going to play out.” "
"Remington Outdoor, one of the country’s oldest and largest gun makers, said this week that a bankruptcy judge had approved its reorganization plan, which will transfer ownership of the company to creditors including JPMorgan. After a court hearing in Delaware on Wednesday, Remington said it expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings by the end of the month with more than $775 million in debt wiped from its balance sheet. Remington, which sought bankruptcy protection in March after sales fell and its debt piled up, will no longer be owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Instead, some of its creditors, including JPMorgan’s asset management arm, will take control. JPMorgan and fellow Remington creditors may opt to try to sell the gun company. The bank declined to comment on the creditors’ plans. Wall Street has started to rethink its close ties with gun makers, especially since the shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February that left 17 people dead and touched off a series of protests and boycotts against companies linked to the firearms industry. This spring, Citigroup said it would require business customers to restrict certain firearms sales, while Bank of America said it would stop lending to manufacturers that make military-inspired firearms for civilian use. Other companies, like the investment management firm BlackRock, have asked firearms companies for details about their business practices. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump contradicted his earlier statements that he knew nothing of a payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress who says she had an affair with him. Writing on Twitter, Mr. Trump suggested that the payment from his lawyer, Michael Cohen, came from a monthly retainer he paid and could not be considered a campaign contribution. The tweets had far more formal and legalistic language than his typical morning messages to the world, and came after one of his attorneys, Rudy Giuliani, said the same during an interview on Fox News. Our correspondent writes that the episode suggests that the president is losing control of his narrative, and it could come back to haunt him. _____ "
"Until Wednesday night, Donald Trump and people in his orbit insisted that the president had known nothing about the $130,000 hush money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels made by his lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, days before the 2016 election. Last month on Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump about it directly: “Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?” His response was a categorical no. This denial was always implausible, and now we have new evidence that Trump was lying. On Wednesday evening, Rudy Giuliani, whose appointment to Trump’s legal team was announced two weeks ago, appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and casually admitted that Trump had repaid Cohen for the money he gave to Daniels “over a period of several months.” This was a bombshell. And in the 12 hours that followed, both Trump and Giuliani made a series of statements so seemingly self-sabotaging and undisciplined that observers began searching for some sort of hidden strategy or logic. Were they trying to get out ahead of a coming revelation? To set off a metaphorical smoke bomb that would distract from some other scandalous development? Or were they really as blundering and incompetent as they appeared? I suspect the answer is a combination of the three. But their motivations are less important than the information they’ve provided us. Whether they realize it or not, experts say they appear to have admitted that Trump and Cohen broke the law. The question is whether the impunity that Trump has enjoyed so far will hold or whether this farce of a presidency will, at long last, begin to crumble under the weight of its own sleaze. Sadly, it’s unlikely that Trump will pay much of a political price for deceiving the country about his sex life and attendant payoffs. Even before Giuliani’s revelations, USA Today reported, based on interviews with a 25-person focus group of Trump voters, that many of the president’s supporters already assumed he was lying about Daniels, and didn’t care. Speaking on CNN on Thursday, Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, said there should be hearings on the Daniels payout, but he’s about to retire. Most of the Republican Party knows who Trump is and has submitted to him anyway. But as a legal matter, Trump seems to be in more trouble than he was 24 hours ago. Norman Eisen, chairman of Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, was almost giddy when I spoke to him on Thursday morning. “We’re seeing the unraveling of a corrupt regime by the force and power of the law, and the people who are the handmaidens of the law,” he said.

"Mayor Bill de Blasio is championing a plan that would make New York City a pioneer in creating supervised injection sites for illegal drug users, part of a novel but contentious strategy to combat the epidemic of fatal overdoses caused by the use of heroin and other opioids. Safe injection sites have been considered successful in cities in Canada and Europe, but do not yet exist in the United States. Leaders in San Francisco, Philadelphia and Seattle have declared their intention to create supervised sites, although none have yet done so because of daunting obstacles. Among them: The sites would seem to violate federal law. The endorsement of the strategy by New York, the largest city in the country, which last year saw 1,441 overdose deaths, may give the movement behind it impetus. For the sites to open, New York City must still clear some significant hurdles. At minimum, the plan calls for the support of several district attorneys, and, more critically, the State Department of Health, which answers to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The city sent a letter on Thursday to the state, asserting its intention to open four injection centers. Although Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio are Democrats, they have engaged in a yearslong feud that has seen few examples of cooperation. Mr. Cuomo, who is facing an energetic primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, has not said whether he supports injection sites, a popular cause among more left-leaning Democrats. The plan calls for four sites to open after a 6- to 12-month period of outreach to the communities where they will be located. They would operate as pilot programs for a year. "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has contradicted Mr. Trump’s rationale for firing James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director, saying he was dismissed because he would not say publicly what he had told the president privately: that Mr. Trump was not under scrutiny in the Russia investigation at the time. “He fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation,” Mr. Giuliani said in an interview late Wednesday with Sean Hannity of Fox News. “He’s entitled to that.” Mr. Giuliani’s assertion contradicted the myriad explanations that the president and his aides have given for the firing, and was the first public acknowledgment by a Trump adviser for what Mr. Comey has maintained: that he was fired for his handling of the Russia investigation. At the time of Mr. Comey’s dismissal last May, both Mr. Trump and his aides cited his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and his decision to say publicly during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, would not be charged with a crime. Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said that Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation “was a total disgrace.” Later in the interview, Mr. Giuliani added: “I’m sorry, Hillary. I know you’re very disappointed you didn’t win. But you’re a criminal. Equal justice would mean you should go to jail. I do not know why the Justice Department is not investigating her.” Mr. Comey said in July 2016 that Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information was “extremely careless” but fell short of criminal behavior and that he was not recommending charges.

"ALBANY — Facing considerable political headwinds, another Republican in the New York State Senate announced his retirement on Thursday, as Democrats salivated about possible gains all across President Trump’s home state. All told, five Republicans in the last week have said they will not seek re-election, opening up political battlegrounds in potential swing districts from Suffolk County to Syracuse. The latest to do so had earned his right to retirement: Senator William J. Larkin Jr. is 90 years old, and had served in Albany nearly 40 years, including a decade in the State Assembly. On Thursday, Mr. Larkin said that he was, “with a heavy heart,” giving up a career in public service, which also included military service in World War II and the Korean War. “My final battle is with Father Time,” he said, in an announcement in Newburgh. This fall, his battle would have been with Democrats, who have long coveted Mr. Larkin’s Hudson Valley district, the 39th, which has substantially more registered Democrats than Republicans. Still, Mr. Larkin had comfortably been re-elected in 2016, though his physical stamina had been tested during the current legislative session, when he was sometimes brought to and from the Senate chamber in a wheelchair. On Wednesday, Mr. Larkin’s Republican colleague, Senator Tom Croci of Long Island, had announced that he, too, was leaving the chamber, returning to military service in the Navy. (Learning of Mr. Croci’s decision to retire, Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic Conference, had quipped, “ At this rate, there will be no one left in the Republican conference by the end of session,” slated to conclude in June.) On Thursday, however, the venerable Mr. Larkin received nothing but bipartisan praise for his long service. “Senator Larkin has always been a gentleman and a friend,” said Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the Senate Democrats. “I hope he enjoys his retirement and this opportunity to spend time with family, friends and loved ones.” "
"No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every Friday for new suggestions from our TV critic on what to watch. ‘An Emmy for Megan’
When to watch: Now, on anemmyformegan.com. The beloved comedy writer Megan Amram has worked on such acclaimed shows as “Parks and Recreation,” “Silicon Valley” and “The Good Place.” Now her sights are set on winning Emmys in two obscure categories: outstanding short form comedy or drama series, and outstanding actress therein. This very silly six-part web series meets those categories’ qualifications exactly, and she winkingly panders to Emmy voters by crying, playing the violin and tapping some of her famous friends to lobby on her behalf. ‘WildWoods’
When to watch: Now, on Hulu.
Add it to your Watchlist Cooper is a Sasquatch who moves to the woods to lead a more deliberate life, and there he befriends Poppy, a sugar glider. In each brief episode, the two explore nature, contemplate selfhood and work through their odd-couple styles: Cooper can be a self-absorbed ding-dong, and Poppy can be a bit set in her ways. As far as kid-show characters go, though, they are both darling and not at all annoying, as if the Muppets had cousins from Belfast, Northern Ireland. ‘The Good Fight’
When to watch: From Sunday, on CBS All Access.
Add it to your Watchlist The first season of “The Good Fight” was a very good spinoff of “The Good Wife.” This second season is an excellent show completely in its own right, vastly more vicious and political (and anti-Trump — if that’s not your bag, this isn’t your show) than even its predecessor. The romance between Lucca (Cush Jumbo) and Colin (Justin Bartha) continues to be the respite for the show’s otherwise fiery goings on, and that is especially true this week, when violence makes its way to the offices of Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Contradictions in Washington, a deadly dust storm in India and trade talks in China. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump contradicted his earlier statements that he knew nothing of a payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress who says she had an affair with him. Now, Mr. Trump suggested that the payment from his lawyer, Michael Cohen, came from a monthly retainer he paid and could not be considered a campaign contribution. The comments came after one of his attorneys, Rudolph Giuliani, appeared to veer off-script on the episode. The string of factual distortions that came to light suggest the president is losing control of his narrative, and it could come back to haunt him, writes our correspondent. _____ "
"False. Of the three Americans currently known to be held in North Korea, two were arrested after Mr. Trump took office — meaning the Obama administration would not have sought their release. Kim Hak-song was arrested on May 6, 2017. He worked at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, a university founded by American evangelical scholars. Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk, was detained on April 22, 2017. He taught at the same university in Pyongyang for a month. The third hostage — Kim Dong-chul — has been held in North Korea since October 2015. He is the only one of the three who was detained during the Obama administration. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, suggested on Thursday afternoon that Mr. Trump was including Otto Warmbier among the three hostages the president had referred to in his Twitter post. Mr. Warmbier, an American college student, was detained in North Korea in January 2016. He was flown back to the United States last June in a vegetative state and died at a hospital in Ohio shortly after. Ms. Sanders also said she “couldn’t confirm the validity” of reports about the hostages’ release. She was referring to a Thursday morning interview during which Rudolph W. Giuliani — who recently joined the president’s legal team — said three American hostages in North Korea would be released “today.” Asked if Mr. Giuliani was authorized to discuss foreign policy on the Trump administration’s behalf, Ms. Sanders said: “Not that I’m aware of.” "
"As of last week, the American public had been told that President Trump’s doctor had certified he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected.” That the president was happy with his legal team and would not hire a new lawyer. That he did not know about the $130,000 payment to a former pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with him. As of this week, it turns out that the statement about his health was not actually from the doctor but had been dictated by Mr. Trump himself. That the president has split with the leaders of his legal team and hired the same new lawyer he had denied recruiting. And that Mr. Trump himself had financed the $130,000 payment intended to buy the silence of the actress known as Stormy Daniels. Even in the current political environment that some derisively call the post-truth world, the past few days have offered a head-spinning series of revelations that conflicted with the version of events Mr. Trump and his associates had previously provided. Whether called lies or misstatements, Mr. Trump’s history of falsehoods has been extensively documented, but the string of factual distortions that came to light this week could come back to haunt him. The shifting statements also illustrated starkly why some of the president’s lawyers have urged him not to submit to an interview by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia during the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice to thwart that investigation. Those lawyers have said Mr. Mueller is setting a perjury trap for Mr. Trump. What they do not say publicly is that they worry the president would be unable to avoid contradicting himself. Mr. Trump has for years presented selective and creative accounts of his life and businesses — “truthful hyperbole,” as he put it in his first book — and at times this habit has gotten him in trouble. Even after being elected president, he paid $25 million to settle lawsuits accusing him of fraud for hoodwinking students who signed up for his now defunct, for-profit Trump University. As a matter of politics, the latest contradictions may not matter much, at least not yet. The public to some extent has grown accustomed to the factual deviations or written them off as unimportant. Just this week, Mr. Trump surpassed 3,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to a running tally by The Washington Post — an average of 6.5 per day. "
"As Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was preparing to defend himself before Congress last week against charges of extravagant spending and other improprieties, he found time to travel to Cochran, Ga., to address the Georgia Forestry Association. On the day after Earth Day, he announced yet another policy that will damage the environment he is supposed to be protecting. He told the group that the E.P.A. would now declare the burning of wood from managed forests for energy production by power plants and other stationary sources to be “carbon neutral.” By that, he meant that, in the agency’s view, there would be no net release of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, because replanting the forest that had just been cut and burned could offset those emissions. This determination could make it easier for wood-burning power plants to win regulatory approval. But Mr. Pruitt’s declaration contradicts some basic facts. Burning wood from forests to generate electricity is not carbon neutral when the direct emissions from combustion, plus emissions from soil and logging and processing the wood, are considered. Scientific studies have shown that it will worsen the consequences of climate change for decades or through the end of this century. This was not a decision based in science, but in politics, a giveaway to the forest products industry. As Mr. Pruitt has put it, it will provide the industry with “certainty” in the “agency’s permitting process.” The forestry association understandably applauded the decision. “Administrator Pruitt’s announcement today reflects the clear scientific consensus on forest biomass,” said Andres Villegas, the president of the group. This statement also could not be farther from the truth. We are among 13 research scientists who have joined to challenge these blatantly inaccurate assertions. We are not outliers on this. In January, 796 scientists from the United States and Europe sent a letter to the European Union Parliament warning against a plan that would provide incentives for cutting trees to burn for energy.

"When it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up? While regulators and a federal judge ponder that question, the great disrupter — Amazon — is already raising prices. Last week, it said its Amazon Prime service, which includes its extensive video offerings along with free shipping and other benefits, would cost $119, a 20 percent increase from the current $99. To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it’s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon’s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring. Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October. As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there’s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner’s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren’t direct competitors. While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense). But Amazon is already vertically integrated — it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).

"Everything seemed to be falling apart. After his election to the presidency in November 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt received a talkative friend. If Roosevelt could rescue America from the Great Depression, the friend said, then he would be remembered as the greatest of presidents; if he failed, he would go down as the worst. There were alternatives to democratic capitalism afoot in the world: fascism in Germany and Italy, communism in Russia. Listening to his visitor, Roosevelt was matter-of-fact. “If I fail,” he said, “I shall be the last one.” And so, to some extent and some degree, we’ve been here before: a sense of crisis, of crumbling order, of facing destructive forces that may prove beyond our control. We survived the 1930s not least because Roosevelt did not fail, and thus was of course not the last president. Among the weapons he deployed in his wars to save capitalism in the 1930s and democracy itself in the first years of the ’40s, one might seem trivial, but isn’t: the radio. It can be difficult, in our own media-saturated age, to recall the revolutionary nature of radio and later of television. As Richard Hofstadter, the Columbia historian, wrote, the “growth of the mass media of communication and their use in politics have brought politics closer to the people than ever before and have made politics a form of entertainment in which the spectators feel themselves involved.” He added, “Mass communications have aroused the mass man.” In the beginning of each great electronic media transformation — radio and television, and now social media — there have been anxieties that mass communication would enable demagogy and trivialize governance. In the first two cases, chiefly because of Roosevelt and his educational use of the Fireside Chats, and John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan with their TV performances, that concern proved to be overblown. Today’s case is still an open question: Twitter could, in the right and calm hands, be a tool for presidential good. Of course, people worry that in the hands of President Trump, it is instead a tool for division and social erosion. To choose just a few recent examples, Mr. Trump has threatened the independence of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, routinely dismissed a duly constituted investigation as a “witch hunt,” suggested that the former F.B.I. Director James Comey be jailed and dishonestly delved into details about his payoff to buy the silence of a pornography film actress with whom he allegedly had a sexual encounter. So we’re not exactly in Rushmore territory here. "

Starts streaming: May 1
Add it to your Watchlist Before he slapped on the latex jowls for his Oscar-winning performance as Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour,” Gary Oldman did superior work in heavy makeup as Count Dracula in this spectacularly ornate exercise in gothic horror from Francis Ford Coppola. The ensemble cast is notoriously shaky — Keanu Reeves takes most of the heat as his surfer-toned Jonathan Harker, but Anthony Hopkins’s bellicose Van Helsing is equally off — but Oldman embodies the feverish romantic spirit that animates the film, which frames vampire mythology as a love that crosses “oceans of time.” It is also a feast for the eyes, with beautiful in-camera effects by the cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and Oscar-winning costumes by Eiko Ishioka.

After only one date, they agree to spend 24 straight hours together, having sex every hour. Though only a touch over 90 minutes, “Duck Butter” starts to feel as exhausting as the day becomes for them, but Shawkat, who wrote the script with Arteta, is determined to squeeze honest, uncomfortable insights out of a situation that brings out the best and worst from both women involved.
— ‘Erin Brockovich’

Add it to your Watchlist After spending much of the ’90s in the wilderness, trying with mixed success to capitalize on his game-changing debut feature, “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” Steven Soderbergh reinvented himself as a Hollywood craftsman — first with “Out of Sight” in 1998, then with “Traffic” and “Erin Brockovich” in 2000. “Erin Brockovich” is pure movie-of-the-week docudrama material, based on the true story of a single mother (Julia Roberts) who becomes a legal assistant and helps make the case against a California power company that is polluting the groundwater. In Soderbergh’s hands, however, the film is transformed into a deft, brassy vehicle for its star, more like a modern-day “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” than inspirational fluff.

Add it to your Watchlist One of two Nicole Holofcener comedy-dramas released to Netflix this month, “Friends With Money” exemplifies the virtues of Holofcener’s work, which resists catchy plot hooks in favor of carefully wrought female characters who coalesce, none-too-tidily, around down-to-earth situations. As in “The Good Girl,” Jennifer Aniston departs from her glamorous public image to play a cash-poor character, this time a former teacher who’s taken work as a housemaid in order to pay the bills. Her humble lifestyle introduces an awkward tension into her circle of well-to-do friends (Catherine Keener, Joan Cusack and Frances McDormand), but their lives are not as put-together as they seem.

In one crazily inspired moment, they dig up the remains of John Quincy Adams in a desperate effort to smoke up all the intelligence they can extract from his bones.

"WASHINGTON — Democrats learned the hard way in 2016 that the right is much more animated by judicial fights after Republicans’ refusal to consider the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland helped rally conservative voters behind Donald J. Trump so he could fill a vacancy held open for nearly a year. Now a new group is emerging on the left in an aggressive effort to counter that imbalance. Demand Justice, a nonprofit being formed by veterans of Capitol Hill, the White House and the Clinton and Obama campaigns, hopes to become a permanent fixture motivating progressive voters on issues related to the federal judiciary while influencing the Senate on judicial nominees. The organization, which expects to raise $10 million in its first year, is not planning to devote its energy to changing the views of Republicans. It instead wants to instill the same kind of zeal in progressives when it comes to the courts, to make the argument that in the current political environment, it is the federal courts that are the final authority on issues important to progressives such as immigration, abortion, gay rights, social policy, the environment and corporate power, to name a few. The group will be led by Brian Fallon, the former spokesman for Hillary Clinton who had previously worked at the Justice Department and on Capitol Hill for Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. He said he is giving up a role as a television analyst to concentrate on the new push. The organization’s founding comes at a time when Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in the Senate are intently focused on remaking the federal courts. Mr. Fallon and others behind the new group acknowledge that conservatives have been much more effective at turning the courts into a rallying point for their voters. In the case of Mr. Garland, not only were Democrats unable to capitalize politically on the Republican blockade, but the decision by Senate Republican leaders to ignore the nomination was ultimately seen as bolstering Mr. Trump and Republican candidates for the Senate among conservatives who consider the Supreme Court a top voting priority. In an interview, Mr. Fallon said the goal of Demand Justice “will be to try to do opinion research and experiment digitally to figure out how we can sustain a conversation and change minds and sensitize rank-and-file progressives to think of the courts as a venue for their activism and a way to advance the progressive agenda.” "
"There is no friendlier territory on television for Trump supporters than Sean Hannity’s nightly hour on Fox News, where President Trump is forever the victim of a witch hunt and the liberal media is perennially bent on his destruction. That safe-space bubble popped — in dramatic, headline-making fashion — on Wednesday night, when Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and current member of Mr. Trump’s legal team, casually confirmed to the startled host that the president had personally repaid his lawyer the money he had laid out to make his problem with a pornographic actress go away. “Oh,” Mr. Hannity replied, his usual bombast briefly escaping him. “I didn’t know — he did?” It was an off-message moment from the ultimate on-message show — and just the latest in a string of agita-inducing moments for Mr. Trump that have played out, improbably, on his favorite television network. Mr. Giuliani’s admission stunned Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, many of whom — including the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders — learned about Mr. Trump’s payment while watching “Hannity.” Even so, the candor may have been by design: Mr. Giuliani said the president’s involvement showed that the payment had not violated campaign finance laws. It was harder to locate the strategy behind Mr. Trump’s swerving, stream-of-consciousness telephone interview last week on “Fox & Friends.” On live TV, the president seemed to stumble into acknowledging, for the first time, that he knew about his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, funneling $130,000 in hush money to an adult film actress who had claimed to have had an affair with the future president.

"It’s easy to argue that the American left is on the cusp of a great victory. The economic anxieties of the working class have gone unaddressed. The Resistance is passionate and politically engaged. Faith in capitalism is plummeting. Only 42 percent of millennials embrace capitalism, according to a Harvard University poll, while 51 percent reject it. The Republicans seem to be turning themselves into an aging minority party. Moderate Democrats are no longer a force. There are only two vibrant political tendencies in America right now: Trumpian populism and Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren-style progressivism. As Trumpism loses, progressivism will win. What can we say about the coming progressive regime? First, it will be a decisive break from the moderate liberalism of Bill Clinton and even Barack Obama. Second, despite some silly recent talk, it will not be Marxist. A few of the distinctive features of Marxism are: 1. The belief that the problems of the modern economy are inherent to the capitalist system. 2. Capitalism will eventually collapse. 3. There is an alternative system. [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] My sense is these ideas have been rejected by most on the left.

"WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani has been President Trump’s lawyer for only a few days, and already he is causing political explosions. In one of his first interviews since joining Mr. Trump’s legal team, Mr. Giuliani appeared to briefly stun Sean Hannity of Fox News on Wednesday night by asserting that the president had reimbursed his personal lawyer for a $130,000 hush payment to a pornographic film actress — contradicting his client, the president. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] “I want to clarify something,” Mr. Hannity said, offering a do-over to Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, failed presidential candidate and longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s. Instead of taking a mulligan, Mr. Giuliani repeated the assertion. It was another high-profile, slightly off-kilter moment for Mr. Giuliani, who has lived a life full of them. A veteran of the no-holds-barred world of New York tabloids that Mr. Trump also inhabited for decades, Mr. Giuliani was an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. He was also a forceful critic of Hillary Clinton, a longtime political rival and Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race. "
"BEIJING — As North Korea holds summit meetings with its archenemies — first South Korea, and soon the United States — China is hustling not to lose influence. Its foreign minister, Wang Yi, returned Thursday to Beijing after two days in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, where he met with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, shoring up China’s position as the North’s best friend. China holds substantial economic leverage, but in the heightened strategic competition between it and the United States, it worries that Mr. Kim is using that rivalry to reduce dependence on China, his country’s longtime benefactor. One of Mr. Wang’s jobs was to try to stop Mr. Kim from veering toward the United States under President Trump, some Chinese experts said. “Beijing likely would want to ensure that Pyongyang would not develop a closer relationship with Washington than Beijing,” said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. “The visit by the Chinese foreign minister, the first in 11 years, appears to be part of that effort.” Beijing has suspected that Washington might agree to put aside its nuclear disagreements with North Korea and accept the North’s nuclear capabilities if it served to contain China, he said.

"Officially, it’s the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit, a black-tie extravaganza held the first Monday in May to raise money for the Costume Institute (a.k.a. the fashion department). Unofficially, the night’s festivities have been called many things, including “the party of the year,” “the Oscars of the East Coast” (mostly because of the star quotient and the elaborate red carpet, where guests pose on the grand entrance stairs to the museum) and, somewhat pointedly, “an A.T.M. for the Met,” the last by the publicist Paul Wilmot. The party signals the opening of the Costume Institute’s annual blockbuster show, and it is known for its celebrity and fashion hosts.

"WASHINGTON — For years, the American military has sought to distance itself from a brutal civil war in Yemen, where Saudi-led forces are battling rebels who pose no direct threat to the United States. But late last year, a team of about a dozen Green Berets arrived on Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen, in a continuing escalation of America’s secret wars. With virtually no public discussion or debate, the Army commandos are helping locate and destroy caches of ballistic missiles and launch sites that Houthi rebels in Yemen are using to attack Riyadh and other Saudi cities. Details of the Green Beret operation, which has not been previously disclosed, were provided to The New York Times by United States officials and European diplomats. They appear to contradict Pentagon statements that American military assistance to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen is limited to aircraft refueling, logistics and general intelligence sharing. There is no indication that the American commandos have crossed into Yemen as part of the secretive mission. "
