"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Big news from the Supreme Court. In the morning, justices dealt a heavy blow to labor unions, saying that nonmembers are not required to pay agency fees. Public-sector unions, including those for teachers, could lose major funding and see membership drop, but our analysis is that labor will not necessarily become weaker. In the afternoon, Justice Anthony Kennedy, above, made even bigger headlines by announcing his retirement. A Reagan appointee, he was the court’s leading champion of gay rights and often a crossover vote. Our Supreme Court correspondent called the news a “judicial earthquake.” _____ 2. The readout from Tuesday’s primaries and runoffs in seven states: upsets for the Democratic establishment and shows of loyalty for Republicans. "
"WASHINGTON — The House resoundingly rejected a far-reaching immigration overhaul on Wednesday, despite a last-minute plea from President Trump, as internal divisions in the Republican ranks continued to hobble legislative efforts to protect the young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. The 121-to-301 vote was an embarrassment both to Mr. Trump and to House Republican leaders, who had spent weeks trying to bring together conservatives and Republicans with moderate views on immigration — and ended up with little to show for the effort. In the end, nearly as many Republicans voted against the bill, 112, as for it, 121. The defeat provided the latest display of the Republican Party’s disunity in Congress on immigration. And it highlighted the continuing inability of both the House and the Senate to resolve the fate of the Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children. Many of those undocumented immigrants have been shielded from deportation under an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which Mr. Trump moved last year to end. Republicans in the House are now likely to turn their focus to narrower legislation that would seek to keep migrant families together at the border, an issue that senators are also looking to address. But with the Fourth of July approaching and lawmakers close to returning home for a recess, it was not clear how quickly a narrower measure might move forward. The House is scheduled to finish its work for the week on Thursday and not return until July 10. A Republican aide said the chamber would not take action on the family separation issue until after the recess. The frustrations over immigration in Congress are matched by the confusion in the Trump administration. A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction on Tuesday stopping the administration from separating children from their parents at the border and ordering that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days.

"China and Russia, apparently seeking to exploit an American wish to lower spending at the United Nations, want to cut more than 200 jobs related to human rights and the prevention of sexual abuse in the organization’s peacekeeping missions, according to diplomats and budget-negotiation documents. Human rights advocates said such cuts, if accepted, would severely hurt United Nations peacekeeping operations covering some of the world’s most vulnerable countries. Roughly 450 jobs are devoted to the protection of human rights and the deterrence of sexual abuse in the peacekeeping system, diplomats said. The push by China and Russia comes at a time when the Trump administration is distancing itself in some ways from the United Nations — although the United States is still the host country and remains by far the biggest financial contributor. At the same time, China in particular is exerting more influence at the organization as its economic importance and contributions increase. China and Russia have long complained about the human rights work of the United Nations, especially in its peacekeeping missions, which they see as falling outside the scope of what the blue-helmeted soldiers of troop-contributing countries should be doing.

"BEIJING — When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with President Xi Jinping of China on Wednesday, he hoped to start a conversation on China’s position in the South China Sea. He left knowing just how firm Mr. Xi is on the issue. “We cannot lose even one inch of the territory left behind by our ancestors,” Mr. Xi told him, according to Chinese state media. “What is other people’s, we do not want at all.” Disagreements between Washington and Beijing over the Chinese military’s expanding presence in the South China Sea and the American policy toward Taiwan were two of the most prominent issues raised during meetings between Mr. Mattis and senior officials in Beijing, the first stop on a trip that will take him to South Korea and Japan. Mr. Mattis, who has assailed the Chinese military for its expansion in the South China Sea, made clear the Pentagon’s stance on contested waters, stressing the need for freedom of navigation in the region and China’s adherence to international law, according to defense officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. During a meeting with his counterpart, Gen. Wei Fenghe, Mr. Mattis reminded the general of Mr. Xi’s remarks during a 2015 White House visit when Mr. Xi said he had “no intention to militarize” islands in the South China Sea, according to the officials. At a conference in Singapore this month, Mr. Mattis accused China of “intimidation and coercion” for placing surface-to-air missiles and other military equipment on islands in the South China Sea, many of which are also claimed by Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.

"WASHINGTON — The stunning defeat on Tuesday of Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat and a potential future speaker, threw the future of the septuagenarian-led caucus into chaos, opening the door to a new generation of leadership and a push leftward. As shock in the capital over Mr. Crowley’s New York primary loss to a 28-year-old first-time candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, gave way to calculation, House Democrats began floating challengers to Representative Nancy Pelosi, their leader. The current leadership slate reacted defensively to the threat of a purge, while a handful of other lawmakers braced for their own primary challenges from the left. Ms. Pelosi dismissed questions about the growing appetite in her ranks for new leaders, and the demand from the party base for more liberal representatives. “Well, I’m female, I’m progressive — what’s your problem?” she said. “Two out of three ain’t bad.” But rank-and-file House Democrats made clear in dozens of interviews that whether the party takes back the majority or not in November, there would be a push to depose Ms. Pelosi, the 78-year-old former speaker. “There will be an insurgency; I just don’t know who’s leading it,” said Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri. “But I can assure you that I am as certain of that as I am that today is Wednesday.” The question of who would lead an insurgency offered Ms. Pelosi some reassurance, but it also raised the threat of the unknown. For over a year, she has known that Mr. Crowley or Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, her 79-year-old second in command and longtime rival, would be her most obvious challengers. Both are white men with roots in the more centrist wing of the party. "
"Mark Mazzetti, an investigative reporter and editor in The New York Times’s Washington bureau, was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize earlier this year for reporting on Donald Trump’s advisers and their connections to Russia. Mr. Mazzetti recently reflected on his work at the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference in Orlando, Fla. This is an edited excerpt from his presentation.  We spent the last year investigating the president, and that was not really something we specifically set out to do. After the election, we had a group that was formed to look at how Trump was going to change government — Washington. We already knew it was going to be this unusual, unorthodox administration, so we built a team that was designed to look at a broad canvas and sort of spend some time on stories and go in the directions we wanted. Then Russia happened. All of a sudden, our focus changed, our group changed slightly, and we realized pretty quickly that this story was consequential, highly competitive, and it would probably be an investigation unlike we had done before. A lot of times, you go into an investigation and you know the broad contours of what you’re looking at — where you think you want to look. Not that you know the conclusions, but you know roughly the places to go. In this Trump-Russia-Mueller investigation, there was really no map or a sense of where things might end up, or even if there was anything at the bottom of the story. That was sort of in our heads, and still is in our heads, about how to be careful about what we write, to never go too far or assume too much. We came into this environment where the president said that everything we wrote, not just The New York Times but our competitors, was fake news and that we made up everything from whole cloth. So it was this frustrating and maddening — but at times exhilarating — and a hugely satisfying story; and we learned some things along the way. The last year was actually my first year as an actual editor — I was an editor and a reporter — but I learned a lot of things the hard way of being an editor. These were some of the things that I learned. If You Hit A Dry Hole, Stop Drilling "
      
      
  
     
   
        
   
       
      
"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher Justice Anthony Kennedy, often considered the Supreme Court’s ideological center, announced that he would retire this summer. His departure could fundamentally change the direction of the court. On today’s episode: • Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for The New York Times. • Sheryl Gay Stolberg, a congressional correspondent for The Times. Background reading: • The retirement of Justice Kennedy, who served as the crucial swing vote for much of his 30-year tenure on the Supreme Court, affords President Trump the opportunity to solidify the court’s conservative majority. • Here’s a look at some of the landmark cases — on gay rights, abortion, the death penalty, gun control and corporate campaign spending, among other issues — in which Justice Kennedy played a decisive role. • The political showdown has already begun: Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, promised to hold a vote on a nominee by the fall. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said that doing so “would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.” Tune in, and tell us what you think. Email us at thedaily@nytimes.com.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • For 30 years, Justice Anthony Kennedy has occupied a spot in the middle of the court’s ideological spectrum, often providing the deciding vote in closely divided cases. While he lent support to liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty, he sided with conservatives on voter access, gun control measures and campaign spending by corporations. The 81-year-old justice announced his retirement on Wednesday. Here’s our lead article about the news, and an assessment of Justice Kennedy’s influence by our Supreme Court reporter. We also looked at how the justice has voted over three decades. He doesn’t like being called the court’s swing vote: “The cases swing,” he said in 2015. “I don’t.” • Separately on Wednesday, the court dealt a major blow to organized labor, ruling that government workers who choose not to join unions may not be required to help pay for collective bargaining.

"In 30 years on the Supreme Court — the past 13 as the swing justice — Justice Anthony Kennedy has been the decisive vote in cases on issues ranging from abortion to affirmative action. Yet his legacy will be defined primarily by his opinions in the area of gay rights, where he wrote the major majority opinions expansively reading the Constitution to protect gay Americans. Even though these cases have prompted some to call Justice Kennedy the “first gay justice,” his legacy remains unsettled and uncertain. His gay-rights decisions will now face a hostile majority on the court, which is likely to overturn, cut back or nullify at least some of them. And he has made it surprisingly easy. When Justice Kennedy joined the court in 1988, it was no friend to gays and lesbians. Two years earlier, the court had upheld a Georgia law making it a crime to engage in intimate conduct with a person of the same sex. It dismissed the argument that the Constitution protected gay intimacy as “facetious at best.” Gay and lesbian citizens found a champion in Justice Kennedy. In 1996, he led the court in overturning a Colorado law barring cities from protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination. Justice Kennedy wrote that laws targeting gay people based in “animus” were unconstitutional. In 2003, he wrote for the court in Lawrence v. Texas, invalidating a law criminalizing same-sex sodomy and overturning the dismissive 1986 decision. Justice Kennedy also wrote the court’s two most important decisions on same-sex marriage. The court in 2013 struck down a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act denying federal benefits to gay couples married under state law; Mr. Kennedy wrote that same-sex marriages were “worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages.” In Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision declaring a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Justice Kennedy said these relationships were “central to individual dignity and autonomy.” The 5-4 decision made marriage equality the law of the land, but beyond that Justice Kennedy’s opinions were important for giving legitimacy to the love and relationships of people long shamed for those very feelings of intimacy.

"WASHINGTON — For months, their sparring had been indirect, stern letters exchanged, pointed threats traded through the news media. But on Thursday, the ever-intensifying skirmishes between Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and conservative House Republicans broke into an ugly public fight. On the House floor, Republicans voted in lock step to give the Justice Department seven days to produce sensitive documents related to the Russia inquiry and the F.B.I.’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email use. Though nonbinding, the measure was intended to put Mr. Rosenstein on notice that House lawmakers were willing to take punitive action — potentially including impeachment — if their demands were not met. In the House Judiciary Committee, conservative Republicans hauled Mr. Rosenstein and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, before television cameras to accuse them of hiding information from Congress to protect their own interests. In Mr. Rosenstein’s case, some Republicans charged outright misconduct related to the investigation into Russian election interference. The two leaders, both appointed by President Trump, defended the special counsel investigation and their response to congressional investigators, even as they said they had been deeply troubled by the findings of a Justice Department inspector general’s report released this month on the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton email case. “There are mechanisms to resolve this without threatening to hold people in contempt,” Mr. Rosenstein said, urging lawmakers to work with him rather than threaten him. “We are not in contempt of this Congress. We are not going to be.” Democrats accused Republicans of concocting a political distraction to further bloody the reputation of the Justice Department as it investigates President Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Judiciary Committee Democrat, called the floor vote “clearly a pretext for a move against Mr. Rosenstein that the majority already has planned.” "

"The Federal Reserve on Thursday gave clean bills of health to most of the largest American banks, allowing them to return money to shareholders, but it forced Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to freeze such payouts around last year’s levels. The Fed said that all of the nation’s very biggest banks — Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase — passed the second round of the central bank’s “stress tests,” which gauge whether financial institutions have enough capital and are sufficiently well-managed to continue lending during periods of financial upheaval. The tests were intended to gauge the health of 35 banks, and regulators said they would allow 34 of them to pay dividends and buy back their own shares, a boon for investors who have been eager to benefit from the banks’ record profits. The banks will almost certainly use their collective success to amplify their argument that, 10 years after the financial crisis, they do not need to be as tightly regulated, and that they deserve relief similar to what their much smaller peers received earlier this year when President Trump signed a bill easing parts of the Dodd-Frank law, the landmark bank oversight legislation enacted in 2010. The six largest American banks got permission to pay out a combined sum of more than $125 billions in the form of increased dividends, which reward investors for every share of stock they own, and share buybacks, which increase the value of a company’s stock by reducing the number of shares outstanding. The only bank to fail the stress test was the American arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bank, which Fed officials sharply criticized for “widespread and critical deficiencies” in how it handles its capital and manages its finances. The Fed’s grievances mean Deutsche Bank will be restricted from transferring money from the United States to its Frankfurt headquarters, potentially making its Wall Street operations less lucrative at a time when the bank’s top executives are already mulling cuts to that business.

"WASHINGTON — The retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy from the Supreme Court could significantly reshape environmental law in the decades ahead and potentially make it easier for the Trump administration to roll back Obama-era climate change policies in the coming years, legal experts said. In his 30 years on the court, Justice Kennedy was frequently a crucial swing vote on major environmental questions. While he tended to be skeptical of expansive federal regulations that intruded on private property rights, he was also willing to break with the court’s conservative wing in favor of more aggressive government action to limit air and water pollution. Perhaps most notably, in 2007, he sided with the court’s four liberal justices in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency to rule that the E.P.A. had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. That case laid the groundwork for many of the Obama administration’s major climate policies, including the Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants. “One can comfortably say that he was the single most influential justice for environmental law over the past 30 years,” said Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Harvard. “Many of those cases were sharply divided, but the one constant was that Kennedy was in the majority in every single case but one. He was the justice that advocates always tried to persuade, because he was persuadable.” President Trump is widely expected to nominate a more conservative justice to fill the vacancy. If that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, he or she would give the court a five-seat conservative majority that is likely to take a dimmer view of federal environmental regulation. It is far from certain that a new court would quickly overturn Massachusetts v. E.P.A. and take away the government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases altogether, legal experts said. The court has already upheld that ruling twice in subsequent cases, and, during oral arguments in 2014, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. indicated that he considered the case an established precedent. "
