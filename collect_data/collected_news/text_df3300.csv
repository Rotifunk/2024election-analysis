"Providing new evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Facebook disclosed on Wednesday that it had identified more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on hot-button issues purchased by a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin. Most of the 3,000 ads did not refer to particular candidates but instead focused on divisive social issues such as race, gay rights, gun control and immigration, according to a post on Facebook by Alex Stamos, the company’s chief security officer. The ads, which ran between June 2015 and May 2017, were linked to some 470 fake accounts and pages the company said it had shut down. Facebook officials said the fake accounts were created by a Russian company called the Internet Research Agency, which is known for using “troll” accounts to post on social media and comment on news websites. The disclosure adds to the evidence of the broad scope of the Russian influence campaign, which American intelligence agencies concluded was designed to damage Hillary Clinton and boost Donald J. Trump during the election. Multiple investigations of the Russian meddling, and the possibility that the Trump campaign somehow colluded with Russia, have cast a shadow over the first eight months of Mr. Trump’s presidency. Facebook staff members on Wednesday briefed the Senate and House intelligence committees, which are investigating the Russian intervention in the American election. Mr. Stamos indicated that Facebook is also cooperating with investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, writing that “we have shared our findings with U.S. authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary.” Mr. Stamos wrote that while some of the ads specifically mentioned the two candidates, most focused instead on issues that were polarizing the electorate: “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.” "
"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, just days after saying President Trump should hold off on scrapping an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, reversed course on Wednesday and said the president made “the right call” by ending the program. Last week, as Mr. Trump weighed whether to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Mr. Ryan said, “I actually don’t think he should do that.” He added that Congress, not the president, should be making such policies. “This is something that Congress has to fix,” the speaker said. On Wednesday, he again said Congress needs to step in, but this time, he did not second-guess the president. Mr. Trump, he said, “was right in his decision” to give Congress the time to find a compromise that could protect the 800,000 young adults brought to the United States illegally as children who qualify for the program, also known as DACA. “He gave us time to work out a consensus, to find a compromise,” Mr. Ryan said. “Where does that compromise exist? That’s what we’re going to spend the next months figuring out, where that compromise is.” After Mr. Trump decided to do away with the DACA program, the issue landed in Congress’s lap, and pressure is mounting. Democrats have pressed for a stand-alone Dream Act, first drafted in 2001, to offer legal status to young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. But Mr. Ryan indicated that any legislative deal for the so-called dreamers would have to include measures more palatable to conservatives. He hinted that a legislative effort to help DACA recipients would need to be linked to efforts to increase border security. “I think there’s a serious humane issue here that needs to be dealt with, but it’s only fitting and reasonable that we also deal with some of the root causes of this problem,” he said, “because what we don’t want to have happen is another DACA problem 10 years from now.” The Senate Judiciary Committee made plans on Wednesday to hold a hearing on DACA next week, though committee aides cautioned that the timing was subject to change. Meanwhile, Democrats urged Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to immediately consider the Dream Act. “We all agree that President Trump’s decision to end DACA is a despicable act of political cowardice,” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, said at a news conference with others from her party. Nearby, Karen Caudillo, a junior at the University of Central Florida who owns an organic cleaning business, wept. Ms. Caudillo, 21, immigrated from Mexico with her family when she was 4. “I’m in tears because I have been fighting for so long to be able to sustain myself and go to school and to be productive,” she said. “And, it just feels like everything is going to waste because I could go back to Mexico.” "
"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, is set to meet with Senate Judiciary Committee investigators behind closed doors on Thursday to answer questions about his June 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, committee officials said. Committee aides said the interview, Mr. Trump’s first with congressional investigators, will be transcribed and could last for much of the day. It will largely focus on the meeting in Trump Tower, which appears to have been set up to deliver harmful information about Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign, according to emails disclosed in June. Democrats, led by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had also agreed to testify at a public hearing before the committee and that he would probably be subpoenaed if he did not follow through on that agreement. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the panel’s chairman, declined to discuss the committee’s dealings with Mr. Trump. Lawyers for Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment. The closed-door interview is the clearest indication yet that the Senate Judiciary Committee — after months of being eclipsed by the Senate and House intelligence committees — is emerging into a higher-profile role in investigating the president, his family and his associates in the coming months. The committee is trying to get answers about the firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director this spring and has staked out a broad investigation that aims to look at everything from the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia to the Obama Justice Department’s handling of the Clinton email case last year. The Judiciary Committee investigation, which began this summer, has received less public attention than the intelligence committees’, which have been looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election since early this year. But with the committees now jockeying for witnesses and documents, and the potential for public hearings this fall, that is likely to change. "

"The terms of the debate over President Trump’s decision to revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are familiar, as are the terms of the larger conversation about immigration in this country: On one side are hardworking immigrants; on the other are politicians who wrongly claim that these immigrants harm the economic interests of native-born Americans. As protests broke out across the United States in response to Mr. Trump’s move, reporters and immigrant advocates stressed that the administration’s actions will hurt achievers — people who have graduated from college, people who have bought houses, people who work for high-tech companies. There is nothing wrong with this story. It’s one that most, if not all, immigrants like to tell about themselves — even if their actual story doesn’t neatly fit the narrative. In fact, as Hannah Arendt pointed out in her essay “We Refugees,” written in 1943 at the height of the 20th century’s refugee crisis, people whose stories fit the narrative least well — the most desperate and the worst-wounded of the immigrants — are especially invested in thinking of themselves as destined for success and, of course, as future loyal citizens. But something goes awry when this becomes the dominant story told about immigrants in America. This has been happening for a number of years: The good people of America talk about immigrants as hard workers who conscientiously contribute to the economy. (I myself have made it onto a few lists of exemplary immigrant success stories.) In fact, DACA was designed to reward achievement: to qualify for the program, an applicant had to be in school or hold a high school diploma or equivalent, or have been honorably discharged from the armed forces. Those who hadn’t been able or lucky to meet those requirements were apparently deemed unworthy of staying in the country where they had lived since they were children. When Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning entry by citizens of predominantly Muslim countries, American technology companies responded with a lawsuit in which they stressed that immigrants have founded and run many large tech companies. The revocation of DACA has brought forth similar — and much-quoted — responses from Silicon Valley. When the president threw his support behind a reform plan that would drastically reduce immigration to this country, editorial writers argued against it by pointing out that immigrants benefit the economy. These arguments usually begin by stating that America is a “land of immigrants.” This not only is an insult to Native Americans and the descendants of those who were brought to this country against their will but also constitutes a sort of sleight of hand. It turns the stories of individual immigrants into the “story of America.” It’s one thing for individuals to base their sense of self-worth on their contribution to the American economy. It’s quite another to claim that America values immigrants because of this contribution: This paves the way to thinking that America should make decisions about immigrants based on whether they benefit the economy. It can even reframe giving safe haven to the persecuted as giving jobs to the well qualified. "
"Early this year, The Times brought together a group of national correspondents to write in-depth stories about regions and people who might have received short shrift in the run-up to last November’s election. One thing we would not pursue was endless post-mortems on the election itself. President Trump might not even be mentioned in these articles, conceived under the in-house rubric “Fault Lines.” “What we desperately want is for our stories to shed light, to tell our readers things about America they do not already understand, with fairness, clear eyes and empathy in abundance,” David Halbfinger, who was the deputy national editor, wrote to us in an email. The articles, mostly deep dives after many weeks of reporting, have begun rolling out. Their subjects include a look at the religious left, the collision of two worlds in an act of vandalism at an Arkansas mosque, an immigrant’s choice to “self-deport” from Iowa and a dispatch of mine from an Illinois truck stop about long-haul drivers. My latest contribution, an account of an auto parts factory in Michigan, strays a bit from the mission. It probably won’t satisfy many people still looking to understand Trump Country. "
"When news leaked on Monday that President Trump had decided to dismantle Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — the 2012 policy that granted administrative relief to some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors — some commentators tried to find a ray of hope in the dismal forecast. Trump, they noted, would give Congress six months to save the DACA-protected “Dreamers” from deportation with a legislative fix. Never mind that House Republicans sabotaged a chance to help Dreamers in 2013, when John Boehner, the House speaker, refused to hold a vote on an immigration-reform bill that had passed in the Senate to a vote on the House floor. Now, NPR reported, Republicans might favor a bill introduced by Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida that would give Dreamers a path to citizenship. “Overwhelmingly, Republicans tell me: ‘Yes, I could support giving these young immigrants permanent status in our country,’ ” Curbelo told “All Things Considered,” “ ‘as long as we continue moving towards better border security, the enforcement of our immigration laws.’ ” Yet among the undocumented activists whom I got to know while reporting in Arizona earlier this year, such a compromise is hardly viewed with relief. Rather it is the Catch-22 that they have been dreading ever since Trump was elected. In emergency meetings and conference calls following Trump’s victory last November, immigrant rights activists prepared for the coming changes in federal immigration policy. Even then, they worried about what to do if Congress linked the extension of DACA’s protections with a broader enforcement crackdown. As I detailed in May, Dreamers were once viewed skeptically by other undocumented activists, who believed that campaigns designed to help Dreamers could undermine efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reforms. These rifts were largely resolved when Dreamers rallied behind efforts to help their parents after President Obama issued the executive order on DACA. By the time Senators Bernie Sanders and Dick Durbin held a private round table with immigrant rights leaders in December 2016, the general sentiment within the movement had become: divided, we fall. Erika Andiola, the first president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, argued that Democrats should filibuster any legislation that targeted undocumented immigrants, even if it helped Dreamers. Greisa Martinez, the advocacy director for United We Dream, who also attended the meeting in Sanders’s office, told me: “It’s not a choice between do you protect the Dreamers or do you protect the broader community.” She continued: “We believe that our responsibility is to be able to do both things at once. One does not come at the cost of the other.” That idealistic unity may have begun to fracture 11 days ago, when leaks began suggesting that Trump might terminate DACA, a scenario that provoked terror among DACA recipients. In their DACA applications, they were required to provide the federal government with detailed information about themselves and their parents — names, addresses — in order to gain work permits, driver’s licenses and other benefits of deferred action. “Can you imagine? The government made a promise to us: come forward, come out of the shadows and we’re going to promise you that you’re not going to be in deportation proceedings,” Reyna Montoya, a Dreamer in Phoenix, told me. “But they deferred our deportation, and now we’re there in the line.” Worried that Trump might kill the program in a late-night tweet, Montoya took to setting her alarm clock for 5 a.m., so she could start each morning by checking whether her DACA protections had been destroyed. In many cases, the stress of such uncertainty was felt not only by Dreamers but also by their families. Their fears extended beyond the nightmarish possibility of being tracked down through the information volunteered in DACA applications. Though the general public often imagines DACA recipients as college students, many of them are in fact parents or full-time employees whose relatives depend on their legal income for survival. And many undocumented family members have placed assets like cars or homes under a DACA recipient’s name, or relied on a DACA child’s Social Security number to take out loans. Even Andiola, a well-placed DACA recipient who is now the political director of Our Revolution, could lose the ability to make mortgage payments on the house that she bought for her mother, Maria Guadalupe Arreola. Arreola told me that she knows many families in the same predicament. Regardless of whether immigration agents deport the Dreamers, with DACA gone, she said, their families “will be ruined.” "
"To the Editor: Re “U.S. Ends Program Giving ‘Dreamers’ Legal Protection” (front page, Sept. 6): We Americans have come together in support of our fellow Americans in Texas as they walk the long path of recovery from the catastrophic flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey. Now we need to come together in support of the 800,000 young people who are at risk from Tuesday’s catastrophic and cowardly actions of the president and the attorney general. The young people who have been protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program are just as American as my native-born children. For those who came here at a young age, this is the only country they have known. They want the same things my young adult children want: security and opportunity. Some of them have been courageously assisting with relief and recovery efforts in Houston. They deserve our respect, not the callousness and dishonesty on display Tuesday in our nation’s capital. We Americans — and especially our religious and congressional leaders — need to stand up to the administration by advocating for and enacting veto-proof legal protections for the children of immigrants. (REV.) DOUGLAS L. CLARK
GUILFORD, CONN. To the Editor: President Trump’s decision to remove protections against deportation for Dreamers is economically foolish, morally troubling and politically shortsighted. Studies show that the 800,000 young immigrants granted work and study permits under DACA contribute strongly to economic growth. We should be crafting a fair route for them to seek citizenship, not making their lives harder and more uncertain. In 1994, California passed Proposition 187, a ballot initiative (later overturned in the courts) that denied many social services to illegal immigrants. Despite its initial popularity, a backlash against the law, especially among Hispanic voters, played a big part in consigning the state Republican Party to long-term electoral irrelevance and helped brand it as anti-minority and anti-immigrant. Likewise, Republican members of Congress should think twice before rubber-stamping a presidential decision that is bound to cast them in a similar unfavorable light. LEIF WELLINGTON HAASE
KENSINGTON, CALIF. To the Editor: As President Trump moves to overturn DACA, let’s pause for a moment and fathom its implications for the lives of millions of young people for whom America is the only home they have ever known. Brought to the United States as infants or children, they grew up like so many other kids, going to high school proms, donning silly outfits for Halloween, marking the Fourth of July with barbecues and fireworks, rooting for their favorite sports teams. They became Americans in every possible way. "
"When the Trump administration announced on Tuesday that it would end an Obama-era program that shielded young undocumented immigrants from deportation, Sherwin Sheik quickly sized up the potential toll on his business. Mr. Sheik is the chief executive and founder of CareLinx, which matches home care workers with patients and their families. The company relies heavily on authorized immigrant labor, making the looming demise of the program — which has transformed around 700,000 people brought to this country as children into authorized workers — a decidedly unwelcome development. The move, Mr. Sheik said, would compound an already “disastrous situation in terms of shortages of supply.” He added, “This is a big issue we’re focusing on.” Recalling the revolt among business executives that followed President Trump’s refusal to single out white supremacists for causing violence last month in Charlottesville, Va., leaders of companies in the finance, manufacturing and technology industries, including Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase, have been quick to oppose the decision to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Those executives may have empathy for the beneficiaries of the program, known as Dreamers, as well as a broader interest in more liberal immigration policies to satisfy their labor needs. But the practical effect on their businesses will typically be minimal. The number of workers who benefit from the program is tiny alongside a national labor force of more than 150 million, and the DACA workers are spread out relatively evenly across most industries. In health care, on the other hand, the economic impact could be significant, depriving patients of help they depend on and driving up costs for families and taxpayers. "

"To the Editor: Re “Who Decides Whether Trump Is Unfit?,” by Peter D. Kramer and Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, Aug. 29): The growing discussion about the 25th Amendment, which provides a mechanism for presidential removal and succession, is timely and important. As it stands, the amendment contains a fatal flaw. Absent Congress’s decision to establish a body to declare the president unfit for office, the 25th Amendment requires a majority of the cabinet to act against the president. Yet if the president is erratic or irrational (rather than medically incapacitated), a president could simply fire his or her own cabinet. Congress must delegate this heavy responsibility to living former presidents and vice presidents. No one is better qualified. This group of people held the office, or were in direct line of succession, and know firsthand the pressures of the presidency, and skills required. Additionally, they no longer have political ambitions of their own and would be above the political fray. Not only that, they are trusted and respected by the American public. Regardless of what happens with Donald Trump, the United States needs a reliable mechanism in place to protect the presidency, and our democracy. Congress should pass my Strengthening and Clarifying the 25th Amendment Act. EARL BLUMENAUER

"WASHINGTON — President Trump has selected a dozen charitable organizations, including the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, to support with personal donations to help with Hurricane Harvey relief, White House officials said on Wednesday. Mr. Trump, one of the wealthiest men ever to hold the presidency, announced last week that he would give a total of $1 million from his own pocket. The White House named the recipients on Wednesday as part of an effort to encourage Americans to chip in with contributions, just hours after the House approved nearly $8 billion for hurricane relief and reconstruction. “The president and first lady witnessed the work of some of these groups firsthand while visiting with hurricane survivors, first responders, volunteers, and federal, state and local officials, and are proud to further assist the recovery efforts in Texas,” Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Air Force One. Mr. Trump’s history of charitable contributions has come under fire. The Washington Post won a Pulitzer Prize this year for articles reporting that many of Mr. Trump’s claims of donations over the years were exaggerated or not genuinely charitable. Sensitive to the criticism, Mr. Trump has been donating his $400,000-a-year presidential salary to charitable or governmental organizations, and aides said he chose the recipients of his hurricane donations in part from recommendations by White House reporters. The White House repeatedly asked reporters for such recommendations. The Red Cross and Salvation Army will each receive $300,000, according to the White House. Reach Out America and Samaritan’s Purse will each receive $100,000. Eight other organizations will receive $25,000 each: the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Habitat for Humanity, the Houston Humane Society, Operation Blessing International, Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon. Mr. Trump’s reported donations came as another hurricane was bearing down on Florida. He has not said whether he will repeat the gesture for organizations providing relief for the new hurricane, Irma. "
"WASHINGTON — It is the scenario that President Trump’s most conservative followers considered their worst nightmare, and on Wednesday it seemed to come true: The dealmaking political novice, whose ideology and loyalty were always fungible, cut a deal with Democrats. If Mr. Trump’s agreement with the two Democratic leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, to increase the debt limit and finance the government for three months did not yet represent the breaking point between the president and his core, hard-right base of support, it certainly put him closer than he has ever been to tipping his fragile political coalition into open revolt. Stunned and irate, conservative leaders denounced news that Mr. Trump had agreed to rely on Democratic votes to win congressional approval for a temporary extension of the debt ceiling and funding of the government until mid-December. “These are the moments that can derail President Trump’s presidency,” said David Bozell, the president of For America and a Trump supporter, who added that the president’s base would be watching the next few months very carefully. “He is not Teflon,” Mr. Bozell added. “Trump spent some of his own political capital today.” Adam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, offered a searing judgment of the president: “Talk about burning bridges with the grass-roots.” “Meet the Swamp,” read the headline on the Breitbart News site. Beneath it was a picture of Mr. Trump meeting at the White House with Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Schumer and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. "
"WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate health committee said Wednesday that he hoped the panel would reach a consensus by the end of next week on a small, bipartisan bill to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent prices from skyrocketing next year under the Affordable Care Act. “The blame will be on every one of us, and deservedly so,” if senators fail to reach agreement, said the chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. Mr. Alexander laid out elements of a possible compromise at a hearing on Wednesday: Republicans would agree to continued payment of subsidies to insurance companies to compensate them for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. Democrats would agree to give states freedom to relax some insurance requirements in the Affordable Care Act. “To get a result,” Mr. Alexander said, “Democrats will have to agree to something — more flexibility for states — that some may be reluctant to support. And Republicans will have to agree to something, additional funding through the Affordable Care Act, that some may be reluctant to support. That is called a compromise.” The senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, said: “Threading this needle won’t be easy. But I do believe an agreement that protects patients and families from higher costs and uncertainty, and maintains the guardrails in our current health care system, is possible.” The seven-year Republican push to repeal the Affordable Care Act appeared to reach a dead end this summer when multiple versions of repeal legislation failed to gain even a simple majority in the Senate. Lawmakers in both parties said Congress would have to get back to a more orderly approach to making health care policy, and Wednesday’s hearing was a start. "
"MANDAN, N.D. — President Trump on Wednesday used the backdrop of an oil refinery here to repeat his call for an overhaul of the nation’s tax code, including a steep cut in the business tax rate. Speaking to a small but friendly crowd in a state that he won by 36 points in November, Mr. Trump urged North Dakotans to pressure members of Congress to support a plan that he promised to detail within weeks. “My administration is working with Congress to develop a plan,” Mr. Trump said, promising a one-page tax form, a “major, major” middle-class tax cut and a top rate for businesses that he hopes will be as low as 15 percent, down from 35 percent. The president said the current rates on businesses were the highest in the developed world and were putting American companies at a significant disadvantage as they tried to compete with businesses in other countries. “We want our companies to hire and grow in America,” Mr. Trump said. “That is how we will all succeed and grow together.” Pitching his plan as something that should have bipartisan appeal, Mr. Trump noted that President Ronald Reagan won passage of a major tax plan with a Congress led by Democrats. “Are you listening, Heidi?” Mr. Trump joked, motioning toward Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the state’s Democratic senator, who joined the president on Air Force One for the flight to her state. “Yes, Heidi is listening.” “Thank you, Heidi,” he added. “We’re not going to put her on the spot.” Ms. Heitkamp, who faces a difficult re-election campaign next year in the heavily Republican state, has been coy about whether she will support Mr. Trump’s tax plan. But the president made clear on Wednesday that he wants to persuade her. He also made clear that he intends to make his tax proposals a key part of his legacy. “We are not surrendering anymore,” Mr. Trump said. "
"WASHINGTON — Officials at Washington National Cathedral will remove two stained-glass windows that pay tribute to the Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, a decision reached after two years of discussion and made more urgent by the recent racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, Va. Church leaders voted Tuesday night in an “overwhelming majority” to remove the windows and announced the decision on Wednesday in a letter, concluding that the windows “tell an incomplete and misleading account of our history.” The two 4-by-6-foot windows were donated in 1953 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and a private donor, but were not noticed by current church leaders until 2015. “We were joining a conversation that was very much alive,” said Mariann Edgar Budde, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who learned about the windows after the mass shooting in 2015 by a white supremacist at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C. “It was no longer abstract. It was right there in our cathedral.” Scaffolding went up Wednesday at the cathedral, the site of state funerals and memorial services for several presidents and the second largest church building in the country, after the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. Removal of the windows will begin Thursday; they will be cleaned, conserved, stored and potentially moved to another part of the church to be used in an educational setting unaffiliated with worship. “As difficult as it is to remove something that was dedicated in a sacred space, we felt it was a Christian imperative and our moral responsibility,” Bishop Budde said. “They are not the objects we wish to have in a sacred worship space.” The decision comes as cities across the country have removed plaques and statues commemorating the Confederacy, and others are weighing whether to follow suit. While opponents say the monuments should be removed because they celebrate a shameful racial legacy, President Trump has said he sees a slippery slope toward erasing other contentious aspects of the nation’s history. Still, some descendants of the Confederate generals themselves have applauded the efforts to remove or rename monuments and landmarks. "
"NEWARK — Senator Robert Menendez spent seven years enjoying a “life of luxury he could not afford” in return for acting as a personal senator to a wealthy ophthalmologist in Florida, federal prosecutors told jurors here on Wednesday during the opening chapter of a case whose outcome could reverberate far beyond New Jersey. But a defense lawyer argued that those actions were rooted in a friendship — “that one word, friendship, that the evidence will show is the true nature of that relationship. And acting out of friendship is not improper, it is not corrupt, it is not illegal.” As both the prosecution and the defense presented their opening statements in the federal corruption case against Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, and Dr. Salomon Melgen, the ophthalmologist, they offered little in the way of new evidence or facts. Instead, they debated questions that will be central to the case: What constitutes a permissible friendship with a politician? What represents an official act by a senator? And whom does a senator work for and represent? The case has attracted wide interest because it is the first time in decades that a sitting United States Senator faces a federal bribery trial and the verdict could have broad political implications at a time of deep polarization in Washington. “This case isn’t really about what happened, it’s about why it happened,” Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Menendez, said. Mr. Lowell said Dr. Melgen and Mr. Menendez had been friends for many years and the doctor had given Mr. Menendez gifts well before he entered the Senate. A lawyer for Dr. Melgen, Kirk Ogrosky, made a similar argument. “I’m here to tell you that every single thing my client shared with his friend and every single political contribution he gave was out of friendship done out of sincere belief that Senator Menendez was good for this country,” he said. "
"President Trump’s immigration policies faced a renewed legal onslaught on Wednesday, as a coalition of Democratic attorneys general, nonprofit groups and private companies announced they would oppose his rollback of Obama-era protections for people who entered the country illegally as children. In an echo of the campaign against Mr. Trump’s effort this year to ban travelers from parts of the Muslim world, a group of 16 attorneys general — all Democrats — filed suit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, claiming that Mr. Trump had improperly upended the policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. Led by Attorneys General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Bob Ferguson of Washington, they alleged Mr. Trump’s shift was driven by racial animus toward Mexican Americans and that the Trump administration failed to follow federal rules governing executive policy making. On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration would phase out DACA beginning next March. The decision came as a group of Republican attorneys general threatened to sue the administration if it did not end the program. Announcing the legal challenge Wednesday alongside a crowd of young immigrants and immigration advocates, Mr. Schneiderman accused the Trump administration of using the threat of lawsuits as a “pretext” that hid the president’s true motives: bias against immigrants and Latinos. Mr. Schneiderman’s lawsuit said that “ending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination of President Trump’s oft-stated commitments — whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof — to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.” "
"A reporter in West Virginia who was arrested four months ago after he aggressively questioned Tom Price, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, will not be prosecuted, officials announced Wednesday. The May 9 arrest of the reporter, Dan Heyman, had stoked concerns about possible efforts to stymie the free press. In a joint statement released by the Kanawha County prosecutor’s office and Mr. Heyman’s legal team said that the State had determined “after a careful review” that Mr. Heyman had not acted unlawfully. He had been charged with a misdemeanor count of willful disruption of governmental processes. Mr. Heyman, a reporter for the Public News Service, has maintained that he was simply asking questions of a federal official as that official walked through the West Virginia State Capitol. In another statement released Wednesday, Mr. Heyman said he was “very relieved” by the state’s decision. “Facing six months of jail time for asking a question as a journalist was pretty troubling,” he said. “We all need to keep asking the tough questions of elected officials,” he continued. “The intense response to my arrest gives me confidence that people will defend the free press, because they believe in it.” "
"Puerto Ricans have ample experience with hurricanes, but the storm approaching on Wednesday brought an added level of anxiety. The island’s dire financial straits have left essential public works, from power plants to retaining walls, weakened by years of scrimping on maintenance. “This is not an event that is occurring in the Netherlands, where they’re ready for it and they have a strong economy,” said Miguel A. Soto-Class, president of the Center for a New Economy, a research group on the island. “This is an event happening on a very poor island that’s been in a depression for the last 10 years.” Puerto Rico effectively sought bankruptcy protection in May, burdened with about $123 billion in bond debt and unfunded pension obligations. Its case is being handled in federal court under a special new law, called Promesa, because the existing bankruptcy law excludes Puerto Rico. Under Promesa, Puerto Rico’s finances must be supervised by a federal board until its house is back in order, a process that is expected to take years. Relations between the board and the elected government of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló were contentious even before Hurricane Irma, with the governor first agreeing to a five-year austerity plan, then reversing course and threatening to go to prison rather than accepting the entire package. In particular, the governor has refused to furlough government workers, and to reduce the pensions of retired government employees by an average 10 percent. The fiscal oversight board has sued the governor, asking the court to order him to carry out the entire austerity plan. The furloughs were supposed to have begun on Sept. 1. Despite the legal dispute, the board’s executive director, Natalie Jaresko, said in a statement Wednesday that the board was “working closely with Governor Rosselló to coordinate support for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storm.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump insisted that he and President Xi Jinping had a “very strong phone call” on Wednesday. But if Mr. Trump kept alive the rapport he has painstakingly cultivated with the Chinese leader, the 45-minute call still served to underscore the widening fissures between Washington and Beijing and the deepening confusion about how the Trump administration is managing the relationship. The National Security Council is conducting a review of the White House’s China policy — taking into account Mr. Trump’s populist trade agenda and differences over how to curb the rogue government in North Korea — but it has commanded little attention. Aside from Mr. Trump himself, it remains unclear who in the administration wields genuine influence on the relationship. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who helped broker the first meeting between the two presidents last April, was once expected to function as a high-level conduit. But his involvement in China has waned; he did not accept an invitation from the Chinese to go to Beijing this month for a visit that some expected would be in preparation for Mr. Trump’s state visit in November. Other officials who have staked a claim to China, such as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, have run afoul of Mr. Trump, either on specific policies or broader issues. And Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, is not playing the coordinating role on China that several of his predecessors did. That lack of a guiding hand has contributed to the administration’s dissonant signals toward Beijing. Two months ago, Mr. Ross tried to negotiate a deal with China on steel exports, only to be publicly rebuffed by Mr. Trump. On Sunday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, threatened to cut off trade with any country that does business with North Korea — an unsubtle, and impractical, warning to its main trading partner, China. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council that would effectively empower the United States Navy and Air Force to interdict North Korean ships at sea, inspect them to determine whether they are carrying weapons material or fuel into the country, and use “all necessary measures” to enforce compliance. The language is included in a remarkably broad draft that would ban the shipment of all crude oil, refined petroleum and natural gas to North Korea, essentially seeking to plunge a country of 25 million people into a deep freeze this winter if its leaders fail to begin giving up their nuclear weapon and missile programs. The resolution — circulated three days after the North conducted its largest nuclear test to date — would also seek to block all the assets of Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, and virtually all the assets of the country’s military and its sole political party. The resolution, which the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said this week she wanted to bring to a vote by next Monday, seems certain to meet vociferous objections from China and Russia. Both hold veto power at the Security Council. But if the sections authorizing interdictions at sea survive, it could set the stage for some of the tensest encounters on the high seas since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when President John F. Kennedy ordered a complete blockade around the island to prevent Soviet missiles from being installed. The resolution calls for something far less comprehensive than a total blockade, which is widely considered an act of war. But it would authorize a committee of the Security Council to “designate vessels for nonconsensual inspections” and authorize all members of the United Nations — using military vessels and aircraft — “to inspect on the high seas any vessel designated by the committee.” "
"Federal prosecutors in New York announced on Wednesday the filing of a new indictment that charges a former Turkish economy minister and three other Turks with participating in a broad conspiracy to violate the United States’ sanctions against Iran. The new charges represent a significant expansion of a case that had already drawn the attention of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, senior members of the Trump administration and President Trump’s informal adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani has been retained by one defendant, Reza Zarrab, to try to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to his case. Mr. Giuliani has met with Mr. Erdogan to discuss the case; in the past, Mr. Erdogan claimed there were “malicious” intentions behind Mr. Zarrab’s prosecution. Prosecutors have charged that Mr. Zarrab, a gold trader and dual citizen of Iran and Turkey, and his co-defendants conspired to facilitate millions of dollars in transactions on behalf of Iran and other sanctioned entities through the use of front companies and false documentation. The most prominent new defendant charged was Mehmet Zafer Caglayan, 59, who served as the Turkish economy minister from 2011 until 2013 and currently serves in the Turkish Parliament, the indictment said. While Mr. Caglayan was a minister, the indictment charged, he “received tens of millions of dollars’ worth of bribes in cash and jewelry from the proceeds of the scheme to provide services” to the Iranian government and concealed those services from United States regulators. The new indictment also said that high-ranking government officials in Iran and Turkey “participated in and protected this scheme,” with some officials taking bribes. In addition, the indictment said, the leaders of a bank that is majority-owned by the Turkish government “participated in the design of fraudulent transactions intended to deceive U.S. regulators and foreign banks.” Other court filings show it is Halkbank. The new indictment comes at a time of testy relations between Turkey and the United States, which are both members of NATO. Last week, Mr. Erdogan denounced another federal indictment — against three of his bodyguards over a brawl in Washington during his visit in May. Twelve other Turkish security officers were charged in that case in June. Mr. Erdogan has also repeatedly called on the American authorities to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. He is the leader of a Turkish Muslim sect accused by Mr. Erdogan of having helped orchestrate an attempted coup that roiled Turkey in July 2016. Mr. Gulen, a longtime critic of Mr. Erdogan’s, has denied any connection to the coup attempt and vowed to fight extradition. In addition to Mr. Caglayan, the new indictment charged Suleyman Aslan, a former general manager of the bank; Levent Balkan, another former bank executive; and Abdullah Happani, an associate of Mr. Zarrab’s. The four defendants charged on Wednesday are not in United States custody, prosecutors said. Mr. Zarrab has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, had no comment. "
"This week, the Senate will do something it hasn’t done in seven years: hold bipartisan hearings on the future of the Affordable Care Act. Serious and creative ideas will be presented. But don’t expect big policy changes anytime soon. Experts and lobbyists close to the congressional process say that, despite consensus that Obamacare’s markets are too thin and too expensive, very few reforms have any chance of becoming law before insurers begin selling Obamacare plans for next year. Instead, the most likely action — if there is any — will simply be to patch cracks in the market caused by President Trump and prevent him from doing more damage. Congressional leaders are looking at a fix that would bring certainty to payments the federal government makes to subsidize plans for low-income Americans. Those payments, which are called cost-sharing reductions and go to the insurers, are outlined in the Affordable Care Act, but the law left it unclear whether the money could be distributed without a clear spending bill from Congress. So far, the payments have been made every month. But President Trump has repeatedly threatened to stop them. Many health insurers have said their worries about the payments have led them to exit Obamacare markets or charge substantially higher insurance prices next year. Legislation that assures the subsidies for a year or two could tie the president’s hands and reduce the uncertainty for nervous insurers. But even though some Republican congressional leaders have embraced the idea, it’s not clear whether enough Republicans will end up voting yes. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s nominee to lead the Justice Department’s civil rights division defended his work on both sides of discrimination cases on Wednesday during his confirmation hearing, seeking to ease the concerns of civil rights advocates who have denounced his nomination. Mr. Trump’s choice, Eric S. Dreiband, a partner at the Jones Day law firm and a former George W. Bush administration official, vowed to enforce the law as vigorously as he defended major corporations. “In private practice, lawyers are ethically bound to zealously advocate for their clients,” said Mr. Dreiband. “I think it prepares you well to serve in public service.” Mr. Dreiband has defended major corporations in discrimination cases related to age, pregnancy and religion. He also represented the University of North Carolina last year in litigation against the Justice Department over transgender bathroom access, and in one of the most high-profile instances, he argued before the Supreme Court in 2015 that Abercrombie & Fitch had been justified in refusing to hire a Muslim woman because she wore a head scarf that clashed with its dress code. Civil rights activists have condemned Mr. Dreiband’s nomination to lead the division, which handles voting rights, policing and discrimination cases. As America’s top civil rights lawyer, he would inherit a number of politically charged investigations, including the Justice Department’s joint inquiry into last month’s deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., at a counterprotest of white nationalists. Mr. Dreiband pledged to uphold the division’s mission. “Anyone who perpetrates crimes or any other civil rights violations that come within the jurisdiction of the civil rights division should know — they should be on notice, if I’m confirmed — that the civil rights division is coming for them,” Mr. Dreiband told the Senate Judiciary Committee, deploring “the bigotry and ideology” of white supremacy.

"To the Editor: Re “White Supremacist Groups Don’t Deserve Tax Exemptions” (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Aug. 29): David J. Herzig and Samuel D. Brunson argue that the I.R.S. should revoke the tax-exempt status of our organizations, New Century Foundation and VDARE Foundation, because we are “white supremacist groups.” Anyone who has actually read our websites will laugh at this. The sole quotation that the writers use to support the claim of white supremacism — from New Century Foundation’s statement of purpose — is “We also believe the European-American majority has legitimate group interests now being ignored.” Would this statement be “supremacist” if it were about Hispanics or blacks? The VDARE Foundation focuses on immigration and has long supported policies very close to those on which President Trump ran — and won. Do the authors think Mr. Trump and his 63 million voters are white supremacists? The writers cite the Supreme Court’s 1983 decision revoking tax exemption for Bob Jones University as precedent. However, Bob Jones was engaging in conduct that the court found to be racially discriminatory. We are not engaging in any such conduct. We are exercising the right of free speech. The I.R.S. lacks authority to withdraw a tax exemption simply because Mr. Herzig and Mr. Brunson disagree with us. JARED TAYLOR PETER BRIMELOW OAKTON, VA. Mr. Taylor is president of the New Century Foundation, and Mr. Brimelow is president of the VDARE Foundation. "
"“BoJack Horseman,” Netfiix’s animated series about a Hollywood has-been who happens to be a talking horse, has had a storybook existence. Released in 2014 to shrugs, it caught on after its second season, becoming a fiercely loved critic’s favorite and a fixture on top-10 lists. By the logic of the show’s world, in which success is fleeting and disaster is one ill-advised pitch meeting away, Season 4 (available to stream on Friday) represents a dangerous moment. Can it keep its momentum? Can it maintain its tricky balance, as a lovingly acidic showbiz satire that’s also a moving meditation on, and deconstruction of, the showbiz satire genre? To paraphrase Sarah Lynn, the debauched child star who appeared alongside BoJack in the ’80s sitcom “Horsin’ Around”: that’s too much to expect, man. The 12 episodes of the new season have episodes and moments equal to the show’s best. They also have ideas that don’t pan out, and an overall lack of cohesion — the main characters seem sequestered in separate story lines that don’t really mesh. A weekend binge is still recommended, but it won’t have the impact of the second or third seasons. For the uninitiated, “BoJack Horseman” is set in Hollywoo — so called since the D in the Hollywood sign was destroyed in Season 1 — and in a world where animals and humans coexist without comment. Ineffably silly animal jokes remain one of the show’s chief pleasures. In the opening episode, the sassy bovine waitress at the Silver Spoon Diner announces, “This cow likes getting tipped.” "
"WASHINGTON — Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday that he would resign in mid-October, an unexpected decision that gives President Trump greater leverage over central bank policy. Mr. Fischer, 73, cited “personal reasons” in a brief letter addressed to Mr. Trump. His four-year term was to have ended next June. The resignation puts immediate pressure on the Trump administration to replenish the Fed’s depleted board. Mr. Fischer’s departure would leave only three people in the seven board seats, the smallest number of governors in the Fed’s history. It also means that Mr. Trump can appoint a majority of the Fed’s board, bending the direction of its policy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants the Fed to loosen some of the regulatory strictures it has imposed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Among the decisions the president will have to make is whether to replace Janet L. Yellen as chairwoman or keep her on when her four-year term ends in early February. He faces a choice between a nominee who, like Ms. Yellen, stresses economic growth, or someone more palatable to conservatives who favor greater emphasis on curbing inflation. Mr. Fischer joined the Fed’s board in May 2014 after a distinguished career as an academic economist and an international policy maker. He sometimes argued that the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly, sparring with Ms. Yellen. But he provided reliable support for measures strengthening financial regulation. "
"You star in ‘‘Difficult People’’ and ‘‘American Horror Story’’ this season, but I know you from ‘‘Billy on the Street,’’ your interview game show. I’m always nervous interviewing people who are interviewers. How has it changed you? It has made me much more sympathetic to all those Greenpeace people. I will always take your flier, because I know what it’s like. What makes a good interview for you? I might have jokes in my head, but the best interactions come when I listen to the person’s response. I let go of whatever my plan might have been, and I meet this person where they are, and I let them lead me wherever they want to go, to a certain extent. It always bothers me when I watch interviews — even serious ones on a news program — and there are no follow-up questions, and the journalist sticks to their plan, and they don’t let the conversation guide them. The ‘‘on the street’’ character comes from your real passion for pop culture and celebrity culture — but the show mocks your character for having that passion. You’re the butt of the joke. For the most part, the comedy of ‘‘Billy on the Street’’ comes from the fact that he never evolves. He’s funny because he sticks to his guns about what’s important, and what’s important is whether Cate Blanchett was snubbed this year. It’s me satirizing my disproportionate passion for the entertainment industry. I’ve had a subscription to Entertainment Weekly since I was 7 years old, and I would read it cover to cover. My parents would take me to Broadway shows and indie movies and foreign films and big studio movies, and I absorbed everything. But as I got older, I realized: This is ridiculous. I still love it all, but I use up a lot of space in my brain to think about these things. Now that you’ve seen the business up close, are you still as obsessed? I really still am a fan. I stayed up an hour too late last night because I got sucked down a Wikipedia hole because I couldn’t remember how many V.M.A.s Madonna has and what she won for. And I started to think: Wait a second, how many Grammys does she have? Was she even nominated for a Grammy before she won for ‘‘Ray of Light’’? And this has nothing to do with my job. I’m not doing anything with Madonna. This is just me, this is how I spend my time and these are the things I’m interested in. I really am ride or die for Madonna. "
"The longtime owners of Starrett City, the sprawling Brooklyn housing complex overlooking Jamaica Bay, are selling the development for more than $850 million, and among those who stand to benefit is President Trump, a partial owner. Starrett City is the largest federally subsidized housing development in the country, and the sale will require the approval of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and state housing officials, raising potential conflicts of interest for Mr. Trump and his family. Mr. Trump owns a 4 percent stake in the complex, according to his federal financial disclosure forms; other members of the Trump family also own stakes in the partnership. The buyer is a joint venture of the Brooksville Company, a recently formed residential real estate firm, and Rockpoint Group, a private equity firm that invests in real estate. The pending deal, which is expected to close early next year, was announced to tenants, employees and elected officials on Wednesday. Representatives Hakeem Jeffries, whose district includes Starrett City, and Elijah E. Cummings, a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, highlighted the potential conflict of interest in July when rumors circulated in New York that Starrett City would be refinanced. “The president is on both sides of the negotiation — he oversees the government entity providing taxpayer funds and he pockets some of that money himself,” they wrote in a July 7 letter to the Donald J. Trump Trust, which holds the president’s business interests, and Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Trump’s share of the proceeds — after the partners pay off their mortgage, transfer taxes and other transaction costs — could be about $14 million, according to real estate executives familiar with the details who spoke anonymously because they have no authority to disclose them.

"In moments of national fragility, history rears its head. The past becomes a vast storehouse of grievance. Revived memory is manipulated to produce violent nationalism. This is what is happening today in the United States, a nation suddenly at war with its past. There is a reason for this war. America has been adept at evasion. A nation conceived as exceptional, a beacon to the world, could not but run from its original sin. How often I have wondered at all the museums and memorials to the Holocaust, the great crime against European Jewry that did not happen here, of which the United States was neither perpetrator nor victim. By comparison, the great American crime of slavery, the laceration and lynching of black bodies, was scarcely memorialized. Today there is a movement in people’s minds. If the 20th century saw decolonization and the fall of empires, the 21st century is seeing the internal corollary of that process: a relentless challenge in Western societies to the white mind-set, white assumptions, white amnesia. How, after all, could those Confederate statues stand for so long and so prominently in so many American cities when they memorialized men who took up arms for slavery and in opposition to the Union? It is hard and painful to refute your ancestry, disentangle individual honor from a lost and morally indefensible cause like that of the Confederacy, knit together a nation after a Civil War and 750,000 dead. Evasions accumulate. The South nursed its wounds, rewrote the story, adjusted the cause. Slavery died; Jim Crow began. The long struggle endured for black Americans to be heard, to be seen, to be equal before the law, to be not three-fifths of a human being but human beings in full. Yet, the issue behind the obfuscations was clear enough, enunciated by Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, who put his “great truth” in unequivocal terms: “That the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition.” Or, as Mississippi declared in seceding, “Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery — the greatest material interest of the world.” This is the cause for which Gen. Robert E. Lee fought; and it was of course the proposed removal of his statue in Charlottesville that precipitated the violence last month between leftists and the white supremacists who wanted Lee kept in place and were willing, in one instance, to kill for him. "
"WASHINGTON — On a sweltering day earlier this summer, operatives with the Central Intelligence Agency gathered at Arlington National Cemetery to bury two of their own. Brian Ray Hoke and Nathaniel Patrick Delemarre, elite gunslingers who worked for the C.I.A.’s paramilitary force, were laid to rest after a firefight with Islamic State militants near Jalalabad in Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan. There had been scant mention of Mr. Hoke’s death in local news reports in Leesburg, Va., his home, and nothing at all about Mr. Delemarre in news accounts in the Florida Panhandle, where his family lives. Their deaths this past October were never acknowledged by the C.I.A., beyond two memorial stars chiseled in a marble wall at the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va. Today there are at least 18 stars on that wall representing the number of C.I.A. personnel killed in Afghanistan — a tally that has not been previously reported, and one that rivals the number of C.I.A. operatives killed in the wars in Vietnam and Laos nearly a half century ago. The deaths are a reflection of the heavy price the agency has paid in a secret, nearly 16-year-old war, where thousands of C.I.A. operatives have served since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The deaths of Mr. Hoke, 42, and Mr. Delemarre, 47, show how the C.I.A. continues to move from traditional espionage to the front lines, and underscore the pressure the agency faces now that President Trump has pledged to keep the United States in Afghanistan with no end in sight. “We are going to be fighting this war for a very long time,” said Ken Stiles, a former C.I.A. counterterrorism analyst who worked closely with paramilitary officers in Afghanistan and who lost three friends in the war. Mr. Hoke grew up in South Dakota, played violin and football in high school, graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a degree in oceanography and in 1997 passed the grueling test to become a member of the Navy SEALs. He was deployed to the Middle East and Europe, and in 2004 joined the C.I.A. "
"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan will participate on Thursday in a TimesTalks conversation with The New York Times, moderated by Jonathan Weisman, the Times’s congressional editor. When and where: 8:40 a.m. Eastern at the Newseum in Washington. How to watch: The conversation will be streamed live to The Times’s home page, YouTube page and Facebook page. How to participate: A portion of the conversation will be devoted to questions from the audience, including the audience on Facebook. Follow along and put your questions in the comment section, and they may be put to Mr. Ryan. Until then, here is a primer on what’s coming on Capitol Hill and what’s sure to be discussed with Mr. Ryan: After eight months political infighting and little legislative action, Congress returns to Washington from the August recess facing a crushing September. This month could determine whether Republicans deliver on any of their big promises before next year’s midterm elections. There is no time to spare: Government funding could run out at the end of September. The debt ceiling could be breached within weeks. And there is that promised rewrite of the tax code. The ability of Republican leaders to handle these tasks may determine how long the party stays in power. President Trump’s approval ratings have been sliding, and whispers have been growing louder as to whether the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, or Mr. Ryan will need to step aside if the tax overhaul collapses, like the repeal of the Affordable Care Act did. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump struck a deal with Democratic congressional leaders on Wednesday to increase the debt limit and finance the government until mid-December, blindsiding his own Republican allies as he reached across the aisle to resolve a major dispute for the first time since taking office. The agreement would avert a fiscal showdown later this month without the bloody, partisan battle that many had anticipated by combining a debt ceiling increase and stopgap spending measure with relief aid to Texas and other areas devastated by Hurricane Harvey. But without addressing the fundamental underlying issues, it set up the prospect for an even bigger clash at the end of the year. In embracing the three-month deal, Mr. Trump accepted a Democratic proposal that had been rejected earlier in the day by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Mr. Trump’s snap decision at a White House meeting caught Republican leaders off guard and reflected friction between the president and his party. After weeks of criticizing Republican leaders for failing to pass legislation, Mr. Trump signaled that he was willing to cross party lines to score some much-desired legislative victories. The deal to keep the government open and paying its debts until Dec. 15 represented an extraordinary public turn for the president, who has for much of his term set himself up on the right flank of the Republican Party. But it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump’s collaboration with Democrats foreshadowed a more sustained shift in strategy by a president who has presented himself as a master dealmaker or amounted to just a one-time instinctual reaction of a mercurial leader momentarily eager to poke his estranged allies. Mr. Trump not only accepted the spending-and-debt plan advanced by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, but also aligned himself with them on immigration. A day after rescinding President Barack Obama’s program protecting younger illegal immigrants on the grounds that it went beyond a president’s authority, Mr. Trump said he wanted to work with Democrats to legalize the program. "
"Silicon Valley has long preferred to remain aloof from national politics, but the Trump era has altered that stance. In recent months, tech luminaries have repeatedly clashed with the president, criticizing his executive order on Muslim immigration, his ban on transgender troops, his “many sides” equivocation on white supremacists and his Tuesday announcement that he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which lets young undocumented immigrants remain in the country. A politically awakened Silicon Valley, buttressed by the tech industry’s growing economic power, could potentially alter politics long after President Trump has left the scene. But if the tech industry becomes a political force, what sort of policies will it push? A new survey by political scientists at Stanford University suggests a mostly straightforward answer — with one glaring twist. The study is the first comprehensive look at the political attitudes of wealthy technologists, whose views have long been misunderstood to the point of caricature by many outside the industry. The findings of the study, which is currently under peer review, were presented last week to the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association. The survey suggests a novel but paradoxical vision of the future of American politics: Technologists could help push lawmakers, especially Democrats, further to the left on many social and economic issues. But they may also undermine the influence of some of the Democrats’ most stalwart supporters, including labor unions. And they may strive to push Democrats away from regulation on business — including the growing calls for greater rules around the tech industry. Over all, the study showed that tech entrepreneurs are very liberal — among some of the most left-leaning Democrats you can find. They are overwhelmingly in favor of economic policies that redistribute wealth, including higher taxes on rich people and lots of social services for the poor, including universal health care. Their outlook is cosmopolitan and globalist — they support free trade and more open immigration, and they score low on measures of “racial resentment.” "
"At the age of 7, Ayad Akhtar, the son of two doctors in suburban Milwaukee, was seized by a religious fervor. He began asking his parents to take him to the one mosque in the area, a converted schoolhouse on the city’s Polish south side that they only occasionally attended. He taught himself to pray, and he saw the Prophet Muhammad in his dreams. One year, on the day in the calendar when some Muslims say all of creation bowed in respect to Muhammad, he stayed up all night, looking out his bedroom window and waiting to see the trees bend. “I don’t know why, but I was a very sensitive kid. I had an acute awareness of splendor,” Mr. Akhtar told me in one of the conversations we had over the summer. “The only thing that really responded to that register of life for me was the Quran — and ‘Star Wars.’” His devotion to Islam deepened until he reached high school and encountered a teacher who introduced him to the European Modernists: Kafka, Camus and others. Mr. Akhtar, who is now 46, went off to Brown, got a graduate degree in film at Columbia and then spent a big chunk of his early adulthood, six years, writing a novel in the style of his literary heroes. The book was 600-plus pages — and unpublishable. One friend considered it “unbearable.” For Mr. Akhtar, the response was both crushing and liberating: “I just thought, this is tiring, and I’m not even good at it.” What followed was an astounding creative explosion, both in its volume and quality. Over the course of four years, he produced a well-reviewed novel, “American Dervish,” a comic retelling of his own childhood, narrated by a boy from a secular Muslim household who turns deeply religious. His play “Disgraced,” an emotionally raw drama focused on a culturally conflicted Pakistani-American lawyer, was awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for drama. Mr. Akhtar’s subject has been the tension between the sacred and the secular — how to honor one’s culture, including its ancient religion, without being imprisoned by it. In October, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, he returns to Broadway for the first time since “Disgraced,” and his new play, “Junk,” marks yet another creative turn. The setting is Wall Street in the 1980s and the battle between an entitled old-money establishment and a new wave of aggressive corporate raiders. Like his other work, “Junk” is intensely interested in the issue of identity, but with a twist: There are no Muslim characters. This latest work is a progression rather than a departure for Mr. Akhtar. He once again mercilessly examines a faith and culture — in this case, money and Wall Street — and his characters are subject to the pull of a powerful orthodoxy. An idealistic journalist in the story sets out to “torpedo every piety of this new faux-religion of finance” but edges too close and is compromised and subsumed. The drama is not an overt comment on the current political moment, but it is a kind of parable. It implies we have all been co-opted, having traded our healthy suspicion of people with vast wealth for something more like worship. "

"Good morning on this wet Wednesday. The Trump administration announced yesterday it was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ordered by the Obama administration in 2012. In response, protesters around the city unleashed their tears, fears and chants at demonstrations from Trump Tower to Foley Square. Known as DACA, the program has offered temporary protection from deportation to nearly 800,000 people who were brought to the country illegally as children, allowing them to obtain work permits, be eligible for driver’s licenses and complete their schooling. It changed the lives of about 30,000 New Yorkers. Here’s a guide on what the decision means for DACA recipients going forward. Who will be affected right now? The cancellation is not immediate, but Mr. Trump called on Congress to replace the policy with legislation before it expires on March 5, 2018. Meanwhile, no new applications will be accepted. Current DACA holders have only until Oct. 5 to renew two-year permits set to expire on or before March 5. Does the Trump administration’s change mean Dreamers will be deported? Immigration officials said in their own Frequently Asked Questions document that immigrants who gave their personal information to the government to receive this legal status will not have the information “proactively provided” to immigration officials. There are exceptions, including cases deemed to be threats to public safety or national security. "

This time, it was President Trump’s order to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The initiative allows the children brought to the United States by undocumented parents, often called “Dreamers,” to remain in the country as adults. Trevor Noah pointed out that the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was the one to announce the decision at a news briefing. Seth Meyers wanted to know why more Republican politicians do not oppose Mr. Trump — especially now, as DACA is broadly popular. Jimmy Kimmel said that Mr. Trump seemed most interested in ending the program because his predecessor had enforced it. Mr. Trump suggested on Tuesday that Congress should figure out how to replace DACA. Mr. Kimmel indicated that he wasn’t feeling rosy about that prospect. "
"WASHINGTON — Breaking ranks with many of their fellow Republicans, a group of prominent politicians filed briefs on Tuesday urging the Supreme Court to rule that extreme political gerrymandering — the drawing of voting districts to give lopsided advantages to the party in power — violates the Constitution. The briefs were signed by Republicans including Senator John McCain of Arizona; Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio; Bob Dole, the former Republican Senate leader from Kansas and the party’s 1996 presidential nominee; the former senators John C. Danforth of Missouri, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming; and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a former governor of California. “Partisan gerrymandering has become a tool for powerful interests to distort the democratic process,” reads a brief filed by Mr. McCain and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, on Oct. 3. The Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican State Leadership Committee all filed briefs on the other side. They urged the Supreme Court to reject a challenge to State Assembly districts in Wisconsin that, by some measures, gave Republicans outsize political power unjustified by the overall vote. Charles Fried, a Harvard law professor who served as United States solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan, and who is among the lawyers representing Republican politicians urging the Supreme Court to reject extreme political gerrymanders, said it was important to take the long view and to act on principle. “It’s not a partisan issue,” he said. “We are working for our republic, and not for Republicans.” Partisan gerrymandering is almost as old as the nation, and both parties have used it. But in recent years, as Republicans captured state legislatures around the country, they have been the primary beneficiaries. Aided by sophisticated software, they have drawn oddly shaped voting districts to favor their party’s candidates. "
"Intel has won a point in its antitrust battle with the European Commission — and the American technology industry as a whole may be feeling a little victorious as well. The Court of Justice of the European Union ordered a lower court on Wednesday to re-examine the 1.6 billion euro, or nearly $1.3 billion, fine imposed on Intel in 2009 for abuse of its dominant position in the computer chip market. The decision is a setback for the European Union antitrust authorities who have been investigating American tech giants like Google and Qualcomm. Here’s what happened in the Intel case: • Intel had offered rebates to entice computer makers to buy all, or almost all, of their X86 central processing units from it. • The European Union’s General Court upheld the 2009 fine in 2014. • Last October, the bloc’s advocate general, Nils Wahl, recommended that the General Court return to the case. He found that the court had been mistaken in its consideration of the “exclusivity rebates” as an abuse of a dominant market position. The fate of the Intel case is far from determined. And the European Commission still has other big investigations open: • Inquiries into Google center on two areas — whether the internet giant used its market position in online search to prioritize its shopping service over that of rivals, and whether the company abused its dominant position by imposing restrictions on makers of Android devices.

"WASHINGTON — Republican congressional leaders perched on the couches in the Oval Office froze in mid-smile on Wednesday afternoon when they realized President Trump was bypassing them to cut a short-term spending and debt ceiling deal with Democrats, and not them. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, had expected the rare bipartisan, bicameral meeting to be little more than a photo-op in which the broad outlines of a deal were discussed, aides said. Instead, Mr. Trump — who has often outsourced the details of negotiations to subordinates like Vice President Mike Pence — interrupted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as he argued for an 18-month debt ceiling increase to stabilize financial markets. When other leaders offered yearlong or half-year extensions, the president waved them off, according to the accounts of staff members briefed on the meeting. The three-month deal Mr. Trump eventually embraced is a significant tactical change for a president thus far anxious to preserve, not expand, his political appeal. The plan was pitched by two Democratic leaders he has relentlessly demonized and marginalized: Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. The deal will give Democrats increased leverage in coming negotiations, several senior members of Mr. Trump’s team lamented after the meeting. In his nearly eight months as president, Mr. Trump has tacked almost exclusively to the right to solidify his conservative populist base, earning him the limited, but granite, support of 30 to 40 percent of the public. In the past 36 hours, he seems to have abruptly abandoned that strategy, driven by the immediate need to pass spending bills after Hurricane Harvey — and chastened by the bipartisan backlash against his decision on Tuesday to phase out a program that allowed unauthorized immigrants brought to the United States as minors to remain here.

"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The memory of the land mine that tore off the leg of Helena González’s nephew years ago is still fresh. Ms. González, 25, has spent much of her life fearing more attacks by Colombia’s Marxist rebels against her family. And last year, when given the chance to vote on a peace agreement to end a half-century of conflict, she joined the majority of Colombians in voting against the deal. “The pope may forgive them,” Ms. González said, coming out of church in the capital, Bogotá, this week. “But in my heart I don’t forgive them. I am still reconciling it all.” As Pope Francis arrived in Colombia on Wednesday for a six-day visit, the challenge before the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was clear: nudging the country, torn apart by 52 years of war, toward a peace with former guerrillas that remains controversial in the eyes of many of the war’s victims. “It’s dangerous ground for Pope Francis,” said Hosffman Ospino, a Colombian theologian at Boston College. “Half of the country disagrees with the peace process.” On the surface, much has gone well for the peace accords between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by their acronym, FARC. After failing in the referendum, the government reworked the deal and passed it through Congress, sidestepping voters. About 7,000 rebels left the jungle, gave up weapons and are returning to civilian life. "
"Before Ghada Tafesh left the Gaza Strip for college in the United States, her family gave her a necklace with two pendants. One was in the shape of historic Palestine. The other was an olive tree. “They wanted me to have something that would remind me of home, and to never be ashamed of where I come from,” she told me. Ms. Tafesh has much to be proud of as she begins the final year of her master’s program in humanities at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., this fall. But the trade-off was painful: getting her education meant not returning home for six years. In 2012, she faced one of the toughest decisions a Gazan teenager can make. With the help of a scholarship, she could attend college in the United States. It would afford her significantly more opportunity than she would ever have in her hometown. Gaza’s few universities provide only basic academic offerings, with very limited master’s and doctoral programs. Then there’s the city’s youth unemployment rate: 60 percent, by most estimates. But by opting to go abroad, Ms. Tafesh would be choosing a kind of exile, since returning at all would mean the risk of getting stuck back inside the blockade. “Receiving entrance and exit permits to and from the Strip is a lengthy and unpredictable process,” said Shai Grunberg of Gisha, an Israeli nonprofit that aims to protect freedom of movement of Palestinians. “There are no guarantees that if a student from Gaza receives an entrance permit to visit family in the Strip, they will manage to secure an exit permit in time to return to their studies.” Steven Keller, who directs scholarship and exchange programs in the West Bank and Gaza, agreed: “We advise students not to return to Gaza during school holidays, due to the personal risk of getting stuck and losing a scholarship.” Ms. Tafesh had already experienced life in the United States: She’d spent her junior year of high school as an exchange student, living with a host family in Laurel, Md. The sound of airplanes from the nearby international airport often woke her up at night and reminded her of Israeli warplanes that meant school was shutting down — “you could feel the walls and floor shaking,” she said, describing being in ninth grade while bombings went off nearby. But the opportunities in the United States amazed her. Until then, she’d been unaware of how limited life in Gaza was. “You accept your reality, until you see how other people live,” she told me recently. “I love to read poetry and novels,” counting Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf and Geoffrey Chaucer as among her favorites. “But there was no library at our school” in Gaza. There were no sports teams or science labs, either. “Our science books were full of experiments that we never got to do.” Eager for more, Ms. Tafesh contacted the Hope Fund, a program that secures scholarships from American colleges for talented Palestinian youth predominately from disadvantaged backgrounds. She applied to Wilson College and was accepted with a full scholarship. After she received her United States visa in July 2012, she was worried that she wouldn’t be able to get an Israeli exit permit to leave Gaza. "
"As Congress returns this week from its summer recess, Washington and its press corps are stirring from what has been a fitful August slumber. It will be a busy fall, just as it was in 1998, when I became the congressional correspondent for The Baltimore Sun as a new name entered the political conversation: Monica Lewinsky. Back then, the Capitol’s august press gallery above the Senate chamber was jam-packed with reporters. Every regional newspaper worth its salt had someone in the Capitol keeping an eye on its congressional delegation and the most pressing matters of the day. I sat crammed in next to a reporter from The San Francisco Examiner, another from New York Newsday, another from The Chicago Sun-Times and three from The New York Times. Then came the long eclipse: the decline of the mid-size, then major daily newspapers, and with them, the twilight of the congressional reporter. The Senate press gallery, with its century-old tile floors and chandeliers, is now a sadder place. Where I, a Baltimore Sun reporter, was once crammed into a carrel alongside such venerable Times reporters as Lizette Alvarez, Alison Mitchell and Eric Schmitt, there are file cabinets. I returned to the congressional press corps in 2012, this time as a reporter for The Times. The hallways of the Capitol were and still are packed with reporters, but most of them work for newsletters and pricey trade outlets catering to Washington lobbyists and insiders. The reporters writing for a national audience who remain on the Congress beat have greater responsibilities. They must inform readers around the country — indeed around the world — of major legislative actions, of fights brewing in both parties with the leadership of the House and Senate, and of developments on the backbenches, once the purview of regionally focused newspapers. In the era of President Trump, congressional reporters have a loftier responsibility as well — one that in the 20 years I have been in Washington I have never felt so keenly. They must cover the legislative branch through the prism of the Constitution, to see Congress not as a bumbling backwater of policy making but as a coequal branch of government, designed as a check on the power of the executive.

"GENEVA — United Nations investigators added their voices on Wednesday to a mountain of evidence of the Syrian military’s responsibility for a chemical attack on a rebel-held town five months ago that left villagers foaming at the mouth and gasping for breath. A United Nations Commission of Inquiry monitoring the six-year conflict in Syria said that Sukhoi 22 aircraft operated by the Syrian Air Force carried out the attack on the village of Khan Sheikhoun early on April 4. It killed at least 83 people, injured close to 300 others and prompted President Trump to order dozens of cruise missile strikes on the airfield from which the jet fighters had launched their attack. The panel’s findings are the first authoritative statement to pin responsibility for the attack unequivocally on the Syrian government. Although a number of foreign governments, watchdogs and news organizations, including The New York Times, had concluded that Syrian forces were most likely behind the attack, the latest report — released by a body tasked with investigating violations by all sides in the conflict — carries more weight and will be harder for the Syrian government and its allies to dismiss as politicized. Moreover, the panel said that Khan Sheikhoun was the site of just one of at least 20 chemical weapons attacks carried out from March 2013 to March 2017 by government forces. (The number of reported, but not confirmed, uses of chemical weapons is vastly higher.) In March, for example, three people, including a surgeon and two patients, died in an attack on an underground hospital in Idlib Province after a helicopter dropped a barrel bomb that dispensed what appeared to be chlorine gas, the panel found.

"After each North Korean provocation, a soothing mantra echoes through the halls of government and think tanks in the United States. China, it is frequently said, could solve this seemingly unsolvable problem, finally reining in North Korea, if Beijing were just properly motivated. But this oft-repeated line contains three assumptions, none of which has held up well in recent years. It assumes that outside pressure could persuade North Korea to curtail or abandon its weapons programs. That China has the means to bring about such pressure. And that Beijing will do so once it is properly cajoled or coerced. Each assumption has been tested repeatedly in recent years and, time and again, has collapsed. Yet three consecutive presidents — George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Donald J. Trump — have invested their hopes and their strategies in China coming to the rescue. Asked whether this were possible, even in the abstract, John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, answered, “No, the Chinese can’t fix this for us.” "
"SEOUL, South Korea — The United States military plans to complete the deployment of an advanced missile-defense system in South Korea on Thursday, days after North Korea detonated what it called a missile-delivered hydrogen bomb in an underground nuclear test, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. Despite angry protests from China, Seoul and Washington have agreed to push ahead with the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, which they said was designed to protect South Korean and American troops from possible missile attacks from North Korea. China has vehemently opposed the Thaad deployment, arguing that it would exacerbate tensions with North Korea and could undermine China’s own nuclear deterrent by giving the United States another means to monitor its missiles. Angry Chinese have boycotted South Korean cars and cultural offerings, like TV dramas. Villagers in Seongju, South Korea, where a Thaad battery was to be installed, also opposed the deployment, fearing that the powerful radar would hurt their health, a concern the Defense Ministry said was scientifically groundless. Joining forces with the farmers were political activists who argued that the Thaad deployment would only increase military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In April, the United States installed the radar and two of the six interceptor-missile launchers of the Thaad battery on an abandoned hilltop golf course in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, the capital. The battery became operational immediately. On Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said the remaining four launchers would be installed on Thursday in response to “North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile threats.” As word of the planned deployment spread, Seongju villagers blocked roads with farm equipment to stop military vehicles from carrying additional equipment to the Thaad base. South Korea and the United States agreed in July 2016 to the Thaad deployment. During his election campaign, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, then a liberal opposition leader, cast doubt on the usefulness of Thaad and said he would review South Korea’s decision to accept its deployment. After taking office in May, he suspended the installation of the four remaining launchers while ordering a study on the environmental impact of the deployment. But after North Korea conducted two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, he ordered his government to cooperate with the United States in installing the remaining launchers. Mr. Moon promised the installation would happen quickly when he talked to President Trump on the phone on Monday, a day after North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. "

Marco Rubio went further, distancing himself from President Trump’s new immigration policy by tweeting a passage from the Bible. John McCain was blunter still, calling the decision “wrong.” But words aren’t enough. They’re not nearly enough. Ryan, Rubio, McCain and the other members of Congress have the power to do something in response to Trump’s decision to subject the 800,000 Dreamers — law-abiding people who entered the United States illegally as children — to potential deportation. Congress can pass a law that removes the threat hanging over them and lets them continue with their lives. If Congress doesn’t act, yesterday’s expressions of concern are mere hypocrisy. “I have zero patience for empty virtue signalling on this,” Susan Hennessey of Lawfare tweeted, in response to Rubio. “You’re a member of Congress. Don’t tell us how sad and pious you are; pass a law.” Greg Sargent of The Washington Post noted that Congress should pass a law quickly, given the uncertainty plaguing Dreamers. Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said Trump’s move had shifted Microsoft’s lobbying priorities. “The entire business community cares about a tax reform,” Smith told NPR. “And yet it is very clear today a tax reform bill needs to be set aside until the Dreamers are taken care of.” Smith also suggested Microsoft would try to block the federal government from deporting its Dreamer employees.

"When he was a presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump took a hard line against Saudi Arabia, criticizing its human rights record and slamming his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for the donations her family foundation received from the country. But as president, Mr. Trump has been more generous to Saudi Arabia, and newly published State Department records indicate that, in several dozen small but extravagant ways, it has been pretty nice to him, too. The records published by The Daily Beast this week list more than 80 gifts that Saudi Arabia gave Mr. Trump when he visited in May, some of which evoke both Indiana Jones and Liberace. (“Orange traditional shirt with silver floral embroidery and leather ammo holder and holster” is one entry.) Other eye-catching gifts include a sword, a copy of the Kuwaiti Constitution, a “sleeveless white silk cotton garment” and two robes lined with the fur of white tigers. Mr. Trump also received a portrait of himself and three chiffon dresses: one yellow, one pale pink and one yellow and turquoise. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump gave similar luxury items to his Saudi hosts, who also posted the president’s face on billboards in the capital and arranged a summit meeting of Muslim leaders and a concert by the American country singer Toby Keith. But Mr. Trump did give Saudi Arabia something it wanted: tough talk on Iran, its regional rival, and a $110 billion arms deal that includes $500 million in precision-guided munitions. Many of the gifts from Saudi Arabia drew interest online because of their opulence and — to an American audience — their oddity. Arms deals and summit meetings are familiar tools of statecraft, but an orange and gold robe lined with cheetah fur? "
"SEOUL, South Korea — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said his country opposed cutting off oil supplies to North Korea as part of new sanctions being considered in the wake of the country’s latest nuclear test, according to official accounts of his meeting Wednesday with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. The United States and its allies are pushing for a global embargo on oil exports to North Korea as the United Nations Security Council debates a new round of sanctions against the North. Russia has veto power over any such Security Council sanctions. North Korea has been getting most of its oil from China. But it has been trying to increase imports from Russia as an alternative source of energy for its military, as well as for its decrepit industries, amid signs that Beijing is growing impatient with the North’s nuclear adventurism, South Korean analysts said. During a meeting on the sidelines of an economic summit conference in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, Mr. Moon asked Mr. Putin to support the proposed oil embargo. But Mr. Putin said that sanctions and pressure would not persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for Mr. Moon. Stopping oil exports to the country would instead hurt ordinary North Koreans by disrupting hospitals and other civilian facilities, Mr. Yoon quoted Mr. Putin as saying. Mr. Putin said Russia exported less than 40,000 tons of oil a year to North Korea. “Without political and diplomatic tools, it is impossible to make headway in the current situation; to be more precise, it is impossible,” Mr. Putin said during a joint news conference with Mr. Moon.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles. California is home to more than a quarter of the roughly 800,000 recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program, known as DACA, that has allowed young people who are undocumented to legally live and work in the United States. Within minutes of the Trump administration’s announcement Tuesday morning that it would end the program in six months, dozens of leaders from across the state condemned the move. Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the decision unconstitutional and said that California could file a lawsuit to keep the program alive as early as Wednesday. “We are prepared to go in tomorrow or whenever it seems appropriate to Court to make sure we stand up for those who have stood up and helped build this country and certainly California,” Mr. Becerra said during a news conference in Sacramento. “We are prepared to defend the DACA program because it is fully lawful and fully American in its value and its approach.” "
"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump Jr. told Senate investigators on Thursday that he set up a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer because he was intrigued that she might have damaging information about Hillary Clinton, saying it was important to learn about Mrs. Clinton’s “fitness” to be president. But nothing came of the Trump Tower meeting, he said, and he was adamant that he never colluded with the Russian government’s campaign to disrupt last year’s presidential election. During five hours of questioning, investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee pressed Mr. Trump on numerous topics related to the meeting with the Russian lawyer, including how the president’s aides this summer drafted a statement aboard Air Force One in response to queries from The New York Times about the meeting. Mr. Trump said he did not speak to his father about the draft statement because he did not want to involve him in something he “knew nothing about,” according to one person briefed about parts of his testimony. Lawmakers have wanted to know what, if anything, President Trump knew about the June 2016 meeting and whether he was involved in preparing the draft statement to The Times. In his prepared remarks on Thursday to Congress, the younger Mr. Trump said he was initially conflicted when he heard that the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, might have damaging information about Mrs. Clinton. Despite his interest, he said, he always intended to consult with his lawyers about the propriety of using any information that Ms. Veselnitskaya, who has links to the Kremlin, gave him at the meeting. A copy of Mr. Trump’s statement was obtained by The New York Times. The acknowledgment by the president’s eldest son that he intended to seek legal counsel after the meeting suggests that he knew, or at least suspected, that accepting potentially damaging information about a rival campaign from a foreign country raised thorny legal issues.

"President Trump huddled for about an hour with top officials from New York and New Jersey at the White House on Thursday, including Senators Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand and Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo and Chris Christie, to discuss the future of a multibillion-dollar tunnel between the two states. The so-called Gateway project, to build a train tunnel under the Hudson River, is considered the linchpin of transportation infrastructure in the region and a top priority for many officials from the two states. It would provide a critical additional link between New Jersey and New York’s Pennsylvania Station. Thursday’s guest list signaled the project’s importance: In addition to the senators and governors, about a dozen members of Congress also attended the White House gathering. Mr. Trump was joined by Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary; Gary D. Cohn, his economic adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the budget director; and John F. Kelly, his chief of staff. “The meeting was positive. The president was receptive and wants to get back to us on Gateway,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. The White House, too, said the meeting had been “productive.” Mr. Cuomo was less bullish. “While the White House meeting was productive, it was inconclusive,” he said. Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, said in an interview that the meeting “could not have been more positive.” He added that the only specific numbers discussed were a $30 billion price tag and a 50-50 split between the federal government and the states in picking up those costs, which has been a point of contention in the past.

"This is Thursday’s storm coverage. Read the latest with Friday’s live updates on Hurricane Irma » Hurricane Irma, an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 storm with sustained winds of up to 155 miles an hour, continued to tear through the Caribbean on Friday, moving through the Bahamas and along the northern coast of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center said. The death toll from the storm was at least seven as of Thursday afternoon, but the authorities warned that the number could rise as emergency crews reached flooded areas and as communications improved. The hurricane is expected to hit the Florida Keys and South Florida starting Saturday evening, said Kevin Scharfenberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. A second storm, Jose, strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean and could hit Antigua and Barbuda, which have suffered extensive flooding and wind damage from Irma, according to the National Hurricane Center. In Florida and Georgia, officials issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal and some inland areas, leading to gas shortages and heavy traffic on local highways. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for South Florida, the Florida Keys, Lake Okeechobee and Florida Bay and a storm surge warning for South Florida and the Florida Keys. • Half of the 100,000 residents of Antigua and Barbuda have had their homes destroyed or heavily damaged, the prime minister said. • The governor of Puerto Rico said at a news conference that electrical service had been restored to 144,000 households — which still leaves nearly a million in the dark.

"Jaime Ballesteros tried to contain his tears on Tuesday while teaching Brooklyn sixth graders about liquids, gases and solids. In between science classes at a charter school in East New York, he broke down at his desk. The government had just canceled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which had granted temporary protection from deportation to immigrants brought to the country at a young age. Under DACA, as the program is known, they attended college and obtained work permits, and many went back into the profession that inspired them in the first place. “The last three years that I have been teaching was like a world of possibility for me and my students,” said Mr. Ballesteros, 25, who is from the Philippines. “Today, I just didn’t feel that same level of hope.” He was just one of the estimated 30,000 DACA recipients in New York who now face uncertain futures, according to statistics kept by the city. The Trump administration gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative solution, while allowing the DACA permits to last until they expire. The jobs these DACA recipients, often known as Dreamers, do have a wide impact in New York, from small business owners to financial analysts to internet entrepreneurs and nurses. In May 2016, New York State allowed DACA recipients to get licenses for teaching and 57 other professions, after a 2015 appellate court decision paved the way in ruling that a DACA recipient from Staten Island, Cesar Vargas, could become a lawyer.

"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan voiced his disagreement with President Trump’s decision to cut a debt limit deal with Democrats and cast doubt on his call to cut the corporate tax rate by more than half in an interview on Thursday with The New York Times. The comments underscore the rift between the White House and the top House Republican at a time when they are pressing to reach several major legislative goals before the end of the year. However, Mr. Ryan said that he understood the president’s motivations. “What the president didn’t want to do is have some partisan fight in the middle of the response to this,” Mr. Ryan said, referring to Hurricane Harvey. “He wanted to make sure we had a bipartisan moment.” The remarks were Mr. Ryan’s first public comments on the matter since Mr. Trump blindsided Republican leaders on Wednesday. Before Mr. Trump made the deal, Mr. Ryan called such a strategy “ridiculous.” On Thursday, he said that he continued to believe that short-term debt limit extensions were not a good idea. “I personally believe, for the credit markets’ sake, we should have longer extensions of these,” Mr. Ryan said.

"Last month, NPR published a list of the 150 greatest albums by women. The list was debated. It was discussed. There were alternative lists of 150 additional albums not on the NPR list. Quibbling with the particulars of the list is one thing. It did overlook a lot. But the quibbling misses an important concern about what it means to argue for a female-only canon. The power of the list came, in part, from its mere existence, from how necessary it felt. Behold the many artists ignored by mainstream coed lists! Aaliyah! Shakira! Tori Amos! Chaka Khan! Why would albums by women who rank so prominently on a list determined by women be missing from one determined by all genders but really mostly men? The question matters.

They say you fed your uncle to dogs after you had him arrested in full public view. They say you had your armed forces minister dispatched with an antiaircraft gun, to obliterate every trace of him from the face of the earth. They say you executed your deputy premier for education for slouching. Nothing strange in this. Tyranny is an art, the foremost requirement of which is to instill the appropriate sense of dread and awe. You — the fat kid with the boarding-school education and the basketball mania — had no chance of living without immediately demonstrating a relish for killing. Political murder in regimes like yours is always performance art. And so you did it, even as you eased economic controls and allowed private markets to flourish. You would not put North Koreans through another Arduous March, as your father had in the 1990s, allowing more than a million to starve so that Pyongyang’s elite could stay fed. Another lesson for tyrants: You do not subjugate a people by taking everything from them. You subjugate them by giving them something they know you can take away. Desperate people aren’t always obedient. Dependent people usually are. "
"The surge in Democratic enthusiasm and activism driven by animosity to President Trump is proving to be a mixed blessing. Renewed fervor improves Democratic prospects in 2018 House and Senate elections. At the same time, in a development reminiscent of the Tea Party Republican insurgency of 2010, moderate and centrist Democratic incumbents face primary challengers from the Sanders left. In some cases, these challengers raise the threat of bitterly contested midterm primaries that could leave House and Senate nominees weakened for the general election. Two moderate Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both face primary challenges from the insurgent progressive wing of their party, as do a growing number of Democratic House incumbents. Center versus left disputes within Democratic ranks have surfaced on several fronts, even as Democrats of all stripes have come to recognize the devastating costs of the Trump-era Republican attack on the nature of truth and the parallel rise of “alternative facts.” The Democratic National Committee, charged with a crucial organizational role in the coming presidential election, continues to struggle to regain standing with Sanders supporters after a series of conflicts in 2016 and 2017 over such matters as control of valuable donor lists and demands for a more progressive agenda.

"Under the leadership of Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson, the State Department is considering a mission reform that includes the abandonment of democratic assistance and human rights. The current mission statement reads, “The department’s mission is to shape and sustain a peaceful, prosperous, just and democratic world and foster conditions for stability and progress for the benefit of the American people and people everywhere.” Dropping the words “just” and “democratic” would be fully consistent with the transactional realism that has characterized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric. And such a change might reflect a growing feeling that most of the programs to support democracy abroad and the importance of democratic ideals are wasteful, inefficient, unappreciated or even damaging. In America, the public (especially Republicans) has increasingly favored nationalism and isolationism, according to some polls, in which the United States focuses on its own problems, with many wary of global humanitarian engagement. But such a shift in United States foreign policy would be a historic mistake, abandoning America’s deepest values, eroding international commitments to human rights, and setting off dismay among friends and joy among foes around the globe. It would be the ultimate symbol of the end of American leadership in the world. This commitment to democracy is far from recent; it has been a red thread running through decades of bipartisan American foreign policy. A century ago, on April 2, 1917, during a speech asking Congress to declare war on Germany, Woodrow Wilson delivered one of the most resonant lines in the history of the American presidency: “The world must be made safe for democracy.” In 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, in the Atlantic Charter, committed the World War II allies to protect “the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.” And since then, democratic ideals have been articulated in speeches by every president, Republican and Democratic.

"Nikki Haley laid the Trump administration’s cards on the table this week with a new proposal aimed at sabotaging one of the Obama administration’s most important diplomatic initiatives — the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. President Trump promised during his campaign to kill the deal, despite its clear benefits to American security. Ms. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, has set forth a scheme that could not only allow Mr. Trump to carry out his threat, but also shift final responsibility to Congress. The whole idea makes no sense to anyone but Mr. Trump’s hard-line advisers, who see Iran as the root of evil in the Persian Gulf. Instead of making sure the agreement works, the president would give Iran an excuse to revive what had been a rapidly advancing nuclear capability and confront the world with another intractable nuclear challenge in addition to North Korea. The deal, negotiated with Tehran by the United States and other major powers, imposed strict limits on Iran’s nuclear activities for 10 years in return for a lifting of international and American sanctions. As an added check, Congress requires the administration to certify every 90 days that Iran is abiding by the deal, in order to continue qualifying for relief from American sanctions. The administration has twice reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance and is required to revisit the issue again next month. Ms. Haley said she doesn’t know what Mr. Trump’s decision will be. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which put unprecedented strong procedures in place for monitoring Iran’s activities, has repeatedly judged that Iran is fulfilling its obligations. In July, Gen. Paul Selva of the Air Force, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that based on evidence submitted to intelligence agencies, “it appears that Iran is in compliance.” Mr. Trump, however, has reportedly kept pushing his advisers to find a way out, and Ms. Haley appears to have answered the call. The essence of her case, presented Tuesday to the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, is that technical compliance with the nuclear-related commitments is not sufficient and that the president “has grounds” to declare that Iran is not fulfilling the agreement because of other destabilizing or objectionable behavior, like its ballistic missile tests, support for Hezbollah and hostility toward the United States.

"Good morning on this wet-to-wonderful Thursday. Class is back in session for more than a million public school children today. For high school students, especially, this is a time of self exploration, growing pains, and, for those of us reflecting back, some regrets. We recently asked our readers to share some of the things they wished they had done differently in high school. Here are a few of their regrets: “What I wish I could’ve done differently: Listen. Be more aware of the potential signs of depression or bullying. I don’t believe I was an aggressor, but I participated in my fair share of it, so I wish I was more self aware, too.” — Sachin Arora, 29, Astoria, Queens “If I had to do high school over again, I’d leave aside the ice cream scooping and McDonalds customer service jobs for work that helped me figure out my longer term career, if at all possible.” — Suzanne Grossman, 42, Maplewood, N.J. “I regret not pushing harder for the one thing I loved: dance. If I could go back, I would tell my younger self to have courage, take risks and believe in myself because that’s what it takes out in the world.” — Annette Herwander, 37, Washington Heights “I would have wanted to have sex and try pot. Back then, programs like D.A.R.E. and ‘abstinence only’ scared me into obedience.” — Joey DeGrandis, 32, East Village "

"A billionaire property developer who has accused some of China’s most powerful officials of corruption has applied for political asylum in the United States, his lawyer said. The billionaire, Guo Wengui, who is in the United States on a tourist visa that expires later this year, is seeking asylum status because his public charges against Chinese officials have made him “a political opponent of the Chinese regime,” Thomas Ragland, a Washington-based lawyer representing him, said in a telephone interview late Wednesday. Asylum — even a pending asylum application — would give Mr. Guo more protection because he could stay in the United States while the application was being considered, a process that can take years, Mr. Ragland said. “Asylum offers a level of protection that is different from having a visa status,” Mr. Ragland said. “Visas can be canceled or revoked.” From his $68 million apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan, Mr. Guo, also known as Miles Kwok, has used Twitter and YouTube to publicize his claims that Wang Qishan, a member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee who oversees the ruling Communist Party’s own anticorruption efforts, and his family members secretly control one of China’s largest conglomerates. Some of the evidence he presents to back his claims is easily refuted or simply difficult to believe. But some of his accusations, such as those made against the family of Mr. Wang’s immediate predecessor, can be corroborated. "
"WASHINGTON — In his seven months in office, President Trump has proved to be the commander in chief of mixed messages. But even for him, the nighttime tweet on Tuesday was a head-turner. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had scrapped his predecessor’s program sparing younger illegal immigrants from deportation on the grounds that a president does not have the power to take such action by himself. He then put the onus on Congress by giving it a six-month deadline to “fix” the program before it would expire. Then, barely eight hours after his decision was announced, the president went on Twitter with a message that completely undercut both positions in just under 140 characters. “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do),” he wrote, using the initials for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. “If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!” By vowing to “revisit this issue,” Mr. Trump arguably took Congress off the hook by seeming to suggest that if lawmakers cannot agree, they need not worry about the political or human consequences because he may take unspecified action himself to protect the younger immigrants. But by his own argument earlier in the day, he does not have the power to do that. White House officials offered no immediate explanation about what the president intended by the message or how he could revisit the issue in six months. Asked during a media appearance with congressional leaders on Wednesday morning if he had any second thoughts on his decision, Mr. Trump said, “No second thoughts.” But the conflicting messages seemed to reflect what aides describe as the president’s own conflicting emotions about the issue.

"FRANKFURT — Europe has taken a small step in its long march toward economic normalcy. The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it had pondered how to wind down its easy money policies, an enormous stimulus program aimed at promoting growth and inflation in the eurozone. But the bank also postponed a decision on when it would actually do so, and will likely decide at least some of the details at its next meeting in October, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, said. Even though the eurozone is arguably in its best economic shape in a decade, Mr. Draghi and his colleagues on the bank’s Governing Council have been exceedingly cautious about ending the emergency measures that helped prevent the euro from self-destructing after the global financial meltdown in 2008. The Federal Reserve in the United States began raising interest rates at the end of 2015, but the European Central Bank continues to flood the 19-nation eurozone with cash as a way to reduce interest rates, stimulate growth and nudge inflation from levels considered to be dangerously low. The measures have worked, for the most part, helping the region overcome a prolonged slump. But the program — known as quantitative easing — has also had side effects, including fueling a steep rise in real estate prices in Germany that have led to fears of a bubble. Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the benefits have far outweighed any negative effects. Still, with the Fed moving in the opposite direction, the European Central Bank has been under pressure to shift its policy. He began laying the foundation on Thursday for plans to “taper” the stimulus. Although the European Central Bank’s Governing Council left monetary policy unchanged, Mr. Draghi said policy makers had preliminary discussions about the program, and said they would make the “bulk” of the decisions about tapering late next month.

"President Emmanuel Macron of France is liberalism’s new poster boy. Hailed as the answer to Europe’s populist tide, he has brought a buzz back into French diplomacy by facing down President Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. “The Macron method,” a leading European think tank gushed recently, is the new Third Way, threading the needle between technocracy and populism. At home in France, it’s a very different story. A recent poll found that Mr. Macron’s popularity fell by 14 points in August, after a fall of 10 points in July. Only 40 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with the president’s performance. To be fair, Mr. Macron never had much popular support to begin with. In the first round of the presidential election in April, when the vote was split among four main contenders, he won just under 24 percent. (By comparison, François Hollande received 28 percent of the vote in the first round in 2012. Nicolas Sarkozy won 31 percent in 2007.) Mr. Macron won the second round handily, but only because he was the lesser-evil candidate in the runoff — his competitor was Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right populist National Front party. Electoral arithmetic explains only so much. Mr. Macron’s popularity suffers from something more fundamental: Macronism. His entire political project has been far too focused on his personality. Much of his appeal has come from his youth, his dynamism, his good looks and his oratorical skills. This hyper-personalized approach always carried the risk that once his charm wore off, there would be nothing left for his supporters to like, which is exactly what is happening. Since taking office, Mr. Macron has put off many people by trying to recapture the grandeur of the presidency. In a phrase that may stick to him for the rest of his time in office, he said he wanted to make the presidency more “Jupiterian,” comparing himself with the powerful Roman god Jupiter, who ruled the skies. When he brought the Senate and Parliament together at the Versailles palace and spoke to them about his ambitions for the presidency, many in France bristled at the monarchical overtones. This arrogant attitude about power has destroyed the anti-establishment, upstart image that Mr. Macron cultivated during the campaign. The post-ideological platform on which he ran is starting to reveal itself for what it really is: an emptiness at the heart of his political project. "
"JERUSALEM — Overnight strikes Thursday on Syrian military sites — which are said to produce chemical weapons and advanced missiles — brought renewed attention to Syria’s chemical weapons, and appear to have been an escalation of Israel’s efforts to prevent its enemies from gaining access to sophisticated weapons. The Syrian military said Israeli warplanes had struck the sites early Thursday, killing two people near the town of Masyaf in western Syria and causing unspecified material damage. Israeli officials did not comment on the strike, but a Syrian monitoring group and two former Israeli officials said it had targeted an installation of a government agency that produced chemical weapons and a military base that produced advanced missiles. The strike came a day after a United Nations commission accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons in an attack in April that killed dozens in the town of Khan Sheikhoun and flooded clinics with victims gasping for breath. While many foreign governments and news organizations had previously concluded that Syrian forces were probably behind the attack, the unequivocal condemnation from the United Nations was the most authoritative statement blaming the Syrian government for it. Syria and its ally Russia have claimed that the Syrian government did not use banned munitions and that the attack was carried out by rebels on the ground. "

"If Gary D. Cohn is no longer considered a serious contender to take over the Federal Reserve, as multiple news media outlets report, what’s next for him? More important, will President Trump decide to keep Janet L. Yellen as leader of America’s central bank, or will he turn to someone like the former Fed governor Kevin Warsh? Here’s what we know: • Mr. Cohn’s public criticism of the president’s response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. has made it much less likely that he will succeed Ms. Yellen at the Fed, according to The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. • The New York Times says that Mr. Cohn has fallen out of favor, but is not totally out of the running. Still, Mr. Trump is known to place a premium on loyalty, and has complained about Mr. Cohn’s statements. • Even after his criticism of the president, Mr. Cohn has said that he needs to stay on board to work on matters like an overhaul of the tax code. It’s possible that if the initiative succeeds, he could regain Mr. Trump’s favor. Ms. Yellin’s tenure as chairwoman of the Fed expires in February. The White House could renominate her. Or it could pick from other candidates, including these mentioned by the news media: • John Taylor, an economist at Stanford • Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School • John Allison, the former chief executive of BB&T Bank "
"WASHINGTON — The top five House Democrats are urging Speaker Paul D. Ryan to establish a select committee on “the rise of white supremacy and domestic terrorism.” The lawmakers, in a letter sent on Wednesday to Mr. Ryan, argued that Congress needed to study an “outbreak of hate” brought on by last year’s presidential election, as well as the threat that white supremacist groups pose to “the security and stability of our nation.” Representative Joseph Crowley of New York said he had broached the idea of the select committee after watching Mr. Trump praise the “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly violence at a rally of white supremacists in Virginia. “A young woman lost her life as a result of what took place in Charlottesville,” Mr. Crowley said in an interview. “That cannot be understated, and that life ought to not go without recognition by the Congress.” Mr. Crowley called the new prominence of neo-Nazis and other groups like the Ku Klux Klan “a national crisis” and said he hoped that the committee could offer bipartisan solutions. He signed the letter along with Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California, Linda T. Sánchez of California, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. It is unclear whether Mr. Ryan will agree to establish the committee. Some conservatives have resisted efforts to shine a spotlight on right-wing extremists that is equal to the one on Islamic terrorists, even though studies have linked right-wing extremists to far more deaths in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. Under a Department of Homeland Security program known as Countering Violent Extremism, the Trump administration has ended grants to groups combating white supremacy, while keeping funding for organizations fighting Islamic terrorism. In their letter to Mr. Ryan, the lawmakers cited the Department of Homeland Security and other authorities in writing that there is “substantial energy behind the white supremacist movement, with traffic on leading websites soaring over the past year alongside a wide-reaching effort to recruit young people on college campuses.” “Given the surge of support for terror,” they wrote, “a more focused effort is needed to understand what is happening and how we can work together to protect our fellow Americans.” "
"I was 19 years old when I bought a first edition of “Sexual Politics” in 1970. Kate Millett’s first book, published the year before, was that unlikeliest phenomenon — a dissertation heard around the world. What I remember most about that year was the dizzying experience of reading Ms. Millett, who died on Wednesday, and the new theories of her sister feminists that came in its wake. Like one of Yayoi Kusama’s “Infinity Rooms,” my consciousness, and that of the women I knew, gained new dimensions. In my library today, that volume of “Sexual Politics” sits next to the feminist classics that soon followed. Both “The Dialectic of Sex” by Shulamith Firestone and “Sisterhood is Powerful,” Robin Morgan’s ambitious anthology, appeared in 1970. The following year, Germaine Greer published “The Female Eunuch” in the United States. Each year thereafter brought a major new work: Phyllis Chesler’s “Women and Madness” (1972); Mary Daly’s “Beyond God the Father” (1973); Andrea Dworkin’s “Woman Hating” (1974); and Susan Brownmiller’s “Against Our Will” (1975). These women and many others, including Adrienne Rich and Angela Davis, offered new insights, shaking foundation after foundation for me and my peers. But it was Ms. Millett’s book that made us feminists. I remember staring at Alice Neel’s image of a confident-looking Ms. Millett on a Time magazine cover in August 1970. It made me feel a little indomitable, too. That fall, I started to offer feminist analyses in my literature classes. Maybe I wasn’t ready to take on the world, but I could take on John Keats’s “La Belle Dame Sans Merci.” In 1963, Betty Friedan had called the “feminine mystique” the problem with no name. It was Ms. Millett who gave it a name — sexual politics — and explained its cause: patriarchal society. By introducing the concept of “patriarchy as a political institution,” she equipped her readers to become their own theorists of culture. Ms. Millett revolutionized our thought by helping us to perceive the power structures in what had previously been cast as apolitical terrain: the home; literature; romantic relationships. It felt so liberating to realize that we could follow her lead. We could take this fundamental insight to our jobs, our schools, our marriages — and to politics itself. Theory mattered. It was capable of propelling real change. "
"HOUSTON — As the floodwaters rose in my west Houston neighborhood after Hurricane Harvey landed, my husband and many of our neighbors pulled boats through waist-high water, knocked on doors and plucked people from their submerged houses. They rescued elderly couples, young roommates, families who do not speak English. There was no checking of IDs, no debate on whether a life was worth saving. All across the city, as catastrophic flooding threatened to drown us, regular people risked their lives to help others. Alonso Guillen, a radio host and D.J. who lived in Lufkin, Tex., two hours from Houston, brought a boat and a group of friends here to join in those efforts. He was on that boat, saving people he had never met before, when it capsized last Wednesday and he drowned. Alonso Guillen died a hero, if not an American citizen. He was a Dreamer, a beneficiary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and like the nearly 141,000 other Dreamers in Texas, he followed the requirements of the program — to stay in school or be gainfully employed — and had never been convicted of a crime. More than that, Texas was his home. Around the time Alonso Guillen was buried in Lufkin, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced President Trump’s decision to cancel the DACA program, saying that “enforcing the law saves lives, protects communities and taxpayers, and prevents human suffering.” Instead, what the announcement shows is how suffering can needlessly be inflicted. The end of DACA means that hundreds of thousands of people nationwide will lose their eligibility to work. As many as 80,000 Dreamers in the greater Houston area alone could be deported to countries where they have no relationships, where they do not even speak the language. It is the disaster of this decision — more than the hurricane — that threatens to tear our city apart. On Saturday, after Mr. Guillen’s boat capsized but days before his body was found, President Trump came to Houston for the second time since the hurricane, to meet with families at shelters and churches. In a dry, air-conditioned building, he met with elected officials, took a few selfies with evacuees and kissed their babies before leaving on his plane. "

"WASHINGTON — A new round of contracts has been awarded to build prototypes for a wall along the border with Mexico, the Department of Homeland Security announced on Thursday. Two of the companies selected, Caddell Construction Company of Montgomery, Ala., and W. G. Yates & Sons Construction Company of Philadelphia, Miss., were also among firms awarded contracts last week to build concrete wall prototypes in the San Diego area. The other companies chosen to build the wall prototypes are KWR Construction Inc. of Sierra Vista, Ariz., and ELTA North America Inc. of Annapolis Junction, Md. The new wall prototypes will be 18 to 30 feet high and made of materials other than concrete, according to documents from Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. The agency did not say what those materials include. Officials said the prototypes, which will also be constructed in the San Diego area, are designed to deter illegal crossings. The border wall was a key campaign issue for President Trump, who said it would stop drugs and dangerous international gangs, although experts point out that most drugs are smuggled into the country through ports of entry, not over the border. Days after taking office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order instructing Customs and Border Protection to build a wall along large sections of the border. The wall has proved to be a tough sell in Congress. Mr. Trump has asked lawmakers to allocate $1.6 billion this year toward building a wall along the roughly 1,900-mile border with Mexico. A mix of barriers — from chain-link fences and steel walls that keep people from crossing to steel beams that stop vehicles — already stretches across about 650 miles of the border. Congress has provided $341 million this year to repair and bolster the existing barriers. The House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill that included $1.6 billion for 74 miles of fencing along the border. The Senate has yet to act on the proposal. Mr. Trump had threatened a government shutdown if the border wall is not included in the next spending bill. He later backtracked on the threat. The Senate approved a measure on Thursday to keep the government funded through December, but did not include funding for the border wall. The House still has to vote on the bill. The Center for Biological Diversity, an Arizona-based environmental group, sued the Trump administration in April for failing to study the environmental impact of the proposed border wall. On Tuesday, the group amended its lawsuit to include the border-wall replacement and prototype projects. "
"It is not just the threat of deportation that is hanging over Amparo Gonzalez. The 31-year-old single mother could also lose her job at a warehouse company, even if she stays in the country. With it would go the health insurance she gets through her employer, which covers her 13-year-old daughter, as well as the exams and treatments that Ms. Gonzalez needs for her chronic colon disease. “I lose everything without DACA,” she said, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that President Trump moved this week to eliminate. With the news that roughly 800,000 people across the country would begin losing their protected status under DACA, which offered work permits and temporary reprieves from deportation to young undocumented immigrants, the program’s beneficiaries are now scrambling to prepare for the various ways the decision could upend their lives. Living and working in the United States are the two privileges most often associated with DACA. But for many recipients, those are merely the first dominoes to fall if Congress does not pass a replacement. The shutdown of the program could reverberate far beyond those privileges and topple the many others that DACA protection can confer, from state-sponsored health coverage and financial aid to driver’s licenses and professional credentials. The loss of these things could, in turn, disrupt recipients’ abilities to go to school, support their families and keep a roof over their heads. Losing the ability to work legally would mean, for an estimated 450,000 people, forfeiting the health insurance and other benefits offered through employers, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Another 290,000 recipients, the center said, may lose their eligibility for state-subsidized health coverage when their protection expires. The law center’s researchers also found that more than half of DACA beneficiaries will be forced to relinquish driver’s licenses. And while many might find work under the table or from sympathetic employers, they could not obtain most occupational licenses, like those required for nursing and cosmetology. "

"WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan participated in a TimesTalks conversation in Washington on Thursday. He discussed the coming tax overhaul effort, immigration, this week’s surprise debt limit deal and what it’s like to work with President Trump. Here are the takeaways. From dealing with the debt ceiling to cutting corporate taxes, it was clear on Thursday that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump disagree on a wide variety of issues. It was also evident that their fortunes are tied and that Mr. Ryan will continue to do his best to cast their differences in a positive light. A day after calling Democrats’ debt ceiling proposal “ridiculous,” Mr. Ryan empathized with Mr. Trump, saying he was seeking a bipartisan moment in the face of crises. Mr. Ryan struck a similar tone on taxes as he called Mr. Trump’s hope for a 15 percent corporate tax rate unrealistic. Rather than focus on their differences, Mr. Ryan emphasized that Mr. Trump wants to get the rate as low as possible. One of the most contentious fights in the coming tax overhaul effort is likely to be the push the eliminate state and local tax deductions. Several Republicans in Congress from states with high tax rates have already expressed their opposition to this plan. Mr. Ryan made a full-throated case on Thursday for eliminating that deduction, arguing that the deduction generally helps the rich. He said that if the standard deduction was doubled, as he wants to do, then middle-income people would feel little effect from changes to the state and local deduction. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Bypasses G.O.P. to Strike a Deal on Debt” (front page, Sept. 7): While I am generally loath to say nice things about this president because his words and actions are usually beneath the dignity of the office, I have to give him credit for understanding one thing about Washington: If you want to get anything done, you have to deal with the Democrats. While the Freedom Caucus and other archconservatives may fume over the debt deal, the real takeaway lesson for them should be that if you want to be part of the solution, you have to stop being part of the problem. This deal may not usher in a new era of bipartisanship, but it does signal to these recalcitrant Republicans that there are other options and that this president is not afraid to take them. MICHAEL SCOTT, SAN FRANCISCO To the Editor: While it’s generally good news that President Trump struck a deal on the debt ceiling, let’s understand that it probably had less to do with Hurricane Harvey aid and bipartisanship than Mr. Trump’s own self-interest and inherent conflicts. A debt ceiling crisis, even not a full-blown default, would roil markets and increase the borrowing costs of businesses, certainly including Trump Organization businesses. So it is not without a smile that I can write that the G.O.P. has been hoist by its own petard. JONATHAN D. KARMEL, CHICAGO To the Editor: I have mixed emotions about the Democrats’ wanting to tie the debt ceiling to Hurricane Harvey funding. Although I overwhelmingly approve both funding for Harvey relief and raising the debt ceiling, which is the only responsible option, I think it should be a hard-and-fast rule that you do not politicize the debt ceiling. Ever. Defaulting on our debt is the fiscal equivalent of a unilateral nuclear strike. It is unthinkable. There should never be conditions set. There are reasons for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, to be concerned about our debt. Those concerns should be addressed in the budgeting process, not in keeping the promises to pay debt that Congress has already approved. Tying together Harvey relief funding and paying our bills on time puts both at risk, as it asks for political courage from G.O.P. legislators. Not a good bet. JEFFREY L. GARCEAU, CHICAGO The writer is research coordinator for MuniNet Guide, which covers public finance issues. "
"WASHINGTON — The Republican-led Senate on Thursday approved legislation to raise the debt limit and keep the government funded until December while providing $15 billion in disaster aid, giving a reluctant stamp of approval to the surprising deal that President Trump struck with Democratic congressional leaders. The Senate approved the measure 80 to 17. All of the senators voting no were Republicans. The Senate acted quickly to provide funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency as it helps Texas recover from Hurricane Harvey, and the federal government will probably be stretched further as Hurricane Irma heads toward Florida. The House passed a measure on Wednesday providing about $7.9 billion in disaster aid, and the Senate beefed up that aid package by adding another $7.4 billion, for a total of about $15.3 billion. “The recovery effort for a record-setting storm like Harvey has strained resources to the limit already,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. “The advance of another historic storm now makes the need for action even more urgent.” Republican leaders had wanted a longer-term extension of the debt limit, but were left with little recourse when Mr. Trump sided with the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, at a White House meeting on Wednesday, blindsiding his own party. The fiscal deal eases the pressure to resolve a thicket of pressing issues this month, but it sets up a high-stakes face-off later this year when lawmakers will need to agree on another funding measure to keep the government open in the long term. Congress will also need to take further action to raise the government’s borrowing capacity and likely will face a far larger hurricane-relief package. Democrats hope to be able to negotiate with Republicans on other issues, too, such as immigration and a measure to stabilize health insurance markets. The measure approved Thursday would continue government funding through Dec. 8 and extend the debt limit for the same period. It would also temporarily extend the National Flood Insurance Program, which is to expire on Sept. 30. "

"To the Editor: Re “It’s the Twitter Age. Let Trump Have His Way With Words,” by Farhad Manjoo (State of the Art column, Aug. 28): It’s not as if Donald Trump is an articulate, thoughtful or composed person who just happens to make spelling errors on Twitter. That would be forgivable. The problem is that his tweets are like a mirror held up to the inner workings of his mind: nonsensical, unintelligent, erratic and dangerous. The end result is a barrage of tens of thousands of tweets going back almost a decade that are full of not just spelling errors, but also a cascade of other public embarrassments: one-word sentences that operate more like dog barks, poor word choices, odd (or missing) punctuation, factual mistakes and outright lies. This is unforgivable for a president. End of story. MARK BESSOUDO, TORONTO To the Editor: In the business world, standards matter, including for writing, and proper spelling is essential to good writing. It helps ensure clarity, averting confusion, misinterpretation and mistakes. This is critical in a fast-paced business environment, where globally dispersed employees rely heavily on written communications and may have English as a second language. Spelling correctly is a best practice, whether on Twitter or email. In business, as in politics, everything you put into writing creates a record and reflects on you. HELEN CUNNINGHAM

"SEATTLE — Wanted: A place with a million people, a diverse population, good schools and malleable lawmakers. Room to accommodate up to 50,000 workers. Canadian provinces also welcome to apply. Amazon took the unusual step on Thursday of announcing it wants a second home outside Seattle, starting what is sure to be a fierce bidding war to lure Amazon — and the thousands of high-paying jobs it will bring to town — using a combination of tax breaks and other sweeteners. By the end of the day, cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Diego, along with states like Michigan, were vocal about their interest, the first of many places expected to consider submitting proposals. Amazon has laid out in meticulous detail what it is looking for, even acknowledging that new laws may be required to get the high level of incentives necessary to hold the company’s attention. “This is the trophy deal of the decade as far as I can tell,” said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. “What governor or mayor doesn’t want to stand on a stage with Jeff Bezos to announce a deal like this?” The plan is the latest surprise from Mr. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, who has reshaped Seattle in the more than two decades since he founded Amazon. He overshadows even Bill Gates, the former Microsoft chief executive who put the Seattle area on the map as a destination for tech companies. Amazon is now the biggest corporate employer in Seattle, and it occupies 19 percent of the prime office space in the city, more than any other employer in a big American city, The Seattle Times reported last month. But Amazon executives have talked internally and with outsiders in recent years about how much more of the company’s hyper-growth Seattle would be able to handle. Housing prices here are skyrocketing, the competition for tech industry talent is getting more fierce and traffic chokes the roads. "

A 19th-century economist named Adolph Wagner made a prediction that came to be known as Wagner’s Law: As societies became wealthier, their taxes would rise. They would rise because people would want more of the services that government tended to provide better than the private market, like national security, education, medical care and a guaranteed retirement. Wagner’s Law has proven truer than not, but there are still many people who would like to pretend otherwise. Specifically, they wish we could summon a country with a strong military, good schools, health care and comfortable retirements — but falling taxes. It’s a nice fantasy. Yesterday, Larry Summers, the economist and former Treasury secretary, gave a lunchtime presentation in Washington laying out the statistics that debunk the falling-taxes fantasy. He effectively updated Wagner’s Law for the United States in 2017. “With the same values and preferences, and the same basic attitude about government activity versus private activity,” Summers said, “you should expect government to be larger in the future than it has been in the past.” There are four main reasons, he argued: • One, society is aging, which calls for greater spending on retirees. The ratio of elderly Americans — those expected to be in the last 15 years of their lives — to all other Americans will rise about 50 percent from 2010 to 2030. "
"The 1990s have been resurgent of late, largely thanks to their somewhat ignoble contributions to contemporary life: reality television and “Baywatch”; White House scandal and congressional shutdown; and, of course, the introduction of Donald J. Trump as a pop culture tabloid star. Well, we all need something to blame. Why not a time period? That it also happened to be an era when fashion had a knowing, energetic immediacy worth celebrating has been mostly overlooked. But on Wednesday, with the opening show of the New York spring 2018 season, Tom Ford came along to remind us. Returning to New York with his first full-on traditional runway show after seasons of flirting with alternate venues (London! L.A.!) and forms (video! dinner theater!) and some timeouts for films, Mr. Ford took a trip down his own glam-cobblestoned memory lane. The 1990s, after all, were the heyday of his Gucci years — he became its creative director in 1994, and left 10 years later — when he burst onto the fashion scene, injecting the concept of postmodern irony into unabashed luxury, adding a dose of sex and making it cool. Just consider that his new collection was in part the opening act for his new fragrance: Alliteratively titled, using first a crude word for sexual congress, followed by “Fabulous.” You fill in the blank. (That is honestly the name on the label.) "
"WASHINGTON — By the time President Trump woke up on Thursday morning, he was feeling upbeat. And as he watched television news reports about his fiscal agreement with Democrats, he felt like telling someone. He picked up the phone and called the two Democratic congressional leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. “The press has been incredible,” he gushed to Ms. Pelosi, according to someone briefed on their call. He was equally effusive with Mr. Schumer, boasting that even Fox News was positive. A few hours later, Mr. Trump went on TV himself, vowing to turn a one-time spending-and-debt deal brokered out of expediency into a more enduring bipartisan alliance that could transform his presidency. He signaled openness to a Democratic proposal to eliminate the perennial showdowns over the debt ceiling, and he repeated his desire to cut a deal to protect younger illegal immigrants from deportation. But even as Republicans fumed at being sidelined, many in Washington were skeptical that the moment of comity would last. Although Mr. Trump has at times preached bipartisanship, he has never made it a central part of his governing strategy. While he may have been feeling energized on Thursday by the collaboration, he is a politician driven by the latest expression of approval, given to abrupt shifts in approach and tone. He is a man of the moment, and the moment often does not last. There are also reasons to doubt whether Democrats would sustain a partnership with Mr. Trump beyond the deal they have cut to keep the government open for three months and paying its debts. The centrifugal forces of partisanship tug from the left as well as the right, and the liberal base has put pressure on Democratic lawmakers not to meet in the middle a president it loathes. For one day, though, the two sides sought to put months of acrimony behind them. “I think we will have a different relationship than we’ve been watching over the last number of years. I hope so,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “I think that’s a great thing for our country. And I think that’s what the people of the United States want to see. They want to see some dialogue. They want to see coming together to an extent.” "
"The standout college quarterback went to the meeting alone that winter night, looking to join. The fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha Psi, a predominantly black fraternity with a small chapter at the University of Nevada, knew who he was. He was a tall, lean, biracial junior, less than a year from graduating with a business degree. “When he came and said he had interest in joining the fraternity, I kind of looked at him like, ‘Yeah, O.K.,’” said Olumide Ogundimu, one of the members. “I didn’t take it seriously. I thought: ‘You’re the star quarterback. What are you still missing that you’re looking for membership into our fraternity?’” His name was Colin Kaepernick, and what he was looking for, Ogundimu and others discovered, was a deeper connection to his own roots and a broader understanding of the lives of others. Seven years later, now 29, Kaepernick is the most polarizing figure in American sports. Outside of politics, there may be nobody in popular culture at this complex moment so divisive and so galvanizing, so scorned and so appreciated. Attempts to explain who Kaepernick is — and how and why he became either a traitor (“Maybe he should find a country that works better for him,” Donald J. Trump said as a presidential candidate last year) or a hero (“He is the Muhammad Ali of this generation,” the longtime civil rights activist Harry Edwards said in an interview last week) — tend to devolve into partisan politics and emotional debates ranging from patriotic rituals to racial inequities. Kaepernick is now (and may forever be) known for a simple, silent gesture. He is the quarterback who knelt for the national anthem before National Football League games last year as a protest against social injustice, especially the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police.

"As New York City hot dog locations go, Tommy Chan’s vending spot in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens is a slow one. But that all changes every year in late August when the United States Open tennis tournament begins. That’s when his modest shack becomes a gold mine. For the two weeks of tennis, lunch-time crowds mob Mr. Chan’s little wooden hut, informally named Tommy’s Doghouse. As the only vendor permitted to sell food on the perimeter of the tournament grounds (aside from the snack counter at a pitch and putt nearby), Mr. Chan, 63, gets swamped with tournament workers and bargain-hunting fans seeking an affordable option to the considerably more expensive food offerings at the tournament, which is scheduled to end with the men’s final on Sunday. His $2 hot dogs are a bargain, compared with the franks inside, which tend to start at $6.50. While a small bottle of water costs $4.50 inside the gates, Mr. Chan charges $2. Erica Newell, of Queens, who works security at the tournament, said that she’ll squeeze in a trip to the doghouse during her 30-minute break for a $4.75 cheeseburger, “compared to inside where you can pay up to 11 bucks,” she explained. “Even though there’s usually a long line, you’re waiting to pay a cheaper price. It works.” "
"In Tecate, Mexico, a little boy with dark hair and curious eyes peers carefully over the barrier wall that borders San Diego County. Rising up almost 70 feet, his hands seemingly grip the barrier tightly, as if he were holding onto his mother’s body. The French artist JR pasted that plaintive image on Wednesday, his first installation in Mexico. The piece, based on his photo of a 1-year-old who lives with his mother and grandparents in Tecate, is fully viewable only from the American side of the divide. The idea came to JR in a dream. “Some people dream about fantasy worlds, I dream about walls,” he said in a phone interview. And though his artwork was not intended as a direct response to the Trump administration, it has extra resonance this week as the White House moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. “I wonder, is this kid worrying about what will happen? What does he think?” JR said. “At one year old, you don’t see the frontier or which side is better.” The United States-Mexico border has been especially fertile ground for artists lately. In Tijuana, the Japanese collective Chim Pom built a treehouse called the “USA Visitors Center,” that JR visited. An American photographer, Richard Misrach, and a Mexican composer, Guillermo Galindo, have joined forces to craft instruments from the objects migrants leave behind. And the Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu created “Carne y Arena,” an immersive virtual-reality exhibition that simulates crossing the border. It’s currently on view at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For JR, whose recent work has frequently dealt with immigrants and refugees, the Mexican installation is part of a continuing conversation. “People will always migrate,” he said. “When we built walls, people built tunnels. When we closed places, they went by the water. The history of humanity is the story of people migrating. Of course, that has to be regulated.” But the idea that borders should be closed, he said, “for me, that’s not a discussion. As an artist, I try to bring back perspective. For this little kid, there are no walls and borders.” "
"Sometimes an international offensive begins with a few shots that draw little notice. So it was last year when Melvin Redick of Harrisburg, Pa., a friendly-looking American with a backward baseball cap and a young daughter, posted on Facebook a link to a brand-new website. “These guys show hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US,” he wrote on June 8, 2016. “Visit #DCLeaks website. It’s really interesting!” Mr. Redick turned out to be a remarkably elusive character. No Melvin Redick appears in Pennsylvania records, and his photos seem to be borrowed from an unsuspecting Brazilian. But this fictional concoction has earned a small spot in history: The Redick posts that morning were among the first public signs of an unprecedented foreign intervention in American democracy. The DCLeaks site had gone live a few days earlier, posting the first samples of material, stolen from prominent Americans by Russian hackers, that would reverberate through the presidential election campaign and into the Trump presidency. The site’s phony promoters were in the vanguard of a cyberarmy of counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts, a legion of Russian-controlled impostors whose operations are still being unraveled. The Russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails or the fire hose of stories, true, false and in between, that battered Mrs. Clinton on Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik. Far less splashy, and far more difficult to trace, was Russia’s experimentation on Facebook and Twitter, the American companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and, in this case, did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda.

"BLURRED LINES
Rethinking Sex, Power and Consent on Campus
By Vanessa Grigoriadis
332 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $28. In July Candice E. Jackson, the top civil rights official in Donald Trump’s Department of Education, told The New York Times that 90 percent of campus rape allegations come from women who regret drunken consensual sex. (She later apologized for her “flippant” remarks.) The day after Jackson made this claim, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, met with groups representing students who say they were falsely accused of sexual assault, including the National Coalition for Men Carolinas. (Says a banner on the group’s website: “Don’t be THAT girl: Embarrassed by a hookup? Angry at a boyfriend? Willing to lie to destroy a life?”) Before the month was over, Columbia University announced that it had settled a lawsuit brought by Paul Nungesser, who became infamous after being accused of rape by Emma Sulkowicz, a fellow student. In 2014, outraged by how Columbia had handled her sexual assault claim against Nungesser, Sulkowicz began lugging a mattress around campus for an entire school year, an iconic piece of protest art that served as her senior thesis. Nungesser’s suit alleged that Columbia, by enabling Sulkowicz’s project, abetted “gender-based harassment” against him. Sulkowicz’s case was emblematic of the movement to use civil rights law to combat campus rape, but in the end the law offered redress to her accused rapist. It’s an irony appropriate to the Trump-era backlash against what his supporters perceived as the far-reaching anti-campus rape policies that took hold during Barack Obama’s presidency. Vanessa Grigoriadis did most of the reporting for her sometimes fascinating but often frustrating new book, “Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power and Consent on Campus,” during the Obama years, when the movement against campus rape was ascendant. Now as the book is released, the movement is on the defensive. This actually makes the subject of “Blurred Lines” more relevant rather than less. Every empirical claim about campus rape is under ferocious dispute: There’s no consensus about what constitutes sexual assault on campus, how common it is or how it should be prevented. In this confusing climate, a cleareyed elucidation of the murky campus rape phenomenon would be enormously welcome. “Blurred Lines” aims to be that book, but is too sloppy with the facts to succeed. Grigoriadis, a contributing editor at The Times Magazine and Vanity Fair, is terrific at capturing complicated personalities and subtle social dynamics. Her kaleidoscopic tour through the campus sexual assault controversy, which begins and ends with Sulkowicz, introduces readers to rape victims-turned-activists, faux-worldly sorority sisters, young men who say their lives were destroyed by false accusations and the college administrators struggling to enforce rapidly changing rules and norms. Grigoriadis puts in the time with students to get them to open up to her, and “Blurred Lines” shows us the parts of their world that defy easy sloganeering. From the outside, that world looks brutal, at least for young women who have internalized the idea that empowerment means mastering a coldly performative sexuality. At one point, a radical feminist at Wesleyan University admits her dislike of pornography in a whisper, saying, “You’re not supposed to say you feel that way.” It’s as if the only taboo desire is the desire for sexual taboos.

"Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, plans to step down from the magazine in December after a 25-year tenure, leaving the role that established him as a ringmaster of the Hollywood, Washington and Manhattan power elite. Mr. Carter’s influence stretched from the magazine and entertainment worlds into finance, literature and politics, where President Trump, a target of Mr. Carter’s poison pen for decades, still bristles at the mention of his name. One of the few remaining celebrity editors in an industry whose fortunes have faded, Mr. Carter — famous for double-breasted suits, white flowing hair and a seven-figure salary — is a party host, literary patron, film producer and restaurateur whose cheeky-yet-rigorous brand of reporting influenced a generation of journalists. Now, he is moving on. “I want to leave while the magazine is on top,” Mr. Carter, 68, said in an interview on Wednesday at the kitchen table of his West Village townhouse. “I wanted to have a third act. And I thought, time is precious.” Mr. Carter co-founded Spy magazine in the 1980s, which helped forge the wry tone and visual style of modern publications. But Vanity Fair, with its fixation on actors, moguls and faded aristocrats, was a product of its editor’s highly particular interests: the golden age of Hollywood, the rituals of WASPdom, the European jet set, Anglophilia. His copious coverage of British royalty and out-of-date celebrities like the Kennedy family was often mocked; one critic found that one-third of the magazine’s issues from 2003 to 2011 contained at least one Kennedy-related article.
