"WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the top Democrat on the panel announced on Tuesday night that they had reached agreement on a plan to prevent the imminent exhaustion of federal funds for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The current appropriation runs out at the end of this month, and many states will exhaust their allotments of federal money later this year or early next year. Nearly nine million children receive health insurance through the program, on which the federal government has been spending about $14 billion a year. The program is for children in families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford other coverage. The agreement was announced by the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and the senior Democrat on the panel, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. “Congress needs to act quickly to extend the funding for CHIP,” said Mr. Hatch, who helped create the program in 1997 with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. Mr. Hatch said the agreement would provide “uninterrupted funding for CHIP” and “increased flexibility for states to administer the program.” "
"If voters sent any discernible messages in the contested Democratic primaries for New York City Council, they were that gentrification is bad, Albany legislators might be good, and a staunchly liberal vision is less important than a strong neighborhood constituency. Oh, and name recognition matters a lot in low turnout races, but is not everything: Five state legislators sought to trade an Albany commute for the shorter trip to City Hall; three of them won. With most of the races decided by late Tuesday, the results pointed to a modest reshuffling of the political map of the Democrat-dominated Council, whose 51 members include just three Republicans. It was a far cry from four years earlier, when a wave of progressive candidates filled about twice as many empty seats and shifted the city’s legislative body further to the left. Indeed, several of Tuesday’s victors were moderate Democrats like State Senator Ruben Diaz Sr., a household name in the Bronx, who voted against gay marriage in Albany and won handily. On the other hand, name recognition probably hurt Hiram Monserrate, the former councilman and state senator convicted of fraud and assault. He lost his comeback bid in central Queens to a state assemblyman, Francisco P. Moya. Much about 2017 was different from the last round of Council elections: the lack of a vibrant contest in the mayoral primary, which Mayor Bill de Blasio won on Tuesday in a walk; a far smaller number of exiting incumbents; and the virtual absence of spending by outside groups, which totaled $720,000 in all Council races this year versus nearly 10 times that in 2013. In the contests for 10 open seats and another 10 with embattled incumbents, local issues dominated, particularly those related to the perennial concerns of gentrification, development and homelessness.

"Defeating a field of five other candidates, Eric Gonzalez won the Democratic primary election for Brooklyn district attorney on Tuesday, taking another step toward becoming the first Latino elected to this office. With no Republican scheduled to run in November’s general election, Mr. Gonzalez, who had already been serving as the acting district attorney, will essentially continue in his job as the borough’s top law enforcement officer. Such a crowded primary field would have been unlikely if not for the sudden death of the previous district attorney, Ken Thompson, who succumbed to cancer in October, in the third year of his four-year term. Five lawyers — all of them former prosecutors — stepped in to challenge Mr. Gonzalez, but none could overcome his wide institutional support or the advantage of his brief incumbency. With 94.4 percent of the precincts counted, Mr. Gonzalez had nearly 53 percent of the vote; his nearest challenger, Anne J. Swern, had 11.6 percent. “I am so happy,” Mr. Gonzalez said at his victory party Tuesday night. “Tonight we make history. I look around this room and see what’s beautiful about Brooklyn. I see the diversity.” The Brooklyn district attorney sets policies that affect the borough’s 2.6 million residents, overseeing an office of nearly 500 prosecutors that handles almost 85,000 criminal cases a year. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s voter fraud commission met in New Hampshire on Tuesday to discuss what members characterized as declining confidence in elections. But the most telling discussions of the session addressed declining confidence in the commission itself. As protesters outside the meeting accused the panel of promoting voter suppression, New Hampshire Secretary of State William M. Gardner, a Democrat on the commission, warned that “the specter of extreme political partisanship” threatened to undermine whatever work it was doing. And Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, another Democrat on the commission, dressed down the commission’s Republican vice chairman for what he called reckless statements about supposed voter fraud in New Hampshire. Even a commission member not in attendance made his critical voice heard. The panel “should be expanding the rights of our citizens to vote, instead of arguably looking for ways to keep people from voting,” wrote Alan L. King, a Democrat and probate judge in Jefferson County, Ala., in a stinging letter. “Some parts of our electorate wish to beat their chests on so-called ‘voter fraud,’ and there may be some isolated instances” of irregularities, he wrote. “But, I would venture to say, thousands upon thousands more people are stricken from voter rolls without justifiable cause or have their vote suppressed.” From its start in May, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity has been dogged by charges that it was established to bolster President Trump’s baseless assertion that fraud cost him a popular-vote victory last November, and to lay the groundwork for future Republican efforts to restrict voting rights. Mr. Trump collected 2.8 million fewer votes than his main rival, Hillary Clinton, but nevertheless won the Electoral College tally. Critics say the panel is politically stacked — the chairman and vice chairman are both Republicans — and loaded with extremists who contend that election fraud is rampant. "
"INTERNATIONAL The Guardia Sanframondi Journal article on Monday about a parade in which residents of the Italian town re-enact Bible stories described one of the scenes incorrectly. A villager portrayed the biblical patriarch Abraham as he offered his son Isaac in sacrifice; he did not portray Samuel anointing David as king of Israel. The error was repeated in a picture caption. SPORTS A picture on Saturday with an article about Major League Baseball’s decision to move the Yankees’ three-game series in St. Petersburg, Fla., against the Tampa Bay Rays to Citi Field was published in error. It showed the Yankees warming up for a 1998 regular-season game at Shea Stadium against the Mets, not the team warming up before a 1998 game that was moved to Shea Stadium because a beam had fallen at Yankee Stadium. • An article on Friday about the Yankees’ 9-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles referred incorrectly to the Yankees’ results in the series in Baltimore. It was their first series win — not sweep — in Baltimore since 2013. • An article on Friday about the women’s semifinals at the United States Open misstated Sloane Stephens’s results at major tournaments since reaching the semifinals of the 2013 Australian Open. She advanced past the fourth round once, at Wimbledon in 2013; it is not the case that “she had not advanced past the fourth round in a major tournament” until this year’s U.S. Open. • An article on Saturday about the men’s semifinals at the United States Open misidentified the last man representing South Africa to reach a Grand Slam final before Kevin Anderson at this year’s U.S. Open. The last to do so was Kevin Curren, at the 1984 Australian Open — not Johan Kriek, at the 1981 Australian Open. • An article on Thursday about the men’s quarterfinals at the United States Open misstated the given name of Rafael Nadal’s opponent. He is Andrey Rublev, not Andrew. "
"Mayor Bill de Blasio coasted to a decisive win on Tuesday in the Democratic primary in New York City, as he moved closer to securing a second term. Facing a group of underfinanced, little-known rivals, Mr. de Blasio received 74 percent of the vote. His main opponent, Sal F. Albanese, a lawyer and former city councilman making his third bid for mayor, received 15 percent. Mr. de Blasio will now focus on the general election, on Nov. 7, when he will face the Republican candidate, Nicole Malliotakis, an assemblywoman from Staten Island, and Bo Dietl, a former police detective running as an independent. “Tonight we took another big step toward a fairer city for all, tonight another ratification of all that we’ve been doing together and it’s going to give us the fuel to go farther,” Mr. de Blasio said at a victory party in Brooklyn, naming some of his achievements, including universal prekindergarten classes, a two-year rent freeze for rent-regulated tenants and a sharp reduction in the stop-and-frisk policing tactic. With no major Democrat willing to take on the incumbent mayor, the contest had all the urgency of a preseason football game, generating tepid interest among voters. "
"WASHINGTON — The House and Senate have unanimously passed a joint resolution urging President Trump to denounce racist and anti-Semitic hate groups, sending a blunt message of dissatisfaction with the president’s initial, equivocal response to the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., last month. The resolution passed the Senate without dissent on Monday and was approved without objection by the entire House on Tuesday night. It could be sent to the White House for Mr. Trump’s signature as early as Wednesday. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately answer a request for comment. The nonbinding measure specifically singles out for condemnation “White nationalists, White supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups.” That represents a sharp contrast to the president’s first comments after the deadly early August demonstrations in which he assigned equivalent blame for the violence on anti-fascist counter-protesters. Mr. Trump denounced “hatred, bigotry and violence — on many sides” and argued that many of the protesters who staged a torchlight march to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee were “very fine people.” One of the counterprotesters, Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a white nationalist demonstrator drove a car into a crowd. Two Virginia State troopers died when their helicopter crashed while monitoring the violence that swept through the usually sedate college town. The House version of the resolution, introduced by Republican and Democratic House members from Virginia, asks Mr. Trump to “use all resources available to the President and the President’s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States.” In a rare show of bipartisan unity, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, introduced the measure as a joint resolution, which requires a presidential signature. Two Republican congressional aides involved in the process said the intent was to put the president on the record calling out white racism by name. The text doesn’t include any reference to counterprotesters. It also calls on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to “investigate thoroughly all acts of violence, intimidation, and domestic terrorism by White supremacists, White nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, and associated groups” and to “improve the reporting of hate crimes” to the F.B.I. “What happened in Charlottesville was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated by a white supremacist, one that tragically cut short the life of a young woman, Heather Heyer, who was speaking out against hatred and bigotry,” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and a co-sponsor of the measure, said in a statement. “We will be pressing our colleagues to swiftly and unanimously approve this resolution in order to send a strong message that the United States Congress unconditionally condemns racist speech and violence.” "
"The University of California, Berkeley, has erupted this year in response to planned speeches by conservative flamethrowers like Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter. On Tuesday, another figure was added to the mix: Stephen K. Bannon, the right-wing media executive and former chief strategist to President Trump. Mr. Bannon has agreed to speak this month as part of Free Speech Week, a four-day event organized by The Berkeley Patriot, a conservative student publication. Mr. Yiannopoulos is also scheduled to appear. Bryce Kasamoto, The Berkeley Patriot’s spokesman, confirmed in a Facebook message on Tuesday evening that Mr. Bannon and Mr. Yiannopoulos would appear at the event, which runs from Sept. 24-27. He indicated that there would be additional speakers but said that he could not name them yet because his group was “still working with the university and law enforcement to finalize our itinerary.” “It’s a valuable opportunity to have such a high-profile figure, who rarely speaks in public, come to our university,” Mr. Kasamoto, a senior at Berkeley, said of Mr. Bannon in an interview on Wednesday. He added that he and his fellow organizers — Mike Wright, also a senior, and Pranav Jandhyala, a sophomore — had invited both conservatives and liberals to speak. “Even if you don’t agree with him politically,” he said, Mr. Bannon “was one of the most influential figures in the 2016 election.” "
"Nancy Gibbs, the first woman to lead Time magazine, is stepping down as editor in chief, ending her four-year run at the publication’s helm. “It felt like it was time,” Ms. Gibbs, 57, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday night. “I’m now going to go do my next thing.” Ms. Gibbs, who joined Time in 1985 as a fact-checker and was named the magazine’s top editor in 2013, helped steer the nearly century-old magazine through a period of great transition for its parent company, Time Inc. Since the company spun off from Time Warner in 2014, it has brought on a new leadership team that has implemented an aggressive strategy to transform the print magazine publisher into a digital media company as it combats declining print advertising and circulation. This year, after fielding interest from potential suitors, the company said it had decided not to sell itself. Ms. Gibbs said that she had embraced the changes at Time Inc., whose stable of magazines also includes Sports Illustrated and People. “Change doesn’t scare me,” she said. “I know that our industry faces all kinds of uncertainty — I recognize that. But this is the golden age of storytelling, so if you’re not changing, you’re missing the opportunity.” Her decision comes on the heels of two other significant leadership announcements in the magazine industry. Last week, Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, announced he would step down in December after a 25-year run. And on Monday, Robbie Myers, the longtime editor of Elle, also said she was leaving her post. Ms. Gibbs said she would stay at Time Inc. through the end of the year as the editorial director of company’s news group, a position she has held since last year, and would help with the magazine’s transition. “Today marks the end of an era,” Rich Battista, the chief executive of Time Inc., and Alan Murray, the company’s chief content officer, said in a note to employees. “Nancy is one of a kind and cannot be replicated,” they added. “Nancy has built not only a remarkable legacy but also a remarkable news organization, and we are determined to maintain its power and relevance in the years ahead.” Time Inc. did not name a successor to Ms. Gibbs, but Mr. Battista and Mr. Murray said they planned to “move quickly” to appoint the magazine’s next top editor. The news that Ms. Gibbs was stepping down was first reported by Vanity Fair. During her 32 years at Time, Ms. Gibbs interviewed five presidents, including Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Donald J. Trump, and numerous other leaders. Though she said she did not know what she would do next, she said she was eager to return to writing. “There are a number of things I can imagine would be interesting to explore,” she said. "
"WASHINGTON — Hope Hicks, one of President Trump’s longest serving advisers working in the White House, was formally named communications director on Tuesday, a title that most accurately describes the role she has played for years. Ms. Hicks’ appointment was one of a handful announced. Mercedes Schlapp, a Republican strategist and former Fox News contributor, will become the senior adviser for strategic communications, adding a new senior staff member to the reshuffled communications team. It was not immediately clear how Ms. Schlapp’s role would intersect with that of Ms. Hicks and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. Jessica Ditto, another campaign hand who has been serving as deputy communications director, is expected to continue in that role. But Ms. Hicks, who is perhaps the most press-shy member of the Trump administration, has been essentially filling the role of Mr. Trump’s communications director since her days on his campaign, when she was one of the only staff members. Until she took over the communications director role in an interim capacity, she was almost constantly by the president’s side when he traveled, and she held sway over what interviews he gave. Outside of Mr. Trump’s family members and his longtime security chief, Keith Schiller, who will leave the White House in the next few weeks, Ms. Hicks is his most trusted aide. Other changes that were announced appeared aimed in part at sending a message of continuity to a communications team that has been buffeted by nearly constant change for the past month. Raj Shah, who worked at the Republican National Committee and was seen as close to the previous press secretary, Sean Spicer, was elevated to principal deputy press secretary. Steven Cheung, who worked on the Trump campaign, will be the director of strategic response. "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump welcomed Malaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak, to the White House on Tuesday, he thanked him for “all the investment you’ve made in the United States.” Mr. Trump did not single out Mr. Najib’s patronage of his hotel two blocks from the White House, but he could have: the Malaysian leader was spotted entering and exiting the Trump International Hotel, with his entourage, on Monday and Tuesday. The White House denied that Mr. Najib had picked the hotel at Mr. Trump’s behest. “We certainly don’t book their hotel accommodations,” the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “so I couldn’t speak to the personal decision they made about where to stay here in D.C.” Whatever the motivation, the choice of lodgings added to the awkwardness of a meeting already replete with ethical questions. Mr. Najib is under investigation by the Justice Department, part of a corruption scandal that critics said he has fended off by firing investigators and dismissing negative news reports about him as “fake news.” In these respects, he is not unlike Mr. Trump. So it was perhaps not a surprise that the two leaders skipped a news conference, kept their public remarks brief, and stayed on the safe ground of trade and counterterrorism. “We’re talking about trade – very large trade deals,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Najib, during a photo opportunity before they met in the Cabinet Room. “Malaysia is a massive investor in the United States in the form of stocks and bonds.” "
"WASHINGTON — A week after concerned Republicans promised quick work to shield young, undocumented immigrants from President Trump’s decision to end their federal protections, lawmakers have tied themselves in knots trying to figure out how to proceed — with only six months to find a way forward. If anything, advocates for immigrants brought to this country as children may have lost ground. Representative Mike Coffman, Republican of Colorado, pulled back a petition he had initiated to force the House to take up legislation to protect so-called Dreamers. A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into the issue was canceled this week. And Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he would not move on any such legislation before he addressed criminal alien gangs and border security. “With all the other things going on right now, it’s kind of put on the back burner,” Mr. Coffman conceded. When Mr. Trump announced last week that he would end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in six months, that time frame was supposed to light a fire under Congress. Instead, it may have hit the snooze button, Mr. Coffman said. “He could have done an immediate phase out,” he said. “That would really put pressure on Congress to put DACA right on the top of the agenda. But in giving Congress six months, with all the other things going on right now, the debt limit, the appropriations, tax reform, it’s not certainly on the top of the agenda right now.” Mr. Coffman, a top target for Democrats in next year’s midterm elections, had planned to circulate a “discharge petition” to force a vote on a three-year extension of DACA that he wrote with Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois. But he called off the action after Speaker Paul D. Ryan said he wanted a broader immigration measure that twinned enhanced border security measures with legalization for young immigrants. "
"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily allowed the Trump administration to stop some 24,000 refugees from entering the United States while the court considers broad challenges to the administration’s revised travel ban. The court’s brief order effectively reversed part of an appeals court ruling that had lifted the travel ban’s restrictions on the nation’s refugee program. There were no noted dissents. The appeals court had also rejected the administration’s efforts to bar travel to the United States from six predominantly Muslim countries by people with grandparents, uncles, aunts and other relatives here. The administration did not challenge that part of the appeals court’s ruling, and the Supreme Court did not address it. The court will hear arguments on the lawfulness of the travel ban on Oct. 10. Tuesday’s order was the latest in a series of interim measures interpreting statements in a June ruling in which the court agreed to hear the case. In the meantime, the court temporarily reinstated the travel ban — but only for people without “a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The meaning of that phrase has been contested ever since. The court did not specify which relatives qualified, for instance, but it did say that spouses and mothers-in-law “clearly” counted. “As for entities,” the court said, “the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading” the executive order. It gave examples: students admitted to American universities qualified, as did workers with job offers from American companies and lecturers invited to address American audiences. "
"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Stressed and exhausted families across the Southeast were assessing the damage from Hurricane Irma on Tuesday, even as flooding from the storm continued to plague some areas, like Jacksonville, and the worst of its wallop was being revealed in others, like the Florida Keys. Officials in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina tried to prepare residents for the hardships of recovery from the storm. Almost 4.4 million Florida homes and businesses remained without power on Tuesday evening, according to state officials, and there were widespread electricity problems in other states as well. At least 56 people have died as a result of the storm, including at least 13 in Florida, according to The Associated Press. Weakened now to a post-tropical cyclone, Irma moved toward the Ohio Valley and spread its clouds and rain over a vast area, while blue skies and sticky heat returned to Florida. The White House announced that President Trump, who twice visited Texas after Hurricane Harvey, will visit Florida on Thursday. Nursing homes and assisted-living facilities in areas without power struggled to keep residents cool and vital medical equipment operating with backup generators. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said on Tuesday that the state had shifted its attention to recovery and rebuilding efforts, while working to get water and food to those who needed it and to restore access to fuel. He said there were 30,000 people working to get the lights back on in the state, and that inspectors were checking the safety of bridges and sizing up repairs needed for sewage systems. "
"OTTAWA — A Canadian judge who wore a “Make America Great Again” cap into court the morning after Donald J. Trump’s election victory last year was suspended without pay and reprimanded by a disciplinary body on Tuesday. Disciplinary hearings against judges in Canada are rare. The decision about the conduct of the judge, Justice Bernd Zabel of the Ontario Court of Justice, was the first issued by the Ontario Judicial Council since 2014. The four-member council, which included a lay person and a lawyer, rejected Justice Zabel’s explanation that the campaign hat and comments he made about Mr. Trump in court were just jokes about an unexpected election result. But it also decided that removing him from the bench would be excessive, given his track record and the fact that he had apologized. “What would a reasonable member of the public think upon seeing Justice Zabel enter the courtroom wearing Trump’s signature red ‘MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN’ hat and state that he did so ‘in celebration of an historic event?’ ” the review body wrote. “In our view, and indeed as Justice Zabel himself now acknowledges, a reasonable member of the public would think that Justice Zabel was making a political statement and endorsing Donald Trump’s campaign.” Justice Zabel had already been suspended by the court since late last year, but with pay. Under the council’s ruling, the justice will now be suspended for an additional 30 days, without pay. The next most severe sanction would have been to remove him from the bench. Judges in Canada are not elected. Appointments to Justice Zabel’s court are made by a nonpartisan, 13-member committee. Judges are not allowed to donate to political parties or participate in any political activities. "
"WASHINGTON — Six Baltimore police officers will face no federal charges in the death of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old black man who died of a severe spinal cord injury while in custody, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday. “After an extensive review of this tragic event, conducted by career prosecutors and investigators, the Justice Department concluded that the evidence is insufficient,” the department said in a statement, adding that it was unable to prove the officers “willfully violated Gray’s civil rights.” The closure of the criminal civil rights investigation into Mr. Gray’s death, which prompted unrest in Baltimore, a predominantly black city, and a federal examination of its police department’s practices, means that no officers will be held criminally responsible in his death. Mr. Gray was arrested in April 2015 and charged with illegal possession of a switchblade after running from officers. Following his arrest, he rode in a police van — shackled but unsecured by a seatbelt, as required by police department regulations — and was found unresponsive. He died the following week. Six officers were charged by the Baltimore state’s attorney with crimes related to Mr. Gray’s death, including manslaughter and murder. All were cleared in those cases as well. “At no time did we ever believe that there was evidence that any of the officers violated anyone’s civil rights or were guilty of violating any federal laws,” Michael E. Davey, a lawyer for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said in a statement on Tuesday. "
"To the Editor: Re “For E.P.A. Chief, Discussing Climate After Storms Is ‘Insensitive’ ” (news article, Sept. 12): The aftermath of climate-change-fueled superstorms like Harvey and Irma is exactly the right time to talk about man-made global warming, contrary to Scott Pruitt’s whining that the discussion is “misplaced.” When the current administration is quickly and relentlessly reversing progress made in fighting climate change, silence is dangerous. There is a scientific consensus that climate change played a role in intensifying the winds and rainfall associated with Harvey and Irma, worsening their devastation. From disbanding a federal climate advisory committee to rolling back flood-protection rules, the Trump administration is putting us on track for deadlier hurricanes that we’ll be even less prepared to endure. Not connecting the dots between climate change and Harvey and Irma only benefits polluting industries and the politicians beholden to them. When people are losing their lives, loved ones, pets and homes, how can we sit back quietly and let more coastal communities become sitting ducks for the next devastating hurricane? JOHN FLEMING, LOS ANGELES The writer is a staff scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity. To the Editor: Re “Irma, and the Rise of Extreme Rain” (column, Sept. 12): Although David Leonhardt clearly explains the impact of climate change on rainfall, his prescription about what to do about it falls short. According to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, approximately 40 percent of the United States population lives in coastal communities, some of which will continue to experience severe flooding from extreme weather events. These include Houston, New Orleans and other densely populated low-lying communities. There is no escaping the inevitable rise in sea level and warmer water due to climate change — an obviously lethal combination. Although I grieve deeply for the millions of people who suffer from the recent storms, we need to stop encouraging people in flood plains to rebuild communities that will soon be underwater again. Government flood insurance, among other programs, creates a false sense of security and promotes living in highly vulnerable areas. There is only one solution — difficult to contemplate but necessary — to this accelerating problem: Start planning for the relocation of millions of people away from the most at-risk coastal areas and regions of frequent flooding. "
"The notice went out on Facebook last year, calling citizens of Twin Falls, Idaho, to an urgent meeting about the “huge upsurge of violence toward American citizens” by Muslim refugees who had settled there. The inflammatory post, however, originated not in Idaho but in Russia. The meeting’s sponsor, an anti-immigrant page called “Secured Borders,” was one of hundreds of fake Facebook accounts created by a Russian company with Kremlin ties to spread vitriolic messages on divisive issues. Facebook acknowledged last week that it had closed the accounts after linking them to advertisements costing $100,000 that were purchased in Russia’s influence campaign during and after the 2016 election. But the company declined to release or describe in detail the pages and profiles it had linked to Russia. A report by the Russian media outlet RBC last March, however, identified the Secured Borders page as the work of the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg firm that employs hundreds of so-called trolls to post material in support of Russian government policies. A Facebook official confirmed that Secured Borders was removed in the purge of Russian fakes. The Secured Borders page, a search for archived images shows, spent months posing as an American activist group and spreading provocative messages on Facebook calling immigrants “scum” and “freeloaders,” linking refugees to crime and praising President Trump’s tough line on immigration. The page attracted more than 133,000 followers before it was shut down. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering reducing the number of refugees admitted to the country over the next year to below 50,000, according to current and former government officials familiar with the discussions, the lowest number since at least 1980. President Trump promised during his 2016 campaign to deny admittance to refugees who posed a terrorist threat. In his first days in office he took steps to radically reduce the program that resettles refugees in American cities and towns, capping the number admitted at 50,000 as part of his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. That was less than half the 110,000 refugees President Barack Obama said should be admitted in 2016. But in recent weeks, as the deadline approached for Mr. Trump to issue the annual determination for refugee admissions required by the Refugee Act of 1980, some inside the White House — led by Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser for policy — have pressed to set the ceiling even lower. The issue has created an intense debate within the administration, with Mr. Miller and some officials at the Department of Homeland Security citing security concerns and limited resources as grounds for deeply cutting the number of admissions, and officials at the National Security Council, the State Department and the Department of Defense opposing a precipitous drop. No final decision has been made, according to the officials, but as the issue is being debated, the Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the administration to bar almost any refugees from entering the country while it considers challenges to the travel ban order. The court will hear arguments in the case next month. "
"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — The first patient was rushed into the emergency room of Memorial Regional Hospital around 3 a.m. on Wednesday, escaping a nursing home that had lost air-conditioning in the muggy days after Hurricane Irma splintered power lines across the state. Another arrived at 4 a.m. After a third rescue call, around 5 a.m., the hospital’s staff was concerned enough to walk down the street to check the building themselves. What they found was an oven. The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills needed to be evacuated immediately. Rescue units were hurrying its more than 100 residents out. Dozens of hospital workers established a command center outside, giving red wristbands to patients with critical, life-threatening conditions and yellow and green ones to those in better shape. Checking the nursing home room by room, the hospital staff found three people who were already dead and nearly 40 others who needed red wristbands, many of whom had trouble breathing. The workers rushed them to Memorial’s emergency room, where they were given oxygen. The rest went to other hospitals nearby. Four were so ill that they died soon after arriving. In the afternoon, the authorities learned that another had died early in the morning, and was initially uncounted because the person had been taken directly to a funeral home. In all, eight were dead. “We had no idea the extent of what was going on until we literally sent people room to room to check on people,” said Dr. Randy Katz, the hospital’s chairman of emergency medicine. "
"WASHINGTON — The federal government moved on Wednesday to wipe from its computer systems any software made by a prominent Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, that is being investigated by the F.B.I. for possible links to Russian security services. The concerns surrounding Kaspersky, whose software is sold throughout the United States, are longstanding. The F.B.I., aided by American spies, has for years been trying to determine whether Kaspersky’s senior executives are working with Russian military and intelligence, according to current and former American officials. The F.B.I. has also been investigating whether Kaspersky software, including its well-regarded antivirus programs, contain back doors that could allow Russian intelligence access into computers on which it is running. The company denies the allegations. The officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiries are classified, would not provide details of the information they have collected on Kaspersky. But on Wednesday, Elaine C. Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, ordered federal agencies to develop plans to remove Kaspersky software from government systems in the next 90 days. Wednesday’s announcement is the latest instance of the apparent disconnect between the Trump White House, which has often downplayed the threat of Russian interference to the country’s infrastructure, and front-line American law enforcement and intelligence officials, who are engaged in a perpetual shadow war against Moscow-directed operatives. Kaspersky’s business in the United States now appears to be the latest casualty in those spy wars. Best Buy, the electronics giant, announced last week that it was pulling Kaspersky Lab’s cybersecurity products from its shelves and website, and the Senate is voting this week on a defense-spending bill that would ban Kaspersky Lab products from being used by American government agencies, effectively codifying Wednesday’s directive into law. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump is doubling down this week on his bid to remake the tax code, meeting with Democrats, tying tax legislation to hurricane recovery and dispatching his economic team to Capitol Hill almost daily to prod lawmakers into action. But he is bringing to the game a relatively weak team — a chief economic adviser whom he has openly disparaged and a Treasury secretary whose counsel he has dismissed — and is promoting quick passage of a new tax code that has yet to be written as members of his party bicker over the details. The urgency was evident on Wednesday, as Mr. Trump urged Congress to “move fast,” and Republican leaders seemed ready. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told House Republicans that the administration and congressional Republicans would release a detailed framework of their plan during the week of Sept. 25, with the goal of taking up legislation in late October. But Republicans remain divided on key details: whether they can meet Mr. Trump’s demand for a 15 percent corporate tax rate; which small businesses and partnerships would qualify for a new low business tax rate; whether tax cuts in the package should be paid for by closing loopholes; and whether hedge fund and private equity managers would continue to see their huge fees taxed at the low rate of capital gains instead of at income tax rates. Democrats have said they will reject any package that they see as skewed toward the rich, especially if it repeals the estate tax, as the president wants. Then there is a tough interim step: Republicans must pass a budget resolution to unlock the procedural tool that would let them move a bill through the Senate with a simple majority. Congressional leaders are bracing for a fight over that budget blueprint. "
"Looking across the globe, it might appear at times that violence, chaos and fear are getting the upper hand over order, democracy and reason. The world has always been a messy place, of course, and it may be that the internet and social media give the worst of times more prominence than the best. But there are real reasons for anxiety. Traditional democratic ideals and institutions are under attack. Some leaders in Eastern Europe espouse “illiberal” democracy, which treads on traditional human rights. Authoritarian leaders from Russia to Venezuela grow stronger; Kim Jong-un of North Korea defies the world in his pursuit of a doomsday weapon. And the United States under Donald Trump becomes more bitterly divided and unpredictable. Historically, however, there has also been pushback, a rejection of oppression and despotism. It brought about the end of apartheid, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, the acceptance of more than a million refugees in Germany. Countries rarely embrace democracy as their first choice; they have often tried monarchies, oligarchies or other forms of coercive government first. They come to democracy because, for all its messiness and inefficiency, it is the way to give people a voice in how they’re governed, and to allow them to change leaders peacefully. But it can never be taken for granted. It is constantly confronting challenges and threats and adapting to changing times. Those challenges will be discussed at the five-day Athens Democracy Forum this week in Athens, Greece. Now in its fifth year, the conference, convened by The New York Times, will gather global leaders to talk about the state of the world. In advance of the conference, The Times solicited essays on some of the challenges facing nations today. "
"WASHINGTON — Nearly 16 years to the day after Congress first authorized a military response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Senate on Wednesday rejected an effort to repeal the virtual blank check that Congress granted to the president while smoke still rose from the rubble of the World Trade Center. The debate pitted the Republican Party’s ascendant isolationist wing, represented by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, against its old-line interventionists, led by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is pressing his vision of a muscular military even as he battles brain cancer. Mr. Paul pressed for the repeal vote, in a strange bedfellows alliance with Senator Tim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who was his party’s vice-presidential nominee last year. But the effort failed when senators voted 61 to 36 to set the measure aside, rather than include it in the annual defense policy bill that senators are considering this week. “What we have today is basically unlimited war — war anywhere, anytime, any place on the globe,” Mr. Paul told his colleagues in a speech Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor. “I don’t think anyone with an ounce of intellectual honesty believes these authorizations allow current wars we fight in seven countries.” Mr. Paul had proposed repealing the declaration in six months, to give lawmakers time to consider a new one. The issue has been around since 2015, when President Barack Obama asked Congress to replace the authorization of military force passed to battle Al Qaeda with a new one crafted specifically to take on the Islamic State. But so far Congress has balked, declining to take on the difficult issue even as lawmakers such as Mr. Kaine insist that the legislative branch should reclaim its constitutional duty to declare war. "
"WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders on Wednesday night declared that they had a deal with President Trump to quickly extend protections for young undocumented immigrants and to finalize a border security package that does not include the president’s proposed wall. The Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, said in a joint statement that they had a “very productive” dinner meeting with the president at the White House that focused on the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. “We agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that’s acceptable to both sides,” they said. But on Thursday morning, the president contradicted the Democrats, saying no deal had been struck. (Read that article.) In a statement on Wednesday night, the White House was far more muted, mentioning DACA as merely one of several issues that were discussed, including tax reform and infrastructure. It called the meeting, which came a week after the president struck a stunning spending-and-debt deal with the Democratic leaders, “a positive step toward the president’s strong commitment to bipartisan solutions.” But the bipartisan comity appeared to have its limits. In a tweet, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, disputed the Democrats’ characterization of Mr. Trump’s stance on the border wall. “While DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to,” she wrote. Mr. Schumer’s communications director, Matt House, fired back on Twitter: “The President made clear he would continue pushing the wall, just not as part of this agreement.” "
"MELBOURNE, Australia — It was a scene that plays out nearly every day in schoolyards across Australia: A couple, standing among a dozen other parents, waited for the final school bell to ring. On cue, Reid Duggan-Tierney, 7, came bounding out of school last Friday and ran toward Michael and Jarrad Duggan-Tierney — his fathers. The Duggan-Tierneys are one of around 6,800 Australian same-sex couples with a child. In many ways, their family represents the chasm that has emerged between the law and people’s lives. As the debate over same-sex marriage in this country becomes increasingly hostile, gay parents are balancing the daily routines of playtime and homework with activism. Australians will soon vote in a national postal survey, a nonbinding poll intended to help the government decide whether to press forward with legalizing same-sex marriage. Ballots were mailed this week, and activists on both sides of the issue have used the well-being of children to make their arguments. Last week, John Howard, a former prime minister, said legalizing gay marriage would hurt children. “I believe there is a conflict here between those seeking the right for same-sex marriage and the rights of the child, and I believe the right of the child to have a mother and father should be preserved,” he told The Weekend Australian. The Duggan-Tierneys may not have a soapbox as large as Mr. Howard’s, but they have over 59,000 followers on Instagram. From their account, @the_real_dads_of_melbourne, they document their lives as parents: playing at the park, shopping for groceries. "
"WASHINGTON — In one Senate office building, some of the leading lights of the Democratic Party gathered Wednesday to embrace what was once a proposal only of the far left: a huge expansion of Medicare, large enough to open the popular, government-run health program to all Americans. In another Senate office building, a smaller but equally adamant group of Republican senators stood together to take one last stab at dismantling the Affordable Care Act. They proposed instead to send each state a lump sum of federal money, along with sweeping new discretion over how to use it. Important elements in both parties are trying to move beyond President Barack Obama’s health care law, which has always been a complicated, politically difficult mix of government and private health insurance. But they are moving in radically different directions. The proposals appeared to have only one thing in common: Neither is likely to be enacted any time soon. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the onetime candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, proposed what he called “a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system,” and he said 16 Democratic senators supported it. Those included Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California — all names on the list of possible candidates for president in 2020. “Instead of wasting hundreds of billions of dollars trying to administer an enormously complicated system of hundreds of separate insurance plans, there would be one insurance plan for the American people with one single payer,” said Mr. Sanders, the ringmaster of an event that felt like a political rally, with banners and placards, consumers and patients, labor union members, nurses in red T-shirts and an audience full of fans who applauded, whooped and hollered.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Myanmar’s national leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, will not attend the upcoming U.N. General Assembly because of the crisis that has forced about 400,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in just weeks. International leaders and rights groups have denounced Myanmar for ethnic cleansing — some have called it genocide — and castigated her inaction. Here are the basics on the roots and history of the strife. Al Qaeda militants, meanwhile, urged Muslims around the world to support the Rohingya with aid, weapons and “military support.” _____ "
"President Trump on Wednesday blocked a China-backed investor from buying an American semiconductor maker over national security concerns, a rare move that could signal more aggressive scrutiny of China’s deal-making ambitions. The deal for Lattice Semiconductor has provided a test of the president’s economic and diplomatic relationship with China. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump reserved some of his harshest words for China, accusing the country of stealing jobs. In recent months, the president has turned more critical of Beijing, accusing it of failing to do more to restrain the nuclear ambitions of North Korea. Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who studies Chinese investment, said that the administration’s decision over Lattice was intended to send a political message. “We could let it die quietly,” he said, “but we’re going to kill it loudly.” The White House said on Wednesday that it prevented the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor, in part because the United States government relies on the company’s products. The integrity of the semiconductor industry, it said, was vital. The White House also raised concerns over the buyer’s close ties to Beijing. The investment group included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by state-backed entities, the White House said. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump is eager to put his conservative imprint on the federal judiciary, but an impediment remains. Though the Senate has virtually eliminated the ability of the minority party to block appointments to the bench from the Supreme Court on down, individual senators can still thwart nominees from their home states by refusing to sign off on a form popularly known for its color — the blue slip. Now, with some Democrats refusing to consent as the Trump administration moves to fill scores of judicial vacancies, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, is for the first time publicly advocating that the blue slip be made strictly advisory when it comes to appeals court nominees — the most powerful judges after those on the Supreme Court. “My personal view is that the blue slip, with regard to circuit court appointments, ought to simply be a notification of how you’re going to vote, not the opportunity to blackball,” Mr. McConnell said in an interview with The New York Times for “The New Washington” podcast. He said he favored retaining the blue slip authority for lower-level district court judges. With the conflict escalating, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, has requested a meeting with Mr. McConnell and the top Republican and Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee to dissuade Republicans from weakening the blue slip. “Getting rid of the blue slip would be a mistake,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview. He said he would argue to Mr. McConnell and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that since majority control of the Senate has been in flux in recent years, members of both parties should remember that they could find themselves back in the minority.

"ESPN, under intense pressure again in the hypercharged terrain of social media, elicited a rebuke from a White House official on Wednesday in response to a series of tweets posted by a “SportsCenter” host. Jemele Hill, who co-hosts the 6 p.m. “SportsCenter” program, called President Trump a white supremacist on Twitter on Monday, adding: “Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the comments were a “fireable offense.” “I think that’s one of the more outrageous comments that anyone can make,” Sanders said Wednesday during a press briefing, “and certainly something that I think is a fireable offense by ESPN.” ESPN, which like many news organizations has long wrestled with how to police employees’ social-media comments, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that Hill’s comments “do not represent the position of ESPN.” "
"When Russia created Facebook profiles of fake Americans to influence the 2016 American election, it could make up the names and biographical details. But it needed photos, too. Now a salesman in Brazil has stepped forward to say that his own family photos were stolen to concoct the profile of “Melvin Redick,” one of many American impostors involved in the spread of Russian propaganda on Facebook and Twitter. Last week, The New York Times featured Mr. Redick’s Facebook profile as an example of fake social media accounts that were used to attack Hillary Clinton, promote leaked emails obtained by Russian hackers and propagate the Kremlin’s political views. The supposed Mr. Redick was an early promoter last year of a website, DCLeaks.com, that American officials believe was created by Russian military intelligence. But The Times could find no American who fit the details he provided on Facebook. There was no such person in Harrisburg, Pa., where Mr. Redick said he lived. The high school and college he listed had never heard of him. And when The Times asked Facebook about him — as well as other profiles that appeared to be the work of Russians — the company concluded that they were impostors and removed them from the social network.

"WASHINGTON — Tim Scott, the lone black Republican in the Senate, delivered a pointed history lesson on America’s 300-year legacy of racism to President Trump on Wednesday in response to what he called Mr. Trump’s “sterile” response to the riots in Charlottesville, Va., last month. The president invited Mr. Scott, a conservative from South Carolina who had expressed disgust with Mr. Trump’s equivocal reaction to the white supremacist protests that left one woman dead, to the Oval Office for what Mr. Trump’s staff described as a demonstration of the president’s commitment to “positive race relations.” Both men described the interaction as positive and constructive, but Mr. Scott clearly had a point to make. When a reporter asked the senator after the meeting if the president had expressed regret, a pained look flashed on Mr. Scott’s face. He paused for a few seconds and replied, “He certainly tried to explain what he was trying to convey.” White House officials emailed reporters a photograph of Mr. Trump listening intently as Mr. Scott made a point, with both sitting in chairs often used for bilateral meetings with foreign leaders. The White House misidentified him as Tom Scott. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Scott made it clear he did not go to the White House for a photo op, but to decisively rebut Mr. Trump’s claim — to the president’s face — that “both sides,” racists and anti-racist protesters, were responsible for the violence that followed a torchlight protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. “My response was that, while that’s true, I mean I think if you look at it from a sterile perspective, there was an antagonist on the other side,” Mr. Scott said. "

"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will resume his role as the reassurer for American allies this week when he heads to Mexico, where he will try to mend relations after President Trump failed to quickly offer condolences for the earthquake on Friday that killed at least 96 people and severely damaged thousands of homes. Mr. Mattis will also try to signal to Mexican officials that ties between the United States and its southern flank remain strong. After four days without word from Mr. Trump about the 8.2-magnitude earthquake in Oaxaca State, Mexico on Monday rescinded its offer of aid to the United States for people affected by Hurricane Harvey. Mr. Trump had not responded to that offer of help — when it was made, he was tweeting that Mexico was one of the “highest crime nations in the world.” But Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas had said his state would accept the help. But the offer was withdrawn when Mexico’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that it needed the money to help care for victims of the earthquake, which was followed by Hurricane Katia. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had scheduled a call with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and that details of it would be shared with reporters. But as of Wednesday afternoon, the White House had not provided the promised readout of the conversation or confirmed whether it happened. “There are people here who say, ‘Why hasn’t he called? The Americans are deliberately slighting us,’” Duncan Wood, the director of the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City. “That’s one view, which is widely held. Some people feel aggrieved.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has imposed visa sanctions against four countries that have refused to take back citizens who were convicted of crimes in the United States and ordered deported, officials said on Wednesday. The Department of Homeland Security said it notified the State Department that the governments of Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone had denied or unreasonably delayed accepting the return of convicts. American diplomats in the countries were ordered to impose visa restrictions, officials said in a statement, but did not say what types of visas would be affected. “International law obligates each country to accept the return of its nationals ordered removed from the United States,” said Elaine Duke, the acting secretary of Homeland Security. “Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea, and Sierra Leone have failed in that responsibility.” Officials said the restrictions would remain in place until the countries cooperate. The issue has been a longstanding problem for officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency charged with deportations. They say other nations will often refuse to issue travel documents or delay providing them. In turn, agency officials said, they are forced to release criminals, including those who have committed assaults and murders, in the United States. A 2001 Supreme Court ruling barred the government from detaining immigrants indefinitely simply for lack of a country willing to take them. "
"It was the morning after a resounding primary victory for Mayor Bill de Blasio, the kind that political mandates are made of, and as luck would have it, the mayor of New York had a tailor-made moment to bask in the glow of electoral success. It was not to be. The political gods had conspired to place Mr. de Blasio on Roosevelt Island on Wednesday, in an uncomfortable white plastic chair in the front row at the opening ceremony of the Cornell Tech campus, alongside Michael R. Bloomberg, his billionaire predecessor, with whom Mr. de Blasio has had an uneasy relationship, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has been Mr. de Blasio’s near-constant tormentor. Speaker after speaker praised Mr. Bloomberg, who had conceived of the tech campus when he was mayor and put the project in motion. But it was Mr. Cuomo who damned the current mayor with not even the faintest of praise. “Mike Bloomberg had the formula: vision plus confidence plus achievement equals progress,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Mike’s formula was shared by my father Mario Cuomo, who called himself a pragmatic progressive. Think about it. A progressive who gets things done, and gets results.” The governor did not include Mr. de Blasio, who sees himself as a paragon of progressivism, in his commendations. In many ways, Mr. de Blasio has benefited from circumstance and luck. Since he entered City Hall in January 2014, the city’s economy has steadily expanded and crime numbers have continued to drop. He has avoided, by and large, major crises. "
"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin inquired about the use of a military plane for his European honeymoon last month, the Treasury Department confirmed on Wednesday, a disclosure that comes as he is already under scrutiny for taking a government plane to Kentucky before viewing the Aug. 21 solar eclipse. The Treasury Department said Mr. Mnuchin had asked about the military plane so that he would have access to secure communications when he was abroad. “It is imperative that he have access to secure communications, and it is our practice to consider a wide range of options to ensure he has these capabilities during his travel, including the possible use of military aircraft,” a Treasury spokesman said in a statement. According to the spokesman, Treasury officials withdrew the request after finding an alternative way to communicate about government matters securely. He noted that Mr. Mnuchin is a member of the National Security Council with responsibility for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. Mr. Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, a Scottish-born actress, were married in June. The revelation about the request, which was first disclosed by ABC News, quickly drew a backlash on social media, with critics accusing Mr. Mnuchin, a multimillionaire former hedge fund manager, of seeking to use taxpayer funds to finance his personal travel. It comes as Mr. Mnuchin is leading the Trump administration’s push to overhaul the tax code, which he has promised to make more fair for middle-class Americans. Mr. Mnuchin and Ms. Linton had already come under criticism for their trip last month to Kentucky, where they traveled together for a tax reform event. Ms. Linton created a firestorm when she mocked a woman who had criticized her on Instagram for promoting luxury brands while traveling to a poor part of the country. The couple did travel by government plane on that trip, and the Treasury Department’s inspector general is reviewing the flight and whether any ethical violations were made. Treasury officials traditionally fly on commercial aircraft except in extenuating circumstances, because government planes can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to operate. Some suggested Mr. Mnuchin made the trip to Fort Knox by government plane so that he would have optimal viewing of the solar eclipse that occurred that day. Richard Delmar, counsel to the inspector general, said in a statement, “We are looking at all requests for use of government aircraft.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A stunned look fell over the hot dog vendor’s face as a police officer, ticketing him for lacking a permit, reached into the man’s wallet and pulled out $60. The vendor and a passer-by recording the exchange protested. “That’s not right,” said the cameraman. “That’s how it works,” replied the officer, of U.C. Berkeley’s police department. And now, video of the encounter outside a Golden Bears football game Saturday has become a fixation of the internet outrage machine. Uploaded over the weekend, it’s been watched millions of times and prompted demands for the officer’s firing. It’s also reinvigorated a debate in California over civil forfeiture, which allows the authorities to seize cash and property from people suspected of wrongdoing. Last year, the practice brought the state’s law enforcement agencies more than $115 million, according to government figures. "
"In February, Sunayana Dumala lost her husband to a man who shouted “Get out of my country!” and unloaded a semiautomatic pistol in a Kansas bar. Ms. Dumala’s immigration status was tied to that of her husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, one of two Indian-born engineers shot that day. So along with dealing with the horror of his sudden death, she also had to face the fact that the man who shot him may have managed to put her at risk of deportation. Mr. Kuchibhotla was in the United States on an H-1B visa. Upon his death, Ms. Dumala’s residency status was terminated. And when she went to India to attend his funeral, she feared that she might not be able to re-enter the United States. It was also unclear whether she would want to. In an emotional Facebook post shortly after the shooting, she posed a question that she said “is in every immigrant’s mind: Do we belong here?” Her congressman, Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas’ third district, was “horrified” by the shooting, and pushed President Trump to condemn it in a joint address to Congress. Upon learning of Ms. Dumala’s immigration issues, he and his staff began looking at ways to assist her. “It would have been a real tragedy, on top of the initial tragedy she suffered, to attend her husband’s funeral in India and then be locked out of the U.S. because of it,” Mr. Yoder said in an interview on Wednesday. “This woman suffered enough. We need to fix this.” "
"Sean Spicer and Chelsea Manning are headed back to school. Sort of. Mr. Spicer, President Trump’s former White House press secretary, and Ms. Manning, a former United States soldier who served seven years in prison for leaking classified information, were named visiting fellows at the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday. Needless to say, their politics differ considerably. Mr. Spicer, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, objected when President Obama commuted Ms. Manning’s 35-year prison sentence in January. He called it “disappointing” and said ""it sends a very troubling message when it comes to the handling of classified information.” Ms. Manning does not appear to be too fond of Mr. Spicer, either. Her appointment drew criticism on Wednesday, and when Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor, said, “I think I’ll forego I.O.P. events this fall,” Ms. Manning replied: “Awesome! Can you ask Sean Spicer to do the same?” These two unlikely classmates can take comfort from the fact that being a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics is nothing like high school. They may not even come face to face. Visiting fellows travel to Harvard for what the school describes as “a limited yet comprehensive number of events” that “provide short-term engagement with the student community.” They do not need to worry about the tyranny of gym class or the complicated politics of cafeteria seating. That may be for the best because the list of fellows for the 2017-18 academic year reads like a who’s who of the flashing cable news chyrons and distressing tweet storms that have dominated America’s polarized politics in recent years.

"TOKYO — Pyongyang’s recent missile launch over Hokkaido and its underground nuclear test have laid bare Japan’s Achilles’ heel: Our country’s national security policy is still woefully ill equipped for this mounting danger. The new sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council on Monday will hardly limit Japan’s exposure. North Korea’s latest provocations pose an unprecedented threat. Even during the Korean War in the early 1950s, Japan, as a rear support base for United States forces, was somewhat insulated; today, it is in the same theater as South Korea, also on the front lines. Any American military strike against North Korea would likely trigger retaliatory measures against Japan. Japan is in a terrible predicament: Highly exposed but with very few options, military or diplomatic, to help itself. Its defense ministry plans to double, to eight, the number of ships equipped with the Aegis missile-defense system. But the new fleet won’t be operational before 2021. Even if Japan also acquires the land-based Aegis Ashore system, as it is contemplating doing, none of this additional capacity could offer it enough protection against North Korea’s increasingly lethal missiles — much less deter North Korea from further developing its own arsenal. This is one reason Itsunori Onodera, the new defense minister, has been making a case for developing Japan’s offensive capabilities, so that it could strike military bases in North Korea, perhaps even preemptively. But such a move faces numerous obstacles — financial, tactical and strategic. No budget decision for such capabilities is expected to even be made until at least late 2018. Acquiring offensive weaponry would require redefining the terms of Japan’s existing security agreement with the United States, which relegates Japan to a purely defensive role and places all responsibility for any offensive action solely with America.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. To paraphrase Ronald Reagan: There they go again. On Wednesday, a group of Republican senators plan to release a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It comes from Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and they will market it as a bill that gives states the flexibility to create the system that they want. But that’s deeply misleading. While it would theoretically give states more flexibility, the bill would mostly rob states of money to pay for health insurance — and millions of Americans would lose coverage as a result. Think of it this way: Every reader of this newsletter has the theoretical flexibility to buy a private jet. Cassidy-Graham, as the bill is known, ends up looking remarkably similar to previous repeal attempts. It would likely result in 15 million Americans losing their insurance next year and more than 30 million losing it a decade from now (based on analyses of an early version of the bill, which was similar to previous Republican health bills). “The similarities are more striking than the differences,” Aviva Aron-Dine of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told me. Right now, the bill looks unlikely to pass, because several Republicans, including Rand Paul, sound unenthusiastic, and it faces a Sept. 30 deadline, as a result of Senate rules. But I still take the bill seriously. President Trump supports it, as apparently do many Senate Republicans. "
"Alarmed that President Trump may soon take steps that could unravel the international nuclear agreement with Iran, more than 80 disarmament experts urged him on Wednesday to reconsider and said the accord was working. In a joint statement, the experts said the 2015 agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration and the governments of Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, was a “net plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts.” Because of the monitoring powers contained in the agreement, they said, Iran’s capability to produce nuclear weapons has been sharply reduced. They also said the agreement made it “very likely that any possible future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a clandestine program, would be detected promptly.” Mr. Trump has repeatedly assailed the agreement — a signature achievement of his predecessor — describing it as “a terrible deal” and a giveaway to Iran. He also has said that he believes Iran is violating the accord, an assertion that has been contradicted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitor that polices Iran’s compliance. The accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, severely limited Iran’s nuclear activities in return for ending or easing many sanctions that were hurting the Iranian economy. "

"President Trump clearly inherited an economy on the upswing, according to the 2016 Census report, with income, health coverage and poverty levels having all improved in the past two years. The question is whether his administration and the Republican-controlled Congress will sustain the momentum, or even reverse it. The Census report, released on Tuesday, showed median income, adjusted for inflation, grew by 3.2 percent from 2015 to 2016, to $59,039, as employers added jobs and hours and even, in some cases, gave raises. At the same time, the poverty rate decreased by 0.8 percentage points, or 2.5 million people, to 12.7 percent. Both measures are now at or near their prerecession levels in 2007, a hard-fought recovery. On health care, the data show that the ranks of the uninsured fell last year by 900,000 people, to an all-time low of 8.8 percent of the population. The decline is a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The 32 states and District of Columbia that participate in the A.C.A.’s expansion of Medicaid for low-income families had larger declines in their uninsured populations than states that do not participate. Massachusetts, for example, a pioneer in broad coverage, has the lowest uninsured rate in the nation, 2.5 percent, while Texas, which rejected Medicaid expansion, has the highest, 16.6 percent. The data also show the success of federal safety-net programs. If not for tax credits for low-income workers, an additional 8.2 million people would have been classified as poor last year. Similarly, food stamps and low-income housing aid lifted 3.6 million and 3.1 million people, respectively, out of poverty last year. "
"America faces two serious national security threats today that look wildly different but have one core feature in common — they both have a low probability of happening, but, if they did happen, they could have devastating consequences for our whole country and the world. One of these threats is called North Korea. If the reckless leader of North Korea is able to launch an arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles that strike the U.S. mainland, the impact on America will be incalculable. And even though the odds of that happening are low — it would be an act of suicide by the North Korean dynasty — President Trump is ready to spend billions on antimissile systems, warships, cyberdefenses, air power and war games to defuse and deter this North Korean threat. And if we prepare for a North Korean nuclear attack and it never happens, we will be left with some improved weaponry that we might be able to use in other theaters, like fighter jets, ships and missiles — but nothing particularly productive for our economy or job creation. The other low-probability, high-impact threat is climate change fueled by increased human-caused carbon emissions. The truth is, if you simply trace the steady increase in costly extreme weather events — wildfires, floods, droughts and climate-related human migrations — the odds of human-driven global warming having a devastating impact on our planet are not low probability but high probability. But let’s assume for a minute that because climate change is a complex process — which we do not fully understand — climate change is a low-probability, high-impact event just like a North Korean nuclear strike. What is the Trump team doing when confronted with this similar threat? "
"The range of problems facing the United States abroad is daunting: a volatile Middle East, an unpredictable, mischievous Russia, a truly menacing North Korea. To say nothing of destabilizing global challenges like the mass migration of desperate refugees, and climate change. President Trump’s “America First” approach, which calls for disengagement from old alliances and responsibilities, is a dodge, not an answer. What’s needed is a robust foreign policy led by a reinvigorated State Department that right now is suffering from presidential neglect, poor leadership and an absence of professional firepower in pivotal positions. Two people who understand the urgency of helping the department recover from the damages inflicted by Mr. Trump are Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Leading members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, they have sought to rally their colleagues around a bipartisan spending bill for 2018 that would strengthen the department and replenish important foreign aid programs. Last week, the two won  unanimous committee approval for a $51 billion bill for the State Department and foreign aid, about $11 billion more than the administration requested. While the total is less than what Congress allocated for 2017, and less than necessary given the international challenges, it’s nowhere near the 30 percent cut that Mr. Trump; his budget chief, Mick Mulvaney; and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had absurdly insisted was imperative. As interesting as the bipartisan vote was the Republican-led committee’s report, which pulled no punches in blistering Mr. Trump and his aides for proposing a budget in May that amounted to an “apparent doctrine of retreat” from the world. “The lessons learned since September 11, 2001, include the reality that defense alone does not provide for American strength and resolve abroad,” the report said. “Battlefield technology and firepower cannot replace diplomacy and development.” That argument strikes at the heart of Mr. Trump’s approach, which favors warlike rhetoric and a reliance on the Pentagon as the primary levers of American power, while negotiation and diplomacy are given short shrift. At more than $600 billion annually, the military budget accounts for almost 19 percent of the federal budget, and Mr. Trump would add billions more for additional Navy ships and nuclear weapons. The State Department and its foreign aid programs account for 1 percent of the overall budget. "
"Last week Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, announced that the Trump White House would be revising the Obama administration guidelines for how colleges and universities adjudicate accusations of sexual assault. There were protests outside her speech and spittle-flecked rants on Twitter, but overall the reaction felt relatively muted, at least by the standards of reactions to anything Trump-related or DeVos-driven. Perhaps this was because enough people read The Atlantic, which chose last week to run a three-part series by Emily Yoffe on the sexual-assault policies in question. The series demonstrated exhaustively what anyone paying close attention already knew: The legal and administrative response to campus rape over the past five years has been a kind of judicial and bureaucratic madness, a cautionary tale about how swiftly moral outrage and political pressure can lead to kangaroo courts and star chambers, in which bias and bad science create an unshakable presumption of guilt for the accused. It’s also a cautionary tale with specific implications for cultural liberalism, because it demonstrates how easily an ideology founded on the pursuit of perfect personal freedom can end up generating a new kind of police state, how quickly the rule of pleasure gives way to the rule of secret tribunals and Title IX administrators (of which Harvard, Yoffe notes in passing, now has 55 on staff), and how making libertinism safe for consenting semi-adults requires the evacuation of due process. Rape and sexual assault are age-old problems. But the particular problem on college campuses these days is a relatively new one. For ideological reasons, the modern liberal campus rejects all the old ways in which a large population of hormonal young people once would have had their impulses channeled and restrained — single-sex dorms, “parietal” rules for male-female contact late at night, a general code emphasizing sexual restraint. Meanwhile for commercial reasons as well as liberationist ones, many colleges compete for students (especially the well-heeled, full-tuition-paying sort) by winkingly promising them not just a lack of adult supervision but a culture of constant partying, an outright bacchanal.

"In 1918 the Peruvian poet César Vallejo completed the collection of poems “Los Heraldos Negros,” known in English as “The Black Riders,” “The Black Messengers” or “The Black Heralds,” depending on the translator. “There are blows in life so powerful, I can’t answer” is a literal translation of the first line of the title poem. In the original Spanish, the line is “Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes. … Yo no sé.” As with the title, there has been some disagreement around how to translate “yo no sé.” “I don’t know,” “I can’t say” and “I can’t answer” are just three possibilities. Each translator has to confront Vallejo’s lacunas for the ungraspable experience of having to bear unbearable acts of power. I’ve thought about this poem often over the past year as I have encountered many who feel they, too, cannot translate the horror of what is happening in America. They are shocked, and they are speechless. They don’t have the words; they can’t say; they can’t answer. How could this happen? Their disbelief is followed by “We won’t go back.” “History is not the past,” James Baldwin said. “It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history.” These are words that should be repeated every day. The horror we seem to only now be noticing is an effect of our country’s longstanding commitment to white supremacy. But I am unclear about when we ever lived without its effects. Was there ever a moment when the persecution of nonwhite Americans wasn’t the norm? As is so often the case, I wondered what I wasn’t seeing. Didn’t America elect a presidential candidate with white-nationalist sympathies? The same man who appeared reluctant to denounce a former grand wizard of the K.K.K. when that man supported him? Yet for many people, it was the alt-right’s march in Charlottesville and President Donald Trump’s initial refusal to condemn those marchers that became the truly untranslatable moment. This confused me. I reached out to a friend, the theorist Lauren Berlant, to ask whether I was misunderstanding what I felt to be an everyday kind of condition, even as others described it as unnamable terror. The K.K.K., white supremacists and the alt-right were being referred to as if they beamed down into our democracy, I said to Lauren. She replied that certain groups are now considered the source of white supremacy rather than its amplification. It’s true that our president’s refusal to become “presidential,” as the pundits are fond of saying, is amplifying what is, but what is — whatever the tweets, whatever his state of mind, whatever his ultimate agenda — remains what was. Some Americans want to believe that unconscionable behavior — like marching in the name of racial hatred or plowing a car into a crowd of civilians — is an ungraspable blow to all Americans. But there’s nothing new about any of this. Heather Heyer was killed in an action meant to express the violent intent and threat of the messengers walking the streets of Charlottesville with lit tiki torches in hand — much like lynchings across our history. Attempts to whitewash white supremacy have been the de facto policy in this country. Do we really need to go over the history? It feels as if we do. Americans, of all races, have accepted the erasure of our history and the muddying of events. But if our executive branch has no interest in distancing itself from white supremacy, it could be because our government has been in support of a similar white-nationalist agenda since before the K.K.K.’s formation, in 1865. Even as former Confederate soldiers terrorized newly freed African-Americans, the Black Codes were passed. These laws, which did everything from restricting the jobs black people could hold to limiting where they could live, structurally and institutionally supported the K.K.K.’s efforts to cripple African-Americans attempts to just live. White supremacists reinstated themselves in American life, expanding from the South to the Midwest and then on to the West; by 1925 the Klan had as many as four million members, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and, in some states, “considerable political power.” In “The History of White People,” Nell Irvin Painter notes that “in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 police and sheriff’s deputies joined Klansmen in a pogrom against African-Americans, destroying homes, businesses and lives in an attack hardly mourned as an assault on Americans.” What was once known as “Black Wall Street” was erased from the landscape after bombings from the air and people being machine-gunned down in the streets. Later, Jim Crow laws only reinforced the agenda of the earlier Black Codes. And when those laws were struck down, each administration in the second half of the 20th century (including Bill Clinton’s) bolstered a false equivalence among drugs, criminality and blackness that reinstated a Jim Crow agenda through mass incarceration. The terror against people of color, especially African- and Native Americans, has always centralized whiteness in defense of itself in its persecution of the other. "

"The Trump administration and the sheriff in Portland, Ore., agree on this much: The crimes were hideous and preventable. But they are fiercely blaming each other for allowing them to happen. The case has stirred up a tempest because the man accused of crawling through the bedroom window of a 65-year-old woman, tying her up and raping her is an illegal immigrant, Sergio Jose Martinez, who has been deported to Mexico 20 times and has been arrested 10 times this year. Under political fire for releasing Mr. Martinez after his most recent stint in jail, the sheriff declared that President Trump’s immigration agency was at fault for failing to provide a legal basis for holding him longer, while the White House blamed the sheriff for letting him go. Cases like that of Mr. Martinez around the country are inciting outrage, amplified by an administration that is eager to expel undocumented immigrants. In a recent speech in Miami that made national headlines, Attorney General Jeff Sessions described the case and several others like it in graphic detail, and said that releasing potentially deportable immigrants like Mr. Martinez when their jail terms were over does “far broader damage to the country than many understand.” “At its root,” he added, “it is a rejection of our immigration laws.” The political jockeying is rooted in a vexing constitutional disconnect between criminal justice and immigration enforcement, which is a matter of civil, not criminal, law. Questions about the legality of trying to connect the two may become one of the most significant legal challenges to the Trump administration’s immigration policy, experts say. "
"O
ne morning in January 2016, Martin Steltner showed up at his office in the state courthouse building in western Berlin. Steltner, who has served for more than a dozen years as the spokesman for the Berlin state prosecutor, resembles a detective out of classic crime fiction: crisp suit, wavy gray hair and a gallows humor that comes with having seen it all. There was the 2009 case of the therapist who mistakenly killed two patients in an Ecstasy-infused session gone wrong. The Great Poker Heist of 2010, in which masked men stormed a celebrity-studded poker tournament with machetes and made off with a quarter-million dollars. The 2012 episode involving the Canadian porn star who killed and ate his boyfriend and then sent the leftovers home in the mail. Steltner embraced the oddball aspect of his job; he kept a picture of Elvis Presley on the wall of his office. But even Steltner found the phone calls he received that morning confounding. They came from police officers from towns far outside Berlin, who reported that protests were erupting, seemingly out of nowhere, on their streets. “They are demonstrating — ‘Save our children,’ ‘No attacks from immigrants on our children’ and some things like that,” Steltner told me when I met him in Berlin recently. The police were calling Steltner because this was ostensibly his office’s fault. The protesters were angry over the Berlin prosecutor’s supposed refusal to indict three Arab migrants who, they said, raped a 13-year-old girl from Berlin’s tight-knit Russian-German community. Steltner, who would certainly have been informed if such a case had come up for prosecution, had heard nothing of it. He called the Berlin Police Department, which informed him that a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had indeed gone missing a week before. When she resurfaced a day later, she told her parents that three “Southern-looking men” — by which she meant Arab migrants — had yanked her off the street and taken her to a rundown apartment, where they beat and raped her. But when the police interviewed the girl, whose name was Lisa, she changed her story. She had left home, it turned out, because she had gotten in trouble at school. Afraid of how her parents would react, she went to stay with a 19-year-old male friend. The kidnapping and gang rape, she admitted, never happened. By then, however, the girl’s initial story was taking on a life of its own within the Russian-German community through word of mouth and Facebook — enough so that the police felt compelled to put out a statement debunking it. Then, over the weekend, Channel One, a Russian state-controlled news station with a large following among Russian-Germans, who watch it on YouTube and its website, ran a report presenting Lisa’s story as an example of the unchecked dangers Middle Eastern refugees posed to German citizens. Angela Merkel, it strongly implied, was refusing to address these threats, even as she opened German borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. “According to Lisa’s parents,” the Channel One reporter said, “the police simply refuse to look for criminals.” "

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have revealed some encouraging news: The U.S. appears to be improving its response to disasters. For all the suffering and damage, the storms were less deadly than had been feared, with about 85 killed in Texas and Florida.

On Thursday, President Trump will visit Florida, where millions remain without electricity. We look at why it could take weeks to restore power. The Keys were hit particularly hard.

"Toshiba’s monthslong effort to sell its memory chip business may finally be nearing an end. The Japanese conglomerate said on Wednesday that it had signed a memorandum to accelerate talks to sell its memory chip unit to a group led by Bain Capital. The group, which also includes Apple, Seagate Technology and Dell, bid more than $18 billion for the chip business, The Wall Street Journal reported. A goal, Toshiba says, is to sign a contract this month, but other bidders are still not excluded from talks (Toshiba had also been in discussions with bidders led by the American company Western Digital and Foxconn of Taiwan). The company has been trying to unload its chip business as part of efforts to strengthen its balance sheet after huge losses at Westinghouse, its American nuclear unit, which filed for bankruptcy in March. Efforts to repeal the estate tax and to introduce deductions for state and local levies will face a fight. Senate Democrats have said they would try to block any rewrite of the tax code that included these measures, arguing that they would make a mockery of Republican promises to provide relief for the middle class.

"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has resumed work at its underground nuclear testing site, defense analysts said, as the country vowed to keep expanding its nuclear arsenal despite the latest United Nations sanctions. The defense analysts also said that the North’s Sept. 3 nuclear test, which Pyongyang said was of a hydrogen bomb, may have been much more powerful than previously estimated. In its first official reaction to the sanctions resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that the sanctions would only strengthen the country’s resolve to pursue its nuclear weapons program “at a faster pace without the slightest diversion.” The sanctions resolution, adopted in response to the nuclear test this month, was the ninth passed by the Security Council since North Korea’s first such test in 2006. If enforced, it would deprive North Korea of 30 percent of its annual fuel imports. It also bans imports of textiles from North Korea, stripping the country of another key source of hard currency. But the North, already heavily sanctioned, remained defiant on Wednesday, saying that it would “redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and right to existence” and establish “practical equilibrium with the U.S.” "
"THE WORLD OF TOMORROW
By Brendan Mathews
560 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $28 Brendan Mathews’s first novel, “The World of Tomorrow,” is admirably fearless, daring to tread territory staked by no less than E.L. Doctorow’s finest work, the 1985 novel-cum-memoir “World’s Fair.” Mathews’s is a long book, full of back story and digression, which is no knock on it per se; for what is a good novel — or a good life — but a long series of digressions? Unfortunately, Mathews’s work also demonstrates another truism about a novel, which is that writing one is like setting off into a trackless wood. The slightest misreading of your compass can leave you lost in the trees, many miles from where you wanted to go. With commendable ambition, Mathews attempts to combine a serious story with a great lark. “The World of Tomorrow” starts with Francis Dempsey, a redheaded rogue of an Irishman faking his way across the Atlantic in first class as a Scottish lord. It is the summer of 1939, and Francis has recently escaped from a Dublin prison — where he was serving hard time for selling French postcards and pornographic books like “Ulysses” — after he was allowed, under guard, to attend the funeral for his enigmatic schoolteacher father. There, he and his younger brother, Michael (enduring his own incarceration of sorts in a Catholic seminary), are abruptly sprung by a mob of their dad’s old I.R.A. pals, whom they never knew existed. A wild ride ensues across the Irish countryside, to a safe house that turns out to be not so safe. Francis accidentally detonates the explosives inside, leaving him with a small fortune in stolen funds, an addled and deafened Michael and several inconvenient bodies to put as far behind them as possible. Francis — now “Angus” — decides to light out for the States under what he calls “the First-Class Plan,” audaciously traveling in as posh a manner as possible. He appropriates the title of a highland lord from “Macbeth” and explains that he is taking the muddled Michael — now “Malcolm” — to see if a specialist in New York can do anything about his brother’s awful fox-hunting accident. So far, so good. But everything bogs down once the brothers reach Amerikay. Francis’ ostensible goal is finding their older brother Martin, now a jazzman living with his family in the Bronx. They are able to reach him, all right, but for various reasons Francis continues with the First-Class Plan, setting himself and Michael up in a vast suite in the Plaza Hotel. Francis/Angus is still pitching woo to a naïve, comely heiress he flirted with aboard ship, but whom he may now really love, because she is so magnificent a violinist that her playing moves him to tears (beauty and wealth apparently not being what they once were in the old romance department). Then Tommy Cronin, a hard man from the I.R.A., is sent by a mobster chieftain named Gavigan. Francis lets blab about his heiress connection — including his promise to her family that he will introduce them to his “cousin,” the queen of England, when they visit “The World of Tomorrow,” the world’s fair recently opened in Queens. Gavigan decides this is an excellent opportunity to have Francis go all Gavrilo Princip on their Britannic majesties and shoot the king dead. He threatens to execute every Dempsey extant if Francis refuses, and has Cronin put him through a crash course on regicide. "
"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn’t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington’s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran’s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East. President Trump — who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal — has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran’s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal’s collapse. But there seems to be little evidence that Iran is actually cheating in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting loopholes in the deal and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal’s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be ignoring injunctions on missile launches levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself. None of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn’t wrong when he says it’s a “bad deal.” It’s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it’s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States’ tools for trying to keep it in check — in particular, sanctions — are limited. "
"Many Americans, and the American government itself, have expressed shock at the treatment of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The Trump administration has also said it is concerned about persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East. For his part, the president has said he wants to defend the rights of the Castro regime’s opponents in Cuba. Yet all these protestations will be for nothing if, as the deadline approaches for the White House to make its determination about the number of refugees to be admitted next year, the administration decides to decimate the United States refugee resettlement program. At stake are not just the lives of tens of thousands of victims of war and persecution who dream of starting a new life in America; at risk also are American values, the United States’ reputation and American interests around the world. Every year, the president decides a refugee admission number. Since the 1980 Refugee Act, the average annual admissions ceiling under both Republican and Democratic presidents has exceeded 95,000. For the fiscal year 2017, President Barack Obama decided the number should be 110,000, against the backdrop of a global refugee population that numbers some 22.5 million. President Trump’s two “travel ban” executive orders already intended to cut the 2017 number by more than 50 percent. Now a decision is expected on the number for fiscal year 2018. Inside the administration, there is a debate between fact and fiction. The facts are that the vetting for entry to the United States as a refugee is tougher than for any other means of arrival. Not one of the three million refugees to the United States since 1980 has committed a lethal act of terror on American soil. The Cato Institute has calculated that a United States resident has a 1 in 3.64 billion chance of being killed by a refugee. Meanwhile, some 60,000 Iraqis who have supported the American military and diplomatic effort in Iraq — as, for example, interpreters — are waiting to know if the promise of safe passage to the United States is to be honored. "
"WASHINGTON — Shortly after learning in May that a special counsel had been appointed to investigate links between his campaign associates and Russia, President Trump berated Attorney General Jeff Sessions in an Oval Office meeting and said he should resign, according to current and former administration officials and others briefed on the matter. The president attributed the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to Mr. Sessions’s decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s Russia investigation — a move Mr. Trump believes was the moment his administration effectively lost control over the inquiry. Accusing Mr. Sessions of “disloyalty,” Mr. Trump unleashed a string of insults on his attorney general. Ashen and emotional, Mr. Sessions told the president he would quit and sent a resignation letter to the White House, according to four people who were told details of the meeting. Mr. Sessions would later tell associates that the demeaning way the president addressed him was the most humiliating experience in decades of public life. The Oval Office meeting, details of which have not previously been reported, shows the intensity of Mr. Trump’s emotions as the Russia investigation gained steam and how he appeared to immediately see Mr. Mueller’s appointment as a looming problem for his administration. It also illustrates the depth of antipathy Mr. Trump has had for Mr. Sessions — one of his earliest campaign supporters — and how the president interprets “disloyalty” within his circle of advisers. Mr. Trump ended up rejecting Mr. Sessions’s May resignation letter after senior members of his administration argued that dismissing the attorney general would only create more problems for a president who had already fired an F.B.I. director and a national security adviser. Mr. Trump once again, in July, told aides he wanted to remove Mr. Sessions, but for a second time didn’t take action. The relationship between the two men has improved marginally since midsummer, as Mr. Sessions has made a public display of hunting for the leakers among the administration’s national security officials. His allies said that despite the humiliation, the attorney general has stayed in the job because he sees a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity as the nation’s top law enforcement official to toughen the country’s immigration policies.

"TOKYO — Forty-one years ago, Antonio Inoki, one of Japan’s most popular professional wrestlers, faced off against Muhammad Ali in a bout that critics called a farcical publicity stunt. Last week, some commentators leveled similar criticism at Mr. Inoki, now a 74-year-old member of Japan’s Parliament, as he returned from North Korea, where he said he had visited a zoo, sipped ginseng wine and discussed nuclear diplomacy with high-ranking officials. “He told me Pyongyang will continue its nuclear testing and take it to a higher level unless the global community, especially the U.S., stops applying pressure,” Mr. Inoki told reporters at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, referring to Ri Su-yong, a vice chairman of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Though Mr. Inoki — a flamboyant ex-athlete with a taste for self-promotion — has been in politics for decades, in some ways he is Japan’s equivalent of Dennis Rodman, the former N.B.A. star who has made numerous visits to North Korea. It is a sign of North Korea’s international isolation — and the limited avenues available to understand it, much less influence it — that Mr. Inoki and Mr. Rodman are among the world’s few links to the leadership of Pyongyang’s opaque, authoritarian state. Mr. Inoki’s five-day trip to North Korea this month was his 32nd since 1995, when he participated in a wrestling match in Pyongyang. In an interview in his Parliament offices, Mr. Inoki — sitting near a life-size cutout of himself with a raised fist, an image soon to be used in advertising for Toyota — said his ultimate goal was “to establish peace through sports diplomacy.” "

"Mikhail Gorbachev was one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century, and William Taubman’s new biography of him is essential reading for the 21st, as we trace the arc from the fall of the Soviet Union to the rise of Putin’s Russia. Kurt Andersen digs up the roots of alternative facts in American culture (hint: it starts with the Pilgrims) in “Fantasyland”; and Ben Blum investigates a cousin’s inexplicable crime in “Ranger Games.” In fiction, new works by the acclaimed novelists Jesmyn Ward and Claire Messud encompass themes of childhood and loss. And Margaret Wilkerson Sexton makes a luminous debut with her novel set in New Orleans, “A Kind of Freedom.” Radhika Jones
Editorial Director, Books RANGER GAMES: A Story of Soldiers, Family and an Inexplicable Crime, by Ben Blum. (Doubleday, $28.95.) On Aug. 7, 2006, Ben Blum’s cousin Alex, an Army Ranger, drove four fellow soldiers to a bank, which they robbed by gunpoint. When Alex was arrested, he insisted the robbery was simply an elaborate Ranger training exercise. Was it? Our critic Jennifer Senior says “Ranger Games” is “a memorable, novelistic account” about the unlikely bond between two very different cousins, as well as a “fascinating tutorial on the psychology of modern warfare and social coercion.” SING, UNBURIED, SING, by Jesmyn Ward. (Scribner, $26.) Our critic Parul Sehgal writes that Jesmyn Ward’s books “reach for the sweep, force and sense of inevitability of the Greek myths, but as translated to the small, mostly poor, mostly black town in Mississippi where she grew up and where she still lives.” Ward’s latest novel, which carries echoes of Faulkner and of Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” is both timeless and perfectly poised for the moment. It combines aspects of the American road novel and the ghost story with an exploration of the long aftershocks of a hurricane and the opioid epidemic devouring rural America. FANTASYLAND: How America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History, by Kurt Andersen. (Random House, $30.) This romp through American history, from Anne Hutchinson to Donald Trump, contains a powerful message: For centuries the country has nurtured a “promiscuous devotion to the untrue.” Andersen, a host of public radio’s Studio 360, a best-selling novelist and a cultural omnivore, explores the deep roots of American unreason in all its seductive forms. CAREERS FOR WOMEN, by Joanna Scott. (Little, Brown, $26.) This novel’s craftily arranged narrative involves plot twists, publicists and real estate in midcentury New York City. Scott borrows the best aspects of crime fiction (pacing, stakes, excitement) and avoids its worst (gore, stilted dialogue, clumsy foreshadowing). Look for walk-on roles by the urban activist Jane Jacobs, former mayor John Lindsay and the high-wire artist Philippe Petit. BLACK DETROIT: A People’s History of Self-Determination, by Herb Boyd. (Amistad/HarperCollins, $27.99.) In 29 chapters, spanning more than three centuries, Boyd celebrates the black men and women of Detroit who would otherwise remain on history’s margins. We meet breakthrough figures ranging from Detroit’s first black congressman to Michigan’s first African-American obstetrician to the country’s first black auto dealer. There are a lot of reasons to despair about the city’s future. But Boyd remains hopeful, and his song of praise emphasizes Detroiters’ values of optimism and resolve. "
"Public servants are supposed to serve the public, not themselves. What part of that equation does Steven Mnuchin not understand? The Trump administration’s Treasury secretary is in hot water again. On Wednesday, ABC News reported that the Treasury Department’s inspector general’s office was looking at his request that a government jet fly him and his new wife on their European honeymoon. The jet costs taxpayers roughly $25,000 an hour to operate. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, is worth more than $300 million. A Treasury spokesman said Mr. Mnuchin made the request, later withdrawn, because he needed the jet’s “secure communications.” Since Mr. Mnuchin is fifth in line of succession should anything happen to the president, this excuse was at least a tad more credible than the one offered for a ride he took with his wife, Louise Linton, last month that is also under official review. That trip was to Kentucky, where the couple could view the solar eclipse in the path of totality. The justification then was that Mr. Mnuchin wanted to speak with Kentuckians about tax reform and he needed to check on the gold at Fort Knox, which is presumably as safe and sound after Mr. Mnuchin’s inspection as it was when he got there. Taxpayers, who are being reimbursed for Ms. Linton’s travel, may never have known about that junket had she not decided to use a photo of herself alighting from the plane to show off her Hermes, Valentino and Tom Ford ensemble on Instagram. She then savaged a woman from Oregon who dared call the move “#deplorable.” As the clothes designers began distancing themselves, Ms. Linton apologized to America — in an interview with a Washington society magazine that ran a photo of her, in a ball gown, on the cover. Mr. Mnuchin comes from a world where rich people get free stuff all the time. Now he is in a different world, one where taxpayers are on the hook. “We’re starting to see a pattern with Steve Mnuchin,” says Walter Shaub, former chief of the Office of Government Ethics, now at the Campaign Legal Center. “This is the tone from the top, that President Trump himself has set: Ethics doesn’t matter, and high positions of public trust come with perks.” "
"Kara Walker has had enough. Since her 1994 New York debut, at just 24 years old, at the Drawing Center, she and her artworks have been hailed as “exquisite” “skillful” “ingenious” and “triumphant.” She has won a MacArthur fellowship, was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and has been widely praised as among the most important black artists working today. No pressure or anything. Ms. Walker is, as she writes in the artist statement for her new show at Sikkema Jenkins & Co. in New York, “tired of ‘having a voice’ or worse, ‘being a role model.’ ” She is fed up with “being a featured member of my racial group and/or gender niche.” She also notes that her new work is not “activist” and we shouldn’t expect answers from her: “I roll my eyes, fold my arms and wait.” Well, this is what Ms. Walker rolling her eyes and folding her arms looks like: a 151-by-191-inch work at the show, in sumi ink and collage, titled “Christ’s Entry Into Journalism,” which combines the imagined and the real as well as the past and present. My eye immediately went to the faces of James Brown and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Then I noticed Frederick Douglass giving a Black Power salute while holding the swastika-stamped head of what appears to be Donald Trump — an obvious allusion to the moment, a few months back, when the president seemed to believe Douglass, who died in 1895, was alive. Elsewhere in the illustration, the president’s look-alike makes another appearance. This time he peeks out from between a Klansman’s legs. The Trump-like character wags his tongue while defecating. In another part of the collage, two black girls swing on a trapeze. Look closer and you see the body of a lynched black man hanging on the branch between them. A white woman carries Trayvon Martin’s hoodie-covered head on a tray. A black man is attacked by a police officer in riot gear who holds a turkey leg in one hand and a cellphone in the other. There is a Confederate battle flag. An American flag. And an arm in a Nazi salute. "
"As leading Democrats embrace Senator Bernie Sanders’s proposal to vastly expand Medicare to cover all Americans, Republicans are fighting back with familiar critiques of such a single-payer system. Mr. Sanders argued for his “Medicare for all” legislation in an Op-Ed published in The New York Times on Wednesday, while his Republican colleagues dismissed the idea in a news conference. Here’s an assessment of their claims. Mr. Sanders claimed that “the majority of the American people” want Medicare for all, citing an April poll by The Economist/YouGov in which 60 percent of Americans agreed that Medicare should be expanded to cover everyone. But this appears to be the high end of support. A Quinnipiac poll in August reported that 51 percent of respondents said that replacing the current health care system with a Medicare-for-all model was a good idea. “Medicare for all” generally polls more favorably than “single payer.” In a June poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 57 percent of respondents supported Medicare for all, while 53 percent favored a single-payer approach. Other polls about single-payer health care found lower levels of support: 44 percent from Morning Consult/Politico, 44 percent from Rasmussen and 33 percent from the Pew Research Center. Pollsters at AP/NORC did not ask about a specific model in an August survey, but 60 percent of respondents said it was the federal government’s responsibility to provide health care for everyone. "

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump came under attack from some of his strongest supporters, who were outraged about his decision to set aside a fight, at least for now, over building a border wall with Mexico as part of a deal with Democrats to protect young, undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump’s second compromise with the top-ranking congressional Democrats in one week raised a question for many Republicans: How much more will his base tolerate? The president also revived his “both sides” claim about the racial violence last month in Charlottesville, Va. _____ "
"Wow, Donald Trump is all over the place. On Tuesday he had dinner with a few moderate Democrats and completely retooled his tax policy before dessert. This is the man who is having such a famous fling with the minority leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, that they no longer need identifying. Really, “Chuck and Nancy” are as famous as Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Victoria and Albert. Antony and Cleopatra. But about the tax policy dinner. The Democratic senators described their discussion as so harmonious it sounded … kind of boring. “Very collegial and very businesslike,” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota on a radio interview back home with talk show host Joel Heitkamp. (Yes, they’re siblings. North Dakota is a very small state. Only 750,000 people. Yet as many senators as California or New York. Do you think that’s fair? Never mind, I digress.) Democrats have been demanding that no tax cuts go to the wealthy, and over beef medallions, Trump gave the impression that was exactly what he wanted, too. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia reported that “the president was adamant from the get-go: ‘This is not a tax cut for the rich, and I repeat that, this will not be a tax cut for me or any rich people.’ That kind of started off the conversation and it went pretty good from there.” Now Manchin and Heitkamp are two of the most conservative senators from their party. But still, this seems like an awful lot of agreeing. Trump has spent the last month howling about the need to cut the corporate tax rate in half, and he’s been adamant about getting rid of the estate tax, which is imposed only on inheritances of more than $5 million. Do you think he’s changed his mind? That the Democrats misheard? That the spinach was spiked with hallucinogens? On Wednesday Trump not only ditched his tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy plans, he claimed the rich might take a hit. “If they have to go higher they’ll go higher,” he told a bipartisan congressional group with the adorable name of the Problem Solvers Caucus. This seemed like good news except for the part about the president appearing to be sort of off his rocker. "
"When Congress has to pass a joint resolution condemning white supremacy and plunk it on the desk of the “president” — in an effort to force him to sign it and daring him not to — you know that we as a country are beyond the pale. (On Wednesday, the press secretary for the “on many sides” white supremacy sympathizer said: “In terms of whether or not he’ll sign the joint resolution, absolutely. And he looks forward to doing so as soon as he receives it.” Of course, he didn’t really have a choice. A veto would have been the equivalent of burning a cross on the Resolute Desk.) When Donald Trump’s fraudulent voter-fraud commission openly entertains the loony and unworkable idea of further winnowing the voter rolls by forcing potential voters to undergo the federal background check used for gun buyers, you know that this administration is trying every way it can to ax voter access and re-establish Jim Crow poll tests. When Robert Mueller is circling this White House like a hawk preparing to descend on a chicken coop, you know that the stench of corruption emanating from this administration reaches to the heavens. Indeed, on Tuesday, Axios reported this intriguing line: “Republicans close to the White House say every sign by Mueller — from his hiring of Mafia and money-laundering experts to his aggressive pursuit of witnesses and evidence — is that he’s going for the kill.” I often hear from Trump enthusiasts and accommodators that at some point resistance must submit, that the time for outrage is term-limited, that at a point, complete opposition registers as unfair and unpatriotic. "
"Republicans — like President Trump, for instance — love to puff up their chests, grasp their lapels and declaim in foghorn voices about their devotion to law and order. And so, on Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, piously declared that the Justice Department should consider whether James Comey had broken the law before and after Trump fired him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. “I think if there’s ever a moment where we feel someone’s broken the law, particularly if they’re the head of the F.B.I., I think that’s something that certainly should be looked at,” she said. She was referring to Comey’s exoneration of Hillary Clinton in the email caper, and his admission that he had leaked his own private memo describing conversations with Trump. It couldn’t get clearer than that, right? Not so fast. On a Friday night in August, when Hurricane Harvey was barreling into Texas, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Ariz.a, sheriff who had blatantly violated a court order to stop detaining people because he thought they looked Mexican. It didn’t bother President Law and Order that he undercut the courts’ only power to enforce their orders. His praise of Arpaio as being “very strong” on lawbreaking by border crossers did not mention that the former sheriff fed his victims rotten food in outdoor detention camps where temperatures soared and some prisoners even died. Or that he failed to investigate about 400 sex crimes. Under the Trump formula, Comey should be investigated by the Justice Department — but Michael Flynn, who had to resign in disgrace as national security adviser, should get a pass for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his meetings with the Russian ambassador. On Wednesday, we learned that Democrats in Congress are asking questions about another memory slip by Flynn — failing to disclose a trip he took in 2015 to try to broker a Saudi-Russian deal on nuclear power plants — and that he may have lobbied inside the White House for that deal. "
"The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency. In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank’s seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen. Few presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it’s time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity. The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking — often vaguely — about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself. The Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low — and both were low before 2008. Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as “consumer prices” but now have a bigger influence on the economy. Consumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys. Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction. To ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money. In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai. "
"In over 45 years of working in global affairs, I’ve observed a simple truth: America’s ability to lead the world depends not just on the example of our power, but on the power of our example. American democracy is rooted in the belief that every man, woman and child has equal rights to freedom and dignity. While the United States is far from perfect, we have never given up the struggle to grow closer to the ideals in our founding documents. The constant American endeavor to live by our values is a great strength that has drawn generations of strivers and dreamers to the United States, enriching our population. Around the world, other nations follow our lead because they know that America does not simply protect its own interests, but tries to advance the aspirations of all. This has stood as the foundation of American foreign policy throughout my political career — until recently. Around the world, including in the United States, we are seeing the resurgence of a worldview that is closed off and clannish. President Trump keeps longstanding allies such as Germany at arm’s length, while expressing admiration for autocrats like Vladimir V. Putin who thwart democratic institutions. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump thrust himself back into the racial storms of Charlottesville on Thursday, repeating his charge that those who resisted the neo-Nazis and white supremacists were as much to blame as the alt-right crowds who marched on the Virginia college town. Mr. Trump was characterizing his side of a conversation on Wednesday with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, during which Mr. Scott, the Senate’s only black Republican, confronted the president on his claim that “both sides” were responsible for the violence that followed a torchlight protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. “Especially in light of the advent of Antifa, if you look at what’s going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the anti-fascist activists who clashed with the neo-Nazis and white supremacists. “Now because of what’s happened since then, with Antifa, you look at really what’s happened since Charlottesville — a lot of people are saying — in fact, a lot of people have actually written, ‘Gee, Trump might have a point,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Air Force One. “I said, ‘You’ve got some very bad people on the other side,’ which is true.” It was the latest shift in Mr. Trump’s constantly evolving statements about Charlottesville. He has alternately condemned the hate groups and drawn a moral equivalence between them and the counterprotesters. On Thursday night, he signed a nonbinding congressional resolution urging him to condemn groups like white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan. But earlier in the day, Mr. Trump reverted to the unapologetic stance he took in a news conference last month at Trump Tower. Despite that, Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Scott had a “great conversation.” He described Mr. Scott as a longstanding friend whom he supported early in his career. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Hurries a Tax Overhaul Not Yet Written” (front page, Sept. 14): President Trump is using the tragedies of multiple hurricanes hitting the United States as an excuse to rush through Congress his plan to reform the country’s income tax code. Attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of people to circumvent the normal process of careful and systematic analysis of the impacts of making major changes to the tax code can only mean that his proposals would fail to stand up to the detailed scrutiny that normally accompanies such legislation. More important, unless President Trump releases all of his tax returns — which, during the campaign, he promised to do after the election — we can never know how much he and his family personally benefit from his proposals. Given that he has repeatedly used the office of the presidency for personal aggrandizement (doubling the membership fees at Mar-a-Lago, hosting foreign leaders at Trump hotels), we can only believe that his plan is less a “Make America Great Again” plan than a “Make the Trump Family Ever Richer” plan. ROBERT CHECCHIO, DUNELLEN, N.J. To the Editor: Re “When the Rich Said No to Getting Richer,” by David Leonhardt (column, Sept. 5): Thank you, Mr. Leonhardt, for reminding us that after World War II the highest income category was taxed at 91 percent. Taxes then paid for war expenses and the Interstate highway system. Today, governments are unable to adequately fund law enforcement or education or fix those highways, among other needs, while some multimillionaires, although in the maximum 39.6 percent tax bracket, actually pay an effective tax rate lower than their secretaries do. In the same way, some corporations ostensibly taxed at 35 percent actually pay a far lower rate or even no taxes after tax credits and deductions. It would be interesting to know how many companies are using contractors to pay their employees a stagnating wage and keep them in dead-end jobs instead of appreciating them as loyal employees and helping them to further their education and goals, as reflected in the Sept. 3 Sunday Business article contrasting two employers, “The Great American Janitor Test.” There is a better way than that being pursued by those who do not see the corrosive effect of the values of many of today’s “leaders.” "
"NAPLES, Fla. — President Trump traveled to Florida on Thursday to take part in what has quickly become a familiar tableau for him: the windbreaker-clad commander in chief, surveying hurricane devastation, bucking up local officials, and alighting from his helicopter to distribute food and handshakes. This time, it was Naples, the Gulf Coast town of multimillion-dollar seafront villas and inland mobile-home parks that was torn asunder by Hurricane Irma. Mr. Trump stopped at one of the latter, where an excavator was removing the twisted remains of a mobile home. “Don’t forget to take one,” the president said to a friendly crowd as he stood behind a silver tin of hoagies, part of a staging area with food and water for resident and rescue workers. “Here’s a nice one!” Mr. Trump arrived in Naples after he was briefed in nearby Fort Myers on the recovery operation by federal emergency management and Florida officials, including Senator Marco Rubio, Gov. Rick Scott, and Pam Bondi, the state attorney general. It was Mr. Trump’s third visit to storm-ravaged parts of the United States in the past few weeks after two major hurricanes, and he again praised the federal government’s performance. “We’re doing a good job in Florida,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Air Force One. “We’re going to see some of the folks and make sure they’re happy,” he said in Fort Myers, acknowledging that many had lost their homes in the destruction. "
"MEXICO CITY — Favorable views of the United States have sharply declined among Mexicans, reaching the lowest point in 15 years amid deep disapproval of President Trump and his policies toward Mexico, according to a survey released on Thursday. Nearly two-thirds of Mexicans now have a negative opinion of their northern neighbor, more than double the proportion of two years ago, the study, by the Pew Research Center, found. Of the 37 countries surveyed by Pew, Mexico had the largest drop in favorability toward the United States. The negative views coincide with a dismal perception of Mr. Trump and his signature campaign promises. Only 5 percent of Mexicans are confident that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in world affairs, his lowest rating in any country, and 94 percent oppose his plan to build a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States. Mr. Trump has also cracked down on undocumented immigrants, many of whom are Mexican, and threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The jump in unfavorable views comes after years of warming perceptions of the United States among Mexicans as relations have deepened between the two countries. Economic ties have strengthened under Nafta, tourism from the United States has soared in Mexico, and millions of Mexicans have family connections in the United States after decades of immigration. But the 65 percent of Mexicans with unfavorable views of the United States in the new survey represent the highest share since Pew began surveying the country in 2002. It also flips the numbers on their head: In 2015, 66 percent of Mexicans had a generally positive view of the United States. The latest survey was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 1,000 Mexicans from March 2 to April 10. Mexicans still have a favorable view of the economic relationship, with 55 percent saying that ties with the United States are good for their country, although that proportion has declined 15 points from 2013. Mexicans’ views of Nafta are similarly favorable, with three in five seeing the accord as a good thing for their country. The negative attitudes toward the United States do not appear to affect Mexicans’ desire to live and work there. More than half of those with an unfavorable opinion of the United States, 54 percent, said that life was better for those who move there. One-third of Mexicans said they would move to the United States if given the opportunity, a proportion that has changed little since 2009. But a smaller share, 13 percent, said they were willing to work or live in the United States without authorization, down from 20 percent two years ago. The survey also found a generally grim mood among Mexicans, with 85 percent dissatisfied with the way things are going in their country. Among their most pressing concerns, the study found, are political corruption, drug-related violence and crime. "
"Young Americans have been moving left and leaving the G.O.P. in recent years, but a successful Democratic coalition built on the backs of liberal youth is far from a sure thing, especially in the short term. The party’s problem is straightforward: getting them to actually go to the polls. Politicians know which part of the electorate still butters their bread — and there’s no avocado on it. Those aged 18 to 29 vote at far lower rates than older groups, decreasing their electoral power. But there are at least some signs that their participation levels will improve. And if an increasingly left-leaning voting bloc does become more politically active, there are huge potential gains for the Democratic Party. The obvious positive news for Democrats is reflected in the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (C.C.E.S.), a survey of 64,000 adults. Fifty-four percent of American adults younger than 30 identified as Democrat or leaning-Democrat in 2016 — that’s six percentage points higher than among the rest of the public. Young people also call themselves “very liberal” or “liberal” more often than Americans older than 30, by five and seven percentage points. Roughly 60 percent of this group reported voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to the C.C.E.S. (This is higher than the 55 percent reported in exit polls after the election.) This may warm Democrats’ hearts, but it’s still a far cry from the hyper-left youth vote some like to think exists. President Trump won the white youth vote last year, after all. A significant part of the Democratic lean among the young can be simply explained by their increased diversity — but not all of it. The youngest voters have been leaning Democratic since 2004. That doesn’t mean they have the same party loyalty of older left-of-center generations. They’re more likely to register as independent. "

"“We could let it die quietly, but we’re going to kill it loudly.” That’s the message President Trump wanted to send in blocking a Chinese-backed bid for Lattice Semiconductor, according to Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. The White House said it prevented the acquisition of the American chip maker to preserve the integrity of the semiconductor industry, raising questions about the buyer’s close ties to Beijing. The investment group making the bid included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by government-backed entities, the White House said. Gao Feng, a spokesman for China’s commerce ministry, said that countries should not use security reviews as a way to push protectionism. What you need to know: • China has been especially interested in computer chips as part of its push to become a dominant force in cutting-edge industries. • Lattice doesn’t currently sell equipment to the American military. But it has in the past, meaning that some of its chips may still be in use, The Financial Times reports. "
"WASHINGTON — An unexpected meeting of the minds between President Trump and Democratic leaders on Thursday made real a possible deal in Congress to pair enhanced border security with legislation to protect young, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. One day after Mr. Trump hosted Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi for dinner at the White House, the president said he could support legislation to protect the young immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation if it were accompanied by a “massive” border security upgrade. Acceding to a key Democratic demand, Mr. Trump said such a package did not need to have funding for a border wall. It was the second time this month that a tentative agreement announced by Democrats left Republican leaders in Congress scrambling to adjust a legislative agenda that appears increasingly set by the party out of power in the House, the Senate and the White House. “We’re working on a plan for DACA,” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to protections for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as he prepared to leave the White House for Florida. He added, “The wall will come later.” And Republican leaders at least sounded open to pursuing it. “We’re not going to bring a solution to the floor that does not have the support of President Trump,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin told reporters. But if Mr. Trump does support an immigration package that includes “security and enforcement,” he said, so will “a majority of our members, because our members support President Trump.” But he also made his frustration clear. “The president understands he has to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution,” Mr. Ryan said.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) John Chiang, California’s bespectacled treasurer, is a finance man. His two decades in public office have been all taxes, budgets, bonds and pensions. It’s a resume that Mr. Chiang, a Democrat, hopes will persuade voters that he is the governor California needs as it wrestles with a housing crisis and gaping income equality. He’ll need to outshine two bold-name rivals in the 2018 race: Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, and Antonio Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles. Mr. Chiang, 55, grew up in a suburb of Chicago, the son of immigrants from Taiwan. He studied finance at the University of South Florida and law at Georgetown University, before relocating to the Los Angeles area in 1987, where he lives today. Since then, he has climbed methodically up the ranks of state politics, from political staffer to tax official to controller to treasurer. Still, Mr. Chiang is not widely known. (On that note, it’s pronounced Chung). To remedy that he embarked this summer, camper in tow, on a yearlong tour of all 58 California counties. "
"President Trump will hold a conference call on Friday morning with Jewish leaders ahead of the High Holy Days, moving ahead with a standard White House event that several rabbinical groups have vowed to boycott. “In commemoration of the Jewish High Holy Days, President Donald J. Trump would like to invite you to a conference call where he will send well wishes for the upcoming holidays and discuss his administration’s progress on issues of interest to the Jewish community,” a brief email to invitees said. “We hope that you will accept our invitation to join this exciting call as the Jewish people welcome 5778 and reflect on the past year,” the email said. The tradition of the conference call had been nonpartisan in previous years ahead of the holidays of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur. But late in August, four coalitions of rabbis said they would boycott the call, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s equivocating response to the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va. Issues related to the Jewish community have been problematic for the president throughout his presidency. A statement from the White House on Holocaust Remembrance Day made no mention of the millions of Jews who were killed, instead focusing on “all” who suffered. And the president’s statement that there were “very fine people” among the white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville prompted an outcry. It was not immediately clear how many groups were invited to participate on the conference call. Still, some people thought the president deserved praise for going ahead with it. “It is important that President Trump is holding this outreach call with Jewish leaders and rabbis ahead of Rosh Hashana,” said Nathan Diament, the executive director for public policy at the Orthodox Union. “It is a testament to the American ideal of religious diversity and it is meaningful that the president is continuing this tradition started by President Obama,” he said. Graham Roth, a spokesman for the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said the group’s position has not changed. “Reform rabbis, along with Reconstructionist and Conservative rabbis, decided to forgo hosting the annual High Holiday call with the president this year,” he said in an email. “This was not a decision made lightly, but the president’s lack of moral leadership in the wake of Charlottesville made it necessary.” "

Bernie Sanders’s biggest ally in his push for single-payer health insurance may well be the Republican Party. Yes, Republicans criticized and mocked the “Medicare for all” bill that Sanders released yesterday, and I doubt any Congressional Republicans will support the bill in the foreseeable future. But I do think they are unwittingly helping his cause. There are two main alternatives to an expansion of government-provided health insurance. One is to argue that it’s fine if millions of Americans go without insurance. I don’t see many politicians willing to make this case affirmatively (even those who vote for bills that would take insurance away). The second alternative is to strengthen private insurance markets, so that they’re covering more people and holding costs. Yet the Trump administration and many other Republicans — both governors and members of Congress — are now doing the opposite. They’re sabotaging the private insurance markets created by Obamacare. If those markets fail, it will leave many Americans who don’t get insurance through their job without coverage. The weaker private markets become, the more political momentum government-provided insurance will have. Some Democrats will push for a gradual expansion of Medicaid and Medicare. Others, like Sanders and his growing list of allies, will push for an entirely new system. I don’t expect them to succeed anytime soon, but the debate over health care has moved much further to the left in recent years than I expected to see. And the Republican Party is largely responsible. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Trump confirms backing for “Dreamers” law. President Trump said this morning that he supported legislation that would protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation, confirming an agreement with Democratic leaders. Mr. Trump’s comments contradicted his earlier Twitter posts, in which he said no deal had been made. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi said protections for the young immigrants were not dependent on funding for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico — though Mr. Trump will continue to push for its construction. Separately, Mr. Trump urged Congress to “move fast” on passing a tax code. • Irma’s effects. Three days after the hurricane, some of the most vulnerable people in Florida were dying — not because of wind or floods, but because of what seemed to be an electrical failure. Eight people died in a sweltering  nursing home. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. The former White House press secretary Sean Spicer broke his post-administration silence on Wednesday, joining Jimmy Kimmel for an interview. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Spicer didn’t exactly forswear his loyalty to President Trump. Mr. Spicer refused to back away from his old claims that members of the traditional news media are often untruthful, even after Mr. Kimmel asked: “Do you think that is a dangerous thing, to delegitimize the press for America?” But when Mr. Kimmel asked whether the president’s constant tweeting had ever worn his patience thin, Mr. Spicer couldn’t help but laugh a little. Mr. Kimmel rolled a tape of Melissa McCarthy’s famous impression of Mr. Spicer on “Saturday Night Live” and asked about Mr. Trump’s response to it. Some reporters have been trying to figure out why Mr. Trump is making deals with Senate Democrats all of a sudden. Some are reporting that he and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have struck up a warm relationship. Samantha Bee is not surprised. Ms. Bee also pointed out that Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has been insisting that Americans should not discuss the possibility that climate change is responsible for recent bouts of extreme weather.

"UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. — Eleven years after parting ways, seemingly forever, the “Will & Grace” gang — same cast, same writers, same studio audience warm-up guy — reunited on the NBCUniversal lot here in mid-August. As they started work on 29 new episodes, Sean Hayes, returning to his role as the overly dramatic Jack, belted out a song from “Dreamgirls.” Megan Mullally, who plays Karen, did a little dance and shouted, “Sass is in the house!” But not everyone was doing Rockette kicks. Ruminating on a sofa in the middle of Stage 22 were Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, the creators of “Will & Grace.” They had already celebrated their show’s revival and were now fretting about the evolved culture, in particular the emphasis on identity politics and the way TV shows are now picked apart on social media. How would their sometimes sharp-edged sitcom, which returns to NBC on Sept. 28, go over in the Age of Rage? “That really is the big question,” Mr. Mutchnick said, crossing his arms. “Will & Grace” pushed well past the broadcast network comfort zone when it arrived with a finger snap in 1998. The show’s framework was familiar — “I Love Lucy,” with twists — but its focus on gay characters was not. Being gay on TV was considered so taboo that “Will & Grace” writers waited until the second season to risk including a (modest) same-sex kiss. Now, however, with the legalization of gay marriage and “Transparent” and gay characters even popping up on the Disney Channel, the question is not whether “Will & Grace” is too inclusive — too ahead of the culture — but whether it is inclusive enough. At a time when Hollywood is under intense pressure to avoid stereotypes and to promote diversity from every possible angle, “Will & Grace” — once seen as the epitome of diversity on television — could actually find itself assailed for being behind the curve. It’s about four privileged white people. The characters, in particular the plain-spoken and politically incorrect Karen, occasionally crack racially tinged jokes. Although the lovably uptight gay character at the center of the show, Will, played by Eric McCormack, is best friends with Grace, played by Debra Messing, he sometimes makes quips that could come across as misogynistic in today’s climate. In rehearsal for the third episode, writers had Will joking, “It’s all in the book ‘Men Are From Mars, Who Cares Where Women Come From.’” "
"For years, climate change activists have faced a wrenching dilemma: how to persuade people to care about a grave but seemingly far-off problem and win their support for policies that might pinch them immediately in utility bills and at the pump. But that calculus may be changing at a time when climatic chaos feels like a daily event rather than an airy abstraction, and storms powered by warming ocean waters wreak havoc on the mainland United States. Americans have spent weeks riveted by television footage of wrecked neighborhoods, displaced families, flattened Caribbean islands and submerged cities from Houston to Jacksonville. “The conversation is shifting,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “Because even if you don’t believe liberals, even if you don’t believe scientists, you can believe your own eyes.” Despite consensus among scientists, not everyone is convinced that terrifying weather means climate change is an urgent threat. There is virtually no prospect of large-scale federal action on the issue in the near future, and President Trump has made a top priority of unraveling the Obama administration’s environmental policies, including the Paris climate accord. Republicans, who control the White House and Congress, remain broadly skeptical of climate science and rely heavily on the electoral support of oil- and coal-producing states. But an array of political leaders — including some members of Mr. Trump’s party, along with emboldened Democrats and environmental activists — see the underlying dynamics of climate politics bending, as drastic weather events throw up practical challenges for red and blue states alike. Mr. Schatz, one of the Democrats’ most assertive spokesmen on global warming, said there were already “pockets of opportunity” to work with Republicans on measures to reinforce coastlines and support solar- and wind-energy production, though not on more ambitious policies. “We can get a fair amount of bipartisanship if we talk about severe weather and resiliency,” Mr. Schatz said. “For some people, it’s just about the phrase ‘climate change’ being too politically loaded.” "
"In the Trump era, Republicans have been revising their views on right and wrong. In 2011, the Public Religion Research Institute asked voters if White evangelical Protestants were the least forgiving. Sixty-one percent said such a politician could not “behave ethically,” twice the 30 percent who felt that such a politician could manage it. Every other religious group was less judgmental. Catholics, 49 no, 42, yes; white mainline Protestants: 44 percent no, 38 percent yes; the religiously unaffiliated, 26 no, 63 yes. Are the moral convictions of white evangelical Protestants writ in stone? Apparently not. Five years later, in October, 2016, P.R.R.I. asked the same question. The percentage of white evangelical Protestants who said that a politician who commits an immoral act in their personal life could still behave ethically shot up from 30 to 72 percent. The percentage saying such a politician could not serve ethically plunged from 63 to 20 percent. “In a head-spinning reversal,” Robert P. Jones, the C.E.O. of P.R.R.I., wrote in the July 2017 issue of The Atlantic, What happened in the interim? The answer is obvious: the advent of Donald Trump. There is more to this phenomenon than evangelical hypocrisy. Many Republican voters, including self-identified strong conservatives, are ready and willing to shift to the left if they’re told that that’s the direction Trump is moving. "
"The bunny almost was broiled. In the most notorious scene of the 1987 thriller “Fatal Attraction,” the spurned Alex (Glenn Close) terrorizes her ex-lover Dan (Michael Douglas) by boiling the family pet on the stove. “Initially, I had her grilling the bunny,” the screenwriter James Dearden said in a recent telephone interview. “But I thought that was too grotesque. So we boiled the bunny instead.” The result remained fairly gory. “The stench was unbearable,” the film’s director, Adrian Lyne, recalled of shooting the scene with a rabbit purchased from a butcher. “It permeated the whole house.” Three decades after it became an Oscar-nominated cause célèbre and grossed $320 million worldwide, “Fatal Attraction” continues to pervade the culture. “Bunny boiler” has become synonymous with a female stalker, and a “Saturday Night Live” sketch last season depicted the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway cooking a CNN anchor’s rabbit. Thirty years after the film’s Sept. 18, 1987, release, I spoke with the cast and filmmakers about the movie and its surprising aftermath. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.  The producer Stanley R. Jaffe saw a short, “Diversion,” written and directed by Mr. Dearden, about an unfaithful husband whose lover phones his wife. Mr. Jaffe took it to another producer, Sherry Lansing, who thought it had feature potential. But no one in Hollywood would buy it, especially with Michael Douglas as the lead. SHERRY LANSING “Diversion” would not leave my mind. I had my own experience when I was rejected [by a man], and I felt like he took my soul. The film got rejected twice by every studio. They would say, “A guy who cheats on his wife for absolutely no reason!” Michael hadn’t done “Wall Street.” He had done the “Romancing the Stone” films and “The Streets of San Francisco” on TV, but he wasn’t big enough to get a movie made with a script they didn’t like.

"There’s an old saying, “hard cases make bad law.” Perhaps a corollary should be “easy cases make good law.” In the realm of insider trading, Mathew Martoma seems an especially easy case. Mr. Martoma is the former SAC Capital portfolio manager who was convicted of the biggest insider-trading offense in history, a series of trades based on confidential information he coaxed from Dr. Sidney Gilman, an eminent neurologist at the University of Michigan who was overseeing tests of a promising drug for Alzheimer’s disease. It was a medication that some speculated would be the biggest drug of all time. After Mr. Martoma learned from Dr. Gilman that the trials had been largely a failure, SAC was able to trade on the still-confidential information, generating profits and avoiding losses totaling $275 million. Mr. Martoma earned a $9.3 million bonus for his efforts. Dr. Gilman testified against Mr. Martoma at trial. Despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, Mr. Martoma has never acknowledged any wrongdoing or shown any remorse. His steadfast refusal to cooperate with the government meant criminal charges were never brought against Steven A. Cohen, SAC’s founder, who remains one of the world’s richest men and who is now back in business at his new operation, Point72 Asset Management. (Insider trading wasn’t Mr. Martoma’s first occasion of impropriety. He was expelled from Harvard Law School after it discovered that he had altered his transcripts to get a prestigious judicial clerkship, and then lied about it. He later enrolled at Stanford Business School, which revoked his M.B.A. degree after learning about the incidents at Harvard.) Given the circumstances of the case, it was no surprise when Mr. Martoma was convicted in 2014 and sentenced to nine years in prison. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump came under withering attack on Thursday from some of his strongest supporters, who were outraged and unforgiving about his decision to set aside, for now, a fight over building the border wall he has long promised as part of a deal with Democrats on legislation to protect young, undocumented immigrants. The tentative arrangement, which the president hashed out over dinner on Wednesday night at the White House with the top-ranking congressional Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, set off accusations of betrayal and renewed nagging doubts about whether Mr. Trump was in jeopardy of alienating some of his most ardent backers on the right. No promise was more central to his campaign than building the border wall. And no constituency was more passionate in defending Mr. Trump’s pledge than the conservatives who believed he would be uncompromising in his approach toward illegal immigration. The condemnation was swift and came from many different conservative corners: members of his own party in Congress, his most steadfast boosters on talk radio and the grass roots. “At this point, who doesn’t want Trump impeached?” said the conservative writer Ann Coulter as she took to Twitter to excoriate the president. “If we’re not getting a wall, I’d prefer President Pence,” added Ms. Coulter, who met recently with the president in the Oval Office and warned him of the perils of not keeping his word on immigration, and most notably the wall.

"THE CRISIS OF MULTICULTURALISM IN EUROPE
A History
By Rita Chin
363 pp. Princeton University Press. $35. THE STRANGE DEATH OF EUROPE
Immigration, Identity, Islam
By Douglas Murray
343 pp. Bloomsbury. $26 In the mid-1890s, the German sociologist Max Weber warned against “the continual swarm” of cheap Polish laborers arriving in Germany. According to him, a “free market policy, including open borders in the east, is the worst possible policy at this point.” And not just for economic reasons. The likely integration of these aliens would threaten the “social unification of the nation, which has been split apart by modern economic development.” For Weber, a German nationalist, the “influx of Poles” was “far more dangerous from a cultural viewpoint” than even of Chinese “coolies.” Compared with Weber’s rhetoric about Germany’s “struggle for existence” and his strictures against Catholics and Jews as well as Poles and Chinese, there is nothing overtly racist about the denunciations Rita Chin quotes in “The Crisis of Multiculturalism in Europe” by opponents of multiculturalism — which for them is shorthand for the nonwhite laborers Europe expediently imported after World War II to reconstruct its shattered economy. The political scientist Samuel Huntington’s comment that “multiculturalism is in its essence anti-European civilization” — approvingly cited by Douglas Murray in “The Strange Death of Europe” — also seems coded in comparison. But as demagogues across Europe and America rant against immigration and promise to build a strong and unified national community through exclusion, it is hard not to feel déjà vu. Racial nationalism was commonplace in the late 19th century, the radically disruptive first phase of economic globalization. Hierarchies of race, ethnicity and religion were imposed on non-Western peoples as Europeans scrambled for territories and resources abroad, followed enviously by Americans. Exclusion was also central to their frantic effort to build political communities at home. Old bonds and solidarities had frayed in societies split apart, as Weber wrote, by modern economic development. Many of the aggrieved became eager to recreate and purify the social body, and to preserve “our” identity against people stigmatized as the “other” through their names, skin color or religious practices. Mass immigration to Western Europe and America, which peaked in the late 19th century, heightened the fantasy of a lost communal wholeness. So did unregulated flows of refugees: Pogroms in Russia sent thousands of Jewish survivors to Western Europe. (Weber’s warnings against the Polish “swarm” reflected a then widespread anxiety about Ostjuden.) Virulent anti-Semites flourished in Austria-Hungary, Germany and France as the 19th century ended, while lynchings of blacks by white mobs in the United States became more common. The United States in the 1880s had pioneered racialized immigration policy, passing laws aimed at keeping Asians out. The Jim Crow laws that institutionalized segregation in the 1890s were accompanied by a mass hysteria in the United States against immigrants. Fears of degeneration haunted even powerful white men like Theodore Roosevelt. In 1905, amid widespread paranoia about the Yellow Peril, he warned of “race suicide,” exhorting white people to strengthen themselves against their rising nonwhite rivals. "
"NEWARK — The Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor opened his post-Labor Day blitz accusing his Republican opponent of abdicating her moral leadership. The Republican challenger retorted with accusations of race baiting. They were the type of hyperbolic accusations often thrown around in a nail-biting, nasty political campaign with such vitriolic attacks feeding a frenetic news cycle hungry for daily conflict and a riled electorate packing town hall meetings and rallies. This is not that kind of race. Despite an election that will mark the end of the tumultuous tenure of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and the fact that it is only one of two statewide elections this year, the campaign has failed to whet the appetite of voters. Philip D. Murphy, the Democrat, is leading the Republican, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, by 25 percentage points in a poll by Quinnipiac University released this week. Much like this year’s primary elections for governor in June, in which turnout hovered around 13 percent of the state’s nearly 5.8 million registered voters, the general election to replace Mr. Christie is being met with similar apathy. About four in 10 voters do not know who either Mr. Murphy or Ms. Guadagno are, according to another recent poll from Rutgers University. “It’s a stealth election,” said Maurice Carroll, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll. “They’re campaigning like crazy but nobody pays attention.” "
"I had only two or three questions for Jon Hamm. I wanted to know if fame had rattled him. I wanted to know if, more than two years after the “Mad Men” finale, he had plotted out a second act worthy of his talent. I wanted to know if he still wanted to be a star. We were supposed to meet at the edge of Central Park at 11 a.m. and take a walk. Then came the rain. So we switched the location to Pearl Studios, a suite of rehearsal rooms in Midtown where actors and dancers audition for Broadway shows, touring companies and cruise-ship work. I texted to say I would pick up coffee. How did he like his? “Black!” he texted back. At Cafe Grumpy on West 39th Street I picked up two black coffees, extra-large. They were nearly lawsuit-hot. The walk in the rain to Pearl Studios seemed long. A few minutes past 11 came another text from Mr. Hamm, whose politeness may owe something to his Missouri upbringing: “I’m one very congested crosstown block away. Sorry!!” If you still picture Don Draper when you think of Mr. Hamm, it may strike you as odd to see him emerge from a Nissan NV200 yellow cab, which has a boxy look very much at odds with the elegant midcentury universe of “Mad Men.” He was wearing a white linen dress shirt with the two top buttons undone, khakis and white sneakers with black laces. A Timex Blackjack Watch and a St. Louis Cardinals cap with a vintage logo completed the look. He accepted his coffee with a thank-you and took my hand in a meaty paw. Since completing his work on the show that made him famous, Mr. Hamm has gone through changes in his personal life while trying to get a movie career going. In 2015, he spent a month in treatment for alcohol addiction at a rehab facility. Some months after that, he and his partner of 18 years, the writer, director and actor Jennifer Westfeldt, announced that they had broken up. "
"Good morning. The New York Times is providing full free digital access to European readers through Sunday. Here’s what you need to know: • Jean-Claude Juncker, above, the president of the European Commission, laid out plans to simplify how the European Union is run. In perhaps the boldest proposal in his annual address to the European Parliament, Mr. Juncker suggested streamlining the bloc’s leadership — an idea that could in theory eliminate his own job. European leaders were largely lukewarm or silent on Mr. Juncker’s idea of combining the presidencies of the European Commission and the European Council, which would require their unanimous support.

"Before there were the Dreamers, there were undocumented children occupying seats in the public school classrooms of America. And before there was Kris Kobach, or Jeff Sessions, or Donald Trump, or other exploiters of the nativist strain that runs just below the surface of the national psyche, there was Texas. In 1975, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to deny enrollment to children not “legally admitted” to the United States. A district that chose to retain such children would forfeit a proportionate share of its state funding, a bargain none was likely to accept. Lawsuits followed, and on June 15, 1982, by a vote of 5 to 4, the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional. “By denying these children a basic education,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote for the majority, “we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institutions, and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of our nation.” Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote for the four dissenters. The case was Plyler v. Doe. Thirty-five years is a long time, and no one on today’s court was among those who struggled with the case for more than six months after the December 1981 argument. For politicians whose priority is kicking noncitizens out of the country, the decision — which acknowledged that the children might be deportable but assumed that many would not be deported — is beside the point. After all, the prospect that the current motivated and patriotic generation of young immigrants might contribute “in even the smallest way” to the country’s future is irrelevant to Trump supporters who, led by Attorney General Sessions, cheered the termination of President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has enabled more than 800,000 of these young people to stay in school and begin careers. Plyler v. Doe may be irrelevant in a strictly legal sense, but there are strong reasons to resurrect its memory and ponder it today. At the simplest level, it’s clear that during the current anti-immigrant spasm, at least several states would have thrown undocumented children out of school but for Plyler. For example, Alabama’s H.B. 56, enacted in 2011, requires school districts to collect data on the citizenship status of each child; while the law couldn’t go further, it has driven a number of undocumented children out of school and their families out of the state. The case reached the Supreme Court during President Ronald Reagan’s first year in office. It presented the new administration with an acute dilemma and leaves us with a fascinating back story, one with obvious resonance with the Trump administration’s vigorous effort to undo the Obama administration’s legal legacy.
