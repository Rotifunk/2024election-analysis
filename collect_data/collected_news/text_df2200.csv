"WASHINGTON — The State Department on Tuesday issued a blistering critique of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries for enforcing a two-week embargo against Qatar without giving the tiny country any specific ways to resolve a crisis over accusations of Qatar’s funding of terrorism. The statement seemed to put President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson further at odds about who is to blame for the dispute, which threatens a host of American diplomatic and security priorities in the gulf. The State Department also announced that, despite Mr. Trump’s direction that Mr. Tillerson assist in resolving the impasse, the secretary of state was all but washing his hands of it. “Now that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo has started, we are mystified that the gulf states have not released to the public nor to the Qataris the details about the claims they are making toward Qatar,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a news briefing. “The more time goes by, the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.,” she said, referring to the United Arab Emirates, which joined the Saudi embargo along with Egypt and Bahrain. “At this point,” she added, “we are left with one simple question: Were the actions really about their concerns regarding Qatar’s alleged support for terrorism, or were they about the long simmering grievances” among countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council, who share both common interests and rivalries.

"BETHESDA, Md. — The Justice Department will form partnerships with a dozen cities across the country to help them fight gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday. Under the program — the Trump administration’s latest move in prioritizing a reduction in violent crime — advisers and consultants will help local law enforcement officials develop strategies to combat violent crime. The cities will not receive funding as part of the initiative, a Justice Department spokesman said. “We will make America and every American neighborhood safe again,” Mr. Sessions said, announcing the partnerships at the start of a summit meeting of state, local and federal officials in suburban Washington organized by his task force on crime reduction and public safety. “This program will help communities suffering from serious violent crime problems to build up their capacity to fight back,” Mr. Sessions said, denouncing a recent rise in violent crime in the United States while praising law enforcement officers for their role in reducing it before that. The two-day conference was part of Mr. Sessions’s focus on reducing crime, which has garnered him comparatively less attention than his recusal from the federal investigation into Russian election interference. On that front on Tuesday, Charles J. Cooper, a prominent Washington litigator, confirmed that Mr. Sessions had hired him, although Mr. Cooper declined to specify whether he was advising Mr. Sessions in the Russia inquiry. In the violent crime program, the 12 cities teaming up with the Justice Department are: Birmingham, Ala.; Indianapolis; Toledo, Ohio; Cincinnati; Houston; Buffalo; Memphis; Baton Rouge, La.; Jackson, Tenn.; Kansas City, Mo.; Lansing, Mich.; and Springfield, Ill.

"In the early days of his administration, President Trump did not hesitate to bash the drug industry. But a draft of an executive order on drug prices appears to give the pharmaceutical industry much of what it has asked for — and no guarantee that costs to consumers will drop. The draft, which The New York Times obtained on Tuesday, is light on specifics but clear on philosophy: Easing regulatory hurdles for the drug industry is the best way to get prices down. The proposals identify some issues that have stoked public outrage — such as the high out-of-pocket costs for medicines — but it largely leaves the drug industry unscathed. In fact, the four-page document contains several proposals that have long been championed by the industry, including strengthening drugmakers’ monopoly power overseas and scaling back a federal program that requires pharmaceutical companies to give discounts to hospitals and clinics that serve low-income patients. Mr. Trump has often excoriated the drug industry for high prices, seizing on an issue that stirs the anger of Republicans and Democrats alike. He has accused the industry of “getting away with murder,” and said that he wanted to allow the federal government to negotiate directly with drug companies over the price of drugs covered by Medicare. But the proposed order does little to specifically call out the drug industry and instead focuses on rolling back regulations, a favorite target of the administration across many federal agencies. “I do believe that the president wants to do something to lower drug prices for people, but this is a far cry from what he said on the campaign trail,” said David Mitchell, the founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs, a nonprofit that does not take money from the industry. “I don’t see anything there that addresses the drug companies getting away with murder, and it appears that is because Pharma has captured the process.” "
"WASHINGTON — The opportunity to take over behind the White House briefing room lectern would be the apex of a political operative’s career in any other presidency, a path to riches, fame and power. But after weeks of fitful efforts to sell a job that for decades people have plotted to get, no one has jumped at the chance to become President Trump’s new press secretary, leaving the president — at least for now — with his beleaguered frontman, Sean Spicer. “I’m right here!” Mr. Spicer said gamely on Tuesday, sporting a tight smile in a self-deprecating gesture that contrasted with some of his more bellicose performances in the past. Mr. Spicer conceded what has been known for weeks: that the White House has solicited interest from a range of people, sometimes approaching them repeatedly even when they’ve said no. “We’ve been meeting with potential people that may be of service to this administration,” said Mr. Spicer, who has done some of the outreach himself. Yet few have been a good fit — and most Republicans in Washington said it would be among the hardest jobs to fill in the Trump administration. "
"WASHINGTON — A growing rift among Senate Republicans over federal spending on Medicaid and the opioid epidemic is imperiling legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act that Senate leaders are trying to put to a vote by the end of next week. President Trump had urged Republican senators to write a more generous bill than a House version that he first heralded and then called “mean,” but Republican leaders on Tuesday appeared to be drafting legislation that would do even more to slow the growth of Medicaid toward the end of the coming decade. And conservative senators, led by Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are determined to hold the line on federal spending, pitting two Senate factions against each other. Senator John Cornyn of Texas emerged from a contentious closed-door lunch with Republican senators on Tuesday saying that he hoped the Senate would be able to meet the deadline of a vote before July 4. “But,” he added, “failing that, I’ve always said we need to get it done by” the end of July. The emerging Senate bill, like the one approved narrowly by the House in early May, would end Medicaid as an open-ended entitlement program and replace it with capped payments to states, Republicans said. But starting in 2025, payments to the states would grow more slowly than those envisioned in the House bill. Republican senators from states that have been hit hard by the opioid drug crisis have tried to cushion the Medicaid blow with a separate funding stream of $45 billion over 10 years for substance abuse treatment and prevention costs, now covered by the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Tuesday that China had not succeeded in getting North Korea to curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, an extraordinary admission of failure in his strategy for dealing with the rogue regime of Kim Jong-un. Mr. Trump’s statement — delivered in an almost cavalier tweet, given how ardently he had sought the cooperation of President Xi Jinping of China — came a day after the death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who had been detained and brutalized in North Korea. Taken together, the developments are a major complication for Mr. Trump’s approach to North Korea, which he has called America’s most urgent foreign threat. He now faces a range of unattractive options: the use of military force; more coercive sanctions, including on Chinese banks that do business with the North; or some kind of opening to Mr. Kim. “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on the eve of a high-level meeting of Chinese and American officials in Washington. “At least I know China tried!” It is not clear how Mr. Trump’s statement will affect Wednesday’s Chinese-American meetings. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and other American officials had been planning to press their Chinese counterparts on North Korea. On Tuesday afternoon, senior officials said they were still trying to gauge the meaning of the president’s tweet. Reports late on Tuesday of renewed activity at a North Korean nuclear site added to the sense of urgency, and underlined how China had failed to curb Mr. Kim’s provocative actions. "
"ATLANTA — Karen Handel, a veteran Republican officeholder, overcame a deluge of liberal money to win a special House election in Georgia on Tuesday, bridging the divide in her party between admirers of President Trump and those made uneasy by his turbulent new administration. Ms. Handel, 55, fended off Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old Democrat and political newcomer who emerged from obscurity to raise $25 million from progressives across the country eager to express their anger at Mr. Trump. That fervor quickly elevated what would otherwise have been a sleepy local race into a high-stakes referendum on Mr. Trump and the most expensive House campaign in history. The surprisingly easy victory for Ms. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and Fulton County official, averted a humiliating upset for Republicans in an affluent, suburban Atlanta district — Georgia’s Sixth — that they have controlled for nearly 40 years. And it showed that Republicans skeptical of Mr. Trump remained comfortable supporting more conventional candidates from their party. The apparent success of relentless Republican attacks linking Mr. Ossoff to the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and her “San Francisco values” also affirmed the efficacy of tying Democratic candidates in conservative districts to their brethren in more liberal parts of the country. With all 208 precincts reporting, Ms. Handel had 51.9 percent of the vote to Mr. Ossoff’s 48.1 percent. "
"Make no mistake: Democrats were swimming against the current in Georgia. The House seat that their sights were on had been safely in Republican hands for nearly four decades. Georgia’s Sixth District is purple only if you scrunch your eyes just so. If you un-scrunch them and look at it honestly, it’s red. So the question isn’t what happened on Tuesday, when Karen Handel, the Republican candidate, prevailed over Jon Ossoff, the Democrat, in a special election with stakes and resonance well beyond the district’s parameters. The question is what happens next. How do Democrats buoy their spirits, maintain their ardor and press on? They ached for this seat. They fought for it fiercely. They reasoned that Ossoff had a real chance: Donald Trump, after all, won this district by just 1.5 percentage points. Donations for Ossoff flooded in, helping to make this the most expensive House race in history by far. Democrats came up empty-handed nonetheless. So a party sorely demoralized in November is demoralized yet again — and left to wonder if the intense anti-Trump passion visible in protests, marches, money and new volunteers isn’t just some theatrical, symbolic, abstract thing. When will it yield fruit? Where will it translate into results? And at what point will Trump be held accountable for a presidency that, so far, has been clumsier and more chaotic than even many of his detractors warned that it would be? "
"UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations secretary general warned on Tuesday that an American retreat from the world posed great risks on many issues, including climate change, international conflicts and the refugee crisis, as he announced a visit to Washington to urge members of Congress to support the United Nations. “When someone leaves space, that space is always occupied by others,” the secretary general, António Guterres, said in answer to a question at an hourlong news conference at United Nations headquarters in New York. Mr. Guterres said that if the United States was not engaged in global issues and international relations, “it will be unavoidable that other actors occupy that space.” “And I don’t think this is good for the United States, and I don’t think this is good for the world,” he added. Mr. Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal, took the helm of the United Nations on Jan. 1, just weeks before President Trump moved into the White House, having made clear his antipathy to the United Nations and international cooperation generally. Mr. Guterres has had only a brief meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House and is still waiting for Mr. Trump to set a date for a lunch invitation. That is unusual. Six months into the job, it is customary for the head of the world body to have had a more substantive meeting with the president of the United States, the organization’s largest funder and most influential member. (The United States pays 22 percent of the organization’s general budget and 28 percent of its peacekeeping budget, according to a formula negotiated with other countries.) "
"To the Editor: Re “President Cedes Afghan Strategy to the Pentagon” (front page, June 19): I read with shock and dismay that President Trump has in effect given over the planning and implementation for the war in Afghanistan to the military, which argued to expand the military effort even though Afghanistan is an unstable country with “endemic corruption.” Even though Afghanistan is far from the American mainland. Even though the 3,000 to 5,000 troops are being asked to deploy without an overall strategy, let alone an endgame. Has President Trump no feeling at all about the extreme danger to which he is subjecting these troops with apparently no interest in providing a rationale for their deployment? Is there no end to ill-conceived military exploits in a faraway land we know nothing about? Have we not learned anything since Vietnam? BRUCE CHADWICK, BROOKLYN "
"PODOLSK, Russia — As a former Soviet factory director, Vladimir Melikhov survived the brutal business turf wars of the 1990s to make a fortune in construction. Now he devotes his energy and money to what, in the Russia of President Vladimir V. Putin, has become a truly risky enterprise: digging into Russian history. Mr. Melikhov has founded a private museum that is devoted to the memory of the “anti-Bolshevik resistance” and that delves into a singularly taboo topic — why many Cossacks and other persecuted Soviet citizens welcomed, at least initially, Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The museum, housed in a three-story building he built himself on his private estate in Podolsk, south of Moscow, makes no attempt to glorify Nazi collaborators. But it has enraged the authorities by focusing on the relentless persecution that followed Russia’s 1917 Bolshevik revolution, creating fertile ground for anti-Soviet treachery during a war that cost 25 million Soviet lives. “What they really don’t like is that I make people think about what happened in the past and what is happening today,” Mr. Melikhov said. As a result, he has been denounced on state television as a traitor, Russian border guards have defaced his passport to prevent him from leaving the country, and he has faced a string of seemingly trumped-up criminal charges. Last week, a court in Podolsk found him guilty of illegal weapons possession and sentenced him to a year of “restricted freedom” — house arrest or some other limits on his movements. The hostility of the Russian state toward Mr. Melikhov is a measure of how the history of World War II, which Russians know as the Great Patriotic War, is a delicate topic — particularly at a time when Mr. Putin and his allies constantly refer to the conflict to fortify their legitimacy.

"Until last week, Travis Kalanick, a founder of Uber and its chief executive, ruled his company absolutely. That was the Silicon Valley way; ever since Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple in the 1980s, tech founders have demanded, and been awarded, enormous deference by investors and corporate boards. So even as successive waves of scandal have hit Uber, Mr. Kalanick’s position looked safe. Then, all of a sudden, it wasn’t. Amid many reforms, Mr. Kalanick announced a leave of absence last week and late Tuesday said he was resigning as Uber C.E.O. It is the swiftness of the fall that’s interesting here. In another time, Mr. Kalanick might have been able to hang on. But we live in an era dominated by the unyielding influence of social feeds. Every new Uber revelation ignited a massive campaign against the company on Twitter and Facebook. A swirl of negative branding took on a life of its own — and ultimately could not be ignored. The story is bigger than Uber. Online campaigns against brands have become one of the most powerful forces in business, giving customers a huge megaphone with which to shape corporate ethics and practices, and imperiling some of the most towering figures of media and industry. Look at how quickly Bill O’Reilly, the former Fox News host, was dispatched from the network after The New York Times dug into his history of sexual harassment settlements. The investigation inspired an online boycott against his advertisers, who, despite Mr. O’Reilly’s soaring ratings, began to drop him faster than day-old beef tartare. But the effects of these campaigns go beyond business. In a nation where politics have grown pitched and sclerotic, fighting brands online suddenly feels like the most effective political action many of us can take. Posting a hashtag — #deleteUber, for instance, or #grabyourwallet — and threatening to back it up by withholding dollars can bring about a much quicker, more visible change in the world than, say, calling your representative. Brand-focused online activism can work for every political side, too: Don’t like a New York theater company’s Trump-tinged production of Shakespeare in the Park? There’s a boycott for you, and Delta and Bank of America will give in. "
"WASHINGTON — Daniel Handel left his bachelor pad in the Truxton Circle neighborhood in 2011 to take an overseas post. Returning this May with a wife and two children in tow, he found the capital had changed as much as his family life had. Hipster coffee shops and gentrified homes have popped up around his old neighborhood. A real estate mogul is living in the White House. And house prices have skyrocketed. Forced to give up his search for a new home in the center of the city despite his $700,000 budget, Mr. Handel, 37, describes prices in the capital as “astronomical.” “I’m mystified,” he says. “There can’t be that many people making that much more than us. Who are these people who can afford these houses?” It is easy to think that it is caused by the influx of very wealthy people, some recruited by Mr. Trump to work in his administration, who have pushed prices up. The housing market in the capital sees a slight churn every four years as political appointees and staff members pass the baton after an election. Instead, Washington is beginning to suffer from a problem facing other American cities, like San Francisco. An influx of professionals is bidding on a limited supply of affordable homes. "
"ATLANTA — Karen Handel, a fixture in Georgia Republican politics, won surprisingly easily in Tuesday’s runoff to fill the House seat in suburban Atlanta vacated by Tom Price, the health and human services secretary. Ms. Handel turned back a well-funded Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, to keep a heavily conservative and affluent district in Republican hands. ■ Ms. Handel, 55, is a former chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission, the governing body for the most populous county in Georgia, and was elected Georgia secretary of state in 2006, overseeing the state’s elections. She ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor in 2010 and for the United States Senate in 2014. Democrats attacked her record, including increasing spending as secretary of state. But her frequent appearances on ballots in the Sixth District offered her an important name-identification advantage in the initial balloting in April. And in the runoff, Ms. Handel’s local reputation made it easier for her to forge a political identity separate from Mr. Trump. ■ Ms. Handel rarely mentioned the president’s name without being asked. While Mr. Trump narrowly carried the district last year, polls show a majority of the district’s voters view him unfavorably. While she appeared with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at fund-raisers, on the campaign trail, she preferred highlighting the Republican lineage of the district: Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker; Johnny Isakson, now a senator; and, eventually, Mr. Price all held the seat. Even when she spoke at a final get-out-the-vote rally with two of Mr. Trump’s cabinet appointees — Mr. Price and Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary — Ms. Handel ignored the president. ■ While Ms. Handel tried to keep her distance from the White House, she was the beneficiary of more than $12 million in spending from outside conservative groups during the runoff. And almost all of it was from House Republican-aligned organizations, which means that she owes her seat in no small part to Speaker Paul D. Ryan and his allies. "
"The Democrats fared far better in this spring’s special congressional elections than even the most optimistic Democrat might have guessed a few months ago. But in the end, they lost all four in Republican-held districts — including the hotly contested election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday. This contradiction is the heart of the challenge the party faces in 2018. Democrats will probably benefit from an extremely favorable political environment, as they do today. But the problem is they’re going uphill, even if the wind is strongly at their backs. The 2018 midterm elections will be decided in Republican-leaning terrain. Even a wave the size of the electoral tsunamis that swept Republicans out of power in 2006 and back into it 2010 would not guarantee the Democrats a House majority in 2018. Make no mistake: Despite the losses, these four special election results — in Kansas, Montana, Georgia and South Carolina — are very strong showings for the Democrats. Although there is room to debate the precise details, Democrats wouldn’t be considered favorites in any of the races they lost this spring. If anything, Democrats did better in these special elections than would have been expected, based on previous election results and even supposing that the national political environment was as hostile for Republicans as it was in 2006. That’s even true in Georgia’s Sixth, where Mitt Romney and the outgoing representative (Tom Price) won by 23 points, even though President Trump won by just 1.5 points. Democratic strength is not surprising, since all of the ingredients for a strong Democratic performance are in place. The president’s party just about always loses seats in the midterm elections, and it generally gets clobbered when the president’s approval rating is beneath 50 percent, much less beneath 40. "
"Forty-five years ago this month, a security guard named Frank Wills noticed some tape over a door lock at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate Complex in Washington. What Mr. Wills set in motion when he raised the alarm that led to the arrest of the Watergate burglars had huge consequences for our nation. In President Richard Nixon’s efforts to hide the truth of the Watergate burglary, it was paramount to stop the F.B.I. investigation. So the president enlisted the C.I.A. director and his deputy to intercede. When the F.B.I. director pushed back and the intelligence officers refused to continue the White House scheme, the cover-up began its slow unraveling. It took time. It was 16 months before Mr. Nixon topped that initial obstruction by firing the special prosecutor and the two senior Justice Department officers. And then, a few months later, it was disclosed that Mr. Nixon had underpaid his taxes for years, and he was forced to pay hundreds of thousands in restitution. All the while, Mr. Nixon’s defenders claimed the investigations were a partisan payback for his 1972 election victory. As the last living member of the Senate committee that investigated the Watergate affair, I am often asked about what similarities I see between the criminality of the Nixon operation and this hash of a presidency that is the Trump White House. My answer is that there is no comparison. Yet. Watergate was a multimillion-dollar enterprise of political spying, bribery, burglary, fraud and other criminal and unconstitutional activities run out of the White House over several years. As a result, some two dozen close associates of the president went to prison, and the president resigned to avoid impeachment proceedings. Mr. Nixon himself probably avoided prosecution only because of the pardon granted by his successor, President Gerald Ford. The scandal destroyed the Republican Party as we knew it. Remember, Watergate was years in the making. We are only months into the Trump administration. There is ample cause for concern, and I hear disturbing echoes of the past. "
"A few days ago I was at a conference in Montreal, and a Canadian gentleman, trying to grasp what’s happening to America, asked me a simple question: “What do you fear most these days?” I paused for a second, like a spectator waiting to see what would come out of my own mouth. Two things came out: “I fear we’re seeing the end of ‘truth’ — that we simply can’t agree any more on basic facts. And I fear that we’re becoming Sunnis and Shiites — we call them ‘Democrats’ and ‘Republicans,’ but the sectarianism that has destroyed nation-states in the Middle East is now infecting us.” It used to be that people didn’t want their kids to marry one of “them,” referring to someone of a different religion or race (bad enough). Now the “them” is someone of a different party. When a liberal comedian poses with a mock severed head of Donald Trump, when the president’s own son, Eric Trump, says of his father’s Democratic opponents, “To me, they’re not even people,” you know that you are heading to a dark place. So when I got home, I called my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, author of the book “How” and C.E.O. of LRN, which helps companies and leaders build ethical cultures, and asked him what he thought was happening to us. “What we’re experiencing is an assault on the very foundations of our society and democracy — the twin pillars of truth and trust,” Seidman responded. “What makes us Americans is that we signed up to have a relationship with ideals that are greater than us and with truths that we agreed were so self-evident they would be the foundation of our shared journey toward a more perfect union — and of respectful disagreement along the way. We also agreed that the source of legitimate authority to govern would come from ‘We the people.’” "
"I am not usually fond of the “this one chart explains everything” genre of political analysis, but every rule has exceptions, and I’m going to make one for a chart that accompanies a new survey on the 2016 election. It helps explain why Donald Trump won the presidency and why his administration is such a policy train wreck, why Democrats keep losing even though the country seems to be getting more liberal, and why populist surges are likely to be with us for a while — a trifecta of rather important explanations. The survey was conducted by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, with an accompanying report written by Lee Drutman, and it assesses voter sentiment along two axes: On the horizontal, economic issues, including welfare, entitlements, trade and inequality; on the vertical, moral/identity issues, from abortion and transgender rights to views of race, gender, immigration and Islam. The resulting chart, Figure 2 of the report, places voters into four quadrants — one consistently conservative, one consistently liberal, and then a more populist quadrant (for cultural conservatives who lean left on economics) and a more consistently libertarian quadrant (for social liberals who are fiscal conservatives). Three things leap out. The first is the diversity of opinion within the Trump coalition about economics. Americans who voted Republican in 2016 tend to embrace some form of social conservatism, but on economic policy they lean only slightly to the right — spreading out across the economically liberal/socially conservative quadrant as well as the consistently conservative one. Indeed, the typical Republican voter’s views on economics and the safety net are relatively close to the center of public opinion as a whole. This reflects both a longstanding trend and a Trump-driven shift. The Republican Party as an institution, or at least its congressional incarnation, has long been well to the right of its own voters on economics, very few of whom vote G.O.P. for strict libertarian reasons. But Trump, by breaking more starkly than past Republican insurgents with party orthodoxy on trade, entitlements and health care, was able to first exploit this tension in the primary campaign — rallying populist Republican voters against their own establishment — and then to win over populist-leaning independents who had previously voted for Barack Obama. But this victory, in turn, made the gap between Republican orthodoxy and the party’s coalition that much wider … which could have been an opportunity for the Trump administration to successfully reconfigure the party’s agenda, but instead, because he’s Trump, has just led to political malpractice and general disarray. "
"We do not know a lot about what is in the health care bill that Republicans are trying to rush through the Senate, but what we do know suggests it will be as bad or worse than the dreadful legislation that the House passed in May. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is doing everything he can to keep the public in the dark about his plan to undo major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. But Washington being Washington, a few details have become public. All are alarming and depressing. And as they emerge, and the public unveiling of the bill grows closer — it could come on Thursday — the need for a few wise Republicans to stand with Senate Democrats to say “no” becomes ever more urgent. One provision under consideration in the Senate, according to news reports, would reduce federal spending on Medicaid more than the Dickensian House version does. That would put even more pressure on states to reduce care for the nearly 75 million people who benefit from that program. Another change would make it much easier for states to let insurance companies sell policies that do not cover treatments like chemotherapy or drugs like insulin, leaving people with pre-existing health problems and those who become sick worse off. Whatever their differences, the Senate and House versions have this in common: a callous disregard for the health care of millions of people plus a kind of frantic wish to pass something, no matter how destructive and poorly thought out, that lets President Trump and other Republicans claim that they have repealed Obamacare.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Even two steps away from the Saudi throne, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 31-year-old son of the king, had already pushed the titanic state oil company toward a public offering, loosened some social restrictions that rankled young people and waded into a costly war in Yemen with no plans for how to end it. Now, Prince Mohammed stands to inherit a kingdom he has already shaken, after King Salman of Saudi Arabia named him crown prince on Wednesday. In doing so, the king swept aside his son’s older rival, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, upending decades of royal custom and profoundly reordering the kingdom’s inner power structure. The move further empowers a young and ambitious leader while Saudi Arabia, a close American ally, is grappling with huge challenges, including low oil prices and intensifying hostilities both with Iran and in its own circle of Sunni Arab states. In favoring his son over Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is respected for his security acumen, the king, who is 81, also marginalized a large cadre of older princes, many with foreign educations and decades of government experience that the younger prince lacks. If Prince Mohammed bin Salman does succeed his father, he could give Saudi Arabia what it has not seen in more than a half-century: a young king with the potential to rule for decades. Prince Mohammed’s swift rise and growing influence had already rankled other princes who accused him of undermining Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. But such complaints are likely to remain private in a ruling family that prizes stability above all else. “A lot of people are happy that a younger generation is coming to power, but those who are upset are the older generation,” who are not used to such dramatic change, said Joseph A. Kechichian, a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, who has extensive contacts inside the family. “Even if people are uncomfortable, at the end of the day this is a monarchical decision, and people will either have to accept the new arrangement or they will essentially have to keep their mouths shut.” "

"HONG KONG — After years of predictions that cars sold in the West would bear the “Made in China” label, the time has finally come. Ford Motor’s plans to build its popular Focus compact cars in China, rather than Michigan or Mexico, is a milestone in China’s automotive rise. Chinese auto industry leaders praised the move as long-awaited confirmation that the country’s factories have become as efficient and high-quality as those in the United States and Europe. The question now is how political leaders greet the development, amid rising skepticism in the United States over Chinese trade policies and the benefits of free trade in general. Though the White House so far has been muted in its reaction to Ford’s move, President Trump in particular was strongly critical of Chinese trade policies during his campaign last year. China’s high tariffs on imported cars and auto parts have already emerged as a potential trade issue. “Ford’s moving production to China shows China’s competitiveness in manufacturing is continuously increasing and our industrial supply chain is improving,” said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, a government-backed trade group in Beijing. “But this is obviously against Trump’s policies — it is quite complicated and may cause some friction in Sino-American trade in the future.” China represents a competitive challenge and a profitable opportunity for American carmakers. China is already the world’s largest automaker, with annual car production roughly equal to that of the United States and Japan combined. Chinese players have long wanted to develop underused factories dotting major cities to increase production and export the excess. For years, it has been a quixotic dream. Such factories tend to churn out lower-quality, domestic-brand rides that would not pass muster with American or European consumers. "
"HONG KONG — State-run newspapers in Vietnam and China reported in recent days that senior military officials from the two countries would hold a fence-mending gathering along a border where their militaries fought a brief but bloody war in 1979. But Tuesday, the scheduled start of the gathering, came and went without any of the coverage in the state news media that readers in the two countries had expected. The Chinese Defense Ministry later said in a terse statement that it had canceled the event “for reasons related to working arrangements.” Analysts, citing government sources, said that the Chinese delegation had unexpectedly cut short a trip to Vietnam after tempers flared during a closed-door discussion on disputed territories in the South China Sea. The cancellation is highly unusual for the two Communist neighbors, and it comes as Beijing continues to build artificial islands in the South China Sea, where the Chinese seek to expand their military influence at a time of uncertainty over President Trump’s policies in the region. “This was not what the Vietnamese expected from a polite guest,” said Alexander L. Vuving, a Vietnam specialist at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. “You can say both sides miscalculated,” he added. But another interpretation is that both countries are “very committed to showing the other their own resolve” on matters of territorial sovereignty. "
"Democrats scrambled to regroup on Wednesday after a disappointing special election defeat in Georgia, with lawmakers, activists and labor leaders speaking out in public and private to demand a more forceful economic message heading into the 2018 elections. Among Democrats in Washington, the setback in Georgia revived or deepened a host of existing grievances about the party, accentuating tensions between moderate lawmakers and liberal activists and prompting some Democrats to question the leadership and political strategy of Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader. A small group of Democrats who have been critical of Ms. Pelosi in the past again pressed her to step down on Wednesday. And in a private meeting of Democratic lawmakers, Representative Tony Cárdenas of California, Ms. Pelosi’s home state, suggested the party should have a more open conversation about her effect on its political fortunes. But the most acute and widely expressed concerns were economic. Speaking after a meeting of the Democratic caucus on Wednesday morning, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the party was preparing to be “aggressively focused on job creation and economic growth.” And Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, who represents an affluent district near New York City, said Democrats must do more to compete with what he described as expansive and unrealistic promises by President Trump. “It’s not enough to say, ‘I want jobs,’” Mr. Himes said. “You need more than that, particularly when you’re competing with a guy who is telling fantasies.” Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan called for Democrats to go “on offense” and attack the president’s perceived strength on economic matters with working-class voters.

"BEIJING — The short, unexpected honeymoon that China enjoyed with President Trump seems to be in trouble, dashing hopes in Beijing that the two countries had embarked on a new, businesslike relationship. Mr. Trump’s assertion that China had failed to pressure North Korea into curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile program means that Beijing must now confront the prospect of a stormier relationship ahead — not just over North Korea but also tougher stands on trade, currency and the South China Sea that Mr. Trump set aside as he sought President Xi Jinping’s help with Pyongyang. “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter this week, ahead of a high-level meeting of Chinese and American officials on Wednesday in Washington, signaling a harder line. Mr. Trump did not detail what might follow that conclusion, but the options on the table with North Korea — including more coercive sanctions that could target Chinese companies trading with the country, a military buildup and even the use of force — are all deeply objectionable to Beijing. At the same time, Mr. Trump had previously suggested he was holding off on getting tough on China’s trade policies in return for Mr. Xi’s help with reining in North Korea, often engaging in public flattery of the leader. Now, Mr. Xi and his colleagues in Beijing must ask — again — whether Mr. Trump is serious about the threats he made on the campaign trail. The prospect of a rockier relationship is particularly sensitive now as Mr. Xi prepares to preside over the Communist Party’s 19th National Party Congress in the fall. While Mr. Xi’s re-election to a second five-year term as president is not in doubt, he is said to want to use the gathering to consolidate his authority and reshuffle the leadership, and he does not want any foreign crises to be distractions.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Democrats just can’t seem to win an election in the Trump era. With last night’s losses in Georgia and South Carolina, Democratic House candidates are zero-for-four in special elections against Republicans this year. It’s easy to look at this pattern and think that Democrats are doing something fundamentally wrong — that they can’t close the deal with voters and are destined to keep coming up short in next year’s midterms. But if that’s the easy conclusion, it’s also the wrong one. Politically, Democrats are doing fine for a party out of power. It obviously would have been better to have won one of last night’s races, especially given the hopes in Georgia. But the party still has a real chance to retake the House next year. A disappointing loss doesn’t change that fact. I hesitate to use sports analogies, because a lot of readers are not sports fans. I hope you’ll permit one in this case, though, because it’s the most clarifying comparison I’m aware of. For years, sports fans and athletes believed that some teams “knew how to win” — and found out a way to pull out close games — while others tended to choke. It certainly seemed to make sense to anyone who watched or played sports. You can see how the analogy applies to recent politics, right? "
"LONDON — Last Friday was the first anniversary of the assassination of Jo Cox, the British member of Parliament who was killed by Thomas Mair, now serving life in prison for her murder. “This is for Britain,” he shouted as he stabbed and shot to death Ms. Cox, a 41-year-old Labour Party politician and mother of two, a week before the Brexit referendum. As shocking as this attack was, it did not come without precedent. In recent years, there have been noticeable upticks in far-right violence, even if its frequency and deadliness have often been overshadowed by the more high-profile attacks claimed by the Islamic State. The frequency of far-right attacks is particularly significant in the United States, where white supremacist, anti-government and neo-Nazi extremists have been responsible for 73 percent of deadly terrorist attacks since Sept. 11, 2001, according to the Government Accountability Office. Also notable is that in many cases, Muslims have become the target of violence. In February 2015, three young Muslims were shot to death in Chapel Hill, N.C., by a 46-year-old man named Craig Stephen Hicks (an F.B.I. report on whether this was a hate crime has not been released). In April 2015, Robert Doggart of Tennessee was arrested in connection with a plot to recruit a militia group and attack a Muslim community in New York State. In 2016, a Ku Klux Klan member, Glendon Scott Crawford, was convicted of plotting to kill a large number of Muslims with radiation. In May, prosecutors say, two men were stabbed to death on a train in Portland, Ore., by a white nationalist named Jeremy Joseph Christian after they intervened when he harassed two young women, one of whom was wearing a hijab, with an anti-Muslim tirade. After a series of terrorist incidents in Britain either claimed or inspired by the Islamic State, in the early hours of Monday the driver of a van hit a group of men who had just attended prayers at a mosque in Finsbury Park, North London. The suspect, who was quickly subdued and arrested, reportedly shouted that he wanted to “kill all Muslims.” His crude method of attack mimicked a terrorist technique recommended by the Islamic State. While attacks by violent jihadists understandably command the most attention, we need to be wary of ignoring the threat from those radicalized by an increasingly well-connected and mobilized far right. The ideologies of these movements are symbiotic, with both sides playing off a fear of the other to tailor their messages and attract new audiences. Left unchecked, competing outrages and persecution narratives could lead to a cascade of radicalization, in which extremists on each side feed the other’s growth. "
"During the months of snarled traffic, choked sidewalks and tightened police checkpoints that clogged the streets of Manhattan around Trump Tower after the building’s best-known resident was elected president, Charelric Lenglain noticed a dismaying change in the foot traffic to his nearby salon. Namely, hardly anyone came for a haircut. This spring, Mr. Lenglain, who said he had lost over 40 percent of his business, shut down the salon, Charelric Coiffure. As many small businesses in the shadow of the gleaming black tower on Fifth Avenue have found, customers were turned off by the turmoil, which persisted long after Donald J. Trump took office in Washington: Security measures stayed in place for his wife, Melania, who remained in their triplex penthouse while their son, Barron, finished school. Now that school has ended, the family has reunited at the White House, and the security vise is loosening around the base of the tower, which stands between 57th and 56th Streets. Tourists can peer up without being herded along so aggressively by the police. And strangled businesses are creeping back to normalcy. Yet for some, the toll of the past six months was too great. In May, Mr. Lenglain reopened blocks away on 59th Street and Central Park West, where he is trying to rebuild his client base. “If he comes back or not, it’s not going to influence my clients coming to me,” he said of Mr. Trump. . “I was having to deal with the police and the inspectors and the motorcades and the barricade.” Moving was an obvious choice: Even with security loosened, Mr. Lenglain said, there was always a chance the president would return to Trump Tower. Now, he said, “I’m totally relieved.” "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, has a contentious relationship with the news media — but he’s pretty popular among the late-night hosts. He provides a hefty share of their material, after all. So the news that the White House is seeking a replacement for him made the hosts almost wistful on Tuesday. Stephen Colbert even led the “Late Show” crowd in an affectionate chant of “Sean! Sean!” After hearing that President Trump had refused to meet with his advisory council on H.I.V. and AIDS, James Corden said the president might care just a little bit more about the disease if he saw the Oscar-winning 1993 film “Philadelphia.” So he sent nearly 300 copies to Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Colbert reacted to news that parts of the country were posting record heat levels. “The temperature is so high in Phoenix, Ariz., that flights are being canceled because it’s too hot for planes,” he said. Trevor Noah tried his hand at old-fashioned fear-mongering. Jimmy Kimmel imagined what Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods might mean for the in-store experience. On Monday, Seth Rogen and Mr. Colbert had some fun on Twitter, sending direct messages to Donald Trump Jr. On Wednesday, Mr. Rogen will talk to James Corden on “The Late Late Show.” There’s a new ratings system for TV shows and movies, aimed at combating gender stereotypes.

"To the Editor: Re “Republicans Win a Race in Georgia Drenched in Cash” (front page, June 21): Jon Ossoff’s loss in Georgia, on the heels of previous Democratic special election losses since President Trump took office, should wake liberals up. While they should take encouragement that their candidates, running in traditionally conservative districts, lost by only single-digit margins, they still need to face the fact that a critical mass of American voters still feels no particular need to rebuke Mr. Trump. Therefore, continuing to run primarily on a platform of, essentially, “join us in fighting the president and his agenda” is a dead end. Instead Democrats need to take a page from the Bernie Sanders playbook and sell voters on a message of “here’s a better alternative, here’s the better world we want to create with you rather than what the president is offering.” It’s the difference between Apple’s saying “Android is an awful phone, don’t you want to get rid of it?” and Apple’s putting out a new iPhone with better features that everyone wants to buy. DAVID NURENBERG
SOMERVILLE, MASS. To the Editor: The left is starting to get the message after four congressional losses in special elections: We have met the enemy and it is us. Democrats threw tens of millions at Jon Ossoff, their 30-year-old newbie candidate, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide who lives outside of Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. Mr. Ossoff couldn’t even vote for himself. The vast majority of his campaign contributions came from outside Georgia. The left also underestimated Karen Handel, a seasoned political gladiator and former Georgia secretary of state. Georgians saw the “wolf in sheep’s clothing” carpetbagger and gave Ms. Handel a resounding victory. "
"Tucked inside the Republican bill to replace Obamacare is a plan to impose a radical diet on a 52-year-old program that insures nearly one in five Americans. The bill, of course, would modify changes to the health system brought by the Affordable Care Act. But it would also permanently restructure Medicaid, which covers tens of millions of poor or disabled Americans, including millions who are living in nursing homes with conditions like Alzheimer’s or the aftereffects of a stroke. “This is the most consequential change in 50 years for low-income people’s health care,” said Joan Alker, the executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. “This is a massive change that has hardly been discussed.” Since its founding, Medicaid has operated as a partnership between the federal government and the states. Each pays a share of patients’ medical bills, with no overall limit on spending. The American Health Care Act would try to slim down  the federal share of that spending, by limiting how much the federal government would pay for each person enrolled in the program. The Senate version of the legislation, expected this week, is likely to make the payments still leaner in later years. The results, according to independent analyses, would be major reductions in federal spending on Medicaid over time. States would be left deciding whether to raise more money to make up the difference, or to cut back on medical coverage for people using the program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the changes would lead to a reduction in spending on Medicaid of more than $800 billion over a decade. (That figure also includes additional cuts to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.) "
"LONDON — Before she lost her parliamentary majority in elections this month, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain harbored bold ambitions to reshape her country’s politics, promising to reach out to working-class voters who were left behind by globalization and struggling to get by. But on Wednesday, Mrs. May jettisoned much of her policy agenda, putting forward a slimmed down legislative program intended to minimize the risk of defeats in Parliament while focusing on Britain’s departure from the European Union, a process known as Brexit. Her authority shattered by the election debacle, Mrs. May is fighting for survival. Despite days of negotiations to secure support for her minority government from 10 lawmakers from the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, there was still no agreement on Wednesday. Having already postponed by two days the Queen’s Speech to Parliament, in which the monarch outlines the government’s coming legislation, Mrs. May proceeded without an accord with the D.U.P., and in the knowledge that any contentious bill risks defeat. Queen Elizabeth II’s role in presenting the agenda is a significant ceremonial duty. Buckingham Palace announced Wednesday morning that the queen’s husband, Prince Philip, had been hospitalized Tuesday night “as a precautionary measure, for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition.” Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, accompanied the queen to Parliament in place of Prince Philip for a ceremony that was, by British standards, relatively light on pomp. Because the June 8 snap election provided little time for preparation, the monarch arrived by car, not carriage, and wore a hat rather than a crown (though the crown traveled in a separate vehicle to Parliament in accordance with protocol). The queen’s choice of headgear became an unexpected talking point with a number of posts on Twitter claiming it bore striking similarities to the European Union flag. "
"If a conservative makes history, asked Donald Trump Jr., does she make a sound? Celebrating Karen Handel’s win in a special House election in Georgia, Mr. Trump complained that the significance of her victory was hardly noted. Ms. Handel defeated her Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, in the closely watched contest, the most expensive House campaign ever. The race made history in campaign finance; did Ms. Handel do the same for women in Georgia politics? It depends on what Mr. Trump meant by “Rep.” If the abbreviation stood for representative, he’s off by about 95 years. Georgia first sent a woman, Rebecca Latimer Felton, to Congress in 1922. A political activist, writer, suffragist and the first female senator, Mrs. Felton was appointed to fill a vacancy by a governor who supported the 19th Amendment. She served just a day, giving her the distinction of also having the shortest term of service. According to her Senate biography, she concluded her only Senate speech with a nod to gender equality. “When the women of the country come in and sit with you,” she said, “you will get ability, you will get integrity of purpose, you will get exalted patriotism, and you will get unstinted usefulness.” Since Mrs. Felton’s term, Georgia’s congressional delegation, like the rest of Congress, has been overwhelmingly male. Just five women from Georgia have served in Congress since then. The state’s first female representative, Florence Reville Gibbs, was voted into office in 1940, through a special election called after the death of her husband. She was followed by Helen Douglas Mankin in 1946, Iris Faircloth Blitch in 1955, Cynthia McKinney in 1993 and Denise Majette in 2003. If Mr. Trump meant Republican, he would have been more accurate. All of Ms. Handel’s female predecessors in Georgia have been Democrats, and no woman currently represents the state. But this definitive moment for Republican women hasn’t gone unnoticed. National and local news outlets alike have written about Ms. Handel making history. Ms. Handel’s victory merits celebration for bringing the number of women in Congress to the highest ever at 105, said Kelly Dittmar of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. But that increase was marginal, from 19.4 percent to 19.6 percent, she added, and bears a reminder that women are still underrepresented in politics. The congresswoman proudly noted the historical import herself in her victory speech, as The Times reported. “I am also very well aware of another obligation that comes with tonight’s decision by the voters, the obligation of being the first Republican woman elected to Congress from the great state of Georgia,” she said Tuesday night. “Tonight reminds us — it reminds me — that anything is possible.” A century earlier, in 1917, America’s first female representative was sworn in: Jeannette Rankin of Montana, also a Republican. “I may be the first woman member of Congress,” Ms. Rankin said upon her election. “But I won’t be the last.” "
"Imagine the late-night talk-show hosts as a ragtag band of Allied soldiers — a dirty half-dozen or so — assigned to take out Donald Trump. Stephen Colbert, the bookish commander.

"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo waded into the debate on immigration policy on Wednesday when he pardoned a Colombian undocumented immigrant facing deportation for a crime that was decades old. The act may have effectively erased the rationale for the man’s removal by eliminating his criminal conviction. The man, Carlos Cardona, 48, entered the United States illegally by crossing the border with Mexico. He is a co-owner of a construction business in Queens, and he was a volunteer after the World Trade Center attacks, sifting through and clearing out the rubble at ground zero. The time he spent in the debris resulted in a severe lung condition from which he still suffers, his lawyer, Rajesh Barua, said. As a young man, according to Mr. Barua, Mr. Cardona briefly fell in with a rough crowd, and in 1990 he pleaded guilty to selling a small amount of cocaine to an undercover officer, a crime for which he spent 45 days in jail. That conviction precluded him from obtaining legal status over the 31 years he has lived New York City, although he is married to a United States citizen. After he missed a court date for an immigration hearing in 2001, an order was issued for his deportation by the Department of Homeland Security’s department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But because his illness stems from his volunteering in Lower Manhattan, which earned him medical care through a federal program for those sickened by the aftermath of the attacks, the department permitted him to stay. He was required to check in periodically with the immigration authorities. On Feb. 28, just days after the Trump administration issued a memorandum that said the removal of undocumented immigrants convicted of a crime was a priority, Mr. Cardona was detained at a check-in at Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan. He has been in detention since then; he is now at Hudson Correctional Facility in Kearny, N.J. He is just one of a number of people with similar histories whom the administration has moved to deport in recent months. The governor’s pardon came after Mr. Cardona applied to a clemency program that was revitalized by Mr. Cuomo over the last two years. Since 2015, the government has spread the word, pitching the program to lawyers and advocacy organizations as a possible way to thwart deportation for those with old convictions. Since Mr. Trump’s election, applications have increased, Alphonso David, the governor’s counsel, said. "
"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration feared that acknowledging Russian meddling in the 2016 election would reveal too much about intelligence gathering and be interpreted as “taking sides” in the race, the former secretary of homeland security said Wednesday. “One of the candidates, as you recall, was predicting that the election was going to be ‘rigged’ in some way,” said Jeh Johnson, the former secretary, referring to President Trump’s unsubstantiated accusation before Election Day. “We were concerned that by making the statement we might, in and of itself, be challenging the integrity of the election process itself.” Mr. Johnson’s testimony, before the House Intelligence Committee, provided a fresh insight into how the Obama administration tried to balance politically explosive information with the public’s need to know. That question also vexed federal law enforcement officials investigating Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Mr. Johnson said he became increasingly concerned about the vulnerabilities of the nation’s election infrastructure, particularly after the hacking at the Democratic National Committee last summer. The administration formally accused the Russian government of hacking into emails from the D.N.C. and other institutions and individuals on Oct. 7. He said he considered having elections systems designated as “critical infrastructure,” a classification that would allow for the same cybersecurity protections available to the financial services and transportation sectors. But the reactions to that idea, at least from several state election officials who control elections, “ranged from neutral to negative,” Mr. Johnson said. "
"WASHINGTON — The 66-year-old gunman who opened fire one week ago on members of Congress at a Northern Virginia ball field most likely acted spontaneously, the F.B.I. said Wednesday, describing his increasing desperation in recent weeks as he moved halfway across the country, unemployed, living in a van and facing a crumbling marriage and anger management problems. Investigators cautioned that they had not settled on a motive for James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill., who was killed in an early morning firefight with police officers on June 14. They said that he had no links to terrorism and that he acted alone. But a lengthy statement from the F.B.I. provided the most complete picture to date of Mr. Hodgkinson’s time in Virginia, where he moved in the weeks before the shooting. “He was struggling in all kinds of different ways,” Timothy R. Slater, a senior F.B.I. agent at the Washington Field Office, said during a news conference. “I think he was struggling in a lot of aspects of his life.” Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, one of the shooting victims, improved to fair condition and was starting rehabilitation, MedStar Washington Hospital Center officials said Wednesday. They had said previously that Mr. Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, had been at “imminent risk of death.” Mr. Hodgkinson began firing on members of Congress and others at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Va., as they practiced for the annual congressional charity baseball game. Mr. Scalise, 51, was gravely wounded after a rifle bullet tore through his hip. Since then, he has steadily improved. "
"The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, made a vigorous and urgent argument this week to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Speaking on the Senate floor Monday and Tuesday, he argued that drafting a replacement bill behind closed doors is not unusual, and discussed various criticisms of Obamacare. Here is an assessment. Referring to a recent report from the Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. McConnell claimed that “nearly two million Americans” opted out of public health care exchanges, “and the most common reason they cited for doing so was because it was too expensive.” In his statement, Mr. McConnell was referring to mostly people who picked a plan, but then never took the final step of paying a premium and enrolling — not people who left the exchanges after paying for insurance. Of the 12.2 million people who signed up for a plan by the end of open enrollment on January 31, according to the H.H.S. report, 10.3 million had actually paid for their coverage by February — a difference of 1.9 million. But in the past, H.H.S. has estimated the number of people who paid for coverage by March. It is unclear why the government has chosen to limit the data to February this year, but the methodological difference can be significant. Those who signed up for a health care plan in the last two weeks of January — 500,000 this year, by one estimate — did not actually have to pay until March. So it is premature to assume they all canceled their coverage. Mr. McConnell’s claim that the “most common reason” for cancellations was high cost is also exaggerated. "
"LEAWOOD, Kan. — Tucked away in a sleepy office park in this Kansas City suburb, a $26 billion investment advisory firm is helping drive Wall Street’s latest wealth boom. Inside, there are no televisions tuned to CNBC and there is hardly a Bloomberg terminal to be seen. There is a dentist on the top floor. The boss drives a Honda. Yet the company, Creative Planning, is at the vanguard of a profound shift in finance: the move away from brokers and mutual fund companies peddling products for a fee, and toward firms offering truly independent, low-cost investment advice. These firms, known as registered investment advisers, number about 30,000 and can manage as little as $1 million and as much as $70 billion. They now oversee about $4.5 trillion in assets. That is about $1 trillion more than what hedge funds administer, and with no sign that this growth will diminish anytime soon, independent advisers — with their vast exposure to “sticky” retirement money throughout the country — have become crucial distribution channels for the biggest names in the industry, including BlackRock, Vanguard, Pimco and Goldman Sachs. As the independent advice industry has grown, Creative Planning has grown faster, with assets exploding to $26.2 billion today from just $34 million in 2004. Peter Mallouk, an estate planning attorney who started the business with an eye toward servicing medical professionals in suburban Kansas City, now oversees a national fleet of wealth advisers in more than 30 states.

"The chief foreign affairs correspondent of The Wall Street Journal was fired on Wednesday after evidence surfaced that he had become entangled in the business dealings of an Iranian-born aviation titan who was one of his key sources. The correspondent, Jay Solomon, was a highly regarded veteran of The Journal and Washington diplomatic circles, and his dismissal came as a shock to the paper’s newsroom. Shortly after the firing was announced, The Associated Press published a report detailing Mr. Solomon’s communications with Farhad Azima, an Iranian-born businessman, about a venture that at times involved aerial espionage in Iran and the sale of defense equipment to the United Arab Emirates. It was unclear if Mr. Solomon ever formally entered into a commercial arrangement or received compensation tied to Mr. Azima, according to The A.P. In a statement to The A.P., Mr. Solomon conceded “mistakes in my reporting” and apologized to his colleagues. “I never entered into any business with Farhad Azima, nor did I intend to,” he said. “But I understand why the emails and the conversations I had with Mr. Azima may look like I was involved in some seriously troubling activities.” "

"Russia made it a crime to facilitate doping, devoted more money to drug-testing the nation’s athletes and laid out a plan to establish mandatory antidoping education classes. President Vladimir V. Putin has called those changes — inspired by the threat of major sanctions for systematic doping — “enormous work based on the principles of clean sport.” But no matter how enormous the pre-emptive measures Russia may take, the nation will not completely stave off sanctions, Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said this week. “We have the impression that some in Russia were thinking by addressing the issues for the future, the past would be forgotten,” Mr. Bach said in an interview at The New York Times on Tuesday, just ahead of a meeting in Washington at the White House with President Trump. “You cannot forget what happened in Sochi,” Mr. Bach said. “We have made clear that the past — what happened there — has to be sanctioned.” Mr. Bach would not predict the severity of the punishment, citing the continuing work of two Olympic commissions that are scrutinizing the implicated athletes and government officials. Those commissions are taking into account the extensive evidence laid out by Richard McLaren, an investigator who spent much of last year corroborating the testimony of Russia’s former national antidoping lab chief, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov. Dr. Rodchenkov set off an international sports scandal ahead of last year’s Rio Olympics by detailing how he and Russia’s Federal Security Service had helped the nation’s Olympians use banned, performance-enhancing steroids throughout the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia.

"The nation’s top consumer regulatory agency is seeking to hold a South Carolina housing finance company in contempt for moving too slowly to respond to a judge’s order that it turn over documents and audio recordings. A federal judge on Tuesday referred the matter to a United States magistrate judge for a hearing. The unusual legal maneuver by the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to hold National Asset Advisors and a related company in contempt shows that the agency is proceeding with an investigation into businesses associated with the sale of homes to lower-income borrowers with seller financing. The move also indicates that the bureau, which was established after the 2008 financial crisis, is not backing down even as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress support proposals that would greatly reduce its enforcement powers. The agency has sought to enforce in court compliance with subpoenas in about eight matters, but this is the first time it has sought to hold a company in contempt for not complying with a judge’s order. Conservative critics have complained that some of the agency’s investigatory subpoenas are too burdensome on businesses and amount to document grabs. But the bureau’s supporters said the subpoenas, or civil investigative demands, were an important tool for regulators. “Despite efforts by banks to kill the agency, they are not backing away from their mission of preventing Americans from getting ripped off by financial firms,” said Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy with the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group in Washington. The motion for contempt arises from a court battle with National Asset Advisors and Harbour Portfolio Advisors, one of the nation’s largest sellers of homes on contracts for deed — a type of seller financing usually aimed at low-income consumers who cannot qualify for conventional mortgages. The consumer bureau filed a lawsuit last year in federal court in Michigan to require Harbour Portfolio Advisors and National Asset Advisors to comply with a subpoena seeking information about Harbour’s sale of rundown homes to thousands of people in more than a dozen states.

"The United Nations secretary general appears to have softened his predecessor’s criticism of Iran last year over its missile tests, a volatile issue in Iran’s relationships with other powers, including Israel and the United States. The milder language is contained in a report by the secretary general, António Guterres, to the United Nations Security Council that has not yet been released. A softening of the criticism would be significant partly because the United States has called Iran’s missile tests unacceptable. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Iran in February and May in response to what it described as “bad behavior” with respect to the tests. Mr. Guterres’s relatively mild language in a passage of the report concerning those tests could complicate any American-led effort to further penalize Iran for them at the United Nations. A copy of the report, dated June 14, was seen by The New York Times on Wednesday. The tests are not prohibited under the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six major powers, which eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for its verifiable promises of peaceful nuclear work. But Security Council Resolution 2231, which put the agreement into effect, called on Iran not to test ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House is quietly lobbying House Republicans to weaken a bill overwhelmingly passed by the Senate last week that would slap tough new sanctions on Russia for its meddling in the 2016 election and allow Congress to block any future move by President Trump to lift any penalties against Moscow. The effort is designed to head off an awkward and politically damaging veto fight between the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress on Russia at a time when Mr. Trump is laboring under the shadow of multiple investigations about his campaign’s potential collusion with Moscow. House Republicans, normally hawkish on Russia, face a choice between demonstrating a hard line against Moscow in the face of its misconduct and sparing their own president a potentially embarrassing confrontation. On Tuesday, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, lodged a procedural objection that effectively halted the measure in the House, and could force it to be redrafted. But there is bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for insisting on harsh sanctions on Russia, whose meddling in the 2016 election has only reinforced many lawmakers’ disdain for its president, Vladimir V. Putin, and it is not yet clear whether the White House can muster enough support in Congress to change the measure. Democrats are intensifying pressure on House Republicans to quickly clear the bill, part of a package that was appended to sanctions against Iran, that passed the Senate last week by a vote of 98 to 2. “I hope we don’t water them down,” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida and the chairwoman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said of the sanctions. “We need to keep them as tough as we can. I don’t know how successful we’ll be.” "
"WASHINGTON — The capital power brokers filed into an elementary school lot, beyond barricades covered in wrinkled advertisements. On the diamond, the players warmed up beside a giant-headed Abraham Lincoln mascot with a slightly menacing smile. Off it, heavily armed security guards lined the grounds. “It has that small-town feel to it,” said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida and a semi-reluctant outfielder in Wednesday evening’s annual softball game between the women of Congress and the women of the Fourth Estate. “It just feels like Anytown, U.S.A.” It doesn’t, exactly. But for a moment, in this city of irrepressible cynicism and occasionally rose-colored outfield sunglasses, it could look like it, at least for the game’s truest believers. For the second time in two weeks, a collection of proudly self-identifying members of the Washington establishment — elected officials, journalists and generally well-meaning creatures of the Trump-era swamp — gathered at a ball field for a showdown that felt more meaningful than usual. Last week, the Congressional Baseball Game drew more than 24,000 people to Nationals Park to watch Democratic lawmakers prevail over their Republican counterparts. The game was held the day after a gunman opened fire at the Republican team’s practice in Alexandria, Va., striking four people, including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip. Mr. Scalise is still recovering; MedStar Washington Hospital Center said Wednesday that his condition had been upgraded to “fair” and that he was making “good progress.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump wasted no time on Wednesday calling the newly named crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman. Less than 24 hours after King Salman elevated Prince Mohammed, his 31-year-old son, Mr. Trump offered congratulations and celebrated the monarchy’s cooperation in rooting out terrorist financing and other issues. Even more than Karen Handel, the Republican who won a hotly contested House seat in a special election in Georgia this week, Prince Mohammed was Mr. Trump’s anointed candidate — in this case, for the byzantine struggle to control the House of Saud. Mr. Trump views Prince Mohammed as a crucial ally in his effort to cement a Sunni Muslim alliance in the Persian Gulf. The prince, who also serves as the Saudi defense minister, favors a confrontational line toward Iran, which dovetails with the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward Tehran. And he is spearheading Saudi Arabia’s embargo of neighboring Qatar, which Mr. Trump has praised because he, like the Saudis, accuses the Qataris of financing extremist groups. The young prince is also a favorite of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner began cultivating Prince Mohammed soon after Mr. Trump’s election. When the prince visited Washington in March, he dined with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, at their home. When the couple joined Mr. Trump on his visit to Saudi Arabia last month, the prince hosted Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump for a dinner at his house. “There’s a certain compatibility there,” said Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The president and his entourage think fellow billionaires who have an itch to get things done make the world go ‘round.” Mr. Kushner and Prince Mohammed, senior officials said, worked closely together to choreograph Mr. Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia, which yielded a renewed commitment by dozens of Arab and Muslim leaders to combat extremism in their countries and to turn off the financial spigot to extremist groups.

"WASHINGTON — Abortion flared up Wednesday as the latest hot-button issue to complicate passage of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which Senate Republican leaders hope to unveil on Thursday and pass next week. The repeal bill approved last month by the House would bar the use of federal tax credits to help purchase insurance plans that include coverage of abortion. But senators said that provision might have to be jettisoned from their version because of complicated Senate rules that Republicans are using to expedite passage of the bill and avoid a filibuster. If that provision is dropped, a bill that has already elicited deep misgivings among moderate Republicans — and stiff resistance from Democrats, health care providers and patient advocacy groups — could also generate concern among abortion opponents, as well as conservative lawmakers. Further complicating the measure’s prospects, insurance companies, which took a leading role in the health care fights of 1993-94 and 2009-10 but have been conspicuously quiet this year, released a blistering letter objecting to Republican plans to remake Medicaid and cut its funding. The changes being considered in Congress could “amount to a 25 percent shortfall in covering the actual cost of providing care to our nation’s neediest citizens,” the top executives of 10 insurance companies wrote this week. “These amounts spell deep cuts, not state flexibilities, in Medicaid.” As senators struggle to develop a health care bill, their handiwork appears to be too moderate for some Senate conservatives and too conservative for some Senate moderates. The latest version, without the abortion-coverage prohibition and with steep Medicaid cuts, may prove unacceptable to some in both camps. To pass it, Senate leaders can afford to lose only two Republican votes of the 52 in the chamber. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has come under growing pressure to open negotiations on a temporary freeze on North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests in return for reducing the American military footprint in the Korean Peninsula, according to American officials and foreign diplomats. Versions of the proposal, floated by Beijing for several months, have been revived several times this week, first by South Korea’s newly installed president and then by China’s foreign minister and one of its top military officials in talks on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But White House officials say they are not interested in any proposal that would require the United States to lift military or economic pressure on the North, even in return for a moratorium on tests. Instead, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis publicly pressed the Chinese to exert more diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang, though President Trump indicated on Twitter on Tuesday that he had just about given up on obtaining help from the Chinese. “China understands that the United States regards North Korea as our top security threat,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters at a news conference after meetings with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, and Gen. Fang Fenghui, in the first security dialogue with Beijing conducted by the Trump administration. “We reiterated to China that they have a diplomatic responsibility to exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime if they want to prevent further escalation in the region.” But like his predecessors, Mr. Trump is gradually learning that for all its talk about cooperation, China is deeply reluctant to take any measures that could seriously destabilize the North Korean government, for fear the country might collapse or be absorbed by the South. So China’s strategy has been to buy time — and preserve the status quo — with talks that may be linked to some kind of testing freeze. They may now have a new advocate of that approach, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who was elected on a platform pledging resumed engagement with the North. On Tuesday, he embraced a similar idea, telling Norah O’Donnell of CBS News in an interview that a freeze could be a way station to a second phase of talks that would “achieve the complete dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear program.” "
"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — President Trump said on Wednesday that he was crafting legislation to bar new immigrants from receiving welfare for at least five years. He announced the proposal in a conquering-hero-returns speech in Iowa, his first trip back to the political battleground state since his inauguration. His mood buoyant after twin Republican wins in congressional special elections the night before, the president also revealed his anticipated plan for putting solar panels on a proposed wall on the Mexican border — an idea he boasted he had come up with himself. And he — mostly — managed to avoid raising the topic he struggles to stop talking about: the investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with his campaign. “They have phony witch hunts going against me,” Mr. Trump said nearly an hour into a speech that veered off script repeatedly. “All we do is win, win, win. We won last night.” The rally, Mr. Trump’s first since the end of April, served as a venting session for a pent-up president who has stewed and brooded from inside the gilded cage of the White House over attacks from investigators, Democrats and the news media, his interview schedule drastically pared down and his aides imploring him to stay off Twitter. Style-heavy and substance-light, the speech went over an hour: an epic version of the fact-challenged, meandering and, even for his detractors, mesmerizing speeches he gave during his upstart presidential campaign.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Republican wins in Georgia. Karen Handel overcame a well-funded challenger to easily win a special election on Tuesday, defeating the Democrat Jon Ossoff in the most expensive House campaign in history. Seen as a referendum on President Trump, the race in the heavily conservative and affluent district outside Atlanta was the latest in a string of demoralizing losses for Democrats. Here’s a quick look at Ms. Handel’s record. Our reporters analyzed the returns as they came in and, in a video, one discussed what the race could mean for next year’s midterm elections. We also have a map showing the results. • Uber founder resigns as C.E.O. Travis Kalanick stepped down on Tuesday as chief executive of the ride-hailing service he helped found in 2009 and built into a transportation colossus. His exit after a shareholder revolt caps months of questions over leadership at Uber, which has become an example of start-up culture gone awry. "
"To the Editor: In recent months, I have heard both supporters and critics of President Trump suggest that the president refrain from tweeting about the issues of the day. Whether you are a supporter or a critic, his tweets provide a window into his state of mind as events unfold. This is extremely valuable. It is likely that this president is going to conduct few traditional press briefings. His tweets may provide the best insight that we will get into Mr. Trump’s thoughts. Those calling on the president to cease tweeting on the events of the day should first answer the following question: “Where would we be without them?” SEAN MCCLOSKEY

"SPRINGFIELD, Mass. — Through the front door of the Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum in Springfield, Mass., the mind of the beloved children’s book author Theodor Seuss Geisel springs to life. The new three-floor museum is lush with murals, including one with a proo, a nerkle, a nerd and a seersucker, too. Around one corner, visitors will find an immense sculpture of Horton the Elephant from “Horton Hears a Who!” But the museum, which opened on June 3, displays a bit of amnesia about the formative experiences that led to Mr. Geisel’s best-known body of work. It completely overlooks Mr. Geisel’s anti-Japanese cartoons from World War II, which he later regretted. Far from the whimsy of “Fox in Socks” (1965), Mr. Geisel drew hundreds of political cartoons for a liberal newspaper, “PM,” from 1941 to 1943, a little-known but pivotal chapter of his career before he became a giant of children’s literature. Many of the cartoons were critical of some of history’s most reviled figures, such as Hitler and Mussolini. But others are now considered blatantly racist. Shortly before the forced mass incarceration of Japanese-Americans, Mr. Geisel drew cartoons that were harshly anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese-American, using offensive stereotypes to caricature them. While President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s library has put his role in Japanese internment on full display, this museum glosses over Mr. Geisel’s early work as a prolific political cartoonist, opting instead for crowd-pleasing sculptures of the Cat in the Hat and other characters, and a replica of the Geisel family bakery. But scholars and those who were close to Mr. Geisel note that this work was essential to understanding Dr. Seuss, and the museum is now grappling with criticism that it doesn’t paint a full picture of an author whose work permeates American culture, from the ubiquitous holiday Grinch to Supreme Court opinions (Justice Elena Kagan once cited “One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish”).

"As health insurers scrambled to decide whether to stay or go by Wednesday’s deadline to file plans for the federal marketplace, Anthem, one of the Obamacare market’s major players, announced that it would pull out of two more states, Wisconsin and Indiana, in 2018. The company, which offers for-profit Blue Cross plans in 14 states, had already said this month that it would stop selling coverage in the marketplace next year in Ohio. In making the announcement, Anthem said offering plans had “become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance.” Even as Senate Republicans hurry to finish their plan to overhaul the law, insurers are racing to meet not just federal but also state deadlines to submit rate requests. While the Wednesday deadline does not represent a final commitment by any insurer, “it will be a good indicator of the health of these markets,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose home state of Wisconsin was among those Anthem plans to exit, pointed to the decision as reason the Republicans needed to pass their overhaul of the health care legislation. "
"Hamburg, Germany — Heiko Maas may be about to learn where the road being paved with his good intentions will lead. A Social Democrat and the current federal justice minister, he has announced ambitious plans to rid the internet of abusive and offensive language. His plans have incited concern in the German offices of Twitter and Facebook and may ensure that he goes into history books as the politician who brought the curtain down on free speech on social media in Germany. Mr. Maas’s plans, which center on legislation allowing legal actions against online insults, libel and sedition, take aim at several real problems, including a sharp increase in hate crimes against more than one million new migrants and refugees to Germany and the spread of “fake news” that, in his view, helped Donald Trump win the American election. And they come after his own failed attempt to get social media companies operating in Germany to agree to self-regulation. Despite promises by Facebook to crack down on harmful speech, Mr. Maas says Facebook still deletes only 39 percent of punishable content, and Twitter only 1 percent. After years of negotiations the minister, quite understandably, has run out of patience. Recently he proposed a law obliging social media to erase “obviously illegal” content within 24 hours after a complaint. In less obvious cases, the deadline is one week. If the networks don’t comply, they face fines of up to 50 million euros, or $55 million. The law is expected to be ratified by Parliament before it goes on its summer break. But even as a proposal, its chilling effect on freedom of expression can already be felt; Twitter is now blocking accounts in Germany that have even the slightest whiff of hate speech. One such account is called @einzelfallinfos — roughly, “individual case reports.” The account’s name mocks the mainstream narrative in Germany that crimes committed by refugees and migrants are “individual cases” — something the account’s operators clearly dispute. Instead, they see a “recurring pattern” of sexual assaults against women perpetrated by young men of mostly Arab origin. So they persistently post official police reports about, as they put it, “crimes committed by refugees, migrants, and presumed migrants.” As of May 15, the @einzelfallinfos account is no longer accessible in Germany. When I asked Twitter why it was being blocked, and how many other accounts are being blocked in Germany, a press officer said, “We do not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.” What were these privacy and security reasons, I asked? “Longstanding company policy — nothing further to add.” "
"As President Trump prepares to fundamentally rethink the reconciliation with Cuba initiated by Barack Obama, here are a few books that shed light on the two countries’ historically fraught — yet intertwined — relationship: ON BECOMING CUBAN
Identity, Nationality, and Culture (1999)
By Louis A. Pérez Jr.
608 pp. The University of North Carolina Press. Though Cuba is now known as an island frozen in time, the early 1900s saw an era of prosperity there. World War I had caused a decline in European sugar production, creating a demand that Cuba rushed to fill, with the building of plantations and factories to satisfy the American market. Trade went both ways: By 1920, 80 percent of imports to Cuba were from the United States, and the island enjoyed the same technological advances and entertainment as Americans. Yet a few decades later, Cubans seemed to be worse off — salaries had stagnated, and sugar could no longer sustain the economy. Louis A. Pérez Jr.’s exploration of the cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba over almost 100 years, from the early 1850s to the revolution in 1959, paints a picture of the landscape leading up to the shift to socialism and the significance of the embargo the United States would impose. DREAMING IN CUBAN (1992)
By Cristina García
245 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. This family epic follows three generations of women — Celia del Pino, the matriarch; her daughter, Lourdes; and Lourdes’s daughter Pilar — and their vastly different views of Cuba and Fidel Castro’s revolution. Celia, who believes pre-Castro Cuba was “a pathetic place, a parody of a country,” supported the revolution and its promise for change. Her daughter, Lourdes, was raped by a revolutionary soldier, and the memory would continue to haunt her after she escaped to the United States, where she builds a successful chain of bakeries. Lourdes views the lavish desserts she creates as a subliminal message to her mother, a “reminder of the ongoing shortages in Cuba,” while Pilar longs to return to the island. Cristina García crafts a masterly novel that deals with political exile through the various viewpoints of one family. "
"Readers have been commenting to The New York Times since the day we were born. (Well, that would have been impossible.) Since the day after we were born. An article on Sept. 19, 1851, noting that Philadelphia had surrendered its commercial supremacy to New York, prompted a favorable reply from a lifelong Philadelphian who was visiting our town. “We would rather witness the dust and mud of Broadway, with its business and bustle, than the Quaker neatness and the Quaker quiet of most Philadelphia thoroughfares,” this “Visitor” wrote. Like most letters in our earliest decades, it agreed with The Times. The idea that the newspaper ought to welcome conflicting ideas and competing viewpoints — including criticism of The Times itself — came with its purchase in 1896 by Adolph S. Ochs, whose heirs still control the company. Mr. Ochs’s aim, he wrote on Aug. 18 of that year, was “to make the columns of The New York Times a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.” The Times made it much easier to find those shades on Dec. 14, 1931, when it began publishing “Letters to the Editor” in a fixed position on the editorial page, rather than scattering them around the newspaper, one by one.

"Not so long ago, the factors spelling success at fashion week for a label were threefold: who attended, what the critics said, and how the buyers responded. In the age of the smartphone, most brands strive to make their shows appealing to an additional 700 million — the number of average monthly users on Instagram, whose likes and mentions rain down on a label’s collections. “Designers understand these days that it’s a global ripple effect you can have,” said Eva Chen, Instagram’s head of fashion partnerships. “You can reach a 15-year-old boy who wants to invest in a new watch, even if he lives in Sydney or in Peru.” So as the latest round of men’s fashion weeks unfold this month across Europe, which labels have placed highest in Instagram rankings? In Milan, Dolce & Gabbana’s bid to tap into the millennial mind through hashtags and the inclusion of celebrity-spawn/models like Braison Cyrus (Miley’s brother, 444,000 followers) and Sistine Stallone (Sylvester’s daughter, 438,000 followers) paid off, and the label claimed the crown for the most likes and comments from June 16 to 20. To be fair, some of the comments were negative, after Raury, a musician walking in the show (162,000 followers), scrawled messages of protest on his chest after he learned of the designers’ support of Melania Trump. Miley Cyrus (68.9 million followers) also posted a criticism of the label’s politics on her Instagram account, prompting a rebuke from Stefano Gabbana (one million followers). "
"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, who for seven years have promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, took a major step on Thursday toward that goal, unveiling a bill to make deep cuts in Medicaid and end the law’s mandate that most Americans have health insurance. The 142-page bill would create a new system of federal tax credits to help people buy health insurance, while offering states the ability to drop many of the benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, like maternity care, emergency services and mental health treatment. But the measure landed in rough seas ahead of a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wants next week. Four conservative senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced that they would oppose it without changes — more than enough to bring it down. “It does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs,” the four wrote in a joint statement. Other Republican senators, like Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio, expressed their own qualms, as did AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the Association of American Medical Colleges.

"MOSCOW — Petro O. Poroshenko, the Ukrainian president, called it the collapse of the “paper curtain.” Since June 11, when 30 European countries began waiving short-stay visa requirements for Ukrainians as an incentive for Kiev to pursue further reforms, tens of thousands of Ukrainians have flocked to those nations. More than 20,000 Ukrainians have already seized on the rule change, some stepping out of airports at their destinations pumping their fists to celebrate putting the bureaucratic headache of visas behind them. On peak days, Ukraine’s border service says, about 5,000 of its citizens leave for the European countries. They are not permitted to work, and can be required to show a return ticket. Still, the change is a rare bright spot for Ukraine, a country mired in war with Russia, plagued by economic woes and struggling to gain a sympathetic hearing from the Trump administration, which has sought closer ties with Moscow. “It was all quite quick and comfortable,” Timofey Matskevich, a small-business owner, said of transiting with his wife, Daria, through an airport serving Barcelona. “They asked no questions, they stamped our passports and said, ‘Welcome to Spain,’ ” Mr. Matskevich said in an online chat from the apartment where he was staying, which he said had a marvelous view of the beach and the Mediterranean beyond.

"WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — By the time Will Ferrell was in the sixth grade, he was almost six feet tall and owning it. “I never felt gawky or like it was a disadvantage. I was kind of proud of being tall,” said Mr. Ferrell, who grew up in Irvine, Calif., where he played baseball, basketball and soccer. “You’re more looked up to. Literally. You are literally looking down on people.” Throughout his film and television career, Mr. Ferrell has used his height (he’s now 6-foot-3) and athleticism to his advantage, wringing laughs as Buddy, the oversize Santa’s helper, in “Elf”; the preening, looming broadcaster Ron Burgundy in “Anchorman”; and the goofy stepfather battling a buff Mark Wahlberg in “Daddy’s Home.” In “The House,” which opens on Friday, June 30, Mr. Ferrell’s Scott Johansen, an average suburban dad, learns to walk tall out of misguided necessity: When he and his wife, Kate (Amy Poehler), discover they can’t afford their only child’s college tuition, they raise money by opening a Las Vegas-style casino at a neighbor’s house and become menacing enforcers in the process. “It’s against their better judgment but in a weird way one of the greatest things they’ll ever do,” said Mr. Ferrell, who arrived for an interview at a hotel dressed in a black suit jacket with a natty pocket square. “And I get to wield an ax.” In real life, Mr. Ferrell, 49, is soft-spoken and the father of Magnus, Mattias and Axel, who recently got to watch their dad film a scene with John Lithgow for the coming “Daddy’s Home 2.” “It didn’t cross my mind to tell them that we play the type of father and son who are so affectionate that we don’t think twice about kissing each other on the lips when we say hi,” Mr. Ferrell said. “But the boys, apparently, were cracking up watching that.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

"Akbar al-Baker, the chief executive of Qatar Airways, recently approached his counterpart at American Airlines, a bitter rival, with some news: His state-owned company wanted to buy a 10 percent stake in American. The unexpected and bold approach, disclosed by American on Thursday, underscored the broad ambitions of Qatar Airways, which has grown from a small regional player focused on the Middle East to a global carrier with flights to 150 destinations. But the move also was certain to intensify a long-running debate in Washington about whether airlines based in the Persian Gulf have an unfair advantage. American, with other major domestic carriers, say Qatar and other Gulf airlines receive large government subsidies that violate international agreements. Domestic carrier executives have appealed to President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson to push back against the Gulf countries. Qatar’s proposed investment could be limited, as a 10 percent stake would require approval from American’s board. Doug Parker, the company’s chief executive, said in an interview that the proposed investment would only “intensify our opposition” to any subsidies given to the Gulf carrier. “We’re a bit bewildered as to why Qatar is interested in investing in American Airlines, given the very public and aggressive position we’ve taken about their business model,” he said. Qatar Airways’ approach also adds a complication to the United States’ increasingly troubled relationship with Qatar, the tiny but wealthy Persian Gulf Arab emirate that borders Saudi Arabia and is home to the largest American military air base in the Middle East. Qatar is in the midst of a crisis ignited by a feud with Saudi Arabia, which imposed an embargo against Qatar this month over accusations that Qatar supports terror groups. "
"Only a few weeks ago, much of the global commentariat still saw the rise of right-wing populism as the defining trend of our times, but recent election results upend that notion. This month an old-fashioned socialist, Jeremy Corbyn, scored an unexpectedly strong showing in Britain. On Sunday, the new-school centrist Emmanuel Macron won a parliamentary majority in France. And conservative, Wall Street-friendly reformers are gaining momentum in, of all places, Latin America, once a hotbed of anticapitalist radicalism. If there is a common factor driving voters worldwide, it is less a particular ideology, right or left, than a deep but amorphous desire for change. Seated leaders normally have a huge advantage in name recognition alone, but these aren’t normal times. In the world’s 50 most populous democracies, the ruling party won just 40 percent of the national elections in 2016. It was one of the poorest showings for incumbents since 2002, when the global economy was emerging from recession and roiling crises were driving established parties from power in the emerging world. So far this year, in five major national elections, the incumbent party suffered humiliating defeats in France and South Korea, will barely hang on at the head of coalition governments in Britain and the Netherlands, and survived with a greatly diminished mandate in Ecuador. The voters’ anger is mainly the byproduct of the wide and persistent slowdown that has taken root since the global financial crisis of 2008. The growth rate of the global economy has slumped to around 2.5 percent this decade, from 4 percent in the decades before 2008, undermined by weakening growth in both population and productivity. No major region of the world is growing as fast now as it was before the crisis. Among the 50 most populous democracies, only nine have dodged the global growth slowdown, and among this group — with a few exceptions, like Germany — most have relatively small economies. Worse, the disappointing recovery has been accompanied by anemic wage growth and rising income inequality. Dashed economic expectations are undermining popular support for working politicians across the economic spectrum. "
"The government’s consumer watchdog is adding its voice to a growing chorus of warnings about problems with a federal program that permits people who take public service jobs to have their student loans forgiven after a decade. Confusing rules, bureaucratic tripwires and outright errors are hindering thousands of people as they try to take advantage of the program, according to a report released Thursday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These are people who teach, serve in the military or work for a nonprofit organization, for example. The volume of complaints is especially alarming because the program has not yet reached its first milestone: forgiving debts. Created in 2007, the program requires borrowers to do 10 years of service before any federal student loan debt is eliminated. The first wave of qualifying borrowers can submit applications in October. But hundreds of complaints in the last year indicate many applicants are encountering obstacles, the agency said. Many public service jobs require increasingly high levels of education, which forces people to accrue larger debt, according to the report — even as they enter professions with traditionally low salaries. This phenomenon is why the program was established. But then the abuses that the agency identified kick in. Many borrowers “point to a range of student loan industry practices that delay, defer, or deny access to critical consumer protections,” Seth Frotman, the bureau’s student loan ombudsman, wrote in an introduction to the report. “The bureau is committed to monitoring the industry for key issues and illegal practices affecting borrowers who are trying to access key consumer protections so they can continue to give back to their communities.” "

"On a recent Wednesday, 75 Guatemalans disembarked from one of three charter flights, all full of deportees from the United States, scheduled that day. The group was led into a hangar, where authorities gave them a perfunctory welcome: a hello, a snack and bus fare to wherever they were headed. The Guatemalan government’s relationship to the deportees ended there. Considering them a burden, even an embarrassment, the Guatemalan state and society are unable and unwilling to assist the thousands of migrants being sent back home. Reintegrating them is no doubt a challenge. But so is doing nothing. And Guatemala and the United States have far more to gain by harnessing the economic, social and political capital these migrants bring back with them. One reason Guatemala doesn’t do much with deportees is the widespread belief that they won’t stay for long. On a recent visit to the country, I heard businessmen, public officials and community activists insist that Donald Trump and his wall would not intimidate aspiring migrants. But migrants aren’t wasting time, either. As a community leader told me, “Everyone is saying that they better rush now before Mr. Trump finishes his wall.” In fact, many Guatemalans want the migrants to go back. Their return spells an end to remittances that constitute about 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. And returning migrants are flooding an already depressed job sector, where three-quarters of the labor force works off the books. "
"The fire that destroyed a London apartment building, killing at least 79 people, provides a grim warning about the dangers of a regulatory approach President Trump has made official policy in Washington. One of the safety failures under investigation in the fire is the lack of sprinklers in the 24-story Grenfell Tower. High-rises built in England since 2007 must have sprinklers, but older ones, like Grenfell Tower, built in 1974, do not have to be retrofitted with them. Why not? Arbitrary deregulation, said Ronnie King, a former chief fire officer and honorary secretary of a parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue. “It’s one of those that if you bring in a new regulation, you have got to give three up to get it,” Mr. King said in a BBC report, referring to a British law first passed in 2011 that requires the elimination of regulations as each new one is enacted. At first, one rule had to be ended for every new rule passed. That was later expanded to “one in, two out,” a standard President Trump put forth in an executive order he signed in January. In 2015, British law became “one in, three out.” Such a pat formula could force officials to reject crucial new rules to avoid eliminating other important protections, or to eliminate such existing protections to make room for a new one. “The government’s mania for deregulation means our current safety standards just aren’t good enough,” said Sam Webb, an architect and fire expert, in the BBC report. Mr. Trump’s order is similarly likely to lead to dangerous elimination of safety rules, including those for food, drugs, water, air, autos and toys, partly because many obsolete or duplicative federal rules were already purged under the Obama era’s “look back” program to systematically revise, end and update existing rules. Supporters of Mr. Trump’s mechanistic two-for-one deregulation pretend that public health and safety would take care of themselves as business is freed of what they say are undue burdens. But this approach is not about safety or business burdens, it’s about increasing profits by reducing compliance costs. Speaking in February 2014 during Fire Sprinkler Week, some of the members of the British House of Commons were all for sprinklers, but not for regulations to require them. “We believe that it is the responsibility of the fire industry, rather than the government, to market fire sprinkler systems effectively and to encourage their wider installation,” Brandon Lewis, who would later become housing minister for the Conservative government, said after praising the one-in, two-out formula then in use. After the Grenfell Tower fire, the dangers of reflexive rejections of regulation, like Mr. Trump’s executive order, are clearer. "
"When President Trump began taking a wrecking ball to some of America’s traditional foreign policies, going so far as to threaten the country’s long and sturdy relationship with its Western European allies, many hoped that the other branches of government would provide a counterweight to the executive branch, and restrain his worst impulses. The federal courts helped by slamming the brakes on Mr. Trump’s travel ban against several Muslim-majority countries. Now the Republican-led Congress, especially the Senate, is beginning to assert itself on national security issues in a mostly constructive manner. Last week, the Senate provided reassurance to European allies jittery about America’s commitment to NATO by voting unanimously to affirm Article 5, the 68-year-old alliance’s core mutual defense provision. Mr. Trump denigrated NATO during his campaign and refused to embrace Article 5 during his recent European trip. As Mr. Trump continued to display indifference, even hostility, to findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to strengthen sanctions against Russia. For too long, Republican leaders had indulged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s pleadings to delay a sanctions vote while he attempted to forge a new relationship with his Russian counterpart, a dubious proposition. It’s obviously in everyone’s interest for the United States to find areas of cooperation with Moscow; Russia is a major power and the only country with a nuclear arsenal comparable to America’s. But there has been no sign that Mr. Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chairman and chief executive with close ties to the Kremlin, has won any concession that suggests Moscow is willing to end its aggressive behavior and engage seriously with Washington. Russia’s mischief knows few boundaries. The country is still destabilizing Ukraine, using its military force to defend President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, undermining democracy across Europe and trying to woo vulnerable NATO members in Eastern Europe to its side.

"About as many Americans are expected to die this year of drug overdoses as died in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. For more than 100 years, death rates have been dropping for Americans — but now, because of opioids, death rates are rising again. We as a nation are going backward, and drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50. “There’s no question that there’s an epidemic and that this is a national public health emergency,” Dr. Leana Wen, the health commissioner of Baltimore, told me. “The number of people overdosing is skyrocketing, and we have no indication that we’ve reached the peak.” Yet our efforts to address this scourge are pathetic. We responded to World War II with the storming of Normandy, and to Sputnik with our moon shot. Yet we answer this current national menace with … a Republican plan for health care that would deprive millions of insurance and lead to even more deaths! More on President Trump’s fumbling of this problem in a moment. But it’s bizarre that Republicans should be complacent about opioids, because the toll is disproportionately in red states — and it affects everyone. Mary Taylor, the Republican lieutenant governor of Ohio and now a candidate for governor, has acknowledged that both her sons, Joe and Michael, have struggled with opioid addiction, resulting in two overdoses at home, urgent calls for ambulances and failed drug rehab efforts. Good for her for speaking up. "
"It was a hard-fought race, people. But the results of our Worst Trump Cabinet Member reader poll are in. And the winner is — Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos! With a near tie for second place between Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “It’s hard to be worse than Sessions or Pruitt. But DeVos deals with … children,” wrote a Michigan reader. DeVos really hates public schools — something you don’t find often in a secretary of education. Her goal seems to be replacing them with charter schools, none of which will need much oversight because, you know, the choice thing. Many readers noted that our secretary of education does not seem to be … all that bright. (“DeVos is a solid choice based on irony alone.”) But I can’t help thinking Sessions might have taken the prize if his appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee had gone on just a little longer. He clearly wowed viewers with his alleged inability to remember things. (“Wins by a Pinocchio.”) Some were taken by his resemblance to a bad hobbit or gremlin (“malevolent pixie”). But others simply found Sessions … bad. (“He is detestable and should have little tiny horns on the back of his head.”) Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A., is a former Oklahoma attorney general who prepared for his current job by suing the agency 14 times. His champions in the Worst competition contended that, in the words of a North Carolina correspondent, “he can do major damage which will take years to undo.” "
"SOFIA, Bulgaria — At the end of 2016, devastated by Brexit and unsettled by Donald Trump’s victory in the American presidential election, many Europeans fell into deep despair. They had become resigned to the notion that the European Union’s moment in history was over. Six months later, nothing is different, yet everything has changed. Polls show that a growing number of Europeans are betting on the European Union. Improved economies across the Continent, the miserable performance of populists in the Netherlands, and the humiliation suffered by the “hard Brexiteer” Theresa May in this month’s general election in Britain have made many Europeans hopeful that the European Union has received a second chance, and that it is going to make the most of it. Emmanuel Macron’s decisive victories in France — first in the presidential election in May and then again in parliamentary elections last week — on a proudly pro-European platform have led many Europeans to believe that rather than disintegration, further integration may now be possible. The hope among the ever-closer-unionists is that Mr. Macron’s labor reforms in France will persuade Germany to invest more in eurozone economies. Meanwhile, plans for further investment in European defense are afoot. But while infectious optimism is visible everywhere in Western Europe, the East has remained conspicuously unenthusiastic. The prospect of Eastern Europeans exiting the union — as the former Czech president Vaclav Klaus recently implored them to do — is still about as likely as President Vladimir Putin of Russia losing next year’s elections, but many in Eastern Europe are squeamish about German-French efforts to reorder Europe. Why? The answer is quite straightforward. The governments in Poland and Hungary fear that further political integration will endanger the illiberal regimes they have put in place, while many Eastern Europeans fear that any Macron-Merkel initiative could result in a two-tiered Europe where they are second-class citizens.

"Late last week, the Trump administration announced that it would be re-abnormalizing the relationship between the United States and Cuba. A few days earlier, El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan opened “NKame: A Retrospective of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón,” reminding us exactly how much we have to gain from a free exchange of cultural energy with our island neighbor. Ayón was born in Havana in 1967 and died there, by her own hand, in 1999. As baffling and crushing as her end was, her life and career had been warm with forward motion. She began studying art at 12, went on to the renowned Instituto Superior de Arte, and joined its faculty after graduation. She began exhibiting in Cuba, and word went out. Invitations for exhibitions and residencies took her to Europe, Japan and North America. In 1993 she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale. In Cuba, this was during the so-called Special Period, when a post-Soviet economic crisis led to drastic food and fuel shortages and transportation breakdowns. Life was a scramble. She had to bike 20 miles to the airport to make the flight to Venice, her father biking behind her with the work she would show there. Fortunately, it was readily portable work, even though it was monumental in concept and scale. She had settled on printmaking early as a medium, one that had had a long and brilliant history in Cuba, but was out of fashion by the 1980s, when she picked it up. And she chose to specialize in one of its more esoteric and labor-intensive forms: collography, a method of engraving that involved applying materials to a printing plate rather than digging into its surface. In Ayón’s hands, the process became one of staggering virtuosity. She composed images from hundreds of pieces of soft paper, sandpaper, even vegetable peelings, fitting them all together on a cardboard sheet, like elements of a puzzle, then inking the sheet and running it through a hand-cranked printer. (You can see her doing this in a video in the show.) The results were notable for their complex physical textures, suggesting embossing, embroidery and raised painting, though what’s most striking on a first encounter is the work’s scale. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump cleared up one of the capital’s least suspenseful mysteries on Thursday, acknowledging that he did not record conversations with James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in anger over an investigation into his campaign’s possible ties to Russia. Meeting a self-imposed deadline of this week to resolve questions he himself raised by implying that he had taped Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had not made tapes of what Mr. Comey has testified were attempts by the president to derail the Justice Department’s investigation. But if few people believed that Mr. Trump actually possessed recordings, his motives in warning Mr. Comey that he might have taped him remain a mystery, particularly since it set off a chain of events that accelerated, rather than slowed, the investigation into Mr. Trump and Russia. Mr. Comey testified that it was Mr. Trump’s veiled threat of tapes that led him to authorize the disclosure of memos of his conversations with the president — the details of which prompted the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to look into the case. The timing of the announcement — after an internal debate in which Mr. Trump was at first reluctant to come clean quickly — seemed calculated to change the subject. Hours earlier, Senate Republicans released their heath care bill, which drew immediate opposition from four Republican senators and fanned fresh doubts about the president’s legislative agenda. “With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of tweets posted around 1 p.m., he has no idea “whether there are ‘tapes’ or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.” "
"Martin Shkreli is not on trial for what made him, in the words of the BBC, the most hated man in America. Mr. Shkreli, the 34-year-old biopharmaceutical executive, will be in court in Brooklyn next week to face securities and wire fraud charges. He is accused of improperly using money from a company he founded to pay back hedge fund investors. Mr. Shkreli has said that he is not guilty and will be vindicated at trial. Still, it was his handling of the price of a little-known drug, Daraprim, which is used to treat infections in AIDS patients and babies, that drew the ire of doctors, patients, insurance companies and even Hillary Clinton. In September 2015, Mr. Shkreli, who was then the chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the American marketing rights to Daraprim. Overnight, he raised its price to nearly $750 a pill from $13.50 and became the smirking symbol of drug industry greed. His sneering defenses of the price increase led to a social media firestorm (and federal and state investigations) that painted the boyish-looking former hedge fund manager as a “pharma bro” villain, a role he has embraced.

"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday made it harder to strip citizenship from naturalized Americans. It also refused to grant new trials to defendants in a notorious 1984 Washington murder case and to a Massachusetts man whose lawyer failed to object to closing the courtroom for part of his trial. The justices unanimously rejected the government’s position that it could revoke the citizenship of Americans who made even trivial misstatements in their naturalization proceedings. During arguments in April, several justices seemed indignant and incredulous at the government’s hard-line approach in the case, Maslenjak v. United States, No. 16-309. They asked about a form that people seeking American citizenship must complete. It requires applicants to say, for instance, whether they had ever committed a criminal offense, however minor, even if there was no arrest. A government lawyer, in response to questioning, said that failing to disclose a speeding violation could be enough to revoke citizenship even years later. Writing for the majority, Justice Elena Kagan said that the law required a tighter connection between the lie and the procurement of citizenship. “We hold that the government must establish that an illegal act by the defendant played some role in her acquisition of citizenship,” she wrote. “When the illegal act is a false statement, that means demonstrating that the defendant lied about facts that would have mattered to an immigration official, because they would have justified denying naturalization or would predictably have led to other facts warranting that result.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Senate Republicans released their version of the health care bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and it looked a lot like the House version. There are deep cuts to Medicaid, and it ends the health insurance mandate while creating a new system of tax credits to help people buy insurance. It also repeals virtually all the tax increases imposed by Obamacare to pay for itself. The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, above, wants to vote on it next week, but four conservative Republican senators said they would oppose it without changes. We’re tracking where each senator stands, and we have more details on what’s in the bill here. _____ "
"Two Iranian airlines made prospective deals with Airbus on Thursday to buy 73 jetliners, a signal that the global aerospace industry is betting such sales to Iran will prevail despite increased hostility by the Trump administration. The prospective deals, described by Airbus as memorandums of understanding, are worth as much as $2.5 billion and were announced by the company at the Paris Air Show, an important sales event for plane manufacturers. If completed, the deals would further solidify Iran as a significant customer in the industry, dominated by Boeing in the United States and Airbus in Europe. Desperate to rejuvenate an aging civilian fleet hurt by years of sanctions, Iranian air carriers have made arrangements over the past year to buy up to 140 planes from Boeing and 100 from Airbus. The deals are permitted under the 2015 nuclear agreement Iran reached with six major powers, which relaxed sanctions in return for Iran’s verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. But the deals — even for the Airbuses — still must be licensed by the United States government because many components and technology in the aircraft are made in the United States and are subject to export control regulations. While President Trump has railed against the nuclear accord with Iran, a country he has described as a pariah state that exports terrorism, his administration has grudgingly gone along with the agreement. He also has made no known moves so far to substantively change export licensing policies. The aircraft deals in particular have presented a challenge to Mr. Trump because they could support thousands of manufacturing jobs in the United States, a major theme of his presidential campaign. At the same time, critics of Iran in the United States have urged him to stop those deals. "
"President Trump returned to familiar rhetorical territory during a raucous campaign-style rally in Iowa on Wednesday night, repeating exaggerations and falsehoods about health care, jobs, taxes, foreign policy and his own record. Here’s an assessment. This talking point is no longer true. Medica, the state’s last company in the individual health insurance market, threatened to pull out in early May. Then it said earlier this month that it would stay in the state but that it would charge much higher premiums. And the Trump administration itself may be responsible for part of the uncertainty and volatility by suggesting it may not fund cost-sharing subsidies, as the company’s chief executive suggested to CNBC. Mr. Trump has signed nearly 40 bills into law, but it’s hard to argue, as he did, that any were “really big.” The 14 bills rolling back Obama-era rules did signal a significant shift in regulatory policy, but are not considered major pieces of legislation. Three others named federal buildings, four made symbolic gestures toward women and veterans, three appointed Smithsonian Institution regents, two set minor rules for federal employees, one affirmed NASA’s mission, one improved weather forecasting, and one aided Minnesota’s bid for a world’s fair in 2023. In the same time period, President Franklin D. Roosevelt began public works projects in response to the Great Depression, Mr. Obama had enacted a stimulus package to counter the financial crisis, and President George W. Bush had signed major tax cuts. In 2015, the United States ranked in the middle or near the bottom compared among 35 advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development by the typical metrics: No. 28 for total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, No. 22 for corporate tax revenue as a percentage of G.D.P. and No. 13 for tax revenue per capita.

"Hello, everyone, Many reporters and editors at The New York Times spend a good deal of time listening to readers’ questions, concerns and suggestions. But our readers often don’t know how we’re thinking about or responding to this feedback. (Unless, of course, a correction is issued.) We’d like to change that. Last month, The Times’s newsroom set up a Reader Center to help us build deeper ties to our audience. As one of our first initiatives, we’re going to experiment with a bulletin board for our journalists to speak directly to readers about our coverage. Do you have feedback about our journalism? Or suggestions for what you’d like to see here? Please contact us at nytnews@nytimes.com. Thanks so much. Hanna Ingber
Editorial Director of the Reader Center June 29, 2017 A Times reader responded to a business article this week on two studies that evaluated the effects of the first phases of Seattle’s increase in its minimum wage. The reader raised a concern that the studies had not undergone peer review, a process whereby others in the same field evaluate one’s work. I understand the reader’s concern about this. In a case like this, where research is published and promoted on a matter of particular public interest, we have to make a decision as to what best serves our readers. Given the attention (and debate) these studies were bound to receive, and the credentials of the researchers, we felt it was best not to ignore the work but to examine it as fully as possible — including possible flaws in methodology — while including a note specifying that it had not yet been peer reviewed.

"The Senate Republicans’ health bill that was made public today is a Jekyll-and-Hyde plan: in some ways kinder than the House Republican plan, and in some ways meaner, to use President Donald Trump’s yardstick. Overall the plan will benefit the wealthy and young adults, but hurt larger numbers of people who are old or poor. On Medicaid, the federal-state health program covering 69 million lower-income people, the Senate plan is harsher than the House plan. Like the House bill, the Senate bill would effectively kill the expansion of Medicaid that was allowed under the Affordable Care Act. It will do this by phasing out, over four years, the law’s requirement that the federal government cover 90 percent of the cost for people added under Medicaid expansion — many of them single adults below or just above the poverty line. Medicaid expansion covers 14 million people in 30 states and the District of Columbia. (The remaining states chose not to expand their programs.) Expansion states would have to come up with hundreds of millions, in some states billions, of dollars from their own budgets to replace those lost federal funds. Based on my experience as a state human services commissioner — for a Republican governor — I predict that few if any states will be able to do that. It is also highly unlikely that other states will join the expansion once the federal match is gone. Both the Senate and the House plans also impose a per capita cap on future federal Medicaid spending. The Senate plan imposes a harsher formula for its cap than the House plan, which already cuts Medicaid spending by $834 billion over 10 years. Because states have to balance their budgets every year, unlike the federal government, many will struggle to compensate for reductions in federal aid caused by a spending cap. Many states will be forced to choose between Medicaid and other priorities, like education, law enforcement and prisons. The inevitable result will be a reduction in health care spending on low-income people. And you cannot cut over $800 billion from Medicaid without adversely affecting health services for the poor. Governors might be expected to loudly protest these Medicaid cuts, but the Senate bill delays the harshest cuts until 2025, after the current governors are gone. We will see how those governors balance their states’ health care futures and their own political interests. That’s Mr. Hyde. Now for Dr. Jekyll. The part of the Senate bill that deals with the individual insurance market and the A.C.A. marketplaces is in some respects Obamacare-lite. The House bill was sharply criticized for replacing Obamacare’s system of tax credits and subsidies, intended to make insurance more affordable, with a system of tax credits that were far less generous. The Senate bill would maintain Obamacare’s tax credit system, but it would scale back the value of the credits. And as under the A.C.A. but not the House plan, the tax credits will be adjusted for income and geography — which will benefit people in parts of the country with high premiums, especially rural areas. Still, deductibles are likely to rise under the Senate plan. "
"Once universally dreaded by banks, the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests are becoming less stressful. The nation’s largest banks breezed through the first phase of their annual tests on Thursday, demonstrating that they have enough capital to withstand the type of financial shock that nearly ruined the industry and the world economy in 2008. The banking system, according to the test results, has an even larger capital cushion than it did going into last year’s exam. That is likely to increase calls from the financial industry and its allies in the Trump administration and Congress to start watering down the regulations. Even the Fed governor overseeing the tests this year has said he wants to pull back some rules. The stress tests, which were introduced early in the Obama administration and are required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, are intended to ensure that banks have enough capital to cover severe losses like those sustained during the mortgage crisis and to avoid another taxpayer-funded bailout. Banks have complained that regulators have unduly required banks to pile on capital that they could use to lend to small business and homeowners. The required capital buildup has also squeezed the industry’s profits, which can cut into bankers’ pay and bonuses. Thursday’s results are very likely a good harbinger for next week’s even more consequential test, when Fed officials will decide whether to approve the banks’ plans to pay dividends and repurchase shares.

"WASHINGTON — Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and his fiancée, the Scottish actress Louise Linton, are a match made in Hollywood, and one that tends to cut a conspicuous presence through this strait-laced capital. But they managed to keep their wedding plans secret until a fellow cabinet secretary spoiled the surprise. The couple’s plans to marry in Washington on Saturday were made public by Wilbur L. Ross, the Commerce secretary, who let the news slip during a conference in the capital this week. Mr. Ross is a frequent dining companion of the couple, who are often spotted around town with their security detail and with friends or family in tow. In an email relayed through a spokeswoman, Ms. Linton, 36, confirmed the plans but said little else about the event — “Wedding Venue is historical building in D.C.,” she wrote — citing security concerns for not giving specifics. In the email, Ms. Linton said she met Mr. Mnuchin at a wedding reception in Los Angeles in 2013. Mr. Mnuchin proposed two years later, after Ms. Linton stopped to admire the shape of an oval diamond in a jewelry store window while at Art Basel Miami Beach, she told the magazine Town & Country in a recent interview about her jewelry box, which is full of diamonds and pearls. The marriage will be the latest high-profile nuptials for Trump administration officials, and the Trump International Hotel in Washington has so far been the preferred space: Omarosa Manigault, a political aide in the White House and a Trump “Apprentice” alumna, married John Allen Newman, a pastor, there in April. Ms. Linton declined to share the names of guests but said that “many from administration” would be among about 300 guests expected to attend. One confirmed guest is the designer Ines Di Santo of Toronto, who flew to Washington in April to design a custom wedding gown. Veronica Di Santo-Abramowicz, Ms. Di Santo’s business partner and daughter, said in a phone interview that her mother had made a “very grand” dress for a “very feminine” bride. "
"If freedom of the press includes the right to print all-caps headlines with exclamation points, it also includes the right to make a cinematic exposé so bombastic that it poorly serves its own cause, however important. Brian Knappenberger’s documentary “Nobody Speak: Trials of the Free Press,” which is being released simultaneously in theaters and on Netflix, draws a through-line from Hulk Hogan’s privacy lawsuit against Gawker Media to the journalistic challenges posed by the presidency of Donald J. Trump, with three overarching points to make. The first is that whatever you think of Gawker’s decision to publish an excerpt from a sex tape featuring Mr. Hogan, a professional wrestler whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, the case had potentially far-ranging implications for the news media’s ability to cover public figures. The $140 million judgment against Gawker, which filed for bankruptcy and was later sold to Univision — the suit was ultimately settled with Mr. Hogan for $31 million — sets a precedent that the movie argues could snuff out significant reporting. (Not all legal experts are so sure.) The second is that the lawsuit itself, subsequently revealed to have been bankrolled by Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder and Silicon Valley billionaire, represented a disturbing instance of a powerful figure secretly using wealth to stifle a voice he regarded as adversarial. The movie suggests that while moguls meddling in the news is at least as old as William Randolph Hearst, hidden puppeteering of this sort is new. About an hour in, the movie clumsily shifts focus, introducing former staff members of The Las Vegas Review-Journal who recount Sheldon Adelson’s secretive acquisition of that paper, a publication that could theoretically serve as a check on Mr. Adelson’s dealings. The third, hardly a surprise, is that the presidency of Mr. Trump, who makes a regular target of reporters, represents a threat to news organizations interested in pursuing the truth. "
"WHEELING, W.Va. — On Feb. 9, 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy disembarked from his Capital Airlines plane at Stifel Field here, where he planned to speak at a Lincoln Day event hosted by the Ohio County Women’s Republican Club. At the McLure Hotel downtown that night, Joe McCarthy, a 41-year-old junior Republican senator from Wisconsin, gave one of the most infamous speeches in American history, mixing right-wing demagogy and outright lies as he claimed that there were hundreds of Communists burrowed deep in the State Department and accused President Harry Truman’s Democratic administration of refusing to weed them out. His speech electrified a crowd of 275 in the McLure’s Colonnade ballroom and transformed him into a frightening national force. Mr. McCarthy blamed “elite” Democrats in the Truman administration, particularly Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who he said had failed to purge “the enemy within” that threatened America’s security and way of life: “While I cannot take the time to name all of the men in the State Department who have been named as members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring, I have here in my hand a list of 205 that were known to the secretary of state as being members of the Communist Party and who, nevertheless, are still working and shaping the policy in the State Department.” By today’s standards, the news of Mr. McCarthy’s speech spread across the nation at a glacial pace. Only the local newspaper and radio station covered it (the radio station later mistakenly erased the only tape recording of the speech). It gained national notice because of a 110-word Associated Press story picked up by about two dozen newspapers around the country. But within days, Mr. McCarthy’s accusation that there was a hidden Communist cabal at the heart of the American government blew up into a bitter national controversy. And before long, Joe McCarthy’s Wheeling speech had triggered a wave of paranoia and fear mongering that would forever bear his name: McCarthyism. On June 28, 2016, another Republican politician landed at Stifel, now named Wheeling Ohio County Airport, to campaign here: Donald Trump. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Lawyer Denies Inquiry, Reversing Boss” (front page, June 19): President Trump’s lawyer’s asserting that Mr. Trump is not under investigation is obviously a ploy in preparation for Mr. Trump’s firing of the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller. If Mr. Trump can make the case that he believes he is not under investigation, then legally (or so he wants us to believe) firing Mr. Mueller would not be obstruction of justice.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • In China, the stocks of major conglomerates, including Wanda and HNA, tumbled after a senior banking regulator said that his agency was looking into “systemic risk of some large enterprises.” The comments came as Beijing is seeking to rein in the overseas buying sprees of some of its most ambitious companies. On the upside, Tesla announced that it is in talks to start manufacturing electric cars in Shanghai. The news comes after Ford said it would shift production of its Focus compact model to China. "
"WASHINGTON — When it comes to managing Republicans’ best interests, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, rarely loses. So it is possible that Mr. McConnell views the potential failure of a hastily written health care bill as an eventual boon. His presentation on Thursday of the Senate’s health care measure to Republican colleagues — after the White House and key lobbyists got a peek the night before — was met with something other than unbridled enthusiasm. According to lawmakers who were at the unveiling, members from the left and right ends of the party’s spectrum were deeply critical of the effort. As Democrats immediately took to the Senate floor to excoriate the bill and the secretive process in which it was put together, few Republicans, even those involved in crafting it, came to defend it. A handful of Republicans — more than Mr. McConnell can afford to lose — were quick to disparage the measure. “I have serious concerns about the bill’s impact on the Nevadans who depend on Medicaid,” Senator Dean Heller, his party’s most vulnerable incumbent in the 2018 elections, said of his constituents. Senator Susan Collins of Maine rendered her own lukewarm judgment, while Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia simply said she would read it, with all the enthusiasm of a college senior faced with a weekend assignment of Proust.

"By now, you may have heard that young voters were critical in the election in the United Kingdom earlier this month, helping deliver embarrassing losses to the Conservative Party. As politically active progressives in our 20s, we were eager to help mobilize the youth vote before the election. But we also knew that reaching out to people in our mostly left-wing social bubble would change nothing. Yara’s matches on the dating app Tinder were surprisingly responsive when she suggested that they register to vote. So we decided to scale it up. With the help of two software engineers, Erika Pheby and Kyle Buttner, we designed a chatbot, a smart computer program that deployed an adaptable script. In the two days ahead of the election earlier this month, the chatbot struck up conversations with thousands of young people between 18 and 25 years old on Tinder. The chatbot talked about politics, with the aim of getting voters to help oust the Conservative government. The results were amazing. Over 30,000 messages reached young people in key constituencies. This is how it worked: People we recruited from Facebook and Twitter “lent” us their Tinder profiles, and the bot convinced Tinder that their profiles were in geographical locations where the vote was close. In these places, the proportion of 18-25-year-olds was high enough that they could swing the election — if they turned out at the national average. Using the photograph of the person who’d lent their profile, the program would automatically swipe “yes” on every user, and if someone swiped “yes” back, creating a “match,” the bot would ask about the user’s voting plans.If the user planned to vote for Labour (or whatever party best placed to beat the Conservatives), the bot sent a message with a link to the nearest polling station. If the user planned to vote for another progressive party, the bot asked if he or she would consider a tactical vote to beat the Tories, voting for the progressive party most likely to beat the Conservatives in their area. And if the user was voting for a right-wing party or was unsure, the bot sent a list of Labour policies, or a criticism of Tory policies. People who lent their profiles could jump in and chat at any time. And they did. We were amazed by the number of people saying that they’d spent hours convincing a match 300 miles away that high taxation for the rich would benefit them, because we all benefit from investment in the National Health Service. Others organized dates with people with whom they had compatible politics. The occasional match was disappointed to be talking to a bot instead of a human, but there was very little negative feedback: Tinder is too casual a platform for users to feel hoodwinked by some political conversation. By and large, users surprised us with their receptiveness. Some people who received bot messages asked how they could join us. Our inboxes were flooded. The number of profiles lent to us in just two evenings was incredible — we needed a 10-person team to process sign ups. We knew we were a part of something big. The fact is that until we saw the exit poll, which showed significant losses for the Conservative Party, we were pessimistic. When the election was announced, we prepared ourselves for a bloodbath. But like thousands of young people across the Britain, we got to work. "
"Aron Nimzowitsch, among the chess greats of his day, didn’t take well to losing badly. Knowing that he was about to be beaten by an inferior opponent in a 1925 tournament, he jumped on the table and yelled, “Against this idiot I have to lose?” Democrats must know the feeling. There are many ways to interpret — and overinterpret — Democrat Jon Ossoff’s not-so-narrow loss on Tuesday to Republican Karen Handel in the race for Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. It’s been in Republican hands nearly 40 years. Tom Price, who vacated the seat to become secretary of Health and Human Services, won last November by more than 20 points. The district is nearly 70 percent white and relatively affluent. This was always going to be an uphill climb for any Democrat, even one as fresh and ideologically moderate as Ossoff. Then again, this election was supposed to be for Democrats approximately what Scott Brown’s 2010 Senate victory in Massachusetts was for Republicans: the first ripple of a midterm wave, in a state dominated by the other party, prompted by an overreaching incumbent president bent on radical health care reform. But it wasn’t to be, despite a huge Democratic voter-turnout effort. Nor did it make any difference that Ossoff had a $23.6 million war chest, and Democrats have a 6.7 percentage point lead in the generic congressional ballot, and Donald Trump is relatively unpopular in the district and even more unpopular nationwide. Whatever else might be said about the race, Democrats didn’t lose for lack of political talent, campaign financing and organization or enthusiasm among their base. They lost because of their brand. What is that? Democrats may think the brand is all about diversity, inclusion and fairness. But for millions of Americans, the brand is also about contempt — intellectual contempt of the kind Nimzowitsch exuded for his opponent (the grandmaster Fritz Sämisch, who, in fairness, was no slouch); moral contempt of the sort Hillary Clinton felt for Trump (never more evident than last year when Hillary Clinton wondered, “Why aren’t I fifty points ahead?”).

"In a sense, Blackstone is back where it started. On June 22, 2007, at what turned out to be a market peak, Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson took their private equity firm public in a ballyhooed transaction that inspired rivals to do the same. A decade on, the firm’s units are trading just above their $31 price ahead of their New York Stock Exchange debut. A better result over the next 10 years could require Blackstone to financially re-engineer itself. Even including dividends, assumed reinvested to derive a total return, Blackstone’s performance has been just ordinary. At about 7 percent a year since the initial public offering, its stock has fared no better than the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, and at a much higher risk. The firm has roughly $360 billion to deploy into buyouts, real estate and credit on behalf of pension and sovereign wealth funds, and that has historically generated at least twice as much return for the investors in the funds Blackstone runs. And while Blackstone units have outperformed the 1.2 percent total return delivered by shares of the Wall Street blue-chip Goldman Sachs, they’ve badly lagged some best-of-breed money managers, including BlackRock, the mutual and exchange-traded fund behemoth, and Berkshire Hathaway. Warren E. Buffett’s conglomerate makes for an apt comparison in that it’s an investment akin to owning a slice of both Blackstone’s publicly traded units and a piece of each of the companies held by its funds. Inside 32-year-old Blackstone, the stock performance isn’t the main measure of the I.P.O.’s success. Simply going public conferred a certain brand status, particularly overseas. Selling a big slug of the new units to China Investment Corporation also paid off. China Investment gritted its teeth through a share-price decline of nearly 90 percent at one stage and helped Blackstone forge relationships with other pools of capital in the People’s Republic. Over the years, the firm has sold more than $30 billion of its holdings, including stakes in Hilton Worldwide and the European warehouse owner Logicor, to Chinese buyers. And Mr. Schwarzman established a unique scholarship program at Tsinghua University. The units also provided a currency to reward employees and expand the firm. For example, less than a year after the listing, Blackstone used units to help fund the acquisition of GSO Capital Partners, which significantly enlarged its credit-investment arm. Since going public, Blackstone has quadrupled its assets under management while increasing its work force less than threefold, to about 2,100. That’s a measure of the economies of scale Mr. Schwarzman and his right-hand man, Tony James, have produced, with the right people to help them. They’re not alone, though. Over the same span, Larry Fink’s far larger BlackRock has nearly quintupled the amount it oversees, to some $5.1 trillion, with two and a half times the staff, now numbering 13,000. "
"Three seasons into its run, the FX anthology series “Fargo” is still finding new ways to surprise. Along with the blood baths we’ve come to expect from the show’s epic finales, Wednesday’s episode culminated in an apparently open-ended l standoff between the righteous cop Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon) and this season’s avatar for all things evil, V.M. Varga (David Thewlis, whom The Times interviewed here.). If that non-resolution left you searching for insight into the moral nature of the universe — or if you just want to read more about Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s wonderful character, Nikki Swango — here’s a selection of worthwhile recaps and interviews to help you work through it. ‘“Fargo” Season 3 Finale: Bled Out’ (The New York Times) In his recap of the episode, Scott Tobias observes that: “justice takes different forms in ‘Fargo’ this season, because the two intersecting cases — Varga’s takeover of Stussy Lots and the feud between Ray and Emmit Stussy — are not the same, however much they’ve literally bled into each other. One is an act of capitalist savagery. The other is the culmination of personal animus.” ‘“Fargo” Season-Finale Recap: The Great American Experiment’ (Vulture) Brian Tallerico focuses in his recap on the finale’s open-ended conclusion. “The third season of ‘Fargo’ ends with something of a cliffhanger, but it’s one that plays into exactly what this season has been about: the fluid nature of truth,” he writes. Tallerico adds that: “‘Fargo’ ends in-between two possible futures. In a sense, it allows us to finish the story ourselves.” ‘“Fargo” Leaves a Door Open in Its Terrific Third Season Finale’ (Uproxx) While most critics have declined to weigh in on whether Gloria or Varga will win the showdown, Alan Sepinwall ventures that, “Ordinarily, the show’s moral ethos would point towards Gloria being correct about Rikers and the Snickers bar, but so much of Season 3 has been about the way the world no longer makes sense, and how easy it is for the Vargas of the world to transform reality into whatever they desire, so I fear the powerful man will be arriving rather than the three D.H.S. agents.” ‘The Finale of ‘Fargo’s’ Third Season Sure Does Signify ... Something’ (A.V. Club) Although its first two seasons enjoyed nearly universal acclaim, some critics complained that Season 3 felt a bit messy. But the finale convinced Zack Handlen that: “a lot of my structural criticisms of this season were misplaced. At the very least, all the disconnection that plagued me for so long — the way characters revealed information at times that seemed too late to be dramatically effective, the weird hiccups and sideways jerks of the narrative, the structure that never entirely coalesced into anything coherent — was on purpose.” ‘“Fargo” Season 3 Squandered TV’s Greatest Cast by Trying to Be Every Show at Once’ (Indiewire) Not every writer found the finale redeeming, though. Steve Greene concludes that: “One of the reasons ‘Fargo’ succeeded in creating something all its own in preceding installments is that it guided its ambiguities towards a greater purpose. Season 3’s many allegories and literary allusions left little room for interpretation or subversion.” "
"Good morning on this radiant Thursday. It’s a job outdoors in the middle of Manhattan, where you can see the sources of the city’s clamor but can’t hear them. Cristian Toledo, who has been a window washer since 2009, says working outside an office building is his preferred way of life. “I prefer to look at people working in the office than me working in the office,” he said. “I can see everything — Central Park all the way down to the World Trade Center.” But before stepping onto any scaffolding, potential window washers must be trained. Members of the Service Employees International Union 32BJ, which represents property services workers, have to train for 216 hours in a classroom and another 3,000 hours hands on. That includes learning how to handle risks like the malfunctioning of equipment and problems with the weather. “The wind — whether you’re working scaffold, on belt or on ladder — is very dangerous,” said Andy Horton, who has been cleaning windows for 33 years and trains window washers. “It’s a nonstop checkpoint. You’re checking every 15 to 20 minutes to make sure that everything is O.K.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Unveiling the health bill. Senate Republican leaders plan to make public today their legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The measure was drafted behind closed doors and is scheduled for a vote next week. A provision related to abortion flared up on Wednesday as the latest issue to complicate passage of the bill, which our reporters in Congress say “appears to be too moderate for some Senate conservatives and too conservative for some Senate moderates.” The measure would make major changes to Medicaid, our health care correspondent explains. We have a copy of a letter from insurance industry executives who spoke out against those cuts. Finally, we assessed a defense of the bill by one of its architects, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. • “Our brand is worse than Trump.” Democrats are  regrouping after an election defeat in Georgia, with some questioning the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Samantha Bee thinks the Trump administration may have changed our relationship with words. On Wednesday’s “Full Frontal,” Ms. Bee adopted the format of a futuristic sci-fi “Dr. Strangelove.” Then she played footage of President Trump, his daughter Ivanka, his lawyer Jay Sekulow and others contradicting themselves or generally disregarding the meanings of certain words. Then Ms. Bee played a clip of Kate Bolduan of CNN wondering “what does matter” in a world where the president’s words do not. James Corden seized on a cringe-worthy meme: Marco Rubio was caught on camera on Tuesday in an awkward not-quite-embrace with Ivanka Trump. In a moment of outrage, Trevor Noah told his “Daily Show” audience that seeing dashboard camera footage of the police shooting of Philando Castile, a black motorist in Minnesota, “broke me.” The video shows Mr. Castile being shot after telling the police officer that he had a gun in his possession but that he was not reaching for it. In an off-air chat with the audience, recorded between the show’s televised segments, Mr. Noah went on to say that he considers police violence a form of institutional and historical racism. And he revealed that in just a few years in America, he had been stopped by an officer close to 10 times. "
"TORONTO — As President Trump disrupts alliances across the map, nearly every level of government in Canada has taken on new duties in a quietly audacious campaign to cajole, contain and if necessary coerce the Americans. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s strategy for managing Mr. Trump is unlike anything tried by another ally. And he has largely succeeded where even experienced leaders like Angela Merkel of Germany have fallen short. More than perhaps any other country, Canada relies on the United States, which accounts for 70 percent of its trade. Its sizable manufacturing industry is tightly integrated with American production, meaning even a slight hardening of the border or prolonged trade negotiations could put its economy at risk. Laid in the first days after Mr. Trump’s election win, the plan even enlists Brian Mulroney, a former Conservative prime minister and political nemesis of Mr. Trudeau’s father, who had also been prime minister. Mr. Mulroney knows Mr. Trump and his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, from social circuits in southern Florida, where all three keep vacation homes. Mr. Mulroney’s former chief of staff and ambassador to Washington, Derek Burney, said they urged Mr. Trudeau’s government to “cultivate access, but not just within the White House. To work the American system as never before.” By organizing a grass-roots network of American officials, lawmakers and businesses, Canada is hoping to contain Mr. Trump’s protectionist and nationalist impulses. Though emphasizing the benefits of harmony, the Canadians are not above flexing muscle, with a provincial government at one point quietly threatening trade restrictions against New York State. "
"The huge, headline-grabbing news out of Uber this week was the resignation of its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, under pressure from the company’s board, a stunning move that capped a monthslong crisis involving sexual harassment, executive misbehavior and Uber’s hard-nosed culture. But amid the drama leading up to Mr. Kalanick’s forced departure, Uber made a quieter change that could represent another momentous shift for the company. On Tuesday, the company announced that passengers would soon be able to tip their drivers through the Uber app. The change, which Uber plans to roll out nationwide next month, is a sudden reversal of longstanding company policy, and a move Uber fiercely resisted for years. Under Mr. Kalanick, the company argued that giving riders the ability to tip drivers would create “friction” in an otherwise seamless transaction and lead to awkward interactions between riders and drivers. The company even cited a 2008 Cornell University study that found that consumers tipped black employees less generously than white employees, and suggested that adding in-app tipping would lead to racial discrimination. The relationship between Mr. Kalanick and Uber’s global network of more than two million drivers has always been strained, to put it mildly. Drivers, who are not technically Uber employees but whose income depends largely on Uber’s policies and pricing structures, balked at Mr. Kalanick’s seeming indifference to their needs. At times, Mr. Kalanick sounded openly hostile to his company’s labor pool, musing in onstage interviews about how long it would take to replace them with self-driving cars. “There are a lot of things about Uber that tip the balance to the passenger side,” said Harry Campbell, a Los Angeles-based Uber driver and founder of TheRideshareGuy, a resource site for drivers. “A lot of that seemed, rightly or wrongly, to stem from Travis, and a lot of drivers blamed him for that.” "
"By now it has become quite clear that conservative parties in Europe and the United States have been gaining strength from white voters who have been mobilized around issues related to nationalism — resistance to open borders and to third-world immigration. In the United States, this development has been exacerbated by ongoing conservative recruitment on issues of race that has reinforced opposition to immigration. On the liberal side, the Democratic Party and the center-left European parties have been allied in favor of globalization, if we define globalization as receptivity to open borders, the expansion of local and nationalistic perspectives and support for a less rigid social order and for liberal cultural, immigration and trade policies. In recent decades, these parties, both in Europe and in the United States have begun to include and reflect the views of large numbers of well-educated elites — relatively affluent knowledge or creative class workers — in alliance with predominantly nonwhite minority constituencies of the less well-off. Ewald Engelen, a social scientist at the University of Amsterdam, argues that the old paradigm of a left arguing for strong government intervention and a right preferring market solutions to social problems has been replaced. “Today,” he told Al Jazeera,“we see that the dominant dichotomy has become globalism versus nationalism.” Stewart Patrick, the director of the International Institutions and Global Governance Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, elaborated on these trends in an email: In the United States, Sean McElwee, a policy analyst at the liberal think tank Demos, and Jason McDaniel, a professor of political science at San Francisco State University, examined data from American National Election Studies and reported in The Nation that In their essay, McElwee and McDaniel graphed data documenting their findings, which is reproduced in the accompanying chart. White voters who supported Trump were decidedly strong on measures of anti-black affect and hostility to the integration of immigrants into the population of the United States. Elections over the past two years here and in Britain, Austria, France and the Netherlands have demonstrated the depth of this transformation of the organized left and the organized right. Whatever the outcome of the voting in a particular country, a clear pattern appears. The emerging or nascent partisan divide has a strong cultural subtext: for or against “traditional values”; young versus old; rural versus urban; the college educated versus those without degrees; blue collar versus white collar; us versus them; whites versus nonwhites; immigrant versus native born; European versus non-European. The rise of an affluent left — sometimes triumphant, sometimes not — can be seen in the victories of Emmanuel Macron and his new La République en Marche (the Republic on the Move) party in France; in the surprise showing of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party in the June 8 parliamentary elections in Britain; in the composition of the electorate that unsuccessfully backed Hillary Clinton; and in the victories of Alexander Van der Bellen, president of Austria, and of Mark Rutte’s People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy in the Netherlands.
