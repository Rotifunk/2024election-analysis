"CLARENCE, N.Y. — In early June, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo joined forces with Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, and declared in no uncertain terms that he would do whatever he could to help unseat six Republican members of New York’s congressional delegation in next year’s midterm elections. Since then, more than a dozen Democrats have announced their candidacy in those six districts, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission, joining nearly a dozen others who had preceded the governor’s declaration of war. The Republicans are certainly taking the threats to their seats seriously, especially considering the historic trend of losses for the president’s party in midterm elections. And there is no question that the stumbles of the Trump administration and the still-stinging November loss by Hillary Clinton have encouraged a groundswell of energy in the Democratic Party base. Yet the decision by Mr. Cuomo to wade into the federal races has added an interesting dynamic to the contests — one that the Republicans do not seem to mind at all. “If Cuomo and Pelosi want to come to our districts to try to bring us down, I would encourage them to,” said Representative Tom Reed, who represents a large swath of the state’s Southern Tier. In races throughout the state, Republicans indicate they will try to link Democratic candidates to Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat who is thought to have national ambitions, but whose approval ratings have been hurt by New York City’s failing subway system. Such a strategy is based on Mr. Cuomo’s lack of popularity in the very districts he hopes to flip: During his 2014 re-election campaign, he lost each and every one of them, sometimes by embarrassing margins. And President Trump won each of those districts last fall. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump traveled to storm-brushed Corpus Christi, Tex., on Tuesday to survey some of the damage caused by Tropical Storm Harvey and demonstrate his personal commitment to a region still in the grips of a historic natural disaster. Mr. Trump, who pushed aides to schedule a trip to Texas as early as possible after Harvey made landfall there on Friday night, settled on visiting Corpus Christi because it was the closest he could get to the hardest-hit areas without disrupting recovery efforts, according to state officials. The port city of 325,000 is 30 miles from the most severely affected parts of the Gulf Coast, and suffered relatively light damage from the initial impact of the storm. After meeting at a Corpus Christi firehouse with state and federal officials, the president flew to Austin, Tex., for another meeting with officials involved in responding to the flooding before returning to Washington. Members of Mr. Trump’s staff said the trip was mainly a humanitarian mission and that the president winced while watching televised scenes of ruin and rescue on the flooded streets of Houston on his way to Corpus Christi. But they conceded that the stakes were high for Mr. Trump on his first visit to a disaster area that was inevitably seen as a test of his competence and empathy. For the most part, Mr. Trump kept to the script. But there were a few jarring, quintessentially Trumpian moments. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — The United Nations Security Council condemned on Tuesday North Korea’s recent missile tests, including one that sent a ballistic missile soaring over Japan, as “outrageous actions.” But it gave no indication that it was prepared to take tougher measures against Pyongyang, which called the latest launch a “curtain-raiser.” The 15 members of the Security Council met for nearly four hours in an emergency session to discuss a response to the North’s latest test, which sent an intermediate-range ballistic missile over the Japanese island of Hokkaido. They unanimously adopted a statement condemning that launch and three others on Saturday, calling them “not just a threat to the region but all U.N. member states.” But nothing in the statement suggested the council was ready to further toughen the eight sets of sanctions it has imposed on the North, and it was unclear what additional action, if any, might be taken. Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said the statement showed that “the world is united against North Korea.” She hinted at a possible American response, saying that “the United States will not allow this lawlessness to continue.” President Trump said in a statement earlier Tuesday, “All options are on the table.” North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has authorized more than 80 missile tests since taking power almost six years ago. But all those missiles landed in nearby waters because they were of limited range or fired at a sharp angle, high into space, so they would splash down without going too far. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a statement condemning what it called North Korea’s “outrageous actions” in launching a ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday and launching three missiles last Saturday. But there was no suggestion that the council was ready to toughen sanctions. President Trump warned that “all options are on the table,” while China called on the North to suspend its missile tests in return for a halt to U.S.-South Korean military exercises. And Japanese citizens, some of whom received a beeping alert on their cellphones just four minutes after the projectile was launched, may be rethinking support for their pacifist Constitution. _____ "
"The Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is all too familiar with roadblocks: Over the last few years he has fought disputes with the governments of China and Britain as well as with the Lego Group, to name a few. This time, he’s being challenged by a much smaller group: The Washington Square Association. Mr. Ai is currently plotting a large-scale public art installation across New York City, entitled “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” The exhibition, commissioned by the Public Art Fund in celebration of its 40th anniversary, will bring 300 works centered on the theme of borders and immigration to all five boroughs. But the Washington Square Association is protesting Mr. Ai’s proposed installation in the park’s archway, as the Washington Square Park Blog first reported. The Association has reported receiving widespread complaints from the community members, who contend the installation would compromise the arch’s own artistic integrity and disrupt the annual holiday tree lighting. “This installation sets a dangerous precedent that one of New York City’s most recognized monuments and pieces of art can be decorated and co-opted for four months at a time,” Trevor Sumner, the Association’s president, wrote in an open letter addressed to the Public Art Fund. In an interview, Mr. Sumner said that although the exhibition was announced in March, the Public Art Fund waited until four weeks ago to inform the Association of its plans, and left little time for change or negotiation. “It’s ironic that the installation is called ‘Good Neighbors,’” he said, given that the Fund did not formally consult with neighbors like his association and the Washington Square Park Conservancy. The Fund did, however, meet with the members of the Manhattan Community Board No. 2 about the project. In an interview, Nicholas Baume, the director and chief curator of the Public Art Fund, said that the installation has been cleared by relevant city agencies and officials — including the Landmarks Preservation Commission — and that his organization has contacted various members of the community. “Every organization, with the exception of the Association, has been absolutely enthusiastic,” Mr. Baume said. He also said the Fund would pay for the relocation of the holiday tree and would meet with the community board on Sept. 6 to respond to questions. The installation, which renderings depict as a large cagelike structure sitting in the archway, is scheduled for display from Oct. 12 through Feb. 11. It arrives just as President Trump seeks funds for a border wall along the Mexican border. In an email interview with The New York Times in March, Mr. Ai spoke about the need for such an installation: “We are witnessing a rise in nationalism, an increase in the closure of borders, and an exclusionary attitude toward migrants and refugees, the victims of war and the casualties of globalization.” "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — Airstrikes in western Afghanistan killed more than a dozen civilians, according to residents and officials on Tuesday, adding to the record number of  civilians who have died this year as violence has intensified. The exact number of casualties in the airstrikes Monday afternoon in the Shindand district of Herat Province was unclear. Gaelany Farhad, a spokesman for the province’s governor, said that 13 civilians and 16 Taliban fighters had been killed in Zer Koh, a remote and mountainous area where factions of the Taliban have a foothold but have sometimes fought one another. But several residents contacted by The New York Times said that the Taliban had left the area about three hours before the strikes, and that all of the victims were civilians, many of them women and children. A spokesman for the American military in Afghanistan, which often carries out airstrikes to try to provide support to Afghan forces, said that the strikes on Monday were by the Afghan Air Force. Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, confirmed that the country’s air force had carried out the strikes, and said that 18 Taliban fighters had been killed. “There are reports of civilian casualties, and the government has appointed a delegation to investigate the incident,” Mr. Waziri said. But a senior Afghan Air Force official in the west of the country, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, denied his forces were involved.

"I would like to believe that what fascinated Donald Trump about the floodwaters of Texas and pulled him to the state on Tuesday were the scenes of human suffering. I would also like to believe that I’m a dead ringer for Brad Pitt. But what Trump saw in Hurricane Harvey was a mirror of his own majesty. A storm worthy of a stud like him. A meteorological complement to one of his resorts, rallies or steaks. Something really, really big. “Even experts have said they’ve never seen one like this!” Trump marveled on Twitter, and I read exultation into that not because I’m sour on the president but because I have eyes. Also because I have a memory. He has used almost exactly those words to describe a buffet of developments in his rise and reign, always with an air of self-impressed wonder. I keep hoping against hope that a new challenge will tease out a new Trump and that if he malingers in the presidency long enough, he’ll meander in the direction of eloquence, slouch toward poetry and tumble into inspiration. Stranger things have happened. I’ll have to get back to you on what they were. But Trump’s hurricane talk and hurricane tweets were like his fair-weather fare: childishly intent on superlatives, puerilely obsessed with size, laden with boasts and lavish with discordant asides. “Thanks!” he exclaimed at the end of a tweet that was mostly about the “historic rainfall in Houston” and the “unprecedented” flooding. True, he was referring to the “spirit of the people” that he also squeezed into that 140-character nook, but his chirpy gratitude had a kooky ring. It framed him not as a leader sweating the fate of his people but as a spectator watching nature’s angriest reality show. "
"The fashion world has a new darling. She’s a size 4, counts Queen Elizabeth I and Marie Antoinette as her style icons and has “a flat stomach, great legs and curvy hips,” according to Vogue. She also happens to have perpetrated one of the greatest leaks of classified government material in American history. But that’s not the primary concern of the breathless media coverage afforded Chelsea Manning, born Bradley. Ms. Manning is the subject of a reverent profile and Annie Leibovitz photo spread in the September issue of Vogue, the magazine’s most important edition. The author, Nathan Heller, portrays the “graceful, blue-eyed” and unapologetic former Army private traipsing across Manhattan in a Gabriela Hearst dress and Dr. Martens, dispensing fashion tips like state secrets. (“I’ve been a huge fan of Marc Jacobs for many, many years,” she says. “He captures a kind of simplicity and a kind of beauty that I like — projecting strength through femininity.”) In a separate feature, the magazine took Ms. Manning vintage shopping as she assembled her “femme Johnny Cash” look. Not since Vogue published a piece about the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, “The Rose in the Desert,” for which it subsequently apologized and scrubbed from its website, has it celebrated such a morally compromised figure. Anna Wintour’s glossy isn’t the only fashion outlet fascinated with Ms. Manning’s transition from soldier to advocate and from male to female. “I choose my lipstick colors carefully,” she says in an exclusive for Yahoo Beauty. “I’m not just saying, ‘I like this edgy color.’ This is an expression of my humanity. And beauty, to me, is self-expression.” On Instagram, Ms. Manning certainly expresses herself emphatically, posing with her boot stomping the camera and promising to “defend against fascism by any means necessary,” the violence-endorsing slogan of the antifa movement. Ms. Manning also serves as artistic muse. On her website, the illustrator Molly Crabapple displays a florid birthday card she sent the imprisoned Ms. Manning three years ago. “We breathed the same air twice, at the courtroom in Fort Meade,” Ms. Crabapple wrote. At Greenwich Village’s Fridman Gallery, Ms. Manning is the subject of an exhibition in which the artist, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, rendered 3-D images of the former prisoner using DNA pulled from cheek swabs and hair samples she mailed from jail. Ted Hearne, the composer of an opera about Ms. Manning, “The Source,” which ran in San Francisco this year, insists she committed a “victimless crime.” That’s not true. When Ms. Manning transmitted 750,000 secret military records and State Department cables to WikiLeaks in 2010, she not only jeopardized continuing missions and disrupted American diplomacy. She also put an untold number of innocent people’s lives in danger. "

"When the American author James A. Michener went to Afghanistan to research his work of historical fiction, “Caravans,” it was 1955 and there were barely any roads in the country. Yet there were already Americans and Russians there, jockeying for influence. Later, the book’s Afghan protagonist would tell an American diplomat that one day both America and Russia would invade Afghanistan, and that both would come to regret it. Michener’s foresight was uncanny, but perhaps that is not terribly surprising. Afghanistan has long been called the “graveyard of empires” — for so long that it is unclear who coined that disputable term. In truth, no great empires perished solely because of Afghanistan. Perhaps a better way to put it is that Afghanistan is the battleground of empires. Even without easily accessible resources, the country has still been blessed — or cursed, more likely — with a geopolitical position that has repeatedly put it in someone or other’s way. In the 19th century there was the Great Game, when the British and Russian empires faced off across its forbidding deserts and mountain ranges. At the end of the 20th century it was the Cold War, when the Soviet and American rivalry played out here in a bitter guerrilla conflict. And in this century, it is the War on Terror and a constantly shifting Taliban insurgency, with President Trump promising a renewed military commitment. Wars of the last three “empires” to invade Afghanistan coincided with the age of photography, leaving a rich record of their triumphs and failures, and an arresting chronicle of a land that seems to have changed little in the past two centuries. Over an 80-year period, the British fought three wars in Afghanistan, occupying or controlling the country in between, and lost tens of thousands of dead along the way. Finally, exhausted by the First World War, Britain gave up in 1919 and granted Afghanistan independence. "
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — For the past 16 years, whenever the United States has been faced with the reality of a failing war in Afghanistan, it has blamed Pakistan. Efforts to bring freedom to the valleys of Afghanistan, this narrative claims, have been thwarted by a double-dealing “ally” that takes American aid while supporting its enemies. The narrative inadvertently casts American presidents, generals, diplomats, spies and others who have been part of the war effort as credulous dupes and casts poor light on the American military, stuck in a quagmire despite having the world’s most advanced weapons and largest financial resources. It also assumes that Pakistan has a clear interest in harming both the United States and Afghanistan. Those assumptions are wrong. Pakistan joined President George W. Bush’s war on terrorism reluctantly but proved itself an effective ally in the fight against Al Qaeda and helped decimate its ranks. That contribution was sullied by Pakistan’s failure to locate Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States established a partnership with Pakistan over a decade and a half — handing out substantial amounts of aid, sophisticated weapons and the status of major non-NATO ally. Pakistan continues to require American military hardware, and middle-class Pakistani children continue to dream of attending American universities and of working on Wall Street. The United States is the biggest market for Pakistani exports, and Pakistani-Americans form its seventh-largest diaspora group. China’s rising global status, and its explicit push for regional influence, has reduced Pakistan’s dependence on the United States, but the rumors of the demise of America’s importance in Pakistan are greatly exaggerated. Despite these factors, neither the United States nor Pakistan has gained all that it would like from the relationship. Pakistan has not been able to convince the United States of the validity of its primary interest in Afghanistan — preventing it from becoming a “proxy for India” and stemming fears of “encirclement” in Pakistan despite India’s proclamations of merely offering economic assistance to Afghanistan.

"President Trump has largely left management of his administration’s tax overhaul to the former Goldman Sachs executives Gary D. Cohn and Steven Mnuchin. That is making some conservatives nervous. For one, the advisers’ ambitions have already drifted. • The 15 percent corporate tax rate proposed in April is now more likely to be set at 20 to 25 percent, according to people familiar with the recent thinking. • A proposed 35 percent ceiling on the highest personal income tax rate could be shelved altogether, leaving the top rate at the current 39.6 percent. There is also the question of whether their experience in finance is enough to succeed in Mr. Trump’s Washington. • People who have attended meetings with Mr. Cohn say he is nimble with data and has a keen understanding of the economy. But he has also made comments that some lawmakers suggest betray a lack of understanding about the political process. (For instance, he reportedly joked to Senate Democrats that “Only morons pay the estate tax.”) • Mr. Mnuchin has made it clear that he has Mr. Trump’s ear and is speaking for him. He is also more careful and more reserved than Mr. Cohn — and more deferential to lawmakers. "

"WASHINGTON — An anti-immigration Republican who is a fervent supporter of President Trump announced on Tuesday that he will challenge Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, a move that solidifies the president’s stamp on the emerging electoral landscape for 2018. The announcement by Representative Lou Barletta gives Republicans a relatively well-known challenger to Mr. Casey as the party tries to take advantage of an electoral map that heavily favors Republicans. But it also shows the political headwinds the Republicans face: The party’s base voters remain loyal to the president and his agenda, even as the larger electorate drifts away. Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Barletta to run, and in jumping into a crowded primary field, the 61-year-old congressman buoyed Republicans from the president’s wing of the party. He announced his candidacy in a three-minute biographical campaign video in which he reprised Mr. Trump’s slogan, pledging to “make Pennsylvania and America great again.” His entry into the race comes as national Republicans are working feverishly to recruit candidates. So-called Trump Republicans are emerging in states from Florida — where the Republican governor, Rick Scott, is toying with running against Senator Bill Nelson — to Michigan, where the rock musician Robert James Ritchie, better known as Kid Rock, has dropped hints that he will challenge Senator Debbie Stabenow. Mr. Ritchie, along with Sarah Palin and the right-wing rocker Ted Nugent, paid Mr. Trump a memorable visit to the White House. But if Mr. Trump’s backers are enthusiastic about the prospect of increasing their numbers in the Senate, mainstream Republicans are terrified that candidates who cast themselves in the mold of Mr. Trump will cost them seats. In two states — Arizona and Nevada — Trump Republicans are making life exceedingly difficult for Republican incumbents by waging primary challenges against them. “The party needs to be extremely careful,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist in Kentucky who is close to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. He warned that if Congress switched hands, Democrats would move to impeach Mr. Trump. “You do not want to put yourself in a situation to give the Democrats an opening to ruin this presidency,” he said.

"HOUSTON — This has been a harrowing year for the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have put down stakes in Houston. Stepped-up enforcement of immigration measures put many on edge over deportations, while Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed one of the nation’s most punitive laws against cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. President Trump has amplified his harsh line on illegal immigration and renewed his promise to build a border wall. Then came the chaos of Hurricane Harvey. Families among Houston’s estimated 600,000 undocumented immigrants – the largest number of any city in the United States except New York and Los Angeles, according to the Pew Research Center – fled their homes to escape the flooding despite their anxiety over being turned away at shelters or facing hostile immigration agents. “People were telling each other that the immigration men were coming to check our papers,” said Eloy González, 40, a truck driver who made it to the sprawling shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center. All he had were the drenched clothes he was wearing when he escaped the flooding in Pasadena, a suburb of Houston where thousands of immigrants live in the shadow of oil refineries. “The rumors are false but the fear is still there,” said Mr. González, an immigrant from northern Mexico, emphasizing that he was one of the “lucky ones” who is legally in the United States. Even as political leaders in Houston sought to reassure residents that routine immigration enforcement would not be conducted at shelters and food banks, many people fleeing their homes expressed dismay over what they described as mixed signals coming from immigration authorities in the upheaval around Hurricane Harvey.

"The tax overhaul promised by President Trump and Republican congressional leaders is lugging a remarkably heavy load. The goal is not only to reduce the tax bills of corporations and small businesses, but also to stimulate investment, create jobs, increase global competitiveness and promote economic growth. Whatever the intentions, though, pushing the world’s largest and most diversified economy in any particular direction is a colossal undertaking. In addition, there is a large and sophisticated tax avoidance industry dedicated to frustrating the most carefully worded proposals. And as Mr. Trump prepares to outline his corporate tax overhaul ideas in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., economists and tax experts warn that the path is likely to be treacherous. Consider the tantalizing $2.6 trillion in global profits that American companies are keeping out of their home accounts and out of the Internal Revenue Service’s reach. A pro-growth tax policy would presumably aim not only to reach profits kept abroad as a tax dodge, but also to encourage companies to use that money to expand their business and hire more workers. That was what President George W. Bush set out to do in 2004 when he imposed what was meant to be a one-time reprieve and lowered the tax on those funds to 5.25 percent from a potential top rate of 35 percent. More than $300 billion flowed back into the United States, but despite safeguards, companies used most of the money to pay shareholder dividends or buy back stock, not to reinvest. "
"HOUSTON — Five days after the pummeling began — a time when big storms have usually blown through, the sun has come out, and evacuees have returned home — Tropical Storm Harvey refused to go away, battering southeast Texas even more on Tuesday, spreading the destruction into Louisiana and shattering records for rainfall and flooding. Along 300 miles of Gulf Coast, people poured into shelters by the thousands, straining their capacity; as heavy rain kept falling, some rivers were still rising and floodwater in some areas had not crested yet; and with whole neighborhoods flooded, others were covered in water for the first time. Officials cautioned that the full-fledged rescue-and-escape phase of the crisis, usually finished by now, would continue, and that they still had no way to gauge the scale of the catastrophe — how many dead, how many survivors taking shelter inland or still hunkered down in flooded communities, and how many homes destroyed. For everybody, it was another head-shaking 24 hours: • The storm made its second landfall early Wednesday morning in Louisiana, just west of the town of Cameron, the National Hurricane Center announced at 4 a.m. As Harvey moves northeast through the state scarred by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, forecasters expect it to gradually weaken and become a tropical depression by Wednesday night. • Local officials in Texas said at least 30 deaths were believed to have been caused by the storm through Tuesday, up from eight a day earlier. The dead included a Houston police officer, Sgt. Steve Perez, 60, who was caught in flooding on Sunday while trying to report for duty. “I expect that number to be significantly higher once the roads become passable,” said Erin Barnhart, the chief medical examiner for Galveston County. "
"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis kicked President Trump’s proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military down the road, announcing that transgender service members will continue to be allowed to serve pending the results of a study. In a statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Mattis said that he was establishing a panel of experts, serving within the Pentagon and the Homeland Security Department, whose task will be to “provide advice and recommendations on the implementation of the president’s direction.” Mr. Trump announced last month in an abrupt series of tweets that transgender people would no longer be allowed to serve in the military. The Twitter messages took the Pentagon by surprise, and since then, Defense Department officials have been trying to cobble together a policy that takes into account their desire to allow currently serving transgender people to remain, while at the same time following the dictates of a commander in chief who, by most accounts, had not put a lot of study into the ramifications of his instructions. Last week, Mr. Trump signed the directive precluding transgender individuals from serving, but gave Mr. Mattis wide discretion in determining whether those already in the armed forces can continue to serve. By putting the onus on Mr. Mattis, the president appeared to open the door to allowing at least some transgender service members to remain in the military, contrary to his initial tweet that all would be disallowed. Mr. Mattis’s statement on Tuesday appeared to open that door further. “Once the panel reports its recommendations and following my consultation with the secretary of homeland security, I will provide my advice to the president concerning implementation of his policy direction,” Mr. Mattis said in his statement. “In the interim, current policy with respect to currently serving members will remain in place.” He said he will issue “interim guidance to the force concerning the president’s direction, including any necessary interim adjustments to procedures, to ensure the continued combat readiness of the force until our final policy on this subject is issued.” "
" Emergency workers rescued many more soaked and frightened people in southeast Texas on Tuesday as floodwaters continued to rise and officials counseled patience, warning that conditions would not improve soon. The slow-moving, record-shattering tropical storm Harvey battered the region for a sixth straight day and began to move into southwest Louisiana, where it made its second landfall early Wednesday morning. With hundreds of thousands of people under evacuation orders, shelters in Houston filled to bursting with people who craved some news about the safety of their loved ones and the state of their homes. For now, the city’s focus “will continue to be on rescue,” and not on damage assessment — much less recovery — Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, said at a news conference. Here is the latest: • The storm made its second landfall just west of Cameron, La., the National Hurricane Center said at 4 a.m. Wednesday. Harvey was expected to move northeast, gradually weakening and becoming a tropical depression by Wednesday night. • Local officials in Texas have reported at least 30 confirmed and suspected flood-related deaths. • Mr. Turner imposed a curfew in Houston from midnight to 5 a.m. until further notice. • Parts of the Houston area set a record for rainfall from a single storm anywhere in the continental United States, with a top reading on Tuesday afternoon, since the storm began, of 51.88 inches. Jeffrey Lindner, a meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, said 25 to 30 percent of Harris County’s 1,800 square miles of land was flooded. "
"Howard Kaminsky, who honed his instincts for publishing commercially successful books at scrappy Warner Books and parlayed that sense into high-level positions at Random House and Hearst, died on Saturday in Manhattan. Mr. Kaminsky, whose authors included Richard M. Nixon and Donald J. Trump, was 77. His daughter Jessica Kaminsky said the cause was a heart attack. Brash and witty, Mr. Kaminsky developed his reputation at Warner with best sellers like “Never-Say-Diet” (1980), by Richard Simmons; “Megatrends” (1982), by John Naisbitt; sequels to “The Happy Hooker,” by the former madam Xaviera Hollander; potboiler fiction by Andrew Greeley, a Roman Catholic priest; the paperback edition of Judith Krantz’s “Scruples”; and novels by Nelson DeMille. But his best-known deal was certainly the one that Warner made with a recently disgraced former president: Barely six weeks after Nixon resigned in 1974, Mr. Kaminsky signed him to an estimated $2.5 million deal to write his memoirs. “We have an absolutely signed contract, signed by the former president,” Mr. Kaminsky told The New York Times. “His handwriting looks damn good to me. It looked like black ink; he signed it in California.” Warner subsequently sold the hardcover rights to Grosset & Dunlap, which published “RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon” in 1978. Laurence Kirshbaum, who worked at Warner in the 1970s and ′80s, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Kaminsky had been an entrepreneurial, risk-taking executive as the company grew quickly from a mass-market publisher of genre paperbacks to one that also competed heavily to sign major hardcovers. (Warner Books was part of the company that would become Time Warner.) "
"When is a shoe not just a shoe? When it is a pair of very high, needle-thin heels worn by the first lady of the United States on her way to the site of a natural disaster. Then it becomes a symbol for what many see as the disconnect between the Trump administration and reality; another example of the way in which this president and his family continue to define “appropriate” their own way; and an excuse for partisan name-calling. Or so became apparent Tuesday morning when President Trump and his wife left the White House to fly to Texas for a briefing on the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, and Mrs. Trump appeared on the lawn in black pegged trousers, black shades, an olive green bomber jacket — and her stilettos, now a trademark. Very much the same kind of shoes, in other words, she has been wearing since long before she joined her husband on the campaign trail. Though by the time the plane had landed Mrs. Trump looked altogether more grounded, in white sneakers and crisp white shirt, with a ponytail pulled through a black baseball cap emblazoned with the word “FLOTUS,” during her time in the air the original shoes went from being mere footwear to objects of vilification thanks to social media’s specific kind of alchemy. In response to the critical reaction, Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s communications director, emailed the following statement: “It’s sad that we have an active and ongoing natural disaster in Texas, and people are worried about her shoes.” "
"CHICAGO — The Illinois attorney general filed a lawsuit against Chicago on Tuesday, seeking a court-enforced consent decree to overhaul officer training and remedy discriminatory practices that were outlined early this year in a scathing federal critique. Mayor Rahm Emanuel had said in January, with only days remaining in Barack Obama’s presidency, that he would work toward such a consent decree. But no deal materialized after President Trump took office, leading Lisa Madigan, the state attorney general, to press the case in federal court. “In the absence of a committed Justice Department, my office will seek the reforms and support police officers need to implement safe and constitutional police practices,” said Ms. Madigan, a Democrat, who spoke of a “broken trust” between black and Hispanic Chicagoans and their police force. The lawsuit, which seeks a consent decree overseen by a judge, represents a state-level response to federal reluctance to accuse police departments of systemic wrongdoing. During Mr. Obama’s tenure, the Justice Department negotiated consent decrees in Cleveland; Ferguson, Mo.; and other cities where investigators found a pattern of police abuses. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions has spoken skeptically about such agreements and called for greater reverence and support for the police. Negotiations for federal monitoring in Chicago broke down months ago, Mr. Emanuel said. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump vowed on Wednesday that he would not talk to Kim Jong-un, cooling off what has become his on-again, off-again cultivation of North Korea’s rogue dictator. But if Mr. Trump’s tweet, in which he said, “talking is not the answer!,” seemed to reignite tensions with North Korea, it also revealed a paradox in how Asia experts view the crisis. Some fear less that Mr. Trump is going to start a war with Mr. Kim than that he is going to stumble into a risky, unpredictable dialogue with him. The world’s attention has understandably focused on Mr. Trump’s saber-rattling threats against Mr. Kim — most dramatically, his promise to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea if Mr. Kim fired ballistic missiles at United States territory. But a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, these experts said, could open the door to ratifying North Korea’s nuclear status or scaling back America’s joint military exercises with South Korea. That could sunder American alliances with Japan and South Korea and play to the benefit of China, which has long advocated direct dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang. “What the North Koreans are angling for is to bring the danger and tension to a crescendo, and then to pivot to a peace proposal,” said Daniel R. Russel, who served until March as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs. “All of this is focused on pressuring the U.S. to enter direct talks with Kim on his terms. That is the big trap.” Previous presidents avoided that trap, Mr. Russel said, even if Bill Clinton briefly contemplated meeting Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il. But Mr. Trump brings a deal-maker’s swagger to the North Korea issue that his predecessors did not. He has in the past expressed a willingness to sit across a table from the willful young scion of North Korea’s ruling family. "
"GENEVA — The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that President Trump’s repeated denunciations of some media outlets as “fake news” could amount to incitement to violence and had potentially dangerous consequences outside the United States. The rebuke by Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for human rights, at a news conference in Geneva was an unusually forceful criticism of a head of state by a United Nations official. Mr. al-Hussein was reacting to Mr. Trump’s recent comments at a rally in Phoenix during which he spoke of “crooked media deceptions” in reports of the violent clashes at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., that resulted in the death of a counterprotester. In Phoenix, the president’s words also appeared to whip up audience hostility toward journalists. “It’s really quite amazing when you think that freedom of the press, not only a cornerstone of the Constitution but very much something the United States defended over the years, is now itself under attack from the president himself,” Mr. al-Hussein said. “It’s a stunning turnaround.” Asked for comment, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in an emailed statement, “We believe in free press and think it is an important part of our democracy, but the press also has a big responsibility to the American people to be truthful. Their job is to report the news, not create it. "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 11 civilians were killed Wednesday in American airstrikes in southeastern Afghanistan, witnesses and officials said, the second deadly allied strike in three days to add to the country’s mounting civilian death toll. The airstrikes, near Dasht e Barai, in Logar Province, came during a joint Afghan and American military operation to pursue Taliban forces, said Salim Salih, a spokesman for the provincial governor, and it was part of President Trump’s new strategy to bolster Afghan forces combating insurgents. The allied forces had come under fire from the Taliban and had called for air support, Mr. Salih said, and the Taliban fighters sought cover in nearby homes. A delegation dispatched from the provincial capital, Pul e Alam, to the site of the battle found 11 civilians had been killed and 16 wounded, Mr. Salih said. He added that two Taliban commanders were also killed. “Three families were living in the house which was bombed; 11 people, including eight women, were killed,” Hawas Khan Kochai, a resident of the Dasht e Bari area, said by phone. “We recovered all the bodies with an excavator after several hours, but two children are still missing.” Capt. Bill Salvin, a spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan, said an American helicopter had made a “precautionary landing because of a maintenance issue” in Logar on Wednesday, but there were no casualties. He would not say whether the airstrikes occurred in the area where the helicopter had landed. “We are looking into reports of civilian casualties,” Captain Salvin said. United States military officials said recently that they had increased American air support and personnel to help train Afghan security forces since President Trump announced more than a week ago his new strategy for the war in Afghanistan. The air support is meant to bolster Afghan forces who are fighting difficult battles against a resurgent Taliban, who have regained control of portions of the country. From January through July, the United States military dropped 1,245 bombs and other ordnance in Afghanistan, over 500 more than had been dropped during the same period last year. The Afghan Air Force, too, has been increasingly active, but its bombs are harder to track. On Monday, residents and officials in Herat Province in western Afghanistan said airstrikes there had killed more than a dozen civilians. A spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense said that the strikes had been carried out by the Afghan Air Force and that 18 Taliban fighters had been killed. With the Taliban deeply entrenched in Afghan villages, and often no clear front line to the war, civilian casualties have become a recurring issue as the American-led coalition deploys more air power to help support Afghan forces trying to regain territory lost to the Taliban. During President Barack Obama’s troop surge after 2010, frequent civilian casualties caused by airstrikes were a main reason that relations deteriorated between Washington and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. "
"WASHINGTON — The United States has about 11,000 troops in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, acknowledging for the first time publicly that the total forces there are higher than formally disclosed in recent years. Previously, Defense Department officials had said 8,400 troops were in Afghanistan as part of NATO’s Resolute Support mission. An additional 2,000 American troops, which military officials have not publicly acknowledged, are in Afghanistan to help local forces conduct counterterrorism missions. The new count includes covert as well as temporary units, defense officials said. The disclosure came after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis expressed frustration with how troops in war zones were counted. To get around Obama-era restrictions on the number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, commanders sometimes resorted to ad hoc arrangements. “The secretary has determined we must simplify our accounting methodology and improve the public’s understanding of America’s military commitment in Afghanistan,” said Dana W. White, the Pentagon’s chief spokeswoman. Before Mr. Mattis sends 4,000 more troops to Afghanistan, as he is expected to do under President Trump’s new strategy for the war there, he has said he wants to know how many troops are on the ground. “The first thing I have to do is level the bubble and account for everybody who’s on the ground there now,” Mr. Mattis told reporters last week. “The idea being that we’re not going to have different buckets that we’re accounting for them in, to tell you what the total number is.” "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!” That was President Trump’s latest comment, via Twitter, on rising nuclear tensions with Pyongyang. It came as the U.S. demonstrated the capabilities of its missile defense system, successfully intercepting a medium-range ballistic missile, above, off the coast of Hawaii. The British prime minister, Theresa May, on a visit to Japan to discuss a post-Brexit trade deal, called on China to strengthen its actions against North Korea, refused to rule out British military involvement and is set to discuss new sanctions with her Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, today. _____ "
"To the Editor: “Melania Trump, Off to Texas, Finds Herself on Thin Heels,” by Vanessa Friedman (On the Runway, nytimes.com, Aug. 30), was inappropriate. I am no fan of any of the Trump family, but this column crossed the line from valid critique to nit-picking. The woman is a former model, married to a rich man and accustomed to dressing well according to high fashion standards. Her husband ran for office; she did not. The fact that she wore high heels when boarding a plane, regardless of her destination, is not newsworthy. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and shoes are just shoes, not “the go-to stand-in for more nuanced, complicated emotions and issues.” Give Melania, and us all, a break.

"WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — “Come in! Back here!” André Leon Talley’s voice rang out, instructing a visitor to enter his elegant white colonial here, which is surrounded by a tidy lawn and large hydrangeas. Mr. Talley, 68, did not rise from his position on a sofa, seated like a pasha amid enormous pillows, in his cozy TV-reading room with its leopard-print carpet. “This house has 11 rooms, but I only use two of them,” said Mr. Talley, the longtime Vogue fashion arbiter who, though no longer working full-time there, is still a contributing editor and does podcasts for the magazine. Mr. Talley has been keeping plenty busy. He is the subject of a new documentary, “The Gospel According to André,” directed by Kate Novack, which screens at the Toronto International Film Festival beginning on Sept 8. And he curated the exhibition “The Glamour and Romance of Oscar de la Renta,” which is scheduled to open Oct. 8 at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. His home, where he has lived since 2005, is filled with art and baubles. Most of the items were gifts or auction purchases. Mr. Talley said that he particularly favored the sales at Doyle New York. In the TV-reading room, amid stacks of books on slipcovered African chairs, there is a silver ice bucket in the shape of an elephant’s head that he says Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis gave him; an original Elsa Peretti snake belt that he sometimes wears as a necklace; a satirical cartoon of himself by the designer Karl Lagerfeld; and several items he says were given to him by the shoe designer Manolo Blahnik, including Mr. Blahnik’s drawing of a shoe.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has given Congress a point-by-point rebuttal of a dossier alleging that he has deep ties to Russian officials — an effort to clear his name as the Justice Department and congressional committees investigate Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s election. Mr. Cohen encouraged lawmakers to investigate those who paid for the salacious 35-page dossier, which surfaced online early this year and alleges that President Trump and his campaign conspired with Russia in the November election. The dossier, compiled by a retired British spy, portrays Mr. Cohen as a central figure in the conspiracy. In an eight-page letter to the House Intelligence Committee, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen offered a full-throated rejection of any suggestion that Mr. Cohen was involved in an effort to work with Russia to disrupt the election. “We have not uncovered a single document that would in any way corroborate the dossier’s allegations regarding Mr. Cohen, nor do we believe that any such document exists,” wrote the lawyer, Stephen M. Ryan. “Mr. Cohen vehemently denies the claims made in the dossier about him, which are false and remain wholly unsubstantiated.” The letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, follows a similar denial by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who spoke to congressional investigators in July.

"Elected to lead the biggest city in the nation, Mayor Bill de Blasio often seems to hunger for a brighter spotlight. He tried to shape the debate in the last presidential election, only to be spurned by candidates in his own party. He flew to Germany in July to speak at a rally during a meeting of world leaders, only to be criticized for leaving New York hours after a police officer was murdered. Now he has seized hold of the national debate over the removal of confederate monuments by ordering a review of all possible “symbols of hate” in the city — once again grabbing national attention while simultaneously putting himself in a tricky situation. He has been peppered with questions about how far the review will go to cleanse New York of potentially offensive figures and whether this or that sculpture should stand or fall. Some see him as playing into the hands of President Donald J. Trump, who warned that the push to remove Confederate monuments could go too far. “He’s going to create some kind of star chamber to see who’s politically correct and who’s not,” said Kenneth T. Jackson, a historian who edited The Encyclopedia of New York City, echoing other historians who have cautioned against the rush to remove statues and monuments. “It’s almost like McCarthyism of a reverse sort: Let’s find out who has got something in their closet that they should be ashamed of. I don’t think we need this,” he said. Ulysses S. Grant — commemorated in at least two statues in Brooklyn and a monumental tomb in Upper Manhattan — issued an order to expel Jews from three states during the Civil War. Horatio Seymour — a New York politician whose portrait is displayed in City Hall — ran as the Democratic presidential candidate against Grant in 1868, heading up a racially-charged campaign in which some of his supporters used the slogan, “This is a White Man’s Country; Let White Men Rule.” The Duke of York, namesake of New York City, was involved in the slave trade.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Tropical Storm Harvey shifted its wrath to areas east of Houston, hitting the Beaumont-Port Arthur area of Texas with record-breaking rainfall and devastating floods. At least 38 deaths have been reported throughout the region. Among the victims was a woman who was swept into a canal and drowned, while her child survived by clinging to her. This video shows the emotional and physical toll on storm survivors. Our journalists are fanning out to cover the storm and its aftermath. Here’s a collection of the most powerful photographs, (like the one above, of an intersection in northeastern Houston), and a guide to our coverage. Access is free. _____ "
"As a brutal storm continues to pound the Gulf Coast, tens of thousands of homeowners are turning to the government for help in repairing and rebuilding. Much of the aid they receive will require taking on debt — an unpleasant surprise to those who may lack the income to pay it back. And as victims of past disasters can attest, that aid may be cumbersome to obtain, insufficient to cover the cost of reconstruction, and take years to fully pay out. Government officials emphasize that the federal programs are meant to supplement, not replace, insurance and other financial buffers against catastrophe. But even more than victims of other disasters, those who have lost homes and businesses to what was once Hurricane Harvey are likely to need substantial help. More than 40,000 households affected by the storm have so far been approved for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to Mark J. Peterson, an agency spokesman. Flooding inflicted much of the storm’s damage, but few in the affected areas have flood insurance — and even those who do will often face rebuilding costs exceeding what their insurance will cover. Jamette Riley Moyer of Rockport, Tex., a coastal town near Corpus Christi, is among those navigating the federal aid labyrinth. The storm smashed her rental home into a pile of timber and shattered furniture, destroying nearly everything she owned. "
"As Tropical Storm Harvey barrels down the Gulf Coast and talk of a disaster-relief bill begins, Republican lawmakers from Texas are rushing to defend their 2013 votes against spending $50.5 billion on Hurricane Sandy relief. Senator John Cornyn’s spokesman, Drew Brandewie, tweeted on Friday that the senator “voted for Sandy relief, just not the package that became law.” He said the final bill included “extraneous” money for items unrelated to disaster relief. (Mr. Cornyn voted for an amendment that would have provided about $24 billion in funding.) On Tuesday, in an interview with NBC’s Katy Tur, Senator Ted Cruz put a specific number on unrelated spending in the 2013 legislation: “Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy.” And on Wednesday morning, Representative Bill Flores echoed criticism of the Sandy relief bill during a local radio interview. Congress “went crazy with it, packing it full of pork,” he said. “Most people don’t realize that the $51 billion bill included spending for almost all 50 states” as well as Guam, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa. But these claims are hyperbolic and misleading. Of 23 examples of extraneous spending that a spokesman for Mr. Cruz provided, all but one — $195 million in discretionary funds for the secretary of health and human services — were Sandy-related or sought to mitigate future storms, as the law required. The spokesman also pointed to a Congressional Quarterly analysis that said that $17 billion in the bill went toward immediate aid for Sandy victims while $33.5 billion was for “near- and long-term assistance and mitigation” of damage from future disasters. "
"Even before the damage from Hurricane Harvey is tallied, big corporations are breaking out their checkbooks. Chevron, an energy giant with several offices in the Houston area, pledged $1 million to post-Harvey disaster relief efforts. So did Exxon Mobil and Dow Chemical, two companies with facilities hit by the storm. Companies in less regional industries also donated: Amazon offered to match $1 million in donations to the American Red Cross, while Verizon promised $10 million. Walmart, which took a front-line role in the clean-up after Hurricane Katrina, sent truckloads of emergency supplies to the affected area. In all, corporations have pledged more than $65 million to help clean up the wreckage from Harvey, according to a Wednesday morning estimate by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. That is an impressive figure, and a sign that corporations are capable of stepping up in a crisis. Hurricane Harvey may be one of the costliest natural disasters in American history, according to initial forecasts. Moody’s Analytics has estimated that the storm’s damage may be as much as $50 billion, though it is hard to know at such an early stage. As Houston recovers, its business community should feel especially compelled to help. That is partly because Houston and the surrounding area, as well as the state of Texas, have been generous to big business in recent years, showering companies with tax breaks, subsidies and other perks in an effort to keep them happy and create new jobs. Houston has benefited from the presence of large corporations, adding thousands of jobs and becoming one of the fastest-growing cities in America. But those companies have benefited, too — sometimes to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The help Houston has given businesses over the years raises an important question: What is the moral obligation of big companies — especially those that have benefited from a region’s largess — after such a major disaster?

"WASHINGTON — A Trump administration official said Wednesday that the administration wanted to stabilize health insurance markets, but refused to say if the government would promote enrollment this fall under the Affordable Care Act or pay for the activities of counselors who help people sign up for coverage. The official also declined to say whether the administration would continue paying subsidies to insurance companies to compensate them for reducing deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income people. Without the subsidies, insurers say, they would sharply increase premiums. The administration, the official suggested, will do the minimum necessary to comply with the law, which Mr. Trump has called “an absolute disaster” and threatened to let collapse. “I don’t think we can force people to sign up for the program,” the official said. The official said the Trump administration had not set any numerical goals for sign-ups under the health care law, and the official did not know if the administration would do so. President Barack Obama used such goals to motivate a small army of counselors, “navigators” and assistants who helped millions of people sign up for insurance in the last four years. About 20 million people have gained coverage, through private insurance policies and Medicaid. Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to repeal the health law, but their efforts have stalled, with no consensus on how much of the law to scrap and how much to preserve. The Trump administration official spoke to about 20 journalists on Wednesday on the condition of anonymity, evidently because major decisions had not been made. The fifth annual open enrollment period, when people can sign up for insurance or switch plans, will run from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, about half as long as the last one. "
"Before it began to rain in Houston last week, the spectacularly wealthy pastor Joel Osteen could have opened up his megachurch to serve as a logistics center. He could have announced that evacuees were welcome to take shelter there when Hurricane Harvey landed. Instead he wrote tweets like “God’s got this” and “don’t drift into doubt and fear … stay anchored to hope.” Only a couple of his posts on Twitter offered “prayers.” On Sunday, Mr. Osteen’s church announced that it was inaccessible because of “flooding.” But intrepid journalists proved otherwise. After Mr. Osteen was humiliated on social media, he finally opened the 16,800-seat church to the public on Tuesday. When asked about the delay, Mr. Osteen said that “the city didn’t ask us to become a shelter.” President Trump, too, revealed his morally bankrupt soul during the storm when he said that he timed his pardon of the racist former sheriff Joe Arpaio to coincide with the hurricane’s landfall because he assumed that it would garner “far higher” TV ratings than usual. Mr. Trump did visit Texas, but there was apparently no mention of dead or displaced Texans, and no expressions of sympathy. Mr. Trump and Mr. Osteen are mirrors of each other. Both enjoy enormous support among evangelicals, yet they lack a command of biblical scripture. Both are among the 1 percent. Natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey are the worst kind of crises for people like Mr. Trump and Mr. Osteen, who purvey their own versions of the prosperity gospel. This is a belief that says if you think positively and make affirmations, God will reward you with financial success and good health. If you don’t, you may face unemployment, poverty or sickness. (Mr. Trump in particular always speaks in laudatory terms about himself and his companies.) "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration notified Congress on Wednesday that it was putting $255 million in military assistance to Pakistan into the equivalent of an escrow account that Islamabad can only access if it does more to crack down on internal terror networks launching attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. The dueling messages sent to Pakistan — promising aid but attaching strings if the country’s counterterror efforts fall short — are part of an increasingly confrontational turn in an alliance that has long been strained. The United States has provided Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid since 2002. But the annual funding has declined in recent years as Washington became increasingly disenchanted with Pakistan’s quiet support for the Haqqani network and the Taliban, whose attacks have been responsible for the deaths of American troops in Afghanistan. Still, American officials have long recognized that Pakistan has tried to crack down on terror groups, and plays an important role in facilitating supply shipments to the United States military in Afghanistan. Last week, in announcing his new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, President Trump excoriated Pakistan. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” Mr. Trump said.

"HOUSTON — A federal judge in San Antonio on Wednesday blocked Texas from enforcing its ban on so-called sanctuary cities, questioning the constitutionality of a law that has pitted Republican state leaders against several Democratic-leaning cities. The judge’s ruling was only temporary, and prevents the law from taking effect on Friday while a suit against it goes forward. But the decision, which Texas said it would appeal, served as a legal blow to one of the toughest state-issued immigration laws in the country and puts the brakes on a measure backed by the Trump administration that critics had called anti-Latino. The law has become so divisive that it served as the backdrop of a shoving match at the Texas Capitol between Hispanic Democratic lawmakers and their white Republican colleagues. The law, known as Senate Bill 4 or S.B. 4, prohibits cities and counties from adopting policies that limit immigration enforcement, allows police officers to question the immigration status of anyone they detain or arrest and threatens officials who violate the law with fines, jail time and removal from office. It also directs local officials to cooperate with so-called immigration detainer requests, which allow foreign-born detainees to be transferred to federal custody after they are released from state or local custody. A number of the state’s biggest cities, including Houston, Austin, San Antonio and Dallas, all of which are run by Democrats, joined a lawsuit against Texas seeking to strike down the law, which was passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, in May. In his ruling issued Wednesday evening, the judge, Orlando L. Garcia of United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, granted a preliminary injunction preventing the law from taking effect while the suit continues. Judge Garcia appeared to block three provisions of the law, including one that stated that local government entities and officials may not “adopt, enforce or endorse” any policy limiting the enforcement of immigration laws.

You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. “Houston’s perfect storm is coming — and it’s not a matter of if but when,” journalists wrote, a year and a half ago. “Why isn’t Texas ready?” The story was a joint project of The Texas Tribune, an excellent local publication, and ProPublica, the deservedly well-regarded national group. Headlined “Hell and High Water,” it exposed the lack of preparedness, and downright denial, in Houston about flood damage. The project mixes maps and text, and you can dip into it briefly or dig into the details. “We’re sitting ducks. We’ve done nothing,” Phil Bedient, a Rice University professor and storm-surge expert, says in the story. “We’ve done nothing to shore up the coastline, to add resiliency ... to do anything.” The article isn’t perfectly clairvoyant — no story is. It falls into the common trap of exaggerating the economic effects of a news development that’s bad for other reasons. But the story offered an important — and, sadly, unheeded — message: Even though it’s possible to mitigate the effects of extreme weather, we’re instead making choices that aggravate them. To give them their deserved credit, that story is by Neena Satija, Kiah Collier, Al Shaw and Jeff Larson. In Slate, Henry Grabar points out that grasslands around the city could have absorbed some of the nearly 52 inches of rain that have fallen so far — had they not been cut by development. To make matters worse, he writes, officials “encouraged development in low-lying, flood-prone areas without regard to future risk.” At CityLab, Tanvi Misra notes that the failure to prepare for floods often hurts low-income, minority communities the most. These communities “are most vulnerable to flooding, or near petrochemical plants and Superfund sites that can overflow during the storm. This is especially true for Houston.” So far, Harvey has submerged an area greater than 15 times the size of Manhattan. “It’s basically impossible for any of us to get our heads around the scope of just how much damage there’s going to be when this is over,” MSNBC’s Chris Hayes tweeted (although these maps, from The Times, give us a good idea). On a more uplifting note, Time’s Maya Rhodan has the backstory of the Houston sheriff’s deputy whose helping of two small children ricocheted around social media. In The Times, Frank Bruni writes, of Trump’s Texas trip: “The weather around him changes. The weather inside him doesn’t. It’s a warm bath of self-regard — the biggest ever, I’d wager — and it overrides everything else.” "
"The current recovery has entered its ninth year — long by economic standards — but it is showing some unexpected vigor. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter of the year, better than initially estimated, and a substantial acceleration over the first quarter’s lackluster 1.2 percent pace. The revised figure is still well below President Trump’s goal of 4 percent growth, but it is the economy’s best quarterly showing in two years. Mr. Trump talked up the latest figures in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., laying out his plans for tax overhaul. Despite nearly uniform skepticism from mainstream economists, he insisted that much faster economic growth was within reach. “I happen to be one who thinks we can go much higher than 3 percent,” the president said. “There is no reason why we should not.” There are several reasons that his goal is probably far-fetched, namely the country’s aging work force and slower population growth than in the past. Combine that with low productivity growth, and hitting Mr. Trump’s target begins to look like a Sisyphean challenge. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump, in Texas, Says His Goal Is the Best Relief Effort Ever” (news article, Aug. 30): Visiting Texas in the midst of Hurricane Harvey, President Trump said: “We want to do it better than ever before. We want to be looked at in five years, in 10 years from now as, this is the way to do it.” But Mr. Trump is doing his best to create more such disasters, by dismantling every effort of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Power Plan to move us out of the fossil-fuel economy into a renewable-energy world of millions of good jobs. His pro-coal, pro-oil policy intensifies such storms by supercharging the air with carbon dioxide and methane, heating our Earth, and overfilling clouds with water vapor that then falls as unprecedented floods of rain. Doing it better would require him to reverse direction. Otherwise he will be known in five, 10, 50, 100 years as the person most responsible for bringing utter disaster on America and all humanity.

PHILADELPHIA To the Editor: Our president, after visiting the catastrophic Harvey scene, is on his way to Missouri to push for tax relief for our wealthiest and least needy citizens. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people on the Gulf Coast will need long-term temporary housing, temporary schools, food, clothing, electricity, air-conditioning, medical care, and the list goes on. It would be wonderful if he could decide to change his priorities, to be a caring president. I could also win the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries in the same week. DAVID A. LOOMAR, NEW YORK To the Editor: President Trump seeks to appear presidential amid the incalculable suffering and devastation caused by Harvey, while his budget would cruelly slash funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His policies, if unchecked, will also destine us to react to increasing cataclysmic weather events rather than being proactive. Proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including a draconian 32 percent cut to its main ocean, weather and climate research center, tell the sad tale louder than his command center visit to Texas. MARY O’CONNOR, NEW YORK To the Editor: In “The Devastation in Houston” (editorial, Aug. 29) you aptly describe “how unchecked urban sprawl and paving over of wetlands and prairies have increased the risk posed by floods.” So let’s see if our builder-in-chief president can direct the Texas rebuilding effort with the smartest infrastructure necessary to avoid another flood catastrophe. That begins with the understanding that conserving our coastal wetlands and creating urban parks are vital when planning housing developments and industrial parks. STEVE COHEN, NEW YORK "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California, home to nearly 40 million people, has commonly been declared ungovernable. That’s why some people think we should carve it up. In contrast to the so-called Calexit movement, which aspires to secession, these proponents see California’s salvation in greater local autonomy within the union. A few years ago, a bid to create six states out of California drew wide media attention but ultimately fizzled. Now, the architect of that effort, a tech billionaire named Timothy C.

"SPRINGFIELD, Mo. — President Trump on Wednesday pitched a sweeping tax overhaul that he said would unleash the American economy and help ordinary people, promising that a large corporate tax cut and trims to individual income tax rates would boost the middle class. The president wrapped his message in the populist rhetoric that powered his presidential campaign. But he described a plan that on its surface appears to offer relatively little to ordinary Americans, granting instead huge tax cuts — “the biggest ever,” he said — to corporations and their shareholders. Mr. Trump gave few specifics on Wednesday beyond a goal of slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, down from 35 percent, and eliminating “loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests,” a reference to his call to scrap some itemized deductions in the code. The politically difficult legislation has yet to be drafted despite months of private negotiations among members of the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Time is running out for enactment of the bill before year’s end, and the White House is keenly aware that if Mr. Trump fails to deliver his promised tax cuts, he will emerge from his first year in office devoid of any major legislative accomplishments. “This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hard-working Americans,” the president said as he stood in front of a giant American flag at the Loren Cook Company, a fan manufacturer. “And I don’t want to be disappointed by Congress.” “Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers,” he added. Many economists believe it is not that simple. They argue that large corporate tax cuts would do relatively little — particularly in the near term — to boost wages or create jobs. Instead, they would boost corporate profits and benefit the wealthiest Americans who own the most corporate stock. There is little evidence that large tax cuts will prompt American corporations to invest more; they are already sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash. "
"“Quit tweeting.” “Chill out, man.” “Listen to women.” Those were the admonishments to President Trump from a 12-person focus group, an effort on Tuesday night in Pittsburgh to test the mood of registered voters after the president’s first seven months in office. The focus group, conducted by Peter D. Hart, a veteran pollster, was commissioned by Emory University and featured five Democrats, four independents and three Republicans. Five voted for Mr. Trump, six for Hillary Clinton and one for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Mr. Hart asked the group members, seven men and five women, how they felt about the direction of the country, and the response was largely pessimistic. One man said the country was “more divisive” now than it has been since the Civil War. Only two additional people shared that view. But in general, the group expressed disappointment and even exasperation with how Mr. Trump has handled his time in office. “He has no social skills,” said Bart Morgan, an independent who voted for Ms. Stein. “It’s almost like he never was taught the right way to act.” “His learning curve has been a little disappointing,” said David Turner, a Republican who said his impulse was still to give Mr. Trump and other officials more of a chance so early in a term.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a statement condemning what it called North Korea’s “outrageous actions” in launching a ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday and launching three missiles on Saturday. But there was no suggestion that the council was ready to toughen sanctions. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, called the latest launching a “curtain-raiser” and warned of more missile tests in the Pacific. President Trump said in an earlier statement that “all options are on the table.” And Japanese citizens, some of whom received a beeping alert on their cellphones just four minutes after the projectile was fired, may be rethinking support for their pacifist Constitution. Above, an evacuation drill in Wajima, Japan, on Wednesday. _____ "
"In 1941, shortly after Pearl Harbor pulled the United States into World War II, a group of volunteer American aviators led by Gen. Claire Chennault known as the Flying Tigers fought Japanese aggression in China. They were so successful that many people believe they were decisive in holding back Japan, eventually leading to its defeat. Although they were paid volunteers rather than members of the American military, they were not denigrated as “mercenaries.” The Flying Tigers — who now would be called contractors — fought for China and the United States and, like paid American contractors in theaters of war today, fought as bravely and patriotically as American soldiers. As policy makers in Washington decide what to do in Afghanistan, they should keep the Flying Tigers in mind. Such a force could be just the solution Afghanistan needs. The reasons are as obvious as they are compelling: Last week, President Trump announced his “new strategy” to end the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history. But in promising to add more dollars to the more than $800 billion already spent, not to mention more American troops to the thousands already dead or wounded, President Trump’s strategy is sadly more old than new. Fortunately, it is not too late to alter the course. This spring, as Afghanistan policy was debated in Washington, the president asked for fresh options to end the war honorably. Faced with two choices — pulling out entirely or staying the course — I argued strongly for a new approach, a third path that would put in place a light footprint of American Special Forces, as well as contractors to work with Afghans to focus on the goal that Americans really care about: denying America’s enemies the sanctuary they used to plan the Sept. 11 attacks.

"I’m just back from visiting all of our key air bases in Iraq, Afghanistan and along the Persian Gulf, and I find myself wrestling with two stark contrasts: the contrast between what is happening there in the air and what is happening on the ground, and the contrast between the decency of the U.S. military personnel fighting this war and how unworthy Donald Trump — who has become our divider in chief — is to be their commander in chief. The first contrast was summed up in two wall-size digital maps at our Kuwait-based command center for the war on ISIS. One map displays every military aircraft the U.S. has in the skies over Syria and Iraq (as well as Russian, Syrian and Iranian aircraft) pounding ISIS targets. There are little symbols for B-52s, U-2s, F-16s, F-22s, F-15s, MQ-9 Reapers and jet refuelers. It is a giant aerial armada, a flying killer symphony orchestrated by the U.S. Air Force. The other map uses different colors to depict the disposition of forces on the ground. It looks like a broken kaleidoscope. Our U.S. military briefer explained: Purple is for Syrian regime forces and their Russian, Hezbollah and Iranian allies; light green shows Syrian Kurds and dark green Iraqi Kurds; light blue represents “disciplined” Iraqi Shiite militias, while the “undisciplined” ones are another shade. Pro-Turkish Sunni militias have their own color, as do the pro-American Syrian Sunni militias. ISIS fighters are another color, and the official Iraqi security forces are a different one still. As our briefer noted dryly: “Not everyone here has exactly the same endgame in mind.” This is our war in the Middle East today in two maps: “Star Wars” meets “Game of Thrones.” You can’t look at these two screens without thinking about the power that comes from our ability to make one out of many — or the power that is lost to a society like Syria or Iraq that needs an iron fist to make its many into one, and when that fist is removed, how the society fractures into small shards. So you can’t help but get upset seeing our own president deliberately dividing our country between his tribe and the rest of us — undermining what truly makes America great. Fortunately, though, you also can’t help but be buoyed by the young men and women you meet visiting our key air bases in the war effort. They remind you what America is on its best days — still resistant to Trump’s divisive dog whistles. "
"“The arithmetic for us is simple,” AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said on CNBC in May. If Congress were to cut the 35 percent tax on corporate profits to 20 percent, he declared, “I know exactly what AT&T would do — we’d invest more” in the United States. Every $1 billion in tax savings would create 7,000 well-paying jobs, Mr. Stephenson went on to say. The correlation between lower corporate taxes and more jobs, he assured viewers, runs “very, very tight.” As Congress prepares to take up tax legislation this fall, including an effort to reduce the corporate tax rate, this bold jobs claim merits examination. Notably, it comes from the chief executive of a company that’s already paying comparatively little in federal taxes. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, AT&T enjoyed an effective tax rate of just 8 percent between 2008 and 2015, despite recording a profit in the United States each year, by exploiting tax breaks and loopholes. (The company argues that it pays significant taxes, at a rate close to 34 percent in recent years, but that includes deferred taxes and state and local levies.) Despite the enormous savings AT&T has realized, the company has been downsizing. Although it hires thousands of people a year, the company, by our analysis at the Institute for Policy Studies, reduced its total work force by nearly 80,000 jobs between 2008 and 2016, accounting for acquisitions and spinoffs each involving more than 2,000 workers. The company has also spent $34 billion repurchasing its own stock since 2008, according to our institute report, a maneuver that artificially inflates the value of a company’s shares. This is money that could have gone toward research and development or hiring. "

s for so many other people, election night did not pan out quite the way Robert Stryk expected. Stryk began the night slumped in a Morton’s steakhouse in downtown Washington, tuning out the guests at his watch party to type out the campaign announcement of a buddy who — in the wake of Donald J. Trump’s all-but-certain defeat and the Republican Party implosion that was sure to follow — planned to make a long-shot bid for chairman of the Republican National Committee. He ended it by closing down the bar at the Mayflower Hotel, and after the race was called, giddily marching down Connecticut Avenue with his friends as they chanted, ‘‘Make America Great Again!’’ Stryk, who owned a lobbying firm so small it didn’t actually have an office, spent most of his time in California and owned a small vineyard in Oregon, and he had helped out the Trump campaign as a sort of informal West Coast hand. He was still reveling in Trump’s upset win two nights later, over a bottle of wine on the patio of the Four Seasons in Georgetown, when a chocolate Lab padded over to his table to sniff his crotch. Stryk and the dog’s owner got to talking about wine and cigars and finally, like most of the country, about Trump. It turned out that she worked for New Zealand’s Embassy in Washington. New Zealand’s prime minister still hadn’t connected with the new president-elect, she told Stryk — a diplomatic and political embarrassment. Stryk cocked an eye across the table. ‘‘What if I said I could get you the number of someone to call the president?’’ he asked her. The following afternoon, Stryk found himself in a cab, headed for a meeting with New Zealand’s ambassador to the United States, Tim Groser. Stryk was more than a little nervous. On the way over, he called a friend named Stuart Jolly, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who ran Trump’s field operation during the Republican primary and spent election night with Stryk at Morton’s. Jolly reached out to someone he knew in the Trump high command and delivered a cell number, but Stryk didn’t know if it would actually work. At the embassy, Groser invited him in, uncorked a bottle of pinot noir and called the prime minister to pass along the number. A week later, President-elect Trump was finally able to accept a congratulatory phone call. But even before the call went through, plans and possibilities were blooming in Stryk’s mind. ‘‘I said to myself: ‘This could be very, very interesting,’ ’’ he told me when I first met him this spring. ‘‘ ‘The world’s going to change.’ ’’ Stryk, who grew up in Arizona, had bounced around the minor leagues of politics for most of his adult life. At 41, he has the frenetic energy of a serial entrepreneur and the motley résumé to match. After dropping out of college to intern on Capitol Hill, Stryk wrote voter-contact scripts for a Republican P.R. firm, helped start a political job-listing website and eventually opened his own Beltway lobbying shop, Sonoran Policy Group. The firm almost collapsed in 2009, after Stryk tried to acquire a troubled Maryland-based security-guard business. Stryk decamped to California, owing thousands of dollars in back rent, and reinvented S.P.G. as a procurement and political-consulting business. He traded tequila shots with the California congressman Dana Rohrabacher, ran for mayor of a town in Napa Valley, handled P.R. for an arms dealer accused of smuggling weapons to Libya — the case was dropped last fall — and helped clients sell the government everything from flashlights to missile-guidance software. By the time he hooked up with the Trump campaign, Stryk had hustled his way to a good living, and he knew his way around Washington. But he was no one’s idea of a Beltway insider. When the phone call to Trump went through, Stryk saw the geography of a new world forming before his eyes. Interests that spent millions of dollars studying Washington and shaping it to their liking had been taken totally by surprise by Trump’s win. The rules had changed, and no one was sure what the new ones were. For Stryk, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for. As he saw it, the lobbying old guard — the guys that threw down black Amex cards at Joe’s Crab and sent fat quarterly bills to clients they barely did any work for — were on the defensive. New people would have a chance. People like Stryk. "
"It’s admirable that Americans’ first instinct when disaster occurs is to open their wallets and volunteer their time. Since this has never been a nation that relies wholly on government to take care of those in need, citizens’ first impulse is to pitch in, whatever their politics or faith. As the first images of suffering emerged from Houston, the flow of cash, food, clothing and rescue equipment into Texas seemed to rise in tandem with the floodwaters. Yet it’s inevitable that not all this largess will reach Harvey’s victims, or be well spent. For that reason, it is important for Americans to be as discerning with their money as they are philanthropic, avoiding scams and asking for greater accountability from trusted charities like the American Red Cross. The Red Cross is the flagship of charitable institutions. It is also a master of promotion. After every disaster, its ads, celebrity testimonials and distinctive logo are everywhere, beseeching Americans to donate blood and money. This week Barack Obama became the Red Cross’s latest Twitter pitchman, urging Americans to make a $10 donation by texting “HARVEY.” During President Trump’s televised update on the response in Texas on Tuesday, a Red Cross representative sat front and center. Corporations find donations to the Red Cross a ready way to demonstrate they care: The organization has already raised millions from JPMorgan, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Dow Chemical and others for its Harvey efforts. This is all to the good, assuming the money flows to the right places. But after years of media reports documenting the Red Cross’s disaster relief failures — including after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy and the Haiti earthquake — some Americans instead are giving to smaller, local charities with a track record in Texas. A 2015 investigation by ProPublica and NPR documented the Red Cross’s glaring failure to account for how it spent the $488 million it raised in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake in 2010, including such basics as how many people were assisted and how much money was spent on overhead.

"WASHINGTON — In the hours after European antitrust regulators levied a record $2.7 billion fine against Google in late June, an influential Washington think tank learned what can happen when a wealthy tech giant is criticized. The New America Foundation has received more than $21 million from Google; its parent company’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt; and his family’s foundation since the think tank’s founding in 1999. That money helped to establish New America as an elite voice in policy debates on the American left and helped Google shape those debates. But not long after one of New America’s scholars posted a statement on the think tank’s website praising the European Union’s penalty against Google, Mr. Schmidt, who had been chairman of New America until 2016, communicated his displeasure with the statement to the group’s president, Anne-Marie Slaughter, according to the scholar. The statement disappeared from New America’s website, only to be reposted without explanation a few hours later. But word of Mr. Schmidt’s displeasure rippled through New America, which employs more than 200 people, including dozens of researchers, writers and scholars, most of whom work in sleek Washington offices where the main conference room is called the “Eric Schmidt Ideas Lab.” The episode left some people concerned that Google intended to discontinue funding, while others worried whether the think tank could truly be independent if it had to worry about offending its donors. Those worries seemed to be substantiated a couple of days later, when Ms. Slaughter summoned the scholar who wrote the critical statement, Barry Lynn, to her office. He ran a New America initiative called Open Markets that has led a growing chorus of liberal criticism of the market dominance of telecom and tech giants, including Google, which is now part of a larger corporate entity known as Alphabet, for which Mr. Schmidt serves as executive chairman. Ms. Slaughter told Mr. Lynn that “the time has come for Open Markets and New America to part ways,” according to an email from Ms. Slaughter to Mr. Lynn. The email suggested that the entire Open Markets team — nearly 10 full-time employees and unpaid fellows — would be exiled from New America. "

"I started at The New York Times in April and quickly learned that by Times standards I would probably be “new” for quite some time. Almost every person I met seemed to have been here for 10 or 20 years — often even more. Their expertise has been honed over hundreds of interviews and investigations; they have traveled the world and the country reporting on everything from the Ken doll’s new look to tax reform to the dire situation in Venezuela. Luckily for me, their knowledge drives my weekly Newsbook column, in which I write timely reading lists to help readers understand issues in the news. Newsbook, which includes short summaries of three books on a central theme and runs online and on Page A3 of the paper, is part of a larger effort by the Books desk to offer more service-oriented content. News articles often raise many questions about history and context, so I ask: What events or issues need illuminating? I try to figure out what readers want to know — what I want to know — and the books that will best answer those questions. Significant cultural moments like Wimbledon or Gay Pride Month often warrant a column as well. That brings me to the most common question about my job: Do you read all the books you recommend? In short, no. I am sure there are people who can read three to six books a week, but sadly I am not one of them. It would take me months to read the number of books I consider weekly. So I rely heavily on my colleagues: When I wrote a literary primer to the Great American Eclipse, for instance, I reached out to Nicholas St. Fleur, a science reporter who sent me the reading list he had compiled while preparing for his trip to Carbondale, Ill., where he witnessed and reported on the longest instance of totality in the United States. In the throes of President Trump’s planning to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, I emailed Coral Davenport, who has covered energy and environmental policy since 2006, for suggestions of the best books on climate change. Although it is ideal to draw on reporters’ expertise to inform my column, it is not always possible, so I have become intimately acquainted with the Times archives. I spend hours reading old reviews — in The Times and other publications — as well as skimming the books themselves to get a grasp of the writer’s argument and what it adds to the zeitgeist. "
"Partisanship and contentiousness typically dominate Washington news. In the clamor, it’s easy to overlook the national consensus on a significant issue: the need to revitalize America’s most crucial security alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I was nominated as United States ambassador to NATO by President Trump in late June. As I made my rounds of congressional offices before my confirmation hearing, I found near unanimity from Republicans and Democrats alike on NATO’s future. There is no appreciable difference of views among the president, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and senators of either party on the need to revitalize NATO so it can meet today’s security needs while maintaining the fundamental principle of Article 5 of the organization’s founding treaty — that an attack on one is an attack on all. There is a strong consensus that a renaissance of NATO offers the best hope to unite our Western allies against threats including intolerable Russian aggression in Ukraine, international terrorism, nuclear and missile capacities of rogue nations, and efforts to wipe out religious and individual freedoms around the globe. NATO is the most successful alliance in world history. It was founded on the conviction that a potent joint effort by the democracies of Europe and North America was the most effective way to deter and counter Communist expansion and prevent World War III. That idea held the alliance together more than 40 years, through many changes of government, and it won the Cold War. "
"United Technologies is finally close to buying the airplane parts maker Rockwell Collins, according to The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times. If the purchase price comes in at around $140 a share, as the newspapers report and that DealBook hears is roughly accurate, it would value Rockwell Collins at roughly $22.7 billion. That would make the deal the biggest ever in the defense and aerospace industry. Here are the five largest acquisitions thus far in the sector, as compiled by Thomson Reuters: • United Technologies’ $18 billion takeover of Goodrich in 2011 • Boeing’s $15.3 billion purchase of McDonnell Douglas in 1996 • British Aerospace’s $12.9 billion acquisition of Marconi Electronic Systems in 1999 • Raytheon’s $9.5 billion takeover of Hughes Aircraft in 1997 • Lockheed Martin’s $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky in 2015 A Rockwell deal could be announced as soon as next week, The Journal and The F.T. say. But talks are ongoing and the timing of an agreement could shift. Related reading: • A deal would probably not have antitrust hurdles because there is little overlap in what the companies produce. But it would need to soothe worried customers, according to the Lex column in The F.T. Problems with United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney engines have caused delays and canceled orders. • Bloomberg Gadfly argues that the deal only makes sense in the context of a bigger breakup of United Technologies. The aerospace divisions are growing more quickly and should be separated from units like the one that makes elevators and air-conditioners. "
"WASHINGTON — The United States conducted a missile-defense test on Wednesday off the coast of Hawaii and intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile, just days after North Korea’s bold missile test over Japan. The missile test on Wednesday was conducted by the United States Missile Defense Agency and Navy sailors on the John Paul Jones, a guided-missile destroyer. “We are working closely with the fleet to develop this important new capability, and this was a key milestone,” in advancing the capability to intercept missiles, said Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves, the director of the Missile Defense Agency, which is part of the Defense Department. “We will continue developing ballistic missile-defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves.” Tensions between the United States and North Korea have been rising in recent months over Pyongyang’s development of its nuclear program. The United States regularly tests its missile-defense systems, and this was the second time one of its Standard Missile-6 missiles successfully intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile, the agency said. The test had long been planned. North Korea’s most recent missile test early Tuesday local time prompted the Japanese government to tell residents to take cover. That missile traveled over the northern island of Hokkaido and landed in the sea. The test was considered a direct challenge to President Trump, who has threatened the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that America would respond with “fire and fury” to provocations. "
"If you watched Julia Roberts cycle through Bali’s artfully cultivated rice terraces in the film “Eat, Pray, Love,” it’s easy to understand why this so-called “Island of the Gods” is often referred to as a tropical paradise. But the film, and the Elizabeth Gilbert book of the same name, obscure an unpleasant reality that has been brewing for years: Bali is struggling to cope with its own popularity. The island of four million hosted a record 13 million visitors (nearly five million international, and more than eight million domestic) in 2016 and is on pace to better that mark this year. I wasn’t aware of this when I booked a midsummer three-week trip to Bali, but we felt the reality of those numbers immediately in Ubud, the once sleepy artist’s village where Ms. Gilbert (played by Ms. Roberts in the film) found love. The raves I had read about Bali’s charming people and their distinctive Hindu culture were true but I wasn’t prepared for the intense traffic or how unpleasant it would be to traverse Ubud’s congested streets on foot with our boys, Leo, 8, and James, 6. Bali has more than three million registered vehicles, but we discovered that there are a host of nearby islands — Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and the Gili Islands — that are car and scooter free. (Nusa means island in Balinese; Gili means small island in Bahasa Indonesian.) The Indonesian archipelago has more than 17,000 islands, and I wanted to spend a week in one of the car-free ones. I eliminated Penida and Lembongan, since they are only a half-hour ferry ride from Bali and thus probably too accessible. Of the three main Gili Islands, each about two to three hours from Bali by speedboat ferry (or a much quicker ferry ride from Lombok), Trawangan, often simply called Gili T, is considered the party island, Meno the quiet one, and Air somewhere in between. Hoping to find our sweet spot, I booked a ferry passage to Gili Air and hoped for the best. An hour into what turned out to be something of a white-knuckle adventure in rough seas, Leo turned flush and announced that he wanted off the boat. I have subjected my children to a host of unpleasant travel experiences around the world, usually while pursuing some elusive undiscovered paradise, and I wondered if Gili Air would be worth the bother.

"Update, Aug. 20, 2018: We have now announced our 2018-19 Student Contest Calendar. _________ Every year our contests become more and more central to what we do. Hearing from teenagers around the world on the issues and ideas of the day — whether via essays, editorials, political cartoons, videos, poetry or culture reviews — has become, for us, an essential part of our mission of “teaching and learning with The New York Times.” Last school year, we received over 25,000 submissions to the eight contests we ran, and this year we hope to get even more. Please invite the students you know. Below you’ll see we’re bringing back most of the contests we ran last year, but we’re also adding three new ones — one about news literacy, another that asks students to make connections between the classroom and the world, and a third on podcasting. In addition, we’re offering an ongoing weekly opportunity for your students to be recognized via our Current Events Conversation. Here is a calendar of each contest’s dates to help you plan ahead. We’ll update this page with all the relevant rules, submission forms and related lesson plans as the date for each contest approaches. For now, we have also included links to contest rules, lesson plans and winners from past years for reference since the guidelines for our contests stay more or less the same year after year. Remember, all of our contests are always open to anyone 13 to 19 years old, from anywhere in the world. The work students send us is then considered by experts, whether Times journalists, outside educators from partner organizations, or professional practitioners in a field related to that contest. Winners and their work are always honored on our site with special posts that go out to our entire audience. "
"Waiting for Uber to finally go public? You’ll have to wait a bit longer. The company’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told employees on Wednesday at his first staff meeting that Uber should go public in the next 18 to 36 months. Such a timetable would mean an initial public offering in 2019 at the earliest. That may annoy those who had hoped the ride-hailing giant would hit the stock market next year. But the company has been in talks to allow existing shareholders to sell to new investors, like SoftBank of Japan. Among the new C.E.O.’s first pronouncements: Change is coming. “What got us here is not what’s going to get us to the next level,” he said. He was introduced by his predecessor, Travis Kalanick, who was ousted in part because of a revolt by existing shareholders like the venture capital firm Benchmark. But Mr. Kalanick had something to celebrate as well. Judge Samuel Glasscock III of Delaware’s Court of Chancery ruled that a legal dispute between Mr. Kalanick and Benchmark be moved to arbitration for now. Benchmark’s lawyers had argued for trying the case in open court, but said the company was willing to arbitrate parts of its complaint. President Trump, speaking in Missouri on Wednesday, made his long-awaited pitch for a sweeping tax overhaul. But it was still missing details. "
"In the pilot of CW’s “Valor,” Capt. Leland Gallo (Matt Barr) tells the helicopter pilot Nora Madani (Christina Ochoa) why secretive special-operations units, like the one they belong to, have become so central to American fighting. “People don’t want boots on the ground, so this is what war is now,” he says. As in life, as on TV. This fall, “Valor” and two other new network dramas about precisely the same sort of military unit are seeking to enlist the viewing public. CBS’s “SEAL Team” tells fictional stories of the Navy SEAL Team Six — just as “Six,” on History, did earlier this year. NBC’s “The Brave” involves a different special-forces outfit, but it’s the same in all but name. The military may be having a TV moment, but as Captain Gallo says in “Valor,” these shows assume that the public doesn’t want a deep engagement. Instead, they present combat as a quick-hit operation. War may be hell, but this fall it’s just another action-drama genre. The common response to the announcement of these series last spring was that they were a network pander to “Trump’s America.” But while they may well land differently in the political climate of 2017, they could have as easily been aired in the Obama or Bush administrations. (At least judging by the rough-cut pilots, which could change before airing.) There’s nothing specifically Trumpian about the shows’ premises or tones. While Muslim terrorists are prominent, for instance, the shows conspicuously avoid any West-vs.-the-world clash-of-civilizations framing. They’re cast multiculturally and multiracially; “The Brave,” like “Six,” includes Muslim soldiers in its special-operations unit. And each series tries to balance the red meat of shootouts and explosions with the vegetables of network-TV moralizing. In the pilot of “The Brave,” a soldier dismisses Doctors Without Borders workers in Syria as “bleeding hearts” who don’t get that “it’s just too dangerous to try and help people over here.” His comrade, a devout Christian, replies that “God gave us two hands, one to help ourselves, one to help others.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. When The Times invented the “Op. Ed. Page” in 1970, the editors announced that they were hoping to create “an intellectual forum” with “divergent” views. In that spirit, I want to call attention to a piece taking issue with a recent Times Op-Ed. (Yes, the punctuation style on Op-Ed has changed since 1970.) Last week, the author Caroline Randall Williams wrote an article addressed to Barack Obama, urging him to speak up against President Trump, especially after Charlottesville. “We need your voice,” she wrote. “There is not a saner, more trustworthy opinion that many of us would rather hear.” In The Daily Beast this week, Jamil Smith disagreed. Hearing from Obama more often may well offer relief to progressives. But Smith argues — persuasively, to my mind — that a more talkative Obama would hurt the causes that matter to Obama and his allies. A higher-profile Obama would help drive Republicans and some independents back into Trump’s corner, given that many of them don’t like the former president. Even as president, Obama came to understand this dynamic and sometimes, rather than inserting himself into an issue and polarizing it, he held back. Remember: The opposition to Trump is doing pretty well. He is struggling, with a record-low approval rating and frequent criticism from his own party (and even his own appointees). "
"With drinking water cut off, its river still rising, and most routes in and out of the city flooded, Beaumont suffered the worst of Texas’ hardships on Thursday, and they showed no sign of abating. Flooding shut down the pumping plants that supply water to Beaumont in the morning, prompting a hospital to transport its patients out of the city, and trucks carrying bottled water struggled to reach the largely isolated city. The Neches River surged far beyond its banks, into streets, houses and businesses in the city of almost 120,000 people 70 miles east-northeast of Houston, reaching six feet above the previous record by afternoon, the National Weather Service reported. It was projected to rise another foot by Friday afternoon. The loss of water was just one of a host of new dangers emerging in the aftermath of Harvey, a storm system that pounded southeast Texas with record rainfall for several days before blowing across Louisiana and into Mississippi. Once a Category 4 hurricane, Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical depression. A series of small explosions shook a chemical plant about 25 miles northeast of downtown Houston on Thursday and more blasts were expected, after floodwaters shut down the cooling systems that kept the chemicals stable. Twenty-one emergency workers were treated for exposure to the resulting fumes and smoke, which were described as a lung and eye irritant. It appeared that the health and safety risk from the plant was limited. But in a region dotted with chemical factories, oil refineries and natural gas plants, the explosions at the Arkema plant near Crosby, Tex., underscore the worries that many people have about the lingering dangers that damage from the storm poses to the region’s infrastructure, economy and health.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The upending of the pornography industry is just one more tale of tech’s takeover of old-guard industries. It’s the subject explored in a new podcast series by the British journalist Jon Ronson, who spent a year reporting on how pornography production in the San Fernando Valley has been reshaped by the internet age. Called “The Butterfly Effect,” the podcast tests the theory that small actions can ripple out in history-altering ways. In the case of adult movies, Mr. Ronson explains, a young German named Fabian Thylmann unleashed a tidal wave in the 2000s after he took over a fledgling website called PornHub, a sort of YouTube for pornography. Suddenly, everybody’s videos were appearing on free sites. Caught off guard, an industry that had been enjoying fat times off DVD sales and paid sites was unable to counter the wide-scale distribution of its copyrighted work. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — A group of American and Canadian humanitarian workers who were traveling in North Korea recently had to make a tough decision: leave the country immediately and hope to return to their lifesaving work in the future, or stay in the North and face possible problems trying to go home later. This time, however, the uncertainty of their situation was not because of the North Korean government, but rather because of the Trump administration’s intention to bar Americans from traveling to the already isolated country. Under the order, announced in July, Americans must leave the North by Friday. “I didn’t want any of the staff or any of the colleagues to potentially face issues when they were getting out,” said Kim Taehoon, founder of DoDaum, a humanitarian group based in the United States that has organized an H.I.V.-diagnosis and treatment program in North Korea for the past several years. “Because of the uncertainty of the travel ban, we don’t know if we will be able to do on-the-ground work anymore.” Washington announced the ban in response to the death of Otto F. Warmbier, 22, an American college student who had been serving a 15-year sentence of hard labor in North Korea after being convicted of trying to steal a political poster. Mr. Warmbier died in June shortly after the North released him in a coma. The travel restrictions also reflected the United States’ growing impatience with North Korea over its missile tests and pursuit of nuclear weapons. By imposing the travel restriction, Washington hopes to discourage people from visiting North Korea, whose brutal government has detained American visitors for offenses like leaving a Bible behind in a hotel room. But at the same time, the sweeping ban threatens the efforts of hundreds of humanitarian workers in the North — Americans and those who collaborate with them — and the lives of North Koreans who badly need help. “One way or another, this program must go on. Otherwise, lives are lost,” said Stephen W. Linton, an American who oversees the Eugene Bell Foundation, a nonprofit group that has treated 250,000 tuberculosis patients in North Korea since 1997, including those with multidrug-resistant strains of the disease that are costlier to treat and harder to cure.

"SEOUL, South Korea — The United States and South Korea wrapped up their annual joint military exercises on Thursday by flying some of their most powerful warplanes in bombing drills in a show of force two days after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan. Two B-1B supersonic bombers and four F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States Air Force and Marine Corps joined four South Korean F-15 fighter jets in live-fire bombing exercises over a military range in eastern South Korea, officials said. On their way to join the South Korean jets, the American warplanes flew together with two F-15s from Japan’s Self-Defense Forces over waters near the southwestern Japanese island of Kyushu, the United States Pacific Command said in a statement. ”This complex mission clearly demonstrates our solidarity with our allies and underscores the broadening cooperation to defend against this common regional threat,” said Gen. Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy, commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, referring to North Korea. South Korean F-15s conducted a similar bombing drill over the same range on Tuesday, hours after a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile from North Korea flew over northern Japan and splashed into the Pacific after a flight of nearly 1,700 miles. North Korea’s test on Tuesday represented the first time that one of its missiles had flown over another country. Its leader, Kim Jong-un, said on Wednesday that the test could be a “curtain raiser” for more such tests in the Pacific. The missile test rattled a region increasingly concerned about North Korea’s fast-advancing missile capabilities and its increasingly bold way of demonstrating them. Mr. Kim said that he would watch the United States’ actions before deciding whether to conduct more missile tests, including in waters around Guam, an American territory that is home to Andersen Air Force Base, from which the B-1B Lancer bombers participating in the drills on Thursday took off. The F-35 jets flew from an American base in Iwakuni, Japan. Hours after Mr. Kim’s warning, the United States conducted what it called a previously planned missile-defense test, intercepting a medium-range ballistic missile fired from a Navy guided-missile destroyer off the coast of Hawaii. Also on Wednesday, President Trump declared “talking is not the answer” to resolving the prolonged standoff over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. But hours later, when asked by reporters if the United States was out of diplomatic solutions with North Korea, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis replied, “No.” The Ulchi-Freedom Guardian, the 11-day joint military exercises the United States and South Korea completed on Thursday, involved tens of thousands of American and South Korean troops, although the exercises were conducted largely through computer simulations. Whenever such joint exercises take place, North Korea accuses the South and the United States of preparing for an invasion and often conducts its own military exercises and missile tests. "
"A political faction in the state of Western Australia is stirring a debate about seceding from the country’s federation of states over a long-running grievance about tax revenues. After Britain voted to leave the European Union in a move known as Brexit, and some Californians agitated to leave the United States after President Trump’s election, has “threatening to leave” become the new political solution to thorny problems? A faction of the Western Australian Liberals, the right-leaning party led by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, is holding a conference this weekend. On the agenda is a motion to set up a committee to investigate “WAxit,” the somewhat awkward moniker for the proposal to secede from Australia. The committee would report back in 2018. The idea might sound far-fetched, but it’s not the first time Western Australia has considered it. In 1933, 68 percent of the state — which had only signed on to the Australian federation reluctantly in the first place — voted to secede. The British House of Commons had final say on the matter, but refused even to consider it. Western Australia was placated with the establishment of a system that had the effect of redistributing Australia’s wealth in its favor — and it’s that system that the rogue Liberal faction is now upset about. “Western Australia has a long history of discontent,” said Alan Fenna, a politics professor at Curtin University in Perth. “But it’s political and economic discontent. It’s not an identity issue as you’d see somewhere like Quebec.” "
"SYDNEY, Australia — Residents of the Japanese island of Hokkaido were woken on Tuesday by warnings that they should take cover from an approaching North Korean missile. The missile launching was the latest in a recent string of provocations from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who is intent on demonstrating his country’s progress in building a nuclear arsenal. Pyongyang’s displays of its nuclear and missile technology are terrifying. But Washington’s development of new nuclear-weapon and missile technologies is also contributing to global instability. American nuclear advances threaten to start a new arms race and change the logic of mutually assured destruction, which has undergirded nuclear stability since the 1950s. In recent years, the Pentagon has increased the overall offensive power of its nuclear arsenal. Those changes, along with further upgrading, will amount to more destructive power from all three legs of the American nuclear triad: sea, land and air-launched nuclear weapons. From the sea, a nuclear missile “super fuze” timing element improves the accuracy of submarine-based warheads by allowing for detonation closer to targets. The United States began incorporating this new fuze system into the ballistic-missile submarine fleet in 2009, and some analysts believe the entire submarine force has already been equipped with the technology. And last week, the Pentagon announced that it had awarded contracts for updated versions of both the ground-based nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal and the air-launched nuclear-tipped stealth cruise missile, designed to penetrate enemy territory undetected. According to some nuclear weapons experts, enhancements like the super fuze have increased by up to threefold the destructive capacity of America’s nuclear arsenal. And Andrew C. Weber, a former assistant defense secretary, recently described the upgraded stealth cruise missiles as “a destabilizing system designed for nuclear war fighting,” rather than a necessary addition to the system of nuclear deterrence.

"This summer, Dave Chappelle returned to the stage for an ambitious, monthlong residency at Radio City Music Hall in New York. We saw the show independently, on separate nights. What we witnessed inspired us to dedicate an entire episode to the legacy of Chappelle’s comedy as he works to re-establish his place in American culture. But much has shifted in the decade since Chappelle, through his much-loved TV show, “Chappelle’s Show,” brilliantly explored how black people are represented and misrepresented: Nowadays, he’s no longer interested in speaking on behalf of anyone else.

"I
f you are, like me, a person with no sense of style and a stomach paunch, you might understand why dressing for a fashion show would be a psychological challenge. The day before my first one, I begged my best-dressed co-worker to chaperone my visit to a fast-fashion outlet. I’d coveted a pleated gold-foil skirt I’d seen on the store’s website. My co-worker had approved the skirt on the model. I tried it on. She did not approve it on me. In person, the gold foil looked cheap, the waistband of the skirt unflattering. Instead, she picked out a rose-colored accordion skirt that I would never have thought to buy. I put it on the next morning. Four hours later, I spilled steak juice all down my front. Maybe another person would have given up at that point, but I was on my way to meet Elaine Welteroth, the editor in chief of Teen Vogue. Hired at 29, she is the youngest-ever editor in chief of a Condé Nast publication, and only the second black woman to hold the title there. Since taking over the magazine last year, she has become a personality of sorts, appearing as herself on ABC’s ‘‘black-ish’’ and being photographed cuddled up to celebrities: the Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, the actors Gabrielle Union and Aja Naomi King. As I headed to the Coach fall show this February, I found myself growing increasingly nervous to meet her. It wasn’t that she was famous, really. But I spent a significant portion of my adolescence fantasizing about running my own teen magazine, and, like her, I am a young, black New York-based editor with curly hair and myopia. She was famous to me. The current iteration of Teen Vogue is, if you listen to anyone who likes it — and you’d be surprised at the diversity of people who do — a ‘‘revolution’’ in magazines. Devoid of the prom- and weight-loss-themed articles that usually litter teen magazines, the title, read primarily by 18-to-24-year-olds, is now full of articles like an open letter by Mckesson to Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old black boy who was fatally shot by police, or a conversation between the singer Troye Sivan and the model Hari Nef about being members of the L.G.B.T. community in the current political climate. It certainly feels strikingly different from the Teen Vogue that began showing up at my family’s house in the early aughts. Back then, it was mostly indistinguishable from the other teen magazines I read: CosmoGirl (for sassy white girls), Seventeen (for ambitious white girls), YM (for white girls prone to toxic-shock syndrome). Teen Vogue — for rich white girls — was explicitly dedicated to fashion, less ‘‘finding a prom date’’ and more ‘‘finding a prom color palette.’’ What sticks out most in my memory is ‘‘A Room of My Own,’’ the back-page feature that almost always presented a very posh New York girl whose bed was inevitably from either Crate and Barrel or some cool, unnamed Brooklyn thrift store. Even though my life didn’t resemble the ones I saw in those pages, I read the magazines as soon as they arrived. I knew the themes were corny and hypocritical — breathless embraces of self-love despite diet tips 12 pages later — but I was convinced they would teach me how to be a person in the world. I hadn’t thought about Teen Vogue for years when I noticed a cover story about Willow Smith, an outspoken teenage singer with brown skin and dreadlocked hair. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen a black girl on the cover of a magazine. I flipped to the article. It was just as effervescent and slightly cheesy as the ones from my youth — ‘‘She may very well be from a distant planet, a foreign place where women are homegrown superheroes, nurtured to become god­desses,’’ went the description of Smith — but it was a far cry from the profiles of racially homogeneous, apolitical teeny-boppers I was used to reading. Welteroth wrote it herself. At the fashion show, people started to take their seats in front of the runway. I craned my neck, searching for Welteroth, who is difficult to miss. She has tight, springy curls that she herself cuts into a corona around her face, and is perhaps the only person who can wear a pair of oversize aviator glasses without looking as if she wandered out of a 1970s-era most-wanted poster. Just as the first models started down the runway, my phone buzzed: It was Welteroth. They closed the doors early. She didn’t make it in. "
"[Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] Vice President Mike Pence’s recent swing through Latin America quickly acquired an unwanted label: the cleanup tour. Almost everywhere Mr. Pence went, one question followed: Did President Trump really mean it when he spontaneously threatened a United States military intervention in Venezuela? Mr. Pence did his best to disavow Mr. Trump’s words without actually saying that was his intent. Every administration suffers its share of “what the president meant to say” moments. Even the most disciplined commander-in-chief misspeaks from time to time. Take one last question at a news conference, tackle an unfamiliar issue, talk too loosely at a fund-raiser, and the damage is done. Aides quickly deny the plain meaning of the president’s words, contort them to conform to policy, or feign outrage that anyone could have failed to grasp what the president meant. This, however, is not just any administration. Just listen, and Mr. Trump’s discordant policy notes sour nearly every foreign policy tune. Mr. Trump threatens to make South Korea pay for missile defense and seems to invite Seoul and Tokyo to build their own nuclear arsenals; Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis jumps in to say never mind. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeks to calm the crisis between Saudi Arabia and Qatar; Mr. Trump’s tweets embolden the Saudis to double down in the feud. Mr. Tillerson, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, Mr. Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., advocate preserving the nuclear agreement with Iran; Mr. Trump scolds, “If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.” Mr. Trump calls for banning transgender people from the military; an array of senior Pentagon officials, including General Dunford, say the policy remains unchanged. When Mr. Trump finally issues a formal order weeks later, Mr. Mattis says it will require further study to implement. And on Russia, the administration speaks with one voice — except Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Pence, in the Baltics, praises tough new congressionally mandated sanctions; Mr. Trump tweets that the sanctions will send United States-Russia relations to “an all-time & very dangerous low.” Moscow’s meddling in the presidential election? Thomas Bossert, the president’s chief counterterrorism adviser, and other senior national security advisers back the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia sought to influence the election in Mr. Trump’s favor. Mr. Trump equivocates: “Well I think it was Russia, and I think it could have been other people and other countries. It could have been a lot of people interfered.” "
"Yes, I recently went to Casper, Wyo., to see the total eclipse, but this column isn’t about that. It’s prompted by something else I saw in Casper after the sun reappeared. A few hundred yards from the hillside where we watched the eclipse is a museum called the National Historic Trails Interpretive Center. A cooperative venture of the federal Bureau of Land Management, the city of Casper and a local foundation, it tells the story of the nearly half-million people who passed through Casper in the mid-1800s on their way west to what they dreamed – or, more like it, desperately hoped — would be a better life. Included there are artifacts and accounts of the pioneers’ Oregon Trail; the route the Mormons took after they were driven from Illinois and Missouri; and the path to California followed by those drawn by visions of gold nuggets. Never having lived more than shouting distance from the East Coast, I had little sense of this history or of the “torrent of humanity,” as a National Park Service brochure puts it, that followed trails with wheel ruts still visible across the West. The museum’s exhibits are engaging, with ample commentary and interactive maps. On the wall near the entrance is a plaque with these words: “The westward urge was a human instinct, like the need to love or to taste spring air and believe again that life is not a dead end after all.” Those words were written not by a federal bureaucrat, but by a mid-20th-century Western writer, David Sievert Lavender, in a 1963 book called “Westward Vision.” Still, a federal agency put them up in a visible position, and keeps them there. Earlier in the day, I had seen one example of nature’s power when the sky went dark. Now here, under federal auspices, was a testament to and celebration of another force of nature: the human instinct that compels people to leave where they are and go, even at their peril, to someplace new, someplace safe. The words lingered in my mind as anomalous, even subversive, as I emerged from the museum into the bright sunlight of another day in the age of Trump. I actually hesitated before quoting the words here, in case Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke or one of his minions learns about them and decides they’re too off-message to remain. "
"I know that Harvey is heavy on America’s heart. It is certainly heavy on mine. My oldest brother lives in the hard-hit suburban Houston town of Humble, just outside of George Bush Intercontinental Airport and on the shores of the Spring Creek and the west fork of the San Jacinto River. And now the storm is barreling toward my hometown in North Louisiana where my mother and two of my brothers live. I’m anxious. I wish that I could take a reprieve from politics and simply focus on the human suffering and human altruism on display in the affected areas. But, alas, I cannot. Politics keep creeping in. Politics keep occurring concurrently. Set aside for a moment that Donald Trump is the person who pulled America out of the Paris climate accords, even though models suggest that climate change makes severe weather more severe, and as Politico reports, “Harvey is the third 500-year flood to hit the Houston area in the past three years.” Forget for a moment that, according to Slate, just 10 days before Harvey made landfall Trump signed an executive order that included “eliminating an Obama-era rule called the federal flood risk management standard that asked agencies to account for climate change projections when they approved projects.” The final assessment on how this administration handles the storm can’t be made while it still rages, but what Trump says and does now is open to analysis. In that vein, a line from Trump’s joint press conference with the president of Finland stood out. When asked about pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio as Harvey was making landfall, Trump responded: “Actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally.” Consider what this man is saying: He used the horror and anxious anticipation of a monster storm menacing millions of Americans — particularly in Houston whose population is 44 percent Hispanic — in a political calculation to get more ratings and more eyeballs on the fact that he was using the power of the presidency to forgive, and thereby condone, Arpaio’s racism.

"Houston isn’t the only major city reeling from record rainfall and devastating floods. In Mumbai, India, where summer monsoons are annual events, as much rain fell in 12 hours on Tuesday as normally does over 11 days in a typical monsoon, paralyzing the city, India’s financial capital. So far this summer, flooding has killed more than 1,000 people in India, Nepal and perennially flood-prone Bangladesh. The United Nations says at least 41 million people have been directly affected by flooding and landslides in South Asia, with homes and croplands destroyed. Floods from heavy rainfall have also ripped through Britain, Ireland, Sudan and Uganda in Africa. On Aug. 14, torrents of water swept through the streets of Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, and a massive mudslide left some 1,000 people dead or missing. Like the calamity in Texas, these unnatural rainfalls carry two messages. One is the risk of unregulated development. As in Houston, officials in India have paid little attention to the consequences of rapid urban growth in low-lying, watery environments with few natural defenses against a deluge when it comes. And, like Houston, which has suffered floods in the past, Mumbai was hit by severe flooding in 2005 that claimed more than 500 lives, yet it did little to address the issues that made that flooding so deadly. The second message is that unabated climate change does, indeed, exact a price. Warmer weather heats the oceans, which causes more evaporation, which increases moisture in the atmosphere, which then falls as driving rain. Warmer oceans also rise, partly due to thermal expansion, which in turn threatens low-lying areas; among climate scientists, Bangladesh has for years been the poster child of nations that are likely to face famine, flooding and forced migration as a result of rising sea levels caused by global warming. It does not have to be this bad the next time around. Cities around the world are taking steps to become more resilient, so they can better cope when exceptional weather events occur. Upgrading sewage, drainage and transportation infrastructure; increasing green spaces; restoring wetlands; and using zoning laws to prevent new construction in known flood plains and vulnerable coastal areas are all obvious steps that can help. Early-warning systems, sorely lacking in many developing countries, are also critical, as are evacuation and emergency response plans. Reforestation can help prevent landslides and bolster the capacity for rain to be absorbed upstream. As the world has long recognized, most recently at the Paris summit meeting on climate change in December 2015, poor nations will need a helping hand from rich ones as they transition to cleaner, low-carbon energy sources. This is not something the Trump administration seems inclined to offer, any more than it seems inclined to listen to the scientists, join with other nations to combat the problem or do something about America’s own greenhouse gas emissions. That’s unconscionable, even borderline nuts, especially now that President Trump himself has seen at first hand the results of inaction. "
"In the face of America’s abysmal voter participation rates, lawmakers have two choices: They can make voting easier, or they can make it harder. Illinois made the right choice this week, becoming the 10th state, along with the District of Columbia, to enact automatic voter registration. The bill, which could add as many as one million voters to the state’s rolls, was signed by Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who had vetoed similar legislation last year. Under the new law, all eligible voters will be registered to vote when they visit the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agencies. If they do not want to be registered, they may opt out. “The right to vote is foundational for the rights of Americans in our democracy,” Mr. Rauner said at a bill-signing ceremony on Monday. “We as a people need to do everything we can to knock down barriers, remove hurdles for all those who are eligible to vote, to be able to vote.” These are incontestable propositions, and yet for most officials from Mr. Rauner’s party, showing even mild support for them is apostasy.

The Times is providing free digital access to coverage of the storm. • The victims’ stories. “Mama was saying her prayers,” Jordyn Grace, 3, told a relative. Jordyn was found in the Texas floodwaters clutching her mother’s lifeless body, a haunting tale of survival among terrible stories of death. At least 38 people were killed by the storm. "
"The Obama administration had an idea it thought would help address the pay gap between white men and almost everyone else: requiring companies to report how much they paid people, along with their sex and race. On Tuesday, that regulation became the latest of those reversed by the Trump administration, before the requirement was to go into effect next year. Pay transparency, alone, would not have solved the pay gap problem. But without it, employees and regulators won’t have evidence that a problem exists at any particular company — and employers will face less pressure to fix it. There is little data on whether forcing companies to disclose pay makes it more equitable, mostly because the pay of individual workers or companies is generally kept secret. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys companies about compensation, but publishes only aggregate, anonymous data. Researchers who have studied the few instances in which companies have publicly disclosed individual salaries say it is not enough to close pay gaps, nor is it essential — some companies have closed them on their own, without publicly reporting pay information. But most companies have no incentive to close pay gaps. The regulation provided that incentive — by pressuring them into it. “Part of the motivation behind it would be to shame certain employers that found large gaps into doing something and taking proactive steps,” said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied the issue.

"President Trump made his pitch for tax reform this week, but the odds are not favorable for legislation that would reduce individual and corporate rates and promote economic growth without driving up the national deficit. For inspiration, maybe Mr. Trump and lawmakers in Congress should look in their own backyard. The District of Columbia, a political entity whose city council lies ideologically somewhere to the left of Bernie Sanders, has done exactly that. The capital’s financial affairs were in such disarray by the mid-1990s that they were taken over by a federal financial control board that operated until 2001. Yet in 2014 the council cut corporate and business taxes, reduced individual rates for everyone earning less than $1 million and broadened the tax base by eliminating many loopholes. As a headline on the conservative website The Daily Caller put it, “Hell Freezes Over: DC Passes Tax Reform.” In the ensuing years, economic growth and tax receipts have surged, enabling the city to accelerate cuts that were being phased in. The legislation was not revenue neutral, in the sense that broadening the tax base offset the reduction in rates. It was a tax cut. But in a development that would surely warm the hearts of pro-growth Republicans, the economic lift was so strong that tax receipts increased, and last year hit a record. Even more remarkable, the plan drew praise from across the ideological spectrum, including that of conservative supply-side advocates like Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, which opposes all tax increases.

"BEIJING — The Chinese Communist Party will hold a once-every-five-years leadership reshuffle in October, the state-run news media reported on Thursday, confirming the date of a closely watched meeting that will serve as a test of President Xi Jinping’s power. About 2,300 delegates, including senior officials, will meet in Beijing for a party congress on Oct. 18, according to news reports. They are expected to confirm Mr. Xi for a second five-year term and to appoint a new cohort of officials under him. Mr. Xi, already one of the most influential Chinese leaders in decades, is likely to emerge from the meeting even more formidable. As president, he has reasserted China’s power in Asia, restructured the military and led a relentless anticorruption campaign that has ensnared scores of low-level officials and political enemies. Now, Mr. Xi is poised to win an even broader mandate for his policies and authoritarian style by stacking the party’s most influential bodies with close allies. He may also defy the standard script and lay the groundwork for extending his tenure by delaying the designation of a successor. “He’s large and in charge,” said Christopher K. Johnson, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "
"HOUSTON — A series of explosions at a flood-damaged chemical plant outside Houston on Thursday drew sharp focus on hazards to public health and safety from the city’s vast petrochemical complex as the region begins a painstaking recovery from Hurricane Harvey. The blasts at the plant, owned by the French chemical company Arkema, came after its main electrical system and backups failed, cutting off refrigeration systems that kept volatile chemicals stable. While nearby residents had been evacuated, 15 public safety officers were treated at a hospital after inhaling smoke from chemical fires that followed the explosions. The Arkema plant has been identified as one of the most hazardous in the state. Its failure followed releases of contaminants from several other area petrochemical plants and systemic breakdowns of water and sewer systems in Houston and elsewhere in the storm-struck region. The explosions — more are expected, the company said — will bring fresh scrutiny on whether these plants are adequately regulated and monitored by state and federal safety officials. The chemical plant accident came as devastation from Harvey, now a tropical depression moving into the Mississippi Valley, continued to spread across the region. The known death toll from the storm and flooding remained at 39, the authorities said. Record-breaking floods swept through Beaumont, Tex., 100 miles east of Houston, damaging the water system and leaving the city’s 120,000 residents without clean water. "
"WASHINGTON — With the election of President Trump, the nation’s consumer watchdog agency faced a quandary: how to shield the Obama-era institution from a Republican administration determined to loosen the federal government’s grip on business. In the weeks after the election, Richard Cordray, the Democrat who leads the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, directed his staff to compile stories from ordinary Americans thanking it for resolving complaints. The anecdotes, which he solicited in an email to share with the Trump transition team, could provide a counterpoint to critics who had cast the agency as a regulatory scourge on the economy. And implicit in his request to employees was the belief that some accolades would come from parts of the country that helped elect Mr. Trump — evidence that the popularity of consumer safeguards transcends party divisions. “There must be hundreds of such stories,” Mr. Cordray wrote in the email in November, which was obtained in a public records request. He added, “I can think of no better vindication” of the agency’s consumer relief efforts. While many federal agencies have begun to loosen the reins on the companies they regulate, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, born out of the Dodd-Frank financial law in 2010, has taken the opposite course. Congress granted it unusually broad authority — and autonomy from the White House and Congress — to both enforce existing federal rules and write new ones, including issuing fines against financial companies. Under Mr. Trump it has openly embraced its mission, cracking down on debt collectors, pushing out a major new financial rule on arbitration and pursuing a flurry of enforcement actions against payday lenders and others.

"Updated, Sept. 4 with additional ideas from a Houston English teacher. Hurricane Harvey, one of the most destructive storms in the history of the United States, made landfall in southeast Texas on Aug. 25. The New York Times writes: The scale of the crisis is so vast, in fact, that officials concede they are nowhere near being able to measure it, much less fully address it. Below, we share a few ideas for how to begin to talk about this natural disaster with your students. We’ll continue to update this lesson in the days and weeks ahead. As always with important breaking news, we would love to know how you will be addressing it in your classroom. Please post a comment, write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, or reach out to us on Twitter or Facebook. And if you are a teacher or student who has been affected by Harvey, please let us know what this site might do to help. _____________________ Images as a Starting Point for Response You might begin with Harvey in Pictures, a powerful collection of photographs about the hurricane and its aftermath. There are also videos and graphics available on the Times site and elsewhere that can help students grapple with the storm and its scope. The animated map Thousands Cried for Help offers a look at the actual requests in real time that came in to local rescue groups, and might provide an even more visceral understanding of the nature of the disaster.

"The legal challenge that helped to free scores of travelers who were detained at airports around the country in the confusing early days of President Trump’s travel ban, prompting thousands of demonstrators to demand their release, was quietly settled on Thursday in a Brooklyn courtroom. Under the settlement agreement, the federal government is required to identify and send a letter to every individual who was improperly barred from entering the country under the original travel ban, providing a list of free legal services organizations that can help recipients obtain visas or other entry documents. Approval is not guaranteed, but the government agreed to process their applications in good faith. “For the people who were never able to come back, this is the best opportunity we can give them,” said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. The agreement did not provide any damages or monetary compensation for those affected by the ban, nor any award of legal fees to the groups who fought it in court. People who never reached an American airport because they were kept from boarding flights are not covered by the settlement. “Although this case has been moot since March, when the president rescinded the original executive order and issued a new one that does not restrict the entry of Iraqi nationals, the U.S. government has elected to settle this case on favorable terms,” Nicole Navas Oxman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement. The travel ban was an attempt to fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The original version of the executive order imposing the ban was issued in January, barely a week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. After that order was blocked in court, Mr. Trump issued a revised version, which will be the subject of arguments before the Supreme Court this fall. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. New dangers are emerging in the aftermath of Harvey, as floodwaters recede and the dwindling storm moves through Louisiana and into Mississippi. Forecasters say it should end on Saturday. Explosions were reported overnight at a damaged chemical plant near Houston, a hub for chemical and petrochemical plants. More blasts are feared. And much of the city is still covered in a toxic stew of chemicals, sewage, debris and waste. More than 30,000 people remain in shelters like the Houston convention center, above. More details of what people suffered are becoming clear, like the wrenching tale of the 3-year-old found clinging to her mother’s body. Here’s a quick guide to our full coverage — access is free.

"Though the Supreme Court’s decision in Fisher v. University of Texas last year upheld the university’s right to use race as a factor in admissions, affirmative action policies continue to be scrutinized. This month, The New York Times reported that President Trump’s Justice Department would begin to investigate and even sue colleges over “intentional race-based discrimination.” Critics contend that the proffering of special consideration or benefits to blacks and Latinos is a form of “reverse discrimination,” while supporters argue that affirmative action merely evens the playing field; a recent analysis found that even with these measures, black and Latino students are still more underrepresented in the country’s top colleges and universities today than they were 35 years ago. Below, two books delve into the debate, while another shows why affirmative action may not be enough. FOR DISCRIMINATION
Race, Affirmative Action, and the Law
By Randall Kennedy
304 pp. Pantheon. (2013) This book presents a balanced defense of what the writer, the Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy, refers to as “positive discrimination.” Kennedy explores the history of race-related laws and asks why, despite preferential treatment in college admissions for people based on special categories like geography or legacy status, consideration on the basis of race has always been contentious. His focus is on higher education, where these discussions have historically taken place because of the scarcity of available seats and top universities’ role as “gateways to opportunity, socialization and certification” and “ training grounds for the power elite.” Kennedy concedes some of the costs of affirmative action — the potential to stoke resentments, as well as the stigma and self-doubt that follows high-achieving black Americans, for instance — but concludes that these drawbacks are outweighed by the net benefits. And his defense is not, as he writes in his introduction, because of the many ways he’s benefited from these policies, though he details them in his introduction. Rather, he views affirmative action as a “positive good,” a moral necessity and the responsible choice in a society marred by historical race-based inequity. WHEN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WAS WHITE

"Durham, N.C. — Some of the most heartening images to emerge from storm-torn Houston this week have been of neighbors doing what we all hope our neighbors will do when we are in trouble. From shuttling victims to safety in their personal boats to braving waist-high water searching for the stranded, neighbors have been helping neighbors cope with the worst natural disaster ever to strike the nation’s fourth-largest city, and doing it without regard to politics or ideology. Another neighbor has offered to help us in these desperate times, a neighbor that also came to our aid when Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Gulf Coast 12 years ago. That neighbor is Mexico. The Trump administration should accept its help again, and do so with thanks and gratitude. Because, as Hurricane Harvey can teach President Trump, that’s what neighbors do. I witnessed Mexico’s willingness to be a good neighbor while serving as the No. 2 at the American Embassy in Mexico City in 2005. Within hours of Hurricane Katrina’s landfall in New Orleans, Mexican officials were on the phone offering to send army field kitchens and naval cleanup crews to the stricken areas. Those offers frankly caught us flat-footed. We were accustomed to looking at Mexico as the poor relation who needed our help, not the other way around. Even more surprising, the Mexican Army was by far the most nationalistic and anti-American element in the Mexican government. Yet it ended up leading a convoy of more than 200 Mexican soldiers to assist displaced Americans in San Antonio, where it eventually served 170,000 meals, distributed more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations.

"No, no, no, says Richard A. Luthmann, a lawyer who practices politics on Staten Island with a blunt-edged hatchet. It is not trolling, Mr. Luthmann said, to set up phony Facebook pages to embarrass candidates — such as one in which a Republican Assembly candidate in a conservative district calls for more housing projects, or another, in which a liberal Democrat City Council member “welcomes” a welfare hotel for drug addicts and criminals. While Mr. Luthmann neither denies nor admits creating the pages, he insists that there would be absolutely nothing unusual if he had. Moreover, he said, trolling is the wrong term for such tactics. “It’s what is called a dirty trick,” Mr. Luthmann said, who misappropriated a term from Plato to deem Facebook spoofing a form of “noble lie.” Thanks to an expose by reporter Amanda Farinacci of Spectrum News NY1, there is scant doubt about Mr. Luthmann’s role in creating a string of bogus pages to cause trouble for candidates running for district attorney; the assembly; the City Council; and the mayoralty. Were candidates he was aligned with glad to have him doing the dirty work? In private Facebook Messenger exchanges obtained by NY1, Mr. Luthmann wrote to Ron Castorina Jr., a Republican member of the Assembly, when they learned of a challenge from another Republican, Janine Materna, in the September 2016 primary.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration signaled on Thursday that the black abolitionist Harriet Tubman may not replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill after all. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined to endorse the plan for a 2020 redesign of the $20 bill that was announced by the Obama administration last year. “People have been on the bills for a long period of time,” Mr. Mnuchin told CNBC. “This is something we’ll consider. Right now we’ve got a lot more important issues to focus on.” President Trump, who has described himself as a “big fan” of the populist rabble-rousing president from Tennessee, made clear as a candidate that he didn’t like the proposal to replace Jackson. “I would love to leave Andrew Jackson and see if we can maybe come up with another denomination,” he said in April 2016, after the decision was announced.

"To the Editor: Re “Who Decides if Trump Is Unfit?,” by Peter D. Kramer and Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, Aug. 29): May I respectfully disagree with the esteemed psychiatrists, whose position is that politicians and not mental health professionals should decide on President Trump’s fitness for office. They write that “many experts believe that Mr. Trump has a narcissistic personality disorder.” These experts are concerned about his mental and emotional instability. People with this disorder distort reality to meet their extreme ego needs, rendering them blind to other views and facts but their own. Mr. Trump is capable of any belief or action that feeds his extreme narcissism, no matter how absurd. His actions are driven by his obsession to gain the praise and adoration of others. This inability to understand reality and the truth, which we have clearly seen in Mr. Trump, renders him incapable of evaluating situations and making informed, appropriate decisions. It is time the mental health community step up and join, if not lead, the effort to remove our president from office. KEN LEFKOWITZ, MEDFORD, N.J. To the Editor: Concern about President Trump’s behavior has led many to posit mental instability as a way to remove him from office. The conflation of bad character and mental illness is both dangerous and unnecessary. Mr. Trump’s impulsivity, dishonesty, divisiveness and outright unpresidential behavior are easily condemned without resorting to a psychiatric diagnosis. In fact, labeling it as illness serves only to excuse his bad behavior. Mental illness may affect judgment and interfere with functioning, but it does not cause bad character. It is dangerous to invoke the label of a mental illness in an attempt to disqualify those with whom we don’t agree. Those of us who are concerned about the effects of his unpresidential and sometimes frightening behavior must turn to other branches of government, such as Congress and the courts, to curb his influence.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • American citizens must leave North Korea by today under the Trump administration’s travel ban, adopted after the North released a detained American student in a coma. Aid workers fear damage to their missions in the impoverished country. The U.S. and South Korea ended annual joint military exercises with a display of air power — B-1B supersonic bombers, F-35 stealth fighter jets and F-15 fighter jets — and live-fire bombing exercises that came just two days after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan. Above, an image released by South Korea. Our White House correspondent polled Asia experts on the North Korean crisis, and found that some have greater fears that President Trump will open a risky, unpredictable dialogue with the North than that he will go to war. _____ "
"The world’s nuclear inspectors complicated President Trump’s effort to find Iran in violation of the two-year-old nuclear accord with the United States and five other world powers, declaring on Thursday that the latest inspections found no evidence that the country is breaching the agreement. Mr. Trump has made no secret of his desire to scrap the agreement, even over the objections of many of his top national security officials. But the reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency make it harder to create an argument that Iran is in violation. The latest declaration by the I.A.E.A. came just a week after Mr. Trump had sent his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, to Vienna to meet with the top agency officials, who are responsible for conducting the inspections and monitoring Iranian compliance. Ms. Haley was pressing the agency to be more aggressive, and some administration officials have argued that the I.A.E.A. should demand access to a series of Iranian military sites. But under the accord, the agency can only do so when there is a reasonable suspicion that Iran is conducting illicit nuclear-related activities at those sites. So far, according the I.A.E.A. and American officials, the United States has not delivered a list of suspect locations. Ms. Haley, who is rumored in Washington to be a leading candidate to become secretary of state if the incumbent, Rex W. Tillerson, steps down later this year or next, made no comment on Thursday on the report’s findings. But she issued a statement that suggested that the administration would push the inspections argument further, despite an Iranian declaration several days ago that its military sites are off-limits.

"For all of the uncertainties that await Houston and coastal Texas, we can be reasonably sure about one thing: Many of those flooded out by Hurricane Harvey will watch their investments and savings collapse into debt and bankruptcy. And the heaviest burdens, of course, will fall on the shoulders of low- and middle-income residents. Preliminary estimates put losses from the storm at $30 billion to $40 billion. If past disasters are any indication, those numbers will only grow in the coming days and weeks. Whatever the ultimate figure, the losses will represent, in part, the aggregation of hundreds of thousands or more individual financial calamities. When the waters recede and Houstonians and others hit by this storm return home, with all their pluck and determination, to muck out and clear debris, many will learn too late that their homeowners’ insurance does not cover flood damage. Even for the lucky 15 percent of homeowners in Houston and surrounding Harris County, who have a federal flood policy in place, collecting claims will most likely be a protracted and contentious process. (Hurricane Katrina and Sandy victims have stories to tell about fraudulent or erroneous claims adjustments, delayed payments and their homes being unlivable for years.) Many of the other 85 percent were not required to have a flood policy because they were not officially at “high risk” on the region’s flood maps — maps that President Trump no longer wants the government to pay for. Those homeowners will be forced to fall back on some combination of disaster relief, loans and savings. Although homeowners with government-backed mortgages will be able to hold off on payments for at least 90 days, eventually they will have to honor mortgages on houses that are uninhabitable or even swept away. Renters may never return home. In short, many Texans will be starting over economically. As the legal scholar Michele Dauber has shown, President Franklin D. Roosevelt understood the relationship between “ruined landscapes and ruined lives.” Roosevelt likened the Great Depression to the devastation of the Dust Bowl, tornadoes in Georgia, and floods on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to build his case for the huge public investments and assistance programs that transformed the fates of Americans who were also starting over. "
"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday that he had signed deployment orders for some of the American reinforcements that are to be sent to Afghanistan. It is the first tangible step that the Pentagon has taken to carry out the new strategy that President Trump announced last week to step up the fight in Afghanistan and try to take back the initiative from the Taliban. “I have signed orders, but it is not complete,” Mr. Mattis said. “In other words, I have signed some of the troops that will go and we are identifying the specific ones.” Although Mr. Mattis did not say which forces were being deployed, administration officials have previously said the Pentagon will send nearly 4,000 additional troops, some of whom are expected to come from the 82nd Airborne Division. The United States currently has about 11,000 troops in Afghanistan to advise Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism missions. The new reinforcements, officials have said, will enable the United States to advise select Afghan brigades in the field, step up the effort to train Afghanistan’s special operations forces and call in American and allied air and artillery strikes. “When you go into Afghanistan and you are carrying a gun, you are going into a combat zone,” Mr. Mattis said. “By and large, this is to enable the Afghan force to fight more effectively. It is more advisers. It is more enablers — fire support, for example.” The military is also reorganizing some of the forces already in Afghanistan to carry out the new mission. Pentagon officials have yet to publicly explain the new mission in detail or make the case why they think the new strategy will be effective when the deployment of 100,000 troops to Afghanistan during the Obama administration failed to break the back of the Taliban and other extremist groups, or force them to the negotiating table. Mr. Mattis said he would begin to outline the rationale for the forces in more detail when he testifies to Congress on Wednesday. "
"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security took the first major step on Thursday toward building a barrier on the border with Mexico, a key campaign promise of President Trump, as officials announced that they had awarded contracts to build several prototypes of a concrete wall. Four companies will build the prototypes in the San Diego area, said officials at Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the department. The companies selected will each have 30 days to complete the projects after the agency gives them the order to proceed. “The border wall prototypes and designs will complement other tools we employ to secure our borders,” said Ronald D. Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner at Customs and Border Protection. Mr. Vitiello said that the prototypes would be about 30 feet high and that the contracts were between $400,000 and $500,000 each. The department has reallocated $20 million from other programs to pay for the prototypes and related costs. Homeland Security officials said the prototypes would be added to the existing walls in the San Diego area and would allow the agency to evaluate which barriers are most effective in giving Border Patrol agents time to respond to reports of illegal drugs and human smuggling. The awarding of the contracts for a border wall comes as the government assesses the damage from Hurricane Harvey, which has devastated parts of Texas. Some congressional critics have accused the administration and its Republican allies of proposing to cut billions in funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead department for disaster recovery, to pay for a border wall.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration ordered Russia on Thursday to close its consulate in San Francisco and two diplomatic annexes, in New York and Washington, in a carefully calculated riposte to Russia’s order that the United States cut its diplomatic staff in Russia. The tit-for-tat move, which Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson conveyed to Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in a morning phone call, bore all of the hallmarks of a Cold War-era grudge match. But the administration seemed eager to contain the fallout, casting the move as a straightforward return to diplomatic parity between the countries rather than the latest volley in an increasingly combative relationship. “In the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians,” the State Department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement, the United States would require Russia to close the three offices by Saturday. Russia’s reaction was similarly measured. The Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Lavrov “expressed regret at the escalation of tension in bilateral relations” and said that the Russian government would study the move before deciding how to respond. Russia’s new ambassador to the United States, who arrived Thursday in Washington to be greeted by the news, was quoted by a state news agency as saying Moscow would respond without “hysterical outbursts.” “It’s necessary to calmly sort things out,” said the ambassador, Anatoly I. Antonov. “It’s necessary to act calmly and professionally.” The administration’s response had been expected for the past month, since Russia ordered the American Mission to cut its staff by 755 people — a sign of its displeasure after Congress imposed sanctions because of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
