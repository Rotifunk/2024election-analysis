"The biggest taboo in the immigration debate is the idea of an “amnesty.” Immigration opponents routinely paint amnesties for undocumented immigrants in the United States as catastrophic blows to the rule of law. The implication is that the only proper thing to do is enforce laws uniformly, all the time, without exceptions — and that an immigration amnesty would thus be a threat to truth, justice and the American way. But there’s a problem with that theory: Amnesties, though not always labeled as such, are central to how the nation’s legal system functions. The ways that laws are not enforced, legal experts say, can be as vital to the legal system’s effectiveness as enforcing them. Take criminal law, for instance. One might imagine that this is an area where uniform enforcement is particularly important: Society has an interest in preserving public safety and seeing justice done. That is why criminal cases are brought on behalf of the state. But in fact, statutes of limitations mean that most crimes can’t be prosecuted at all after a certain amount of time has passed, usually no more than a few years. The principle is so strong that only a small number of very serious crimes can be prosecuted indefinitely. "
"BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is getting even larger. The company said Wednesday that it had taken in $264 billion in new funds so far this year, bringing its total assets under management to a staggering $5.9 trillion. BlackRock is the beneficiary of a global rush by investors to place their money in so-called passive investments, rather than the traditional actively managed mutual funds. The influx of money — along with soaring financial markets — helped boost Blackrock’s profits for the third quarter, which were up 13 percent. Of the $96 billion in new money that BlackRock brought in during the third quarter, most of it, $52 billion, came into its exchange-traded funds business, which operates under the brand iShares. BlackRock, along with its chief competitor, Vanguard, has been at the forefront of the recent boom in passive investing, cashing in on investor frustration with mutual funds, which charge higher fees and, of late, have not performed on par with stock market indexes. Together, these two investment giants now oversee more than $10 trillion in assets. Exchange-traded funds track all the broad stock and bond market indexes as well as a wide range of investment strategies, some of which are designed to replicate the approaches of portfolio managers picking value or growth stocks. BlackRock now oversees $1.6 trillion in E.T.F.s, by far the most in the industry, and its leadership has made it clear that these types of investment funds represent the future for BlackRock. And the results this quarter reveal why: funds with active strategies took in $5.7 billion while passive offerings attracted $70 billion. "
"“Mr. Robot” debuted in 2015 as a captivating and uncanny reflection of not just our fractious times — all those eerie parallels with real-world events — but also of the isolating effects of technology billed and sold as a means of connection. The story was to our world as Mr. Robot was to Elliot: A darker, (somewhat) angrier version, with a mysterious agenda born of deep pain. Then it folded inside itself in Season 2, testing viewers’ patience as it burrowed into Elliot’s inner struggle to reconcile his splintered selves. (Unsuccessfully, as it turned out.) His overlong prison interlude and the trials of Angela and Darlene nicely broadened what had been a narrowly focused story about a troubled hacker, but they also raised a question: Could “Mr. Robot” get far enough out of its own head to recapture some of the fun that made its first season so intoxicating? Based on Wednesday’s Season 3 premiere, the answer seems to be a qualified yes. I say “yes” because Bobby Cannavale’s mustache, alone, was more delightful than anything in Season 2 — which I liked, for the record — aside from the sitcom segment and perhaps Elliott’s Adderall montage. I say “qualified” because the show seems to be venturing into metaphysical realms that could undermine the techno-political urgency that makes it feel so essential. [Interview: Sam Esmail Discusses Season 3] We’ll get to that in a minute, but first back to the mustache. We opened on Mr. Cannavale as Irving, a used-car salesman and all-purpose Dark Army fixer who cleaned up Tyrell Wellick’s shooting of Elliott, settling, it seems, any lingering mystery over whether Wellick is a figment of Elliot’s damaged psyche. In a measure of how much this show messes with you, I briefly wondered if Irving, too, was somehow an Elliott projection. But it seems clear that he exists in the world, as does Wellick. More surprising: So does Mr. Robot, in a way. In Season 2, Elliot seemed to reach an understanding with Mr. Robot, only to be shot for trying to defy him in the finale. In the new season, the show seems to have synthesized the two sides of its personality more successfully than Elliot has, externalizing his existential struggle and placing Mr. Robot, as roguishly portrayed by Christian Slater, directly into the global disruption narrative. Elliot heroically dons the hoodie and descends, via a 4-plus minute Steadicam shot, into the frenetic hacker Olympics in order to close the backdoor that would enable the Stage 2 destruction of Evil Corp’s hard copy archives. Then later Mr. Robot meets back up with Wellick to seemingly devise a workaround. Which is to say, last season’s lackluster chess match has expanded into Elliott aiming to outmaneuver himself on a broader scale, with many lives and the fate of civilization in the balance. "
"BRUSSELS — Anxious about political trends in Germany that are sowing divisions with the United States under President Trump, foreign-policy experts have warned the incoming German government that the trans-Atlantic relationship must be preserved at all costs. In a manifesto titled “In Spite of It All, America,” the German signatories said: “The liberal world order, with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets, is in danger” from the Trump administration because of its “America First” credo. But, the manifesto says, “It is exactly this order on which Germany’s freedom and prosperity depends.” “If Germany wants to be an effective actor in Europe,” the paper says, “it needs the United States.” The document, to be published in Thursday’s edition of the weekly Die Zeit newspaper, suggests that the government should concentrate on the fundamentals of the trans-Atlantic relationship with the United States, like security, and avoid more contentious issues like trade and migration. The manifesto warning against budding anti-Americanism is aimed at the German political parties negotiating with Chancellor Angela Merkel to form a new government, and also at the Social Democratic Party, now in the opposition, which has criticized Mr. Trump. “The message is designed to hit at those who think that Trump has finally shown the real nature of America, and that it’s time for the Germans and French to free themselves from trans-Atlanticism,” said Jan Techau, who is one of the signatories, director of the Richard C. Holbrooke Forum at Berlin’s American Academy and a former head of Carnegie Europe. "
"Read the Article: “German Foreign Policy Experts Warn Against Anti-Americanism” The following is an English translation of the manifesto “In Spite of It All, America: A Trans-Atlantic Manifesto in Times of Donald Trump — a German Perspective,” written by a group of foreign-policy experts on German-American relations, that was to be published in Thursday’s edition of the weekly Die Zeit newspaper. The New York Times was provided a draft advance copy. 1. International Order — the new German-American conflict of interests One of the new German government’s premier challenges will be to manage the trans-Atlantic relationship during Donald Trump’s presidency. Its success in this endeavor will be one way to measure its overall performance. We, a group of foreign policy experts from civil society, would like to offer some ideas. The liberal world order with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets — is in danger. It is exactly this order on which Germany’s freedom and prosperity depends. The order is being challenged from various directions and sources: rising powers strive for influence; illiberal governments and authoritarian regimes are ascending; anti-modern thinking is gaining traction and influence even within Western democracies; Russia is challenging the peaceful European order; and new technologies are disrupting old economic structures. Lastly, the United States, inventor and — until recently — guardian of the liberal order, currently does not see itself as system guarantor. Donald Trump is the first U.S. president since World War II to fundamentally question the ideas and institutions of the liberal international order. He opposes this order by advocating a system of raw power and national interest. In his alternative system, small and medium sized countries play a role as dependent and secondary actors. Donald Trump is skeptical of any and all of the United States’ commitments to multilateral institutions and norms. With its preference for stable treaty-based alliances and long term, multilateral commitments, Germany sees the current international order as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. For Germany, Donald Trump’s foreign policy creates a previously unknown conflict of interest with its most important ally. Since Germany’s as well as Europe’s security and affluence rest upon the current international order even as President Trump charts a different course for the United States, an increased responsibility falls to the European Union and its member state Germany to safeguard and strengthen the international order.

"WASHINGTON — Ehud Barak, the former Israeli leader known for his hawkish views on Iran, said it would be a “mistake” for President Trump to decertify the Iran nuclear deal, both because it would play to Iran’s advantage and because it would scuttle any hope of a negotiation with North Korea. Mr. Barak, a decorated soldier who was prime minister and defense minister, is the latest and most prominent Israeli to urge Mr. Trump not to disavow the deal — a step the president is expected to take when he announces his broader strategy for dealing with Iran later this week. “Even if America decides to pull out of it,” Mr. Barak said in an interview on Tuesday, “no one will join — not the Chinese, not the Russians, not even the Europeans. It will serve the Iranians.” Iran, he pointed out, is complying with the terms of the agreement. It will “continue to harvest” the economic benefits of the deal. But if Mr. Trump disavowed it, that would give the Iranians a pretext for resuming their drive toward a nuclear “breakout” capability, particularly in the latter years of the agreement, when the economic benefits are outweighed by Iran’s desire to join the club of nuclear states. The lessons of a broken deal will not be lost on North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Barak said. “They will say it makes no sense negotiating with the Americans if they can pull out of a deal that has been signed, unilaterally, after a relatively short time.” An unconstrained North Korea could impel Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons, he said. In the Middle East, Iran’s renewed drive for a bomb would pressure neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey to do likewise. "
"Of all of the dismaying and disgusting details of the Harvey Weinstein saga, none is more depressing than this: It has so few heroes. There is a storybook villain, Mr. Weinstein, whose repulsive face turns out to be the spitting image of his putrescent soul. There are victims, so many of them, typically up-and-comers in an industry where he had the power to make or wreck their careers, or bully or buy their silence, or, if some allegations are to be believed, rape them. But mostly there are enablers, both those who facilitated his predations and those who found it expedient to look the other way. The enablers were of all sorts. Corporate board members who declined to investigate allegations of his sexual behavior and now claim the news comes as “an utter surprise.” Assistants who acted as “honeypots,” joining meetings between Mr. Weinstein and his intended victims to give them a sense of security — and then leaving the predator to his prey. Reporters who paid him tribute with awards, did his bidding with fawning coverage, or went after his enemies with hit pieces. A lavishly paid Italian studio executive whose real job, according to former Times reporter Sharon Waxman, was “to take care of Weinstein’s women needs.” (A lawyer for the executive reportedly denies the allegation.) And then there was the rest of Hollywood. Mr. Weinstein’s depredations were an open film industry secret, the subject of an onstage joke by Seth MacFarlane at the 2013 Oscar nomination announcement. Everyone laughed because everyone got it. Some of his victims, such as Gwyneth Paltrow, became Hollywood powers in their own right but never publicly rang an alarm until this week. The actor Ben Affleck, who owes his start to Mr. Weinstein, is an overnight laughingstock because he acts surprised by the producer’s behavior. He won’t be the only celebrity doing his best Claude Rains “shocked, shocked” impression. Even some of the ostensibly good guys in this saga cannot be let off lightly. In The New Yorker, Ronan Farrow reports that Irwin Reiter, a top Weinstein Company executive, sought to console one of the office assistants harassed by Mr. Weinstein by saying the “mistreatment of women” was a longstanding company issue and that “if you were my daughter he would not have made out so well.” But Reiter never went public. "
"The broad debate over President Trump’s fitness for the difficult and demanding office he holds has recently been reframed in a more pointed and urgent way: Does he understand, and can he responsibly manage, the most destructive nuclear arsenal on earth? The question arises for several reasons. He has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. He has reportedly pressed for a massive buildup in the American nuclear arsenal, which already contains too many — 4,000 — warheads. And soon he will decide whether to sustain or set a course to possibly unravel the immensely important Iran nuclear deal. Doubts about his competency were reinforced this week by Senator Bob Corker, who charged that Mr. Trump was treating his office like “a reality show” with reckless threats that could set the nation “on the path to World War III.” Mr. Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, says he is relying on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to help “separate our country from chaos.” That is a searing indictment, and Mr. Corker is no garden-variety legislator; as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is a respected, and largely responsible, voice on national security issues. Further, NBC News now reports that Mr. Tillerson judged Mr. Trump a “moron” after a July 20 meeting in which Mr. Trump, apparently distressed that the arsenal has declined since the Cold War, said he wanted a nearly tenfold increase in weapons. Mr. Trump’s policy pronouncements during the campaign betrayed either profound ignorance or dangerous nonchalance: At one point he wondered why America had nuclear weapons if it didn’t use them; at another he suggested that Japan and South Korea, which have long lived under the American security umbrella, should develop their own nuclear weapons. But nothing he said has been quite as unsettling as his recent tweetstorms about North Korea, his warnings of “fire and fury” and his quip about “the calm before the storm.” Many have hoped, and still hope, that Mr. Trump’s aggressive posture is mostly theater, designed to slake his thirst for attention, keep adversaries off guard and force changes in their behavior by words alone. But there is no underlying strategy to his loose talk, and whatever he means by it, Congress has been sufficiently alarmed to consider legislation that would bar the president from launching a first nuclear strike without a declaration of war by Congress. It wouldn’t take away the president’s ability to defend the country. That’s a sound idea, and could be made stronger with a requirement that the secretaries of defense and state also approve any such decision. As things stand now, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, passed when there was more concern about trigger-happy generals than elected civilian leaders, gives the president sole control. He could unleash the apocalyptic force of the American nuclear arsenal by his word alone, and within minutes. "
"HARRISBURG, Pa. — President Trump took his campaign for tax cuts to another key battleground state on Wednesday in search of elusive Democratic votes as he argued that his plan would benefit middle-class Americans, like truck drivers, more than it would help his fellow business tycoons. At a rally in an airport hangar reminiscent of his fiery events during last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump told hundreds of truckers that slashing rates would produce more hauling contracts and put more money in their pockets. Uncertain that he can count on a fragile Republican majority during a critical Senate vote next week, he sought to pressure Pennsylvania’s Democratic senator to support the plan. “We’re going to fight, and we’re going to get those Republicans and maybe of few of those Democrats to raise their hand,” Mr. Trump told the cheering crowd. “And you’re going to have so much money to spend in this wonderful country and this great economy. That is why we have proposed tax cuts that are pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and pro-American.” But if he hoped to turn Senator Bob Casey, the Democrat, Mr. Trump made little traction. In a statement, Mr. Casey called the president’s plan “a massive tax giveaway” to the richest Americans at the expense of the middle class. “It’s time for the administration and Congress to stop advocating for this scheme to cut taxes for the superrich and focus on raising wages and creating good-paying jobs for our families in Pennsylvania,” Mr. Casey said. The short trip to the Pennsylvania state capital underscored the complicated politics of the tax fight for the president. The 52-vote Republican majority may not be enough next week to secure a budget measure needed for the tax cuts, given that some of that party’s senators are balking or on the fence. Mr. Trump has been hunting for Democrats without any certain converts. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump is coming under mounting pressure from European allies and fellow Republicans to preserve the Iran nuclear deal. With the president widely expected to disavow the agreement when he outlines his Iran strategy on Friday, defenders and even erstwhile opponents of the deal are urging him not to unravel it completely. Mr. Trump’s top national security aides are united behind a plan to decertify the deal, but leave it in place, with a goal of revising its terms. But in pursuing that course, the president will set off a volatile sequence of events that some warn could end up mortally wounding the agreement. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers will have to decide whether to reimpose punitive sanctions on Tehran, a move that would almost certainly scuttle the 2015 deal that was brokered by world powers. In European capitals, allies are showing signs of resisting pressure to join the United States in trying to renegotiate its terms. “While the Trump administration is making a very fine distinction between a decertification that is a report to Congress rather than leaving the deal, I’m concerned that that distinction will be lost on our allies and adversaries,” said Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain called Mr. Trump on Tuesday to urge him to uphold the deal, adding that it should be “carefully monitored and properly enforced,” according to a spokesman for 10 Downing Street. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, reinforced that message in a call to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The White House’s overarching Iran policy is predicated on de-emphasizing the nuclear deal in favor of confronting Tehran on other issues, including its missile program and its support for extremist groups throughout the Middle East. Yet Mr. Trump’s longstanding contempt for the nuclear accord — he has labeled it a “disaster” and the “worst deal ever” — has kept it center stage. "
"Eminem is far from the first rapper to trash the current American president. The most explicit attack came in August from the California rapper YG. His song “FDT” — the title is an abbreviation whose meaning can’t be spelled out in a family newspaper — calls President Trump a “cancer” and insists: “He can’t make decisions for this country, he gon’ crash us/No, we can’t be a slave for him.” Kendrick Lamar took aim at the president in March in “The Heart Part 4,” with the lyrics: And the young rapper Aminé used his television debut on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon” back in November to deliver these lines: “9/11, a day that we never forgettin’/11/9, a day that we always regrettin’.” Then there are scores of implicitly anti-Trump songs that take on issues like police brutality and economic inequality, like Chance the Rapper’s latest, which he performed late last month on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”: “And y’all just keep clappin’ and keep happen/Like Flint got clean water and y’all don’t got teen daughters and black friends and gay cousins, y’all just gon’ say nothin’.” Yet Eminem’s “The Storm,” a scathing four-minute attack on the “kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust,” which he debuted at the BET Awards on Tuesday night, has already overshadowed all of these previous anti-Trump musical efforts. It’s made major news headlines. It’s already garnered 8.7 million views on YouTube. And there have been some two million tweets about the performance, with praise pouring in from stars including LeBron James and Ellen DeGeneres. What gives? Some see the overwhelming reaction to the rap as evidence of racism — that Eminem’s song is generating such overwhelming attention because he’s white. There’s no denying that the key difference between the rappers mentioned above and Eminem isn’t that he’s the only one from Detroit. "
"After 24 years in operation, Tent City, an outdoor Arizona jail that served as an emblem of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s “tough on crime” stance, has been closed. The final 370 or so inmates were transferred to another detention facility, and the area was officially shut down on Saturday. The relocation of the inmates had been underway since May. The closing, a cornerstone of the new Maricopa County sheriff’s agenda, further unravels the legacy of Mr. Arpaio, who was convicted in July of ignoring an order to stop racially profiling Latinos, and then pardoned by President Trump in August. Mr. Arpaio, a hard-liner on illegal immigration, said on Wednesday that he was proud of what he had accomplished with Tent City, which he once described as a “concentration camp.” “It’s been a great program, a great deterrent,” he said. “Had over half a million people come through the tents. All convicted, doing their time.” “To this day, people approach me and thank me — parents about their kids having to go to the tents and they straighten out,” he went on. Tent City, which was outfitted with dozens of Korean War tents, was a spectacle that attracted much national attention for Mr. Arpaio’s tactics: Most inmates were issued pink underwear to wear underneath their jumpsuits, pornographic magazines were banned and cooking shows were broadcast in the cafeteria while the inmates ate two meatless meals a day. Inmates also endured extremely hot conditions, something human rights groups criticized as cruel. "

"When Ronan Farrow made a guest appearance on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” on Tuesday night, he tried to make it clear that he was the reporter, not the story. “We are there in service of women doing something really tough,” Mr. Farrow told the host, “and I hope people hear their voices and focus on that.” The next day, however, the media and entertainment industries were still discussing how and why Mr. Farrow’s story on allegations of sexual abuse levied against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein by numerous women had ended up being published by The New Yorker — after it began as an investigative report for NBC News. Mr. Farrow, formerly a contributing correspondent for NBC News, told Ms. Maddow he had taken his investigation to The New Yorker only after the network dragged its feet. But Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, disputed the suggestion that the network’s news division had lacked the courage to air Mr. Farrow’s exposé. “We supported him and gave him resources to report that story over many, many months,” Mr. Oppenheim said during an annual meeting with NBC News staff members on Wednesday at Studio 8H, the home of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” “The notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us.” Mr. Farrow’s 8,000-word article concerned 13 women, several of whom went on the record to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault and rape. The story, published on Tuesday, went online days after the publication of the first of two investigative articles by The New York Times on Mr. Weinstein, who was fired from the Weinstein Company on Sunday.

"NAZARETH, V.I. — The day after Hurricane Maria finally subsided, I looked up at the ceiling and exhaled. “Thank you,” I whispered, relieved to still be alive. Hurricane Maria’s winds were just as terrifying as Hurricane Irma’s two weeks before, but when the storm hit around Sept. 19, it made me imagine the devil. My family huddled inside a downstairs bedroom of our two-story home, and it felt like the pitchforked monster had opened hell’s gates, freeing his demons to try to tear down the door and devour us. The idea wasn’t far-fetched. A former classmate of mine who lived in Tutu High Rise, one of St. Thomas’s largest public housing developments but now a hollow shell, had been sucked out of her window and smashed to death by Hurricane Irma. At one point as the storm shrieked, I wondered if the world was ending and we, in America’s sole majority-black territory, were going to have the misfortune of being the first to go. “When will it end? I wish it would just stop,” my sister Grace said, pleading for the divine intervention my mother, a devout Christian, also sought. “Father, don’t let us die like this!” my mother prayed, raising her fist toward the window.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump, after failing  to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress, will act on his own to relax health care standards on small businesses that band together to buy health insurance and may take steps to allow the sale of other health plans that skirt the health law’s requirements. The president plans to sign an executive order “to promote health care choice and competition” on Thursday at a White House event attended by small-business owners and others. Although Mr. Trump has been telegraphing his intentions for more than a week, Democrats and some state regulators are now greeting the move with increasing alarm, calling it another attempt to undermine President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. They warn that by relaxing standards for so-called association health plans, Mr. Trump would create low-cost insurance options for the healthy, driving up costs for the sick and destabilizing insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act. “It would have a very negative impact on the markets,” said Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner in Washington State. “Our state is a poster child of what can go wrong. Association health plans often shun the bad risks and stay with the good risks.” They also worry that the Trump administration intends to loosen restrictions on short-term health insurance plans that do not satisfy requirements of the Affordable Care Act.

"WASHINGTON — Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday that they planned to make public the thousands of Facebook ads linked to Russia that appeared during the 2016 presidential election campaign, the first indication that the ads would be released. The lawmakers told reporters about their plans after an afternoon meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. They said the 3,000 ads would probably be released after a Nov. 1 hearing on the role of social media platforms in Russia’s interference in the election. That hearing, and a similar one that the Senate Intelligence Committee plans to hold with Facebook, Google and Twitter, will place Silicon Valley’s top companies under a harsh spotlight as the public perception of the giants shifts in Washington. Ms. Sandberg sat down with Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leader of the House investigation, and Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, at the start of two full days of meetings with federal officials. The meetings are a part of the company’s lobbying and public relations push to contain fallout from disclosures that a group linked to Russia bought more than $100,000 in ads on divisive issues on Facebook. Lawmakers and public interest groups have called for the release of the ads, which Facebook shared with Congress last month, to understand what kind of material foreign buyers placed in front of Facebook users. But Facebook has said it had no plans to release the ads. Ms. Sandberg also agreed to hand over additional Facebook content unrelated to ads, such as fake news and inflammatory posts on pages to organize rallies, that the Russian-linked actors appeared to use to sow discord, Mr. Schiff said. “They will provide that information in the near future, and that will be important to look at,” he said in a separate interview. Mr. Schiff and Mr. Conaway said Ms. Sandberg appeared to understand the gravity of the political pressure surrounding Facebook. “I think they certainly realize the intense interest in what the Russians did on their platform, the responsibility they have on their own to ferret this material out,” Mr. Schiff said to reporters after the meeting. Before the ads can be released to the public, he said, they need to be scrubbed of any personally identifiable information. He said lawmakers had asked Facebook for help in that process. “It’s our hope that when they conclude, then we can release them publicly,” Mr. Schiff said. Later in the day, Ms. Sandberg met with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. On Thursday, Ms. Sandberg will take the stage with the media outlet Axios for a 30-minute interview about Facebook’s handling of the Russia inquiry. Then she will meet with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who are concerned that racist and anti-immigrant messages spread on the site were amplified by the platform’s technology and fake accounts.

"WASHINGTON — For Republicans trying to rally their base, no political villain has been more effective than Representative Nancy Pelosi, the longtime Democratic leader. In campaign after campaign, they made her the symbol of the Washington they claimed to be running against. Now a renegade group of anti-establishment Republicans is adapting that model and turning it against their own party. They are replacing Ms. Pelosi with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. “He is an anvil,” said L. Brent Bozell III, a longtime conservative activist who on Wednesday joined a group of a half-dozen activists from the right demanding that Mr. McConnell and his leadership team step down. “Not with Democrats,” he said, “but with his own party. This is the trouble that he’s in.” Mr. McConnell was an ever-present boogeyman in the recent primary campaign in Alabama between Senator Luther Strange, a McConnell ally, and Roy Moore, the deeply conservative former state Supreme Court judge who ran on a caustically anti-leadership message. Mr. Moore won in an upset, despite being attacked with millions of dollars from groups loyal to Mr. McConnell as a zealot who was removed twice from the bench for refusing to obey orders from higher courts. A faction of conservative activists, including President Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, now hopes to replicate that kind of grassroots-fueled victory across the country. But their targets are not where the rest of the Republican Party is aiming — states with Democratic senators that Mr. Trump won where there are large pockets of conservative voters — but in seven states where Republicans already hold a Senate seat. Many Republicans consider this strategy suicidal. “This is the reason that Republicans didn’t regain the majority in 2010 and 2012,” said Josh Holmes, a former aide to Mr. McConnell who is president of Cavalry Strategies in Washington. “You had this for-profit, quote, unquote conservative crowd who found it much more entrepreneurial to challenge from within than to fight back against Democrats. And ultimately what happened in those two cycles is that Democrats won. Republicans exhausted their resources.” "

"Not such a long time ago, in this very galaxy, civil rights protesters were lectured about finding the “right time and place” for their demonstrations. It’s all well and good to express your opinion, they were told, but in-your-face street protests are disruptive and can harden opposition. Or, as The Huntsville Times in Alabama put it, “the path to equal rights” is “down the road of moderation, mutual respect and minimal resort to mass perturbation.” In another editorial, it said “racial troubles” should be taken “off the streets and into the courts.” That was 1965, after Sheriff Jim Clark’s uniformed thugs whipped, beat and gassed civil rights marchers in Selma. Two years later, when Martin Luther King announced his opposition to the war in Vietnam, The New York Times editorial page lectured him about getting back to his place as a civil-rights leader. He should, The Times said, “direct the movement’s efforts in the most constructive and relevant way.” Now comes the National Football League, dropping its pretense of supporting the broad aims of athletes who kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and joining the chorus — led by President Trump — that they should find more respectful ways of voicing their anger. In a masterpiece of euphemism, Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, said the league’s leaders “care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues.” "
"PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago — For Joey Richardson, a 61-year-old retired civil servant known as Porche, watching his beloved men’s soccer team crush the United States was like watching David slaying Goliath.

Trinidad and Tobago, a twin-island nation in the southern Caribbean, was abuzz on Wednesday with one of the strangest upsets in recent World Cup history: The previous night, it defeated the United States in a 2-1 qualifier game, which, along with simultaneous matches in Panama and Honduras, meant the Americans failed to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1986. Compounding the oddness of it all was the Trinidad team really had nothing to play for. Its losing streak had been so bad that it had already lost any chance of going to Russia for the World Cup next year — leaving Mr. Richardson one of the few fans in the bleachers last night in a nation largely uninterested in the game. Until now. The winning goals have been on continual repeat across television screens, and the victory blazed in huge headlines across newspapers; it is all anyone wants to talk about on the streets of the capital, Port of Spain. “T&T Puts a Licking on the U.S.,” declared The Daily Express, a local newspaper, referring to both countries by their initials. And then there were the memes, mostly mocking President Trump. In one, he throws paper towels over the waterlogged field to his team on the other side. Another takes the form of a fake tweet from the president’s account: “But why do we have to play against 2 teams, Trinidad AND Tobago??? Not fair.” "
"“Dynasty” is back on television. “Blade Runner” is in theaters. And all your favorite synth pop bands from the 1980s, including Depeche Mode and New Order, have new albums.   As Generation X moves into wistful middle age, the new-wave hit makers of the MTV V.J. era are back and touring. Here are some new long-playing discs (also available for streaming!) that recall a time when all it took was an angular haircut and a Yamaha DX7 to rule the world. New release: “The Punishment of Luxury,” released Sept. 1, is the band’s 13th album (and its third since reforming in 2006). The 12-track album remains true to the band’s signature robo-pop sound and offers a rumination and indictment on have-it-all consumerism. Synth Classics: “Enola Gay” (1980); “So In Love” (1985) "
"Saudi women are gaining the right to drive. American women are losing the right to employer-provided birth control. The first development signifies a theocratic kingdom’s bow to the inexorable onslaught of modernity. The second is a cynical bow to the forces of reaction against modernity. It would be too far a stretch to see in Saudi Arabia even the glimmer of the emergence of civil society. But it’s not much of a stretch to see in the rules issued by the Trump administration last week the fraying of civil society as the United States has known it. Ours is a diverse society in which all are expected, with limited and precisely defined exceptions, to abide by the rules that apply to all. The alternative, as Justice Antonin Scalia observed decades ago, “would be courting anarchy.” The new rules, which went into immediate effect, create exceptions that are anything but limited. They are, in fact, there for the taking. Any “entities” that claim not only religious but also “moral” objections to birth control are entitled to refuse to comply with the federal contraception mandate that until last Friday was enabling 55 million women to receive birth control without charge as part of their work- or college-related health insurance coverage. Which entities? The list is on page 161 of the administration’s 163-page announcement of its “interim final rule” on religious objections (a separate document applies to the moral objectors, a completely new concept in this five-year-old controversy). The list of religious objectors includes churches and religious orders (which from the beginning have been completely exempt from the mandate anyway); nonprofit organizations; a “closely held for-profit entity;” a “for-profit entity that is not closely held” (including publicly traded companies); and “any other nongovernmental employer” along with institutions of higher education.

"To the Editor: Re “E.P.A. Announces Bid to Roll Back Emissions Policy” (front page, Oct. 10): The cheers of the Hazard, Ky., crowd listening to Scott Pruitt’s jettisoning of the Clean Power Plan struck me as a validation of behavioral economics, which explores how humans often make irrational economic decisions. Richard Thaler may have just won a Nobel Prize for exploring this phenomenon, but Mr. Pruitt and his ilk have made a career out of exploiting it. They use emotional language such as “winners and losers” and “war on coal” to obscure what’s really going on, which is the coal industry extracting as much labor from people and coal from the environment as possible, leaving both the poorer for it. The challenge is to put the principles of behavioral economics to work to ramp up the public support for policies boosting clean power, not coal. It is now up to governors — like Andrew Cuomo in New York, Jerry Brown in California and John Hickenlooper in Colorado — to lead the nation on that path. ELIZABETH POREBA, NEW YORK To the Editor: Scott Pruitt proclaimed the end of the “war on coal” on Monday. “No better place to make that announcement than Hazard, Ky.,” he added unironically. VIVIAN DONALDSON
SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. To the Editor: Do Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt even realize that they are ceding leadership in the development of cleaner energy to China, now proceeding full speed with the deployment of solar panels and the development of hybrid and battery-driven cars? In a few years, the United States government will lament the dominance of China’s green technology, perfected on its own home turf. In the meantime, American industries will have less incentive to innovate. BEN MYERS, HARVARD, MASS. "
"Maureen Dowd: The Washington Post does not deserve all the credit for the Pentagon Papers. Tom Hanks: True. Confirm. And when you see our movie, The New York Times gets all of its due. There is nothing better in this world than being Tom Hanks. Ah, no. Deny. There’s better things. David S. Pumpkins is your greatest work. Confirm! Any questions? Typewriters are making a comeback. I’m going to confirm that. And I’ll tell you why: because you will not lose your data and no one can hack your typewriter. Seeing typewriters as chic hotel décor is annoying. That actually pisses me off. Every time “You’ve Got Mail” is on cable TV, you stop to watch it. No. Deny. Dave Chappelle’s best work was in “You’ve Got Mail.” I’m going to have to deny that because I’ve seen his work since. But that was Nora to a T. She was always ahead of the curve. You know who was a reference in “Sleepless in Seattle”? Seinfeld’s Soup Nazi! There’s a scene with Meg and Rosie, where Meg says about him, “he’s the meanest guy in the world, but he makes the best soup you’ve ever eaten.” You want to run for president. Deny. Because I wouldn’t want to answer the phone calls. I’m not trying to be flip. What would I have to offer other than I can make a speech every now and again? I mean, Clooney’s a guy to run.

He has no curiosity about history. So that’s the scariest thing. You love little Polish cars called Maluchs. Oh, the Fiats! Yeah, well, I love any goofy Communist car.

"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — In 2006, when Tom Hanks wanted to get a story published, he sent it to his friend and sometime director Nora Ephron. Having had my own writing critiqued by her, I know just how daunting that could be. “Oh, petrifying, horrifying, yes, yeah,” Mr. Hanks said, grimacing. The piece was a sweet paean to his makeup man Danny Striepeke, then 75 years old and retiring, a 50-year Hollywood veteran who had started by giving Elvis Presley his tan in “Viva Las Vegas” and Laurence Olivier his Roman nose in “Spartacus” and ended by turning Mr. Hanks into a policeman, an astronaut, an Army Ranger, an F.B.I. agent, a Master of the Universe, a Slavic tourist stuck in an airport, Santa Claus and a Harvard professor of symbology. Hanks sent Ms. Ephron the piece — she got mail! — and asked, “Is this a thing?” “And she said, ‘Yes, it is a thing. Send it to The New York Times. I’ll make some calls for you. It shouldn’t be in the Sunday Styles section but maybe in the Thursday Styles section,”’ Mr. Hanks recalls. And after many rewrites and lots of no-mercy Nora editing, like “What does this mean?” and “This is not good” and “Voice, voice, voice” and “Tell people what you’re going to tell them, and then tell them, and then tell them what you just told them,” it was finally published in Thursday Styles. I hesitate, wondering if now is the moment to break the news to Mr. Hanks: He has spent a decade honing his writing and, despite all the other acting and directing and producing he does, and despite being, as the historian Douglas Brinkley calls him, “American history’s highest-profile professor,” he has managed to squeeze in a book of fictional short stories called “Uncommon Type.” And yet he’s still going to be in Thursday Styles. And not only that. I will have to ask him about The Times’s first bombshell report about Harvey Weinstein, just published, and Hollywood’s guilty silence on the incendiary subject. What does Mr. Nice have to say about Mr. Sleazy? "
"Nearly a year after Election Day, Facebook’s role in our modern political infrastructure is finally coming into focus. We now know, for example, that Russian-linked Facebook ads reached roughly 10 million Americans during the presidential election season, and that Russian government actors posed as Americans on Facebook to push divisive social issues like gun control, gay rights and the Black Lives Matter movement. We also know, thanks to a recent interview with Brad Parscale, President Trump’s digital campaign director, that the Trump campaign considered Facebook’s advertising microtargeting tools essential to its victory. But there is much more to know. Facebook has addressed some election-related questions, and may share more next month when its executives testify in front of the House and Senate intelligence committees. These investigations may focus solely on Russian interference, but they could also produce valuable information about how Facebook operates as a company, how it views its role on the political stage, and how it plans to safeguard its platform from malicious activity in the future. The conversation about Facebook would benefit from more facts, and less speculation. So this week, I sent a list of some of my unanswered questions to Facebook. Two representatives — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, and Joe Osborne, a company spokesman — responded to several questions in some detail. The company declined to answer several other questions, but I include those here as well, in hopes that they might one day be answered. Below are my questions, followed by Facebook’s responses, where applicable. 1.
In an April 2017 white paper, your security team disclosed an incident during the 2016 election in which “malicious actors” were discovered to be using fake Facebook accounts to promote links to stolen information. The paper did not name the actors, but it was later revealed that this referred to a coordinated campaign to promote emails that were stolen from Democratic National Committee officials by Russian hackers and published by WikiLeaks. It has also been reported that Facebook’s legal and policy teams pressured the security team to exclude any mentions of Russia from their report. Why did they want to keep this information from becoming public? Alex Stamos, chief security officer, Facebook: In our April white paper, “Information Operations and Facebook,” we described the activity that we detected from a sophisticated threat actor that was spreading stolen information about specific political targets in the run-up to the U.S. election and using it to feed press stories that they could then amplify. We took steps to disrupt this activity and reported details to the relevant authorities. "
"A group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday that would compel top federal officials, including President Trump, to disclose how changes to regulations might benefit them financially. The bill comes after a recent investigation by The New York Times and ProPublica showed that some appointees to the Trump administration’s deregulation teams had close industry connections and could be reviewing rules that their previous employers had tried to weaken or eliminate. Mr. Trump established the teams at major federal agencies as part of his effort to roll back regulations, presenting industries with a new avenue for bucking rules they have long argued were hurting profits, depressing job creation and raising prices. In addition to the president and members of deregulation teams, the legislation would require disclosures by senior White House advisers, including those who do not receive a government salary, and agency chiefs. The bill’s author, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, was among a group of Democratic lawmakers who demanded in an August letter to the White House that the Trump administration disclose the names deregulation team members and documents related to their potential conflicts of interest. The administration did not respond to the letter. Other sponsors of the bill include Representatives John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon. The bill does not have Republican sponsors, which suggests it is unlikely to be approved. Agencies have been opaque about the deregulation teams. A full vetting of their industry ties has been difficult to conduct because some agencies have declined to provide information about team members, including, in some instances, their names. The teams include former employees of industry-financed organizations that oppose environmental regulations, lawyers who have represented companies in cases against federal regulators and staff members of so-called political dark money groups. In all, The Times and ProPublica identified 85 known current and former team members, including 34 with potential conflicts. Several federal agencies have not yet released the names of people serving on deregulation task forces. We need your help finding them and figuring out what they’re doing. Got a tip?

"A few years ago, Robert Plant found himself suddenly overcome with an urge to return to his roots. “I know I’m emphatically British,” he said. “But I didn’t realize how much that was true until I’d been away for a while.” He had been living in Austin, Tex., with his girlfriend at the time, the singer-songwriter Patty Griffin, who was also his bandmate on his 2010 album and tour, “Band of Joy.” And, for a time, he relished the opportunity to absorb American life and culture. “The hospitality and friendships and initiation into Americana — not just music — was marvelous,” he said. The process began several years earlier, when he teamed with the bluegrass great Alison Kraus for the Nashville-recorded 2007 album “Raising Sand,” probably the most acclaimed and successful project of his post-Led Zeppelin career. (He last played with his old band 10 years ago this December, during a one-off gig at the O2 arena in London that made headlines around the world.) The pair won an album of the year Grammy, and the LP went platinum; along the way, he discovered an entire world of Appalachian music and the joys of vocal harmonies, which were never a big part of his musical repertoire. “It was one of the most rewarding, classic periods of my life,” he said. “And it was just such a” — he paused to search for the right word — “tear to leave America and return to Britain.” Mr. Plant was calling from the lobby of the Frome Memorial Theater in Somerset, England, which was built just after the First World War and is within easy driving distance of his house in Shropshire, near the Welsh border. Since returning from the United States, he has lived, as he put it, “only eight miles from where I learned how to speak French and do geometry.” Affable and chatty, he cheerfully recounted tales from his past lives: as the golden-maned, howling frontman of Led Zeppelin; in partnership with the Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page as Page and Plant; a foray into ’80s synth-rock; and the rootsy solo path he has forged over the last two decades.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he intended to name Kirstjen Nielsen, a top White House aide, to lead the Department of Homeland Security, elevating a former homeland security official in the George W. Bush administration who has lately worked to impose order in Mr. Trump’s chaotic West Wing. Mr. Trump announced his choice in a statement that noted Ms. Nielsen’s “extensive professional experience in the areas of homeland security policy and strategy, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure and emergency management.” She is the first nominee for the homeland security post who had served in the department, according to the statement. If confirmed, Ms. Nielsen would replace John F. Kelly, who was homeland security secretary until he left in July to serve as the White House chief of staff and bring discipline and direction to a West Wing plagued by disorganization and infighting. Mr. Kelly had drafted Ms. Nielsen to be his chief of staff at the Homeland Security department, and when the president plucked him for the White House, he brought her as his No. 2. Known as a no-nonsense player and policy wonk, Ms. Nielsen appears unlikely to land at the center of the type of controversies that have engulfed Mr. Trump’s presidency. But her regimented style in a freewheeling and often dysfunctional West Wing frustrated some senior officials and people close to the president, who chafed under her dictates. On Wednesday, some of them described Ms. Nielsen’s promotion as a solution to a toxic personnel situation, while others fretted privately that her departure would create a void at the White House that would be difficult to fill. Mr. Kelly pushed hard for her selection, making a personal appeal to Mr. Trump during a monthslong search process. Among the other candidates considered, according to people familiar with the process, was Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. Former colleagues said on Wednesday that Ms. Nielsen was well qualified. “She’s a total homeland security expert — absolutely has no learning curve,” said Michael Allen, who worked with Ms. Nielsen during the Bush administration. “She’s an experienced manager, she’s an implementer, she knows how to get under the hood and figure out what needs to be connected to what.” "
"“Mr. Robot” began as a story about a troubled programmer but steadily expanded to encompass underground revolutionaries, global power brokers and a hack that disrupted the entire world. The USA techno-thriller returned for its third season Wednesday night with even broader horizons, as key characters like Whiterose (B. D. Wong) and Angela Moss (Portia Doubleday) seemed to envision alternate universes, while the tormented hero, Elliot (Rami Malek), resumed his baroque existential struggles. The episode found him recuperating from last season’s culminating gunshot and pondering ways to counteract his Mr. Robot alter ego, specifically his world-shattering acts of cyberterrorism. “The big question this season is: Can you put it together after you’ve broken it?” said Sam Esmail, the show’s creator. “Can he reverse what he did? Or is it going to be forever changed, given the set of events he set in motion?” After debuting to near-universal acclaim in 2015, “Mr. Robot” put off some viewers last season with a slower pace and deeper focus on the internal struggles of Elliot and other characters. Season 3 will be “a lot more action packed,” said Mr. Esmail, who again directed every episode (and wrote five of the 10). In a recent phone interview, he discussed why criticisms of Season 2 surprised him, and why the rise of President Trump is the latest real-world event to eerily parallel the universe of “Mr. Robot.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Where do things stand with Elliot heading into Season 3? The internal battle he went through in the second season led to a certain kind of acceptance. In the third season we rip that all apart again, in a very different way. In the same way he is wondering if he can take back the 5/9 hack, he’s also dealing with his dissociative identity disorder and questioning whether he can put that genie back in the bottle. “Mr. Robot” has always been interested in duality in its characters and structures. But this season it seems as if you’re getting into parallel universes. "
"WASHINGTON — The North American Free Trade Agreement, long disparaged by President Trump as bad for the United States, was edging closer toward collapse as negotiators gathered for a fourth round of contentious talks here this week. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has sparred with American businesses that support Nafta and has pushed for significant changes that negotiators from Mexico and Canada say are nonstarters. All the while, the president has continued threatening to withdraw the United States from the trade agreement, which he has maligned as the worst in history. As the trade talks began on Wednesday, Mr. Trump, seated in the Oval Office beside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, said it was “possible” that the United States would drop out of Nafta. “It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” the president said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers. And in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also. So we’ll see what happens with Nafta, but I’ve been opposed to Nafta for a long time, in terms of the fairness of Nafta.” Mr. Trudeau, in comments later at the Canadian Embassy, said he remains optimistic about the potential for a Nafta deal but noted that Canadians must be “ready for anything.” The collapse of the 1994 trade deal would reverberate throughout the global economy, inflicting damage far beyond Mexico, Canada and the United States and affecting industries as varied as manufacturing, agriculture and energy. It would also sow at least short-term chaos for businesses like the auto industry that have arranged their North American supply chains around the deal’s terms. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Wednesday to use the federal government’s power to license television airwaves to target NBC in response to a report by the network’s news division that he contemplated a dramatic increase in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. In a story aired and posted online Wednesday morning, NBC reported that Mr. Trump said during a meeting in July that he wanted what amounted to a nearly tenfold increase in the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile, stunning some members of his national security team. It was after this meeting that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson reportedly said Mr. Trump was a “moron.” Mr. Trump objected to the report in a series of Twitter messages over the course of the day and threatened to use the authority of the federal government to retaliate. He repeated his complaint later in the day, when reporters arrived in the Oval Office to cover his meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. “It’s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write and people should look into it,” Mr. Trump said. "
"WASHINGTON — The International Monetary Fund delivered a blunt warning to international policy makers ahead of the fund’s annual meeting this week: Governments risk undermining global economic growth by cutting taxes on the wealthy. The message, while aimed broadly at all developed nations, carries particular resonance in the United States as the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers push a tax plan that critics say will exacerbate income inequality by reducing taxes for the richest Americans. In a report issued Wednesday, the fund emphasized that flatter tax rates across income scales and lower rates for the highest earners could exacerbate a troubling trend toward growing inequality in the United States and around the world. The White House is currently pushing a proposal that tax experts warn would cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans by lowering the top rate, by eliminating the estate tax and by doing away with the alternative minimum tax, which imposes a higher rate to ensure the wealthy are not exploiting loopholes. The monetary fund’s report builds on its broader message this week — that governments should take advantage of global economic strengthening to get their fiscal houses in order. By acting now to curb debt, overhaul inequities in taxation and lift spending on education and health for the poor, countries can stave off another economic crisis and help the most vulnerable in the process. President Trump’s agenda in many ways defies those recommendations. He championed several bills in Congress this year that would have reduced federal spending on health care, though none of them passed the Senate. "
"BEIJING — He was one of China’s most prominent commanders, with hopes of rising higher. So when Gen. Fang Fenghui disappeared from public view, it sent a clear warning to the top leaders of the People’s Liberation Army: President Xi Jinping was not done shaking up their once-unassailable ranks. General Fang, the chief of the army’s Joint Staff Department, was not the only military leader to fall ahead of next week’s Communist Party congress. Gen. Zhang Yang, the director of the military’s political department, also vanished from sight. Their names have not appeared in the Chinese news media for more than a month, when their successors were announced with no fanfare. Removing the two generals was the latest step by Mr. Xi to strengthen his grip on the military, a pillar of Communist Party power. On the eve of the party congress, which will kick off his second five-year term as the nation’s leader, he seems to have concluded that he must exert greater control to remake the country’s armed forces into a power worthy of China’s global standing. Mr. Xi’s reorganization of the military has already gone further than seemed possible under his recent predecessors, but as the overhaul and its attendant personnel cuts have begun to take shape, Mr. Xi has confronted poor coordination among branches of the armed forces and foot-dragging from senior officers whose positions have been threatened. “The removal of those top leaders, senior elderly generals and admirals, is part of a broader drive to promote and advance younger, more professionally minded officers,” said Timothy R. Heath, an expert on the Chinese military at the RAND Corporation. “There are huge numbers of top brass in the P.L.A.; it’s top-heavy, and huge numbers of these guys are going to lose their jobs.” Since coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi has used a crackdown on corruption to purge commanders deemed corrupt or disloyal. The moves have given Mr. Xi, whose father was an important figure in China’s revolutionary army, a degree of authority over the People’s Liberation Army that had eluded previous civilian leaders. "
"LONDON — Denise Gough has never been to New York: She swore to herself that she’d first visit as an actress. “I wanted to wait — I thought, one day I will do theater in New York, and that is how I will experience the city.” Her dream is coming true, in quite spectacular fashion. This month, the Irish-born Ms. Gough brings her star performance in Duncan Macmillan’s “People, Places & Things” to St. Ann’s Warehouse. In February, she’ll be part of what she calls a “most gorgeous ensemble” and “the Marvel Comics of theater,” doing “Angels in America” with Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane at the Neil Simon Theater on Broadway. Mr. Macmillan’s scorching script centers on Emma, an actress and drug addict who checks into rehab after losing focus during a production of “The Seagull.” The play kinetically conveys the highs as well as the despairing, disorienting lows of addiction, with a lead part that demands an actress dig deep: Emma is fiercely intelligent and funny, but also destructive, damaged and vulnerable. It’s a huge role, but Ms. Gough, 37, didn’t so much rise to the challenge as blow the theater’s roof off. She won the Olivier and other prizes for a performance described as both virtuosic and emotionally shattering, and was likened to Mark Rylance in “Jerusalem.” This was less a gush and more a righteous roar of approval, however, with critics cheering that a secret star of British theater — so chameleonic that she’d gone underrecognized for over a decade — had finally smashed into success. The play, which originated at the National Theater, in a coproduction with Headlong, duly transferred to the West End. But success came only just in time: If Ms. Gough hadn’t gotten the part, she was going to quit acting altogether. She’d had a year without any work, and was broke. "

"WASHINGTON — Republicans are staggering, knocked off kilter by internecine conflict between President Trump and his own party in Congress. Incumbents are under aggressive challenge from conservative activists. Frustrated veteran lawmakers are bailing out. Given the swirling tumult, one political and legislative reality is suddenly becoming crystal clear: Republicans must deliver a tax cut or face an epic backlash that would pose a significant threat to their governing majority and long-term political health. After Republicans were unable to fulfill their longstanding promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the tax cut proposal is the only remaining game in town for the struggling majority and its allies on K Street. The inability to enact a tax cut — an idea that nearly all Republicans support in theory while differing on the details — would represent a monumental failure. The party would have virtually no argument for re-election in 2018 and Senate and House incumbents would be wide open to challenge from both the right and the left. Big donors who are already sitting on their wallets would have no motivation to open them up. Mr. Trump’s ongoing Twitter feuds have complicated the task, but the Republican Party really has no choice — it must find a way to get a tax cut to the president’s desk. “We are 10 months into a new president with a city that appears to be dysfunctional,” said Scott Reed, senior political strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “It is vital that tax reform and economic growth get accomplished by the Congress.” Like many other advocacy groups, the chamber is putting extra emphasis on how lawmakers vote on tax and economic issues and won’t be inclined to throw its support behind those who don’t share the views of the business lobby.

"Donald Trump ran for the White House as a change agent hostile to the habits of Washington, the place he nicknamed “the swamp.” It worked. But the customs he continues to upend as president are the scaffolding that supports the otherwise fragile words of our written Constitution. Mr. Trump’s rejection of them is more threatening to both his presidency and our constitutional regime than any technical violation of the law that he has been accused of (at least so far). Customs are the punctuation marks of republican politics, the silent guides we follow without pausing to consider their authority. They operate in a space that is difficult for formal rules to codify. That the president of the United States speaks with caution and dignity, that he exercises the pardon power the Constitution grants him soberly rather than wantonly, that he respects the independence of law enforcement, and that, to the extent reasonable politics permit, he speaks truthfully — these are all customs, not laws. Law is powerless to impose them and powerless without them. When Mr. Trump drains language of its normal meaning, the law can do nothing about it. His  ridiculing of the United States senator who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, his repeated use of the word “fake” to describe news coverage when he actually means “unpleasant” and his style of rhetoric in front of the United Nations, where he called terrorists “losers” and applied a childish epithet to the head of a nation in whose shadow tens of thousands of American troops serve and with whom nuclear war is a live possibility, are all cases in point. There is no way to formalize conventions of maturity and dignity for presidents. Custom fills that void. Mr. Trump’s prodigious abuse of language violates the custom according to which presidents use words to convey serious meanings. Examples arrive daily, but here are a few more. The president has promised to decree his way to better health care, which he cannot constitutionally do. He has repeatedly tweeted threats at North Korea whose imprecision has turned red lines into smudges. He zigs and zags between alliances with and attacks on other constitutional officers in such a way that no one can constructively work with him. Yet all of these abuses of language are violations of custom, not law. When he violates such customs, Mr. Trump is at his most impulsive and self-destructive. It may sound ridiculous to invoke James Madison or Edmund Burke when we talk about this president, but that is part of the problem. Mr. Trump could profit from the wisdom of his predecessor Madison, for whom the very essence of constitutionalism lay not in what he derided as “parchment barriers” — mere written commands there was no will to follow — but rather “that veneration which time bestows on every thing.” The Constitution, in other words, would be only as strong as the tradition of respecting it.

But getting there is turning into a nightmare — a world where billions of people are connected but without sufficient legal structures, security protections or moral muscles among companies and users to handle all these connections without abuse. Lately, it feels as if we’re all connected but no one’s in charge. Equifax, the credit reporting bureau, became brilliant at vacuuming up all your personal credit data — without your permission — and selling it to companies that wanted to lend you money. But it was so lax in securing that data that it failed to install simple software security fixes, leaving a hole for hackers to get the Social Security numbers and other personal information of some 146 million Americans, or nearly half the country. But don’t worry, Equifax ousted its C.E.O., Richard Smith, with “a payday worth as much as $90 million — or roughly 63 cents for every customer whose data was potentially exposed in its recent security breach,” Fortune  reported. That will teach him! Smith and his board should be in jail. I’m with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who told CNBC, “So long as there is no personal responsibility when these big companies breach consumers’ trust, let their data get stolen, cheat their consumers … then nothing is going to change.” Facebook, Google and Twitter are different animals in my mind. Twitter has enabled more people than ever to participate in the global conversation; Facebook has enabled more people than ever to connect and build communities; Google has enabled everyone to find things like never before. Those are all good things. But the three companies are also businesses, and the last election suggests they’ve all connected more people than they can manage and they’ve been naïve about how many bad guys were abusing their platforms.

"Facing deportation to Mexico and fearing separation from his children, Javier Flores Garcia took refuge last year in a Methodist church in downtown Philadelphia. Members of the congregation prepared a makeshift bedroom for him in the basement, and promised to give him sanctuary, no matter how long he needed it. On Wednesday, after nearly 11 months, Mr. Flores walked out of the church for good, a rare winner among the tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have fought battles over deportation this year. His case was resolved in an unusual way: He has been promised a special type of visa given to victims of crime who assist the police. But even so, Mr. Flores’s freedom gives the growing sanctuary movement, organized by houses of worship across the country to protect undocumented immigrants, a small victory in the face of a widespread federal crackdown. Mr. Flores’s case shows “that when we fight and when we resist, that we win,” said Erika Almiron, executive director of Juntos, an immigrant rights organization in Philadelphia that took up Mr. Flores’s case. President Trump came into office vowing to rid the country of millions of illegal immigrants, and immigration arrests have risen by nearly 40 percent in 2017, compared to the previous year, to a rate of almost 400 people a day. Since Mr. Trump was elected, 34 people facing deportation have publicly taken refuge inside of churches, including four this week, according to the Rev. Noel Andersen, a minister of the United Church of Christ and the national grass-roots coordinator for Church World Service, an ecumenical human rights and refugee resettlement organization. So far, seven of those 34 have left their sanctuaries after winning relief from deportation, he said. "
"The only fitting reaction to the news that Steve Bannon intends to support primary challengers against Republican incumbents from sea to shining sea is a terrible, almost Teutonic sort of world-weariness. Bannon’s grand ambitions should inspire the same soul-deadening déjà vu, the existential exhaustion, with which Bill Murray’s weatherman greeted every morning in Punxsutawney, Penn. They should bring to mind both Friedrich Nietzsche’s idea of eternal recurrence and his warning that if you stare deep into the abyss, it stares into you. They should inspire a vision of the Republican Party as a wheel turning endlessly in darkness, with the illusion of movement but the light forever out of reach. O.K., maybe that’s all a little much. But really, didn’t we just go through all this? It was just seven years ago that Republican incumbents were facing populist challengers who promised ideological revolution, just a little while ago that the establishment was losing primaries to a mix of true believers, opportunists and erstwhile witches. What Bannon is promising is what the Tea Party actually delivered, in a past recent enough to still feel like the present: a dramatic ideological shake-up, an end to D.C. business-as-usual, and the elevation of new leaders with a sweeping vision for a new G.O.P. Then it all came to naught. The ideological shake-up took the form of paper promises, not successful legislation. The end to D.C. business-as-usual just created a new normal of brinkmanship and gridlock. And when the Tea Party’s leaders — Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, above all — reached out to claim their party’s presidential nomination, they found themselves steamrolled by a candidate who scorned all their limited-government ideas and offered, well, Trumpism instead. Alas when it comes to governance, Trumpism turns to have two fatal weaknesses: the dearth of Trumpists among elected Republicans, and the total policy incapacity of Trump himself. So having failed in his appointed role as Trump whisperer and White House brain, Bannon has decided to do the Tea Party insurgency thing all over again, except this time with his nationalist-populist cocktail instead of the last round’s notional libertarianism. Maybe it will work. Maybe repetition is the charm. Maybe the Tea Party was a dead end, but some Trumpist primary candidates will finally produce a Republican Party capable of doing something with its power. If you squint at the Bannon vision, you can almost imagine it. His professed nationalism, with its promise of infrastructure projects and antitrust actions and maybe even tax hikes on the rich, is potentially more popular than the Tea Party vision — an easier sell to swing voters than a stringent libertarianism or a zombie Reaganism, a more plausible response to the new political landscape that the stale agenda currently on offer on a Republican-controlled Capitol Hill.

"Your podcast, “Conversations With People Who Hate Me,” is exactly what it sounds like: You interview people who have posted racist, homophobic or otherwise terrible things about you on the internet. Fast Company said it’s the “timeliest podcast of 2017.” Why would you want to put yourself through this? Just because someone says something outrageously mean to you online doesn’t mean they’re sad and lonely. I wanted to go toward these messages rather than run away. But surely you’re aware of the internet maxim “Don’t feed the trolls.” I’ve made the conscious choice to not even use the term “troll.” These are real people who have said things to me online that they wouldn’t necessarily say to me in person. How do you decide whom to talk to? I chose people who had a nuanced take on why they hated me or my work. All my guests had initially reached out to me on Facebook. Do you see your show as part of this trend in journalism toward reaching out to “real America” and trying to figure out what drives Trump voters? I really don’t like the mentality of “Identity politics aren’t the real issue” or “What we really need to care about is coal country.” It just feels like there are so many edicts every day of the right and wrong ways to care, but I think we can get to know the trials and tribulations of those in coal country while also acknowledging and exploring the marginalized identities of people who have been systematically oppressed for so long. There’s so much policing that goes on within the left. I came face to face with it last summer when I covered the Democratic and Republican National Conventions for Seriously.TV, a digital comedic news channel. Everyone loved Donald Trump at the R.N.C.; people rallied around him. At the D.N.C., there was so much talk about how awful Hillary Clinton was. It was so divided. How do you psych yourself up for the actual phone call? The truth is the phone calls feel incredible: They make the world feel smaller and more manageable. It makes you feel like connection is possible with people with whom you’ve had a rocky beginning. The really emotionally draining part is delivering the episode to the world, trying to make sure that my guests and their views are accurately represented. I want to ensure that I’m actually engaging in conversation with them and identifying things that I disagree with, and that it’s not, like, the most masturbatory thing ever. "
"Lee Friedlander’s “The American Monument” was first published in 1976. That’s “monument” singular, though one of the many singular things about Friedlander is that he’s nothing if not a pluralist. Whitman-like, he is great, contains multitudes. In an essay appended to the sumptuous new edition of this landmark work, Peter Galassi (who curated the 2005 Friedlander retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art) deems it “pointless” to try to count precisely how many books the photographer has published since 1976 before settling on roughly one a year. The retrospective was huge, and, inevitably, the accompanying catalog was almost too hefty to lug home comfortably. It was sort of monumental, though monuments tend to be erected to the dead. On receipt of a lifetime achievement award from the International Center of Photography in 2006, the 71-year-old Friedlander responded that the honor, while welcome, was premature. At the glamorous reception and dinner, he spent the evening photographing, snapping guests and the other honorees like a cub photographer eager to make the most of what might prove to be his big break. That break actually came in 1967 at MoMA when he, Garry Winogrand (who died in 1984) and Diane Arbus (who died in 1971) were chosen to represent a shift in documentary photography from social concerns toward more personal ends. It’s possible that his reputation, as it has risen in the decades since, has also suffered, in the way that Dizzy Gillespie’s did in comparison with that of his doomed fellow bebop pioneer Charlie Parker. Almost inevitably for an artistic career stretching over more than five decades, the quality of the work is uneven. Unlike Winogrand, Friedlander hasn’t given up on editing, but he is more interested in taking pictures and getting them out than in scrupulously curating his own oeuvre. “It’s a generous medium, photography,” he is quoted as saying in the epigraph to the MoMA catalog. He was thinking particularly of a picture of his uncle, which also included a bunch of other, unintended information. “The American Monument” came about in similar fashion, when he noticed that memorials and statues of all kinds cropped up in multiple contact sheets, some of which were primarily concerned with other matters. After that, he began seeking out such monuments in the course of his travels throughout the States. Eventually he had enough pictures for a book — which, in Friedlander-ese, means more than enough. The original edition boiled thousands of potential candidates down to 213, the bulk of them taken between 1971 and 1975, supplemented by a brilliant afterword by Leslie George Katz. That essay still feels remarkably fresh in the reprint, even though Katz’s observations occasionally gleam with a faith in the assumption of the continued worth of monuments that may turn out to be “discredited,” “outmoded” or ironically apposite, as when he says of their power, “Something like racial memory is at work.” Robert Musil wrote that nothing is as invisible as a monument, and Friedlander in the 1970s relished the simple and complex task of making the invisible visible. He did this by showing how monuments hide in plain sight: subsumed by traffic, by familiarity, by the abundance of incidental detail he “got” in that picture of his uncle. The poet Siegfried Sassoon expressed the cruel paradox of remembrance while contemplating the Cenotaph, dedicated to the dead of the First World War, in London: “Make them forget, O Lord, what this Memorial/Means.” Friedlander’s photos read like an almost-random survey of the aesthetics and meanings of all kinds of monument — and of how easy it is to forget what is meant to be remembered. It is entirely coincidental that the book is being reissued at a time when the silent claims of monuments on our attention have become more audible than at any period in their long and dormant history. Misgivings about a few make us newly attentive to the many. The album is essentially the same as it was in 1976, but we view it rather differently. Monuments, after all, are also mirrors. So, for that matter, are the windows (often of cars) through which we see them — and few photographers have had more fun than Friedlander exploiting, exploring and reflecting on the capacities of these two pieces of technology to complicate what is shown in a frame. Dependent on all manner of mirroring, both felicitous and contrived, the slim volume Friedlander published before “The American Monument” was a collection of self-portraits. The self of which the pictures in the reprinted book offer a composite portrait is, of course, America. "
"BERLIN — If President Trump decertifies the Iran nuclear deal this week, as seems likely, “it will show total disrespect for America’s allies,” Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to the United States, told me. That’s the least of it. This — and I know competition is stiff — would be the rashest, most foolish act of the Trump administration to date. The president’s refusal to certify an accord his own defense secretary, James Mattis, says Iran is upholding, and is in the American national interest, would send a strong signal that the United States has become a bait-and-switch power whose word is worthless. It’s America’s word as solemn gage that has underwritten global security since 1945. Goodbye to all that. Uncorked, Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has grown bubbly. He’s compared Trump’s White House to “an adult day care center” in which only the likes of Mattis are keeping the child-sovereign’s tantrums from causing disaster. He’s suggested that, through infantile recklessness, Trump could set us “on the path to World War III.” Exhibit A in this pattern of puerility would be the decertification of a multilateral deal that is working and is supported by China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, powers with which Trump may even have a passing acquaintance. Bait and switch, I said. The accord is a nuclear nonproliferation deal, not a grand bargain with Iran. It was concluded, as most breakthrough diplomatic accords are, with a hostile power. It was designed to curb the potential threat from the Islamic Republic, not change the nature of the regime overnight. It was about centrifuges, not Iranian support for Hezbollah; enriched uranium, not Iran’s terrible human rights record. It represents a difficult compromise between two countries — the United States and Iran — whose accumulated grievances stretch back decades but whose unyielding confrontation benefits neither. "
"One of the Democratic Party’s most prominent financial backers is demanding that lawmakers and candidates on the left support removing President Trump from office, putting pressure on Democrats to make Mr. Trump’s ouster a defining issue in the 2018 midterm elections. Tom Steyer, a billionaire California investor who spent more than $91 million supporting Democrats in the 2016 elections, issued the demand to his party in a letter on Wednesday. In his message, Mr. Steyer called Mr. Trump a “clear and present danger to the republic” and urged Democrats to pledge that they would seek to remove him from office if they take control of Congress next year. Mr. Steyer — who is considering a run for Senate, perhaps against Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fellow Democrat — cited a range of acts by Mr. Trump to justify impeachment, including the president’s “relationship with Vladimir Putin and Russia,” allegations that Mr. Trump has used the presidency to “promote his own business interests” and his “seeming determination to go to war.” And he pointed to mounting expressions of concern on the right, including the warning by Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, that Mr. Trump was at risk of fomenting a world war, and reports that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson described Mr. Trump as a “moron.” Democrats, Mr. Steyer said, should be no less confrontational. “This is not just an issue of Twitter screeds but what it means for a person who has control over our nuclear arsenal,” Mr. Steyer said, adding in a plea to lawmakers: “I hope you will make your position clear so that Democratic voters who are under constant attack by this administration, know their elected representatives have the patriotism and political courage to stand up and take action.” The letter, which was sent to Democratic congressional offices and the party’s House and Senate campaign committees, and shared with The New York Times by an aide to Mr. Steyer, represents a significant boost to efforts on the left to make impeachment a mainstream political consideration.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Most of climate change’s dangers remain far-off in the future, and almost anything in the future feels uncertain, even squishy. This uncertainty is a big reason that climate change is such a hard political problem to solve. The Trump administration’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan — and promote coal use — is clearly bad for the planet’s far-off future, because it will aggravate climate change. But I think the most effective strategy for the opponents of repeal is to focus on the here and now. And unlike some anti-environmental policies, this one will begin to harm Americans very quickly. Coal plants release a stew of pollutants, including mercury (which damages children’s brains) and particulate matter (which includes bits of unburned coal small enough for people to inhale). These bits of coal cause asthma, strokes, lung damage and heart attacks. Worldwide, particulate matter is the seventh-largest cause of avoidable deaths. Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s E.P.A. director, has a long record of running government agencies on behalf of the energy industry. First in Oklahoma and now in Washington, he’s enacted policies to increase industry profits, no matter the health consequences. Buried deep in the proposed rule change that the E.P.A. released yesterday, the organization acknowledges part of the damage it is doing: “Some of the benefits of reducing these pollutants would have accrued to children.” Indeed. But in Pruitt’s E.P.A., keeping children from breathing coal doesn’t seem to be a priority. On this subject, Richard Revesz and Jack Lienke have written an op-ed in The Times carefully detailing how the E.P.A. has fudged the economic numbers to justify its policy. Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund has written a pithy series of tweets. The Editorial Board also addresses the subject today. In The Times. “It’s also hard to reconcile ESPN’s decision to suspend Jemele Hill for not quite calling for a boycott with the outspokenness that ESPN prizes in anchors who are not black women, who say things much more offensive and only get a slap on the wrist,” argues Kashana Cauley, a television writer.

"On Tuesday, the day after the slightly surreal public tussle between Ivana and Melania Trump over who actually was first lady (Mrs. Trump #1 joked it was she; the current occupant of the White House was not amused), the official first lady made a visit to an opioid clinic in West Virginia, signaling that the drug epidemic would be a focus for the East Wing. It was a classic first lady moment, and it’s clearly an important cause (less controversial, perhaps, than the cyberbullying idea), but also classic was Mrs. Trump’s choice of dress for the occasion: a green shirtdress from Cefinn, the brand created by Samantha Cameron. Yes, that Samantha Cameron: the former first lady of Britain. Or the equivalent; there is no formal first lady title there. Still, it was, in effect, an appearance that quietly doubled-down on the first lady messaging. Earlier this year Ms. Cameron introduced Cefinn — the name derives from a combination of her children’s initials — some months after her husband, David, resigned as prime minister after the country voted to leave the European Union. The moderately priced and easy-to-wear collection is sold on Net-a-Porter, among other retailers, and the particular dress that Mrs. Trump wore, a belted muslin number, is available for $450 (Mrs. Trump changed the belt). That makes it a relatively accessible public-image choice on the Trump continuum, another interesting signal from a first lady whose clothes, such as the $51,500 Dolce & Gabbana coat that she wore in May during the Group of 7 summit meeting in Sicily, have tended toward the gilded and out-of-reach. And, like the Timberland boots she wore this month in Puerto Rico, it demonstrates some sensitivity to the reality of the place she was visiting. (Of course, Mrs. Trump also wore towering Christian Louboutin snakeskin stilettos to the clinic, which retail for $1,395, but everything is relative, and the shoes have become part of her signature. Baby steps.) In any case, the Cefinn dress is also interesting in the context of the furor that surrounded Mrs. Trump early in her husband’s administration, when a libel suit against The Daily Mail revealed that the first lady had maybe-possible plans for a brand in her post-White House life. That created an uproar, and Mrs. Trump denied any such idea, though Mrs. Cameron, of course, has done exactly that — and with no negative repercussions. Indeed, there was a fair amount of excitement in Britain when the news was announced (British Vogue did a story), though it had little impact in the United States. This clearly has not escaped Mrs. Trump. That she is now supporting the post-Downing Street fashion life of a member of the small club that is former world leaders’ wives could be — well, a noteworthy look. "
"The rapper Eminem struck out at President Trump in a video that played at the BET Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday, accusing the president of racism, hypocrisy, disrespect of military veterans and more in almost five minutes of furious freestyle rap. He also excoriated Mr. Trump for his responses to the recent violence in Charlottesville, Va., the devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria and the mass shooting in Las Vegas. The video, titled “The Storm,” was filmed in Detroit as part of the BET Hip Hop Awards’ traditional cyphers, in which rappers typically aim to deliver showy verses in a group setting. In his solo appearance, Eminem, wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and baseball cap, name-drops Colin Kaepernick (“This is for Colin/ball up a fist”), Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Stephen K. Bannon. Throughout, he alludes to an array of Mr. Trump’s political clashes, including a reference to Senator John McCain (“Unless you’re a P.O.W. who’s tortured and battered/’cause to him you’re zeroes/’cause he don’t like his war heroes captured.”) Mr. Kaepernick expressed his support on Twitter with a raised fist emoji. Eminem also ripped into his fans who are Trump supporters. “And any fan of mine/who’s a supporter of his/I’m drawing in the sand a line/you’re either for or against/and if you can’t decide/who you like more and you’re split/on who you should stand beside/I’ll do it for you with this,” he raps, before giving the middle finger to the camera.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump’s feud with Senator Bob Corker continued on Tuesday, when Mr. Trump tweeted to suggest that Mr. Corker, a Republican, had been tricked by The New York Times into saying disparaging things about the president. On “The Late Late Show,” James Corden took aim at Mr. Trump from a variety of angles. Mr. Corden also addressed another internecine fight that’s occupying Mr. Trump’s time. The New Yorker on Tuesday published an unsparing investigation into the film producer Harvey Weinstein’s conduct with female actors and models, including accusations that he raped multiple women. But the late-night shows seemed reluctant to deal with the reports, and only some addressed them at all. Even those shows that did failed to spend much time on the revelations or mention the most unsettling accusations. Stephen Colbert discussed Elon Musk’s suggestions that artificial intelligence could pose a greater threat to humanity than North Korea’s nuclear program. Mark Zuckerberg had called that claim “pretty irresponsible,” leading Mr. Musk to tweet a spicy, dismissive response. "
"WASHINGTON — American military officials at the Guantánamo Bay prison recently hardened their approach to hunger-striking prisoners, detainees have told their lawyers, and are allowing protesters to physically deteriorate beyond a point that previously prompted medical intervention to force-feed them. The claim comes during two significant developments for the military commissions at Guantánamo this week, including a Supreme Court decision on Tuesday not to hear an appeal in a much-watched case. Together, the events are renewing attention on the wartime prison operation that President George W. Bush opened in 2002, that President Barack Obama tried without success to close and that President Trump has so far left alone. Of the 41 men remaining at the prison, 10 were charged or convicted in the commissions system and the rest are being held in indefinite wartime detention without trial. That group includes about five men who have gone on hunger strikes to protest, detainee lawyers say. For years, the military has forcibly fed chronic protesters when their weight dropped too much. Detainees who refuse to drink a nutritional supplement have been strapped into a restraint chair and had the supplement poured through their noses and into their stomachs via nasogastric tubes. But around Sept. 19, guards stopped taking hunger-striking detainees to feeding stations, said Clive Stafford Smith, a lawyer for the international human rights organization Reprieve. He said this change was reported by two Reprieve clients who had been subjected to tube feedings, and corroborated by several other clients. David Remes, who represents another hunger striker, said his client had been on such a strike since August but had not been tube-fed despite losing significant weight. The client also told him that other protesters were no longer being force-fed. "
"The tech giants are too big. Other than Donald J. Trump, that’s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline. The companies I call the Frightful Five — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have experienced astounding growth over the last few years, making them the world’s five most valuable public companies. Because they own the technology that will dominate much of life for the foreseeable future, they are also gaining vast social and political power over much of the world beyond tech. Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing — in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches — are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit. I’ve spent the last few years studying the rise of these giants. As tensions over their power reached a high boil this summer — Facebook and Russia, Google and sexism, Amazon and Whole Foods — I began thinking more about the nature and consequence of their power, and talking to everyone I could find about these companies. Among them were people in the tech industry, as well as many in other power centers: Washington, Hollywood, the media, the health care and automotive businesses, and other corners of society that may soon be ensnared by one or more of the Five. This is the first of several columns in which I’ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment — their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked. Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.

"Good morning on this wobbly Wednesday. Things got feisty last night at the first general election debate in the race for New York City mayor, and the raucous audience was partly responsible for it. (If you missed it, here are five takeaways and a fact-check.) Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican candidate, and Bo Dietl, an independent, were met with cheers, jeers, boos and screams as they answered questions about homelessness, subway delays, police reform and racial segregation in schools, among other topics. Mr. de Blasio harped on the other candidates’ support for President Trump. Ms. Malliotakis called out the mayor’s touchy relationship with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. And Mr. Dietl managed to work the term “nincompoop” into some comments on jail reform. We asked some of the attendees: Who won the debate? “No one won the debate. It was a S-show in there. Everyone was booing, you couldn’t hear the answers to the questions — it was too much.” — Christina Jerez, 28, a Queens resident who supports Mr. de Blasio “Nicole won the debate. I thought she was excellent. I came in being a Bo Dietl supporter because I was tired of de Blasio’s failed four years, and I thought she nailed it. She focused on the issues. She didn’t get into senseless politics.” — Amber Barth, 38, a Queens resident who supports Mr. Dietl “Nicole. Not because I support her, but she was on point on all the issues. The issue of education in the city right now, what’s important to the schools, the subway system and the M.T.A., safety, housing, homelessness. I don’t think she won, I know she won.” — Baxter Bey, a Manhattan resident who supports Ms. Malliotakis "

"President Trump usually ignores the criticism that comes his way from MSNBC, the reliably liberal cable channel that, his advisers argue, will attack his administration no matter what. But two reports by the channel’s parent network, NBC News — including a scoop that the president sought to expand the nation’s nuclear arsenal — set off some of Mr. Trump’s most hostile rhetoric yet about the freedom of the press. “Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked,” he wrote on Twitter. “Not fair to public!” A few caveats to keep in mind. Rage against the media is political Wagyu for the president’s base. And Mr. Trump’s notion of suspending licenses — along with his proposal, tweeted last week, that late-night comedians be subject to the “equal time” rule — is essentially unworkable, given how government regulation of the airwaves actually works. So was it a genuine threat — or just another comment from a president who seemingly thrives on narrative tension simply trying to top himself? "
"The situation in Iowa remains horrifying. More than a third of the population has been without clean water for three weeks, and waterborne diseases appear to be spreading. Only a sixth of the population has electricity. The health care system is a shambles, and sheer hunger may be a problem in some remote areas. Fortunately, the federal government is going all out to aid its citizens in distress. The president is making disaster relief a top priority, while praising the often heroic efforts of Iowa residents to help themselves. And generous aid, he promises, will continue as long as it’s needed. O.K., I lied. The dire situation I just described is in Puerto Rico, not Iowa (which happens to have just about the same number of U.S. citizens). And my upbeat portrayal of the federal response — which is how things might have played out if this nightmare were, in fact, in Iowa — is the opposite of the truth. What we’re actually witnessing, in effect, is the betrayal and abandonment of three and a half million of our own people. It’s hard to make an accurate assessment of the initial emergency response to Hurricane Maria, although there are a number of indications that it was woefully inadequate, falling far short of the response to natural disasters in other parts of the United States. What is clear, however, is that recovery has been painfully slow, and that life is actually getting worse for many residents as the cumulative effects of shortages of power, water and food take their toll. And the Trump administration seems increasingly to see this tragedy as a public relations issue, something to be spun — partly by blaming the victims — rather than as an urgent problem to be solved. From the beginning, Donald Trump — who literally seems to think that he deserves praise for throwing a few rolls of paper towels into a crowd — has suggested that Puerto Rico is responsible for its own disaster, and he has systematically denigrated the efforts of its people to take care of one another.

"SAN FRANCISCO — At the start of this decade, the Arab Spring blossomed with the help of social media. That is the sort of story the tech industry loves to tell about itself: It is bringing freedom, enlightenment and a better future for all mankind. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, proclaimed that this was exactly why his social network existed. In a 2012 manifesto for investors, he said Facebook was a tool to create “a more honest and transparent dialogue around government.” The result, he said, would be “better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time.” Now tech companies are under fire for creating problems instead of solving them. At the top of the list is Russian interference in last year’s presidential election. Social media might have originally promised liberation, but it proved an even more useful tool for stoking anger. The manipulation was so efficient and so lacking in transparency that the companies themselves barely noticed it was happening. The election is far from the only area of concern. Tech companies have accrued a tremendous amount of power and influence. Amazon determines how people shop, Google how they acquire knowledge, Facebook how they communicate. All of them are making decisions about who gets a digital megaphone and who should be unplugged from the web. Their amount of concentrated authority resembles the divine right of kings, and is sparking a backlash that is still gathering force. “For 10 years, the arguments in tech were about which chief executive was more like Jesus. Which one was going to run for president. Who did the best job convincing the work force to lean in,” said Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Now sentiments are shifting. The worm has turned.” "
"WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, the 264th day of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, a Democratic congressman from Texas walked onto the floor of the House and presented articles of impeachment against the commander in chief. President Trump has not necessarily committed a crime, the congressman said, but he has “undermined” the integrity of his office, “brought disrepute” on the presidency, and “betrayed” the trust of Americans. Congress, firmly in Republican control, barely blinked an eye. The dynamic is likely to become a lot more familiar on Capitol Hill as the Trump presidency and investigations into the president’s associates grind on. Driven by an angry and energized base and insulated by the surety that Republican leaders will block their efforts, liberal Democrats are turning to one of Congress’s most symbolically freighted cudgels — impeachment — to add urgency to their longstanding criticisms of a president they say is unfit for office. But with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, still pursuing his investigation, the efforts lack the weight of a prosecutor’s brief — and could become the objects of scorn, if not mockery. “I believe that there is support across the length and breadth of this country,” the congressman, Al Green of Texas, said in an interview shortly before he went to the floor on Wednesday. “I do not take this lightly.” Mr. Green’s articles of impeachment have company. Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, plans to introduce his own impeachment articles in the coming weeks. Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, did so in July. And other Democrats in the House, where impeachment proceedings must begin, say they will not be far behind. "
"For Democrats, the warning shots are coming thick and fast. “More than half of Americans don’t think Donald Trump is fit to serve as president, yet he has a clear path to winning reelection,” Doug Sosnik, who served as President Bill Clinton’s political director, wrote in the Washington Post last week. “Are Democrats Headed for a McGovern Redux?” Alan Greenblatt asked in Politico on Oct. 9. On the same day, a New York Magazine headline declared: “No One Should Rule Out a Trump Re-election in 2020.” What can Democrats do? A Pew Research Center survey released earlier this month documented the growth of the partisan divide: “the median (middle) Republican is now more conservative than 97% of Democrats, and the median Democrat is more liberal than 95% of Republicans.” The two accompanying charts illustrate the heights partisanship has reached. Much of the current polarization is driven by difference of opinion on issues of race and immigration. Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke who has focused much of her research on the racial attitudes of whites, emailed me to comment: Disrupting this linkage is an uphill battle for Democrats: According to Cornell Belcher, a prominent Democratic pollster who worked for President Barack Obama, attempts to win white working class votes in presidential elections should not be the Democrats’ top priority. He wrote me: Belcher pointed out that In terms of Congressional and state legislative contests, Belcher argues, “we can and should do better among non-college white voters” because they are crucial to the outcome in many districts. But doing so, he argues, will be a tremendous challenge: Significantly, Belcher contends, the anxiety about rapid social change is politically salient. Offering economic palliatives will not adequately address that anxiety, he said: Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan who is an expert in elections and party politics, wrote in an email that many voters in 2016 were worried about the rate of changes taking place in the racial and ethnic composition of their communities and in the continuing shift from manufacturing to service industries: This difference played into a second Democratic liability, according to Lupia: Voters who cast Republican ballots last year experience disproportionately higher levels of both cultural and economic anxiety than Democratic voters, Lupia argued, but “many people on the left mock this uncertainty and those who feel this uncertainty are quite good at knowing when they are being mocked.” Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, agrees with Lupia in many respects, but places greater emphasis on economic policy as a coalition building mechanism: Cain is critical of the lack of attention Democrats paid to economic issues in 2016: "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Most male late-night hosts have not made much of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. But on Wednesday, Samantha Bee led “Full Frontal” with a full-on attack. She started by taking aim at Mr. Weinstein’s response last week to the initial reports that he’d sexually harassed women throughout his career. Ms. Bee was also irked by Mr. Weinstein’s statement that “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.” President Trump suggested on Wednesday that the Federal Communications Commission should consider revoking NBC’s broadcasting license for publishing stories he finds objectionable. Stephen Colbert has another idea. Jimmy Fallon wondered whether Mr. Trump had forgotten about the First Amendment entirely. "
"M
innesota is home to some of the world’s most ancient rocks, as old as 3.5 billion years. Earth has been around for only 4.5 billion years. About 2.7 billion years ago, basalt lava flowed underwater near what’s now the state’s border with Canada; the lava hardened, and the creep of geologic time turned it into a bedrock of greenstone and granite. On top of it, a layer of sedimentary rock rich in iron ore formed nearly two billion years ago, when the region was ocean floor. Then a billion years ago, Earth’s crust cracked open, producing a 50-mile-wide fissure stretching from Lake Superior to Kansas. For the next 100 million years, lava bubbled up into what geologists call the Midcontinent Rift, forming a mineral deposit filled with copper and nickel. Settlers first made their way to the area in 1865 in a fruitless search for gold. What they did find was iron ore, and lots of it. Rails were laid for iron-ore transport, and the town of Ely was founded a few years later, in 1888. Today Ely is home to a few thousand people, a place of long, hard winters that is, in the words of one resident, “not on the road to anywhere — we’re literally the end of the road.” People do not end up here by accident. For most of the town’s history, the main reason they came was to make a living off the rocks. The ore supported abundant mining jobs for generations. For almost as long, however, people have been coming to this area for another reason, too: to visit America’s most popular national wilderness area, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, which encompasses roughly a million protected acres and thousands of lakes and welcomes 150,000 visitors annually. The “Land of 10,000 Lakes” is actually a land of 11,842 lakes, and that figure counts only those bigger than 10 acres. They are a legacy of the glaciers that retreated from the region about 10,000 years ago. As a result, the state has a significant fraction of the world’s supply of surface-available fresh water; 6 percent of Minnesota’s surface area is water, more than any other state. Geological coincidence makes Ely — one three-square-mile town in the northernmost reaches of the continental United States — a focus of a national debate about the proper use of public lands. The place also distills the political fault lines in today’s America, pitting an angry working class against progressive activists. Just southeast of Ely, an international mining conglomerate has invested hundreds of millions of dollars during the past decade toward potential copper-nickel mines a few miles outside the Boundary Waters. The company — Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the Chilean mining giant Antofagasta — has drilled 1.6 million feet of core samples out of 496 holes to explore the deposit from which it soon hopes to process 20,000 tons of mineralized ore a day. The company believes the area’s valuable metals — copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, gold and silver — can be extracted in an environmentally responsible way and can provide hundreds of jobs to the job-starved economy of Minnesota’s Arrowhead Region, along the northwestern coast of Lake Superior. But there’s a generations-long rift in Ely — between those who believe minerals are the region’s greatest asset and those who believe clean waters are — that has been laid bare recently. In December the Obama administration denied a renewal of Twin Metals’ mining leases and put in place a moratorium while a two-year comprehensive federal study is being conducted on mining near the Boundary Waters. Depending on its findings, the stoppage could be a prelude to what conservationist groups here hope for most: a 20-year prohibition on mining in a 230,000-acre portion of the Rainy River Watershed that includes land surrounding the Boundary Waters. That could lead to a permanent end to mining around the Boundary Waters. Now, mining supporters, among them Representative Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represents Ely’s district in Congress, are trying to undo the moratorium. The battle is being fought on both moral and economic grounds. Mining advocates stress the hundreds of tangible construction and mining jobs this copper-nickel operation could create in the coming decades. Boundary Waters activists argue that the very presence of mining — its disruption of this area’s natural character, not to mention the specter of pollution — could hamper the region’s “amenity-based” development in a multitude of tangible and intangible ways, from destroying property values to stripping away jobs that feed off this area’s natural beauty.

"When President Trump announced his long list of immigration demands on Tuesday, it threw another wrench into the fraught negotiations over fixing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era policy that until last month protected some young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. But if the Washington deal-making drags on too long, it could be disrupted by a different force: a federal judge in Brooklyn who has sternly warned that should policy makers prove unable to repair the program, commonly known as DACA, he might have to do it. In recent weeks, the judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, has made a series of unusually forceful statements from the bench, calling the Trump administration’s approach to fixing DACA “cruel,” “heartless” and “unacceptable.” He has also offered praise for the 800,000 young immigrants who were shielded by the program, lauding them as people who pay rent, taxes and mortgages, and who “support their communities.” Judge Garaufis has even professed confusion over Mr. Trump’s tweets about DACA, saying that the president’s apparent desire to save the program does not square with his government’s continued efforts to rescind it. But perhaps most forebodingly, the judge has stated several times that while he would prefer “the political branches” to resolve the issue, if that becomes impossible, he may have to impose his own solution. A Democrat appointed by President Clinton, Judge Garaufis has found himself in a position to guide DACA’s fate because two linked lawsuits have landed in his courtroom. The suits, filed separately last month by a coalition of immigration lawyers and by more than a dozen state attorneys general, have challenged Mr. Trump’s repeal of DACA by arguing that it is an “arbitrary” exercise of power and betrays an “animus” toward Latinos. Similar suits have also been filed in California. Judge Garaufis has acknowledged that he is unlikely to decide on the merits of the lawsuits until early next year. And he may find that the United States Appeals Court for the Second Circuit does not take kindly to his rhetoric or eventual decision. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Palestinian unity deal. Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal in Cairo today that aims to end their decade-old rivalry and paves the way for joint control of Gaza’s borders. Under the agreement, brokered by Egyptian intelligence, Fatah will lift a series of punitive sanctions that it imposed on Hamas-controlled Gaza this year. But it leaves thornier issues unresolved. • Trump’s to-do list. With Congress failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Trump is ready to go it alone on health care. He plans to sign an executive order today that would relax rules on small businesses that band together to buy health insurance. On Wednesday, the president said it was “possible” the U.S. would drop out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. His administration has pushed for significant changes to the deal, but Mexico and Canada say they’re nonstarters. Separately, Mr. Trump threatened to use the government’s power over broadcast licenses to retaliate against NBC for a report about the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Curious about how The Times covers the Trump administration?

"WASHINGTON — President Trump suggested on Wednesday evening that a soaring stock market might be “in a sense” reducing the national debt, a statement that is not true, in any sense. “The country — we took it over and owed over $20 trillion,” Mr. Trump told the Fox News personality Sean Hannity, following similar remarks he made earlier on Wednesday in a speech he delivered on tax issues in Pennsylvania. “As you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value.” “So you could say, in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt.” The comments represented the latest in a long-shifting series of positions on debt issues for Mr. Trump as both president and candidate, which has included, at various points, proclaiming “I love debt” and also promising to pay off the entire national debt in eight years. Wednesday’s remarks coincide with recent comments by Republican lawmakers and other administration officials playing down concerns about the federal debt. The White House and Republicans in Congress are pushing a tax rewrite that independent analysts warn could add trillions more to the debt, but administration officials say will more than pay for itself with increased economic growth. The federal budget deficit increased in the 2017 fiscal year, both in dollar terms and as a share of the economy, the Congressional Budget Office reported this month. Total debt held by the public stands at $20.38 trillion, up from $19.95 trillion when Mr. Trump took office in January. "
"To the Editor: Re “Citing Scandal, Studio’s Board Fires Weinstein” (front page, Oct. 9): I wish Jenni Konner, the executive producer of “Girls,” were right when she says Harvey Weinstein’s firing is a tipping point. Alas, we have a president who brags about sexually abusing woman, lots of gold in the parachutes handed to Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly after they were ousted, “gag orders” as standard operating procedure, and countless women in every industry who are experiencing offensive and often criminal sexual misconduct right now. A quarter century after Anita Hill was vilified for speaking out about Clarence Thomas, we have a lot of fighting left to do. Fortunately, activists across the country, many of them women of color, are leading that fight. ELLEN BRAVO, MILWAUKEE The writer is the co-author of “The 9 to 5 Guide to Combating Sexual Harassment” and author of “Again and Again,” a novel about date rape. To the Editor: Harvey Weinstein’s public apology was both condescending and tiresomely clichéd. Mr. Weinstein has undoubtedly downplayed the sexual harassment of countless women in Hollywood over dozens of years. Unfortunately, he is not alone. I spent nine years in Hollywood as an actress. With my freckles and my “girl next door” visage, I was always cast as the little sister or the brainy girlfriend. I naïvely believed that this would safeguard me from the proverbial “casting couch” I had heard so much about. It did not. Over those nine years, I had multiple interactions with well-known directors and producers that were thoroughly offensive, demeaning and inappropriate. I was fortunate enough to extricate myself from these interactions. However, I never felt as if I could “blow the whistle” on these men. They were well respected, powerful and influential. I simply walked away, without giving them what they wanted and without the part. "
"Before there was Bach, there was Monteverdi. This is true both historically and for the eminent and versatile English conductor John Eliot Gardiner. In recent decades Mr. Gardiner has been best known for his consuming immersion in Bach, including a yearlong international Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with his Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists in 2000 and a thoroughgoing biography, “Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven,” published in 2013. But his formative involvement with Monteverdi dates to the beginning of his career, in 1964, when he began to form that Monteverdi Choir for performances of the composer’s 1610 Vespers — like Monteverdi’s other large-scale works, little performed at the time — with a view to the 400th anniversary of his birth, in 1567. Now Mr. Gardiner, 74, arrives in New York for Monteverdi’s 450th, with a rare semistaged triptych of the composer’s surviving operas, “L’Orfeo” (1607), “Il Ritorno d’Ulisse in Patria” (1640) and “L’Incoronazione di Poppea” (1642), to be performed at Alice Tully Hall next week to open Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival. Reached in Pisa, Italy, last week, between performances of the Vespers there and at Versailles, Mr. Gardiner discussed the project and bringing Monteverdi to Donald Trump’s America. These are edited excerpts from the interview. When you first came to Monteverdi, what did you think he had to say to the 20th century? What’s so striking about Monteverdi is his extraordinary, exceptional ability to encapsulate the whole range of human emotions in music. I don’t think anybody had done it before, and I’m not sure many composers have done it since. "
"WASHINGTON — The House, dismissing concern for the rising cost, approved a $36.5 billion aid package on Thursday that would provide hurricane and wildfire relief funding while bailing out the financially troubled National Flood Insurance Program. The aid package would also help Puerto Rico’s financially beleaguered government avoid running out of cash in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Conditions there remain dire, with most of the island still without power three weeks after the storm hit. The House approved the bill 353 to 69, with all of the no votes coming from Republicans. The disaster package, now awaiting consideration in the Senate, would be the second installment of aid money that Congress has approved in response to this year’s hurricanes, after a $15.3 billion relief measure in September. With the tab now more than $50 billion, lawmakers warn that much more money will still be needed. Lawmakers from Texas and Florida have already outlined expansive requests, adding up to tens of billions of dollars in total. And the United States Virgin Islands delegate to the House, Stacey Plaskett, a Democrat, complained that the package lacked aid needed by her devastated territory. “I know people are concerned that not every state’s need is met, but this is, I think, a good step in the right direction,” said Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who urged his colleagues to vote for the bill “so we can get this money out the door as quickly as possible.” The governor of the Virgin Islands, Kenneth E. Mapp, wrote to congressional leaders on Thursday to request $5.5 billion of disaster relief for the United States territory, a group of islands east of Puerto Rico that was raked by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. “We are at the U.S. government’s mercy,” the governor said, describing destroyed hospitals, schools and fire stations, two heavily damaged airport terminals, and an electrical grid that was a total loss. He said the greatest share of the aid would be put toward housing, because most homes on the islands had been “destroyed or substantially damaged,” along with the hotels and resorts at the heart of their economy.

"The news arrived on Oct. 11, a day — as Facebook reminded us — designated as the International Day of the Girl. On the surface, it even seemed like it might be a progressive change: The Boy Scouts of America announced that it would allow girls to participate in Cub Scouts and to eventually earn Eagle Scout rank. The responses fell into a few broadly predictable categories. Some applauded what they saw as a long-overdue opening of closed doors, along the lines of the January announcement that transgender boys could join scouting and the 2013 end to the ban on gay members. Others, mostly men, many of them former scouts, objected to what they saw as creeping political correctness, an incursion of unwanted female influence into an all-male bastion. On Fox News, Laura Ingraham attributed the change to a “small, radical group of gender-benders.” But both sides seemed to agree that the shift in policy, whether they loved it or hated it, was essentially progressive. They’ve been had. The Boy Scouts’ decision to open its ranks to girls appears to be less an evolution toward openness and inclusion than a calculated business strategy. The move allows the organization, which has been rocked by revelations of decades of sexual abuse, to improve its public image. It opens up a broad new market with the promise of increased revenue, an attractive proposition for a nonprofit that has seen both membership rolls and corporate sponsorships shrink in recent years. Most crucially, it’s a direct attack on the Girl Scouts, a group that shares some historical roots with the Boy Scouts but has grown into a very different organization, with very different values. Unlike the Boy Scouts, in which individual troops are overwhelmingly affiliated with churches — a large share are tied to conservative denominations; an estimated 20 percent of scouts are Mormon, for instance — the Girl Scouts are a secular organization. While the Boy Scouts have an official policy against atheists and agnostics participating in scouting, the Girl Scouts make it clear that girls may substitute any words they like for the part of the Girl Scout Pledge in which they promise “to serve God.” "
"WASHINGTON — He was talking taxes with truckers on Wednesday evening when President Trump suddenly diverged into a curious tangent. He had been given “some very, very important news” that “you’ll probably be hearing about” in the next few days. What it was, he did not say. If the truckers packed in the airport hangar in Harrisburg, Pa., went home that night scratching their heads, Mr. Trump was right that they would eventually realize what he was referring to. By Thursday morning, word emerged that an American woman and her family had been released after five years of captivity by Afghan militants. The forecast by the president seemed to contradict Mr. Trump’s own declaration that he never telegraphs his moves in advance. But advisers have long ago learned that if Mr. Trump is told something, he may not be able to restrain himself from sharing, as he did with intelligence gleaned from the Israelis when he met with the Russian foreign minister in May. In this case, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump was hinting at a delicate development before it was fully completed, but aides were sensitive afterward about not disclosing anything prematurely. Mr. Trump often criticized his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for discussing overseas operations too early. “I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ‘yes, here’s what we’re going to do,’” he said shortly after taking office. The American hostage, Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband and their three children were freed from captivity “through an intelligence-based operation by Pakistan troops,” according to a statement from the Pakistani government. But the family was not yet in American hands. The Pakistanis said the hostages, captured in Afghanistan in 2012, were tracked as they were moved across Pakistan. “The operation by Pakistani forces, based on actionable intelligence from U.S. authorities, was successful,” the statement said.

"Ai Weiwei lives his life in public: blogging his anger at the Chinese government, transforming his detention into harrowing dioramas, and now Instagramming up a storm from his exile in Berlin. Over the last two years, the world’s most famous artist-activist has been traveling to refugee camps from Greece to Iraq and Gaza to Myanmar, documenting the displacement of millions and the borders they are desperate to cross. Others might have stayed behind the camera. Mr. Ai, now a refugee himself, puts himself right in front. The worldwide refugee crisis is the subject of “Human Flow,” Mr. Ai’s new film, and it also informs a gargantuan undertaking of new public artworks in New York, running from Harlem to Flushing and united under the title “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.” Put aside its cheesy title, cribbed from Robert Frost, and there is a fair deal to admire in this new endeavor, which consists of new sculptures in the form of steel barriers; hundreds of lamppost banners of refugees past and present; and interventions at bus stops across the five boroughs. Remember the 1990s, when the hawkers of globalization told us this century would see borders fall? In fact construction of international walls and fences has surged worldwide to deter unauthorized migration; Europe’s borderless Schengen zone is under existential threat; Brexit promises to divide Ireland once again; and, if someone has his way, a “big, beautiful wall” may rise south of here soon. Mr. Ai saw those barriers firsthand while filming “Human Flow.” Now he has brought them to New York, where they fit in with alarming naturalness. This week I saw a solid hunk of the hundreds of small and large additions Mr. Ai has made to New York’s streets and parks. Out in Queens, Mr. Ai has encircled the Unisphere — the stainless steel globe that’s the primary symbol of the 1964 World’s Fair — with a running mesh lattice that rises to about knee height. “Circle Fence” cannot be traversed; this is an insuperable border. Yet the nets’ soft and pliant forms, which you’re free to touch or sit upon, may put you in mind of fishermen or trapeze artists more than of guards and wardens. "
"As National Football League team owners consider President Trump’s call to fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, they have stumbled into one of the most consequential debates in today’s workplace: How far can workers go in banding together to address problems related to their employment? In principle, the answer in the N.F.L. and elsewhere may be: Quite far. To the extent that most people think about the reach of federal labor law, they probably imagine a union context — like organizing workers, or bargaining as a group across the table from management. As it happens, the law is much more expansive, protecting any “concerted activities” that employees engage in to support one another in the workplace, whether or not a union is involved. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have defined such activity to include everything from airing complaints about one’s boss through social media to publicly supporting political causes that have some bearing on one’s work life. The league’s operations manual says players must be on the sidelines during the anthem and should stand. While the law might not bear on whether an individual player can kneel during the anthem, many experts say it could protect players from repercussions for making such a gesture together — or taking other action — to show solidarity on the job. And as unionization continues its decades-long decline, some believe that these alternative forms of taking collective action may be crucial to enabling workers to speak up. “Workers without a traditional organization that is meant to protect them at work are kind of scrambling around for new ways of protecting themselves,” said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University. “It does feel like these are nascent forms of something new.” "
"You know something is wrong when Wall Street loan sharks show more heart than the president of the United States. Last week, some of the companies that hold Puerto Rico’s $74 billion in debt and had been suing to force payment, no matter the consequences, started talking about cutting the island a break after Hurricanes Irma and Marie. One firm said it was dropping its lawsuit (at least for now). A top executive of a mutual fund admitted that Wall Street miscalculated the risk of buying all those unsustainable tax-free bonds from Puerto Rico in the first place and may actually have to lose some money on the deal. After all, said Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles & Co.: “They are U.S. citizens. We are U.S. citizens. We have an obligation to help.” President Trump, who has made some halfhearted and condescending efforts to show concern about Puerto Rico, is having none of that nonsense. In one of his deranged early-morning Twitter rants, Trump said on Thursday that Puerto Rico’s “infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.” He said Congress, which he knows perfectly well can’t do much of anything, has to “decide how much to spend” and warned that he “cannot keep” federal disaster relief officials and the military in “P.R. forever!” "
"MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines threatened on Thursday to expel the ambassadors representing the European Union, suggesting that he would give them 24 hours to leave his country. “You think that we are a bunch of morons here,” Mr. Duterte said in an expletive-laden speech at the presidential palace. “Because we can have the diplomatic channel cut tomorrow. You leave my country in 24 hours. All. All of you.” His remarks appeared to be a reaction to recent criticism of the country’s war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed by the police. A director of Human Rights Watch suggested that the Philippines should be removed from the United Nations’ top human rights body. A group including European lawmakers issued a statement after a visit to the country last week suggesting that the European Union might tighten its terms of trade with the Philippines for human rights reasons. The European Union said in a statement issued by its delegation in Manila that the lawmakers’ visit had been a private trip organized by the Progressive Alliance — a group that is critical of the Duterte government — not an official mission. “The statements made by the Progressive Alliance during its visit to the Philippines were made solely on behalf of the Progressive Alliance and do not represent the position of the European Union,” the statement said.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump will scrap subsidies to health insurance companies that help pay out-of-pocket costs of low-income people, the White House said late Thursday. His plans were disclosed hours after the president ordered potentially sweeping changes in the nation’s insurance system, including sales of cheaper policies with fewer benefits and fewer protections for consumers. The twin hits to the Affordable Care Act could unravel President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, sending insurance premiums soaring and insurance companies fleeing from the health law’s online marketplaces. After Republicans failed to repeal the health law in Congress, Mr. Trump appears determined to dismantle it on his own. Without the subsidies, insurance markets could quickly unravel. Insurers have said they will need much higher premiums and may pull out of the insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act if the subsidies were cut off. Known as cost-sharing reduction payments, the subsidies were expected to total $9 billion in the coming year and nearly $100 billion in the coming decade. “The government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments,” the White House said in a statement. It concluded that “Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.” In a joint statement, the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said Mr. Trump had “apparently decided to punish the American people for his inability to improve our health care system.” "

Spar with snowflakes who are offended by something he says about race or gender and perhaps even believe he never should have been invited in the first place. Post the exchange on the internet and use it as proof that the cultural consensus is stacked dramatically against conservatives. As Mr. Shapiro has put it: “The left has run out of aggressors to target; instead, they’ve become the aggressors, self-righteous morality police dedicated to wiping out dissenting thought.” It’s true that campuses tend to be hostile places to conservatives like Mr. Shapiro, Charles Murray and Heather Mac Donald. But the notion that they are the cultural underdogs is bogus. What Mr. Shapiro does on campus is shadow boxing meant to pander to his conservative fans whose values dominate mainstream American culture. If he wanted to be genuinely brave, he’d challenge some of the wrongheaded ideas held by his right-wing fans. Instead, he uses his megaphone — the website The Daily Wire — to reinforce what they already believe. To take only the most recent example: On Monday, The Daily Wire published a video that depicted Native Americans as animated savages before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. In one slide, the video lists Native American achievements as consisting of dreamcatchers, tomahawks and cannibalism, while stating that Columbus’s arrival in 1492 assured the arrival of “math” and “the iPhone.” The animated video was actually the second one The Daily Wire posted this past weekend on the subject; the other carried the subtle title “Christopher Columbus Actually Was a Great Man.” Mr. Shapiro and The Daily Wire aren’t alone in pandering to their readers. Over at the website The Federalist, the editors took the opportunity of Columbus Day not to examine its complicated legacy or illuminate some overlooked aspect of history but to publish an article titled “Why ‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day’ Is Far Worse Than Columbus Day,” which makes the case that the historical violence of some Native American peoples wash Columbus clean of his genocidal sins. “The only reason,” it says, that anti-Columbus activists “ideological idiocy has free rein today is because Europeans showed up in 1492.” That same publication had a “black crime” tag on its website until two weeks ago, which included an article titled “If You Don’t Want Police to Shoot You, Don’t Resist Arrest.” The subheading: “Every time I hear of a black man getting killed by the cops, he’s almost always a criminal thug I have no desire to defend.” "
"WASHINGTON — For months, Facebook has been trying to counter criticism about its influence on the 2016 presidential election. The company has hired three crisis communications firms and has bought digital and newspaper ads. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has posted live video to the social network to explain how much he cared about election integrity. This week, it sent Sheryl Sandberg to Washington to charm Congress and the public. Ms. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, acted as the giant tech company’s chief ambassador in the capital on Wednesday and Thursday — shuttling around to talk with dozens of lawmakers, and making numerous promises about how the company would change. In a public appearance hosted by Axios, the news start-up, she admitted that Facebook had made mistakes during the presidential campaign. She offered lawmakers who are investigating Russia’s meddling in the election more data from the company. And she promised the Congressional Black Caucus that she would help appoint an African-American to the Facebook board. “She said 10 to 15 times, ‘We’ve got to do better,’” Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democrat from Missouri, said after Ms. Sandberg met with the Congressional Black Caucus, which has complained about the level of diversity at the company. Facebook faces a variety of concerns about fake news and its broader role in the presidential campaign. But the criticism has become far more intense in the last few months, after the company revealed that Russian-linked groups bought more than $100,000 in ads on Facebook to influence the election. The complaints about Facebook have also helped propel debate about the technology industry more widely, and whether the biggest technology companies — like Facebook, Google and Amazon — have grown too large and powerful. Some lawmakers are now talking about potential ways to regulate the businesses. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — In the late 1980s, when I was in third grade in South Korea, a teacher spent an entire class period telling us that the United States was deliberately keeping the Korean Peninsula divided so it could sell weapons to our country. I repeated the story at home, and my mother and brother told me that my teacher must be a radical pro-North Korean sympathizer. I should know that the United States is our ally, they said, and that our real enemy is Kim Il-sung up north. Communists want to destroy us, and Americans were simply trying to protect us and our precious democracy. I believed it then. But it now looks like America could bring our doom. As the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, put it, President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, are acting like “children in a kindergarten,” spewing incendiary words and issuing threats. And while Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim try to outdo each other with verbal pyrotechnics, fear is growing in South Korea that we may be heading toward war. The new variable is Mr. Trump, who has no problem stooping to the level of a dictator. The man who’s supposed to be Seoul’s dependable ally is playing a dangerous game of one-upmanship to the peril of everyone who lives on the Korean Peninsula. Back in April, Mr. Trump tweeted that if the Chinese don’t help the United States deal with the North Korean nuclear problem, “We will solve the problem without them!” This was followed by Mr. Trump’s threat to rain “fire and fury” down on North Korea. He has taken to belittling Mr. Kim as “Little Rocket Man,” promising that North Korean leaders “won’t be around much longer!” More recently, Mr. Trump said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a diplomatic mission to East Asia, was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.” He added, “Save your energy, Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would withdraw from Unesco, the United Nations cultural organization, after years of the United States distancing itself because of what it called the group’s “anti-Israel bias.” The administration also cited mounting arrears at the organization as a reason for the decision. “We were in arrears to the tune of $550 million or so, and so the question is, do we want to pay that money?” Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said Thursday at a news briefing. She added, “With this anti-Israel bias that’s long documented on the part of Unesco, that needs to come to an end.” While the United States withdrew from the group, the Trump administration said it wanted to continue providing American perspective and expertise to Unesco, but as a nonmember observer. The withdrawal goes into effect at the end of 2018, but that decision could be revisited, officials said. If Unesco returns “to a place where they’re truly promoting culture and education on all of that, perhaps we could take another look at this,” Ms. Nauert said. Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization popularly known for its designation of World Heritage sites, is a global development agency with missions that include promoting sex education, literacy, clean water and equality for women. In a lengthy written statement, Irina Bokova, Unesco’s director general, expressed regret at the decision and said that the American people shared the organization’s goals. "
"To the Editor: Re “President Issues Terms of a Deal Over ‘Dreamers’ ” (front page, Oct. 9): As time passes and the six-month deadline for congressional action to protect Dreamers like me gets nearer, the sense of urgency seems to be deteriorating. I was one of the first persons to have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals granted. I played by the rules. I worked hard to get into college and even harder to make it through college. I am months away from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley. I have a clean record. I’ve repeatedly been admitted to prestigious internships, I have several mentors and whether I’d succeed was never in question. The conditions that President Trump has set for a bipartisan deal to protect the DACA recipients dim the chance of a deal, but I urge Democrats and Republicans not to politicize the lives of hundreds of thousands of people like me. Pass something. I and other Dreamers belong in this country. I spent only the first year of my life in Mexico, but because I was born there, this government fails to see me as American. Whether some like it or not, immigrants continue to shape and be a part of America. It is time that we stop dehumanizing fellow Americans. DIANA JAUREGUI IÑIGUEZ
BERKELEY, CALIF. To the Editor: President Trump’s latest anti-immigrant demand — that any legislation to protect Dreamers include a crackdown on unaccompanied children, concentrated at the border — is illogical and inhumane. First, deporting children would not deter other child migrants, as some hard-liners suggest. It is Central America’s horrific gang violence, not American immigration policy, that prompts parents to make the heart-wrenching decision to send their children on the perilous journey north. Second, border apprehensions, including of minors, have dramatically declined under Mr. Trump, which he attributes to his rhetoric. Instead, he should be thanking Mexico. Since 2014, when record numbers of unaccompanied children arrived at our border, Mexico has substantially increased apprehensions at its own southern border as well as resettlement of migrants in Mexico. "
"WASHINGTON — The message was as stark as it was startling. Three weeks after a killer hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico, President Trump indicated on Thursday that he was losing patience. At least some of the blame for the continuing crisis is yours, he told the island territory, and the federal government will not stay “forever.” While most residents endured another day without power and many without water or other basic services, Mr. Trump upbraided Puerto Rico’s leadership for mismanagement that predated the storm and said troops and emergency workers would eventually leave. Caught off guard, his advisers scrambled to reassure Puerto Rico that Washington was not abandoning it. The president’s warning came on the same day the House approved $36.5 billion in aid for natural disasters, including in Puerto Rico, with the tab rising weekly. Federal agencies expect to spend years helping the island rebuild. But Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for a slow and not always empathetic response to the storms that devastated Puerto Rico, sought to refocus responsibility to where he believes it belongs. “ ‘Puerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.’ says Sharyl Attkisson,” he wrote on Twitter, citing the host of a public affairs show on Sinclair Broadcast Group television stations. “A total lack of accountability say the Governor. Electric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes. Congress to decide how much to spend. We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!” The tweets set off alarms in San Juan, the Puerto Rican capital, where Ricardo A. Rosselló, the governor, anxiously called John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, to seek an explanation. Mr. Kelly reassured him that no federal resources were being withdrawn anytime soon and then made an unannounced visit to the White House briefing room to repeat the message for the news media. “Our country will stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done,” Mr. Kelly said. The president, he asserted, merely meant that eventually the federal government would complete its mission. “The whole point is to start to work yourself out of a job,” he said. "
"New York City may be more lamentably dull than it was 20 years ago, but it remains a magnet for exceptional talent — in many parts of Brooklyn it is easier to trip over Rhodes scholars than it is to find a half-gallon of milk with additives. Recent economic studies also suggest that as knowledge fields have become increasingly concentrated in the country’s biggest cities, New York has become even more attractive to the brilliant and prestigiously educated. That from this vast pool we have not been able to fish out a vibrant, impressive (and young) political class is one of the paradoxes of life in New York right now. That we collectively mourn the loss of every old bar with sawdust on the floor more operatically than we despair the enfeebled state of our civic life is another aspect of the current disconnect. The mayoral debate this week provides merely the most immediate path to validating these claims. Bill de Blasio, an unpopular incumbent who maintains the fantasy that he is a national voice on progressive issues, went up against two opponents: the Republican Nicole Malliotakis, a representative in the State Legislature who looks at glaringly low crime statistics and manages to see Hell’s Kitchen in 1975, and Bo Dietl, a former detective, running as an independent who, aside from his various crimes against decorum and syntax, last spring admitted that he had been hired by Fox News to investigate and discredit the women who said that they had been victims of sexual harassment there. Episodes of the “Real Housewives” have delivered less shouting and more illumination. At the same time, Manhattan’s district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., a Democrat whose political ambitions were supported by a celebrated last name (his father was secretary of state in the 1970s) is running for re-election unopposed. This must now serve as a source of regret to anyone who might have considered mounting a challenge. Recent revelations have Mr. Vance refusing to prosecute Harvey Weinstein for sexual assault and Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. for fraud, despite significant evidence. Investigative reports have noted a backdrop of contributions made to Mr. Vance’s campaign from lawyers representing the prospective defendants. Mr. Vance and members of his team have maintained that in each case there was insufficient proof to go forward, and yet Mr. Vance did return the contribution from the Trump lawyers after details were publicized. Capitalizing on the moment, Marc Fliedner, a former prosecutor in Brooklyn and civil rights lawyer, presented himself as a write-in candidate. In Staten Island there is the spectacle of Michael Grimm, a Republican working to reclaim the congressional seat he lost when he pleaded guilty to tax fraud and went to prison. “I am absolutely absorbed with the question of how you get better people into politics,” Richard Ravitch, the businessman, former lieutenant governor in New York and longtime consigliere to state and city officials, told me. “I teach a lot; I’m around young people, and no one wants to run for office anymore.” The cult of money is at least in some part to blame, given how many young people come to the city with the pronounced aspiration to make lots of it, and given how severe an impediment the high cost of living here can be to time spent in public service.

"CAIRO — After a decade of hostility and recrimination, the two main Palestinian factions came together in Cairo on Thursday to sign a reconciliation deal that holds out the tantalizing prospect of a united Palestinian front. Hopes for the agreement, signed under the watchful eye of Egyptian intelligence, were tempered by the knowledge that many previous Palestinian initiatives have failed. Yet there is optimism that this time may be different, partly because the stakes are so much higher. For the two million Palestinians of Gaza, trapped in a tiny coastal strip that is frequently compared to an open-air prison, the Cairo deal offered a potential respite from their lives of dire shortages of electricity and lifesaving medicine, as well as a chance to travel to the outside world. For the Palestinian leadership, it held out the prospect of negotiating with Israel with a single voice, even as it forced the divided territory’s most radical militants to make painful concessions that acknowledged their own failure to advance their cause. Hamas, which controls Gaza and has fought Israel three times, said it was ready to cede control of Gaza’s borders and allow the rival Palestinian Authority to effectively take over the day-to-day running of the territory. It was a sobering reality check for a group that, despite years of fiery defiance and arms supplies from Iran, cannot rule Gaza without help from Fatah, the rival faction that controls the Palestinian Authority and was driven out of Gaza in violent clashes 10 years ago.

"On July 14, 2016, as French families strolled along Nice’s seafront promenade, a Tunisian man driving a large truck rammed into a crowd, killing 86 people. A month later, the mayor of nearby Cannes declared that “burkinis” — a catchall term for modest swimwear favored by many religious women — would be banned from the city’s beaches; a municipal official called the bathing suits “ostentatious clothing” expressing an “allegiance to terrorist movements that are at war with us.” One of the law’s first victims was a third-generation Frenchwoman who was ordered by the police to strip off her veil while onlookers shouted, “Go back to your country.” Still, many French politicians and intellectuals rushed to defend the ban. The former president Nicolas Sarkozy called modest swimwear “a provocation”; Alain Finkielkraut, a prominent philosopher, argued that “the burkini is a flag.” But what they presented as a defense of secular liberal values was in fact an attack on them — a law, masquerading as neutral, had explicitly targeted one religious group. When rapid immigration and terrorist attacks occur simultaneously — and the terrorists belong to the same ethnic or religious group as the new immigrants — the combination of fear and xenophobia can be dangerous and destructive. In much of Europe, fear of jihadists (who pose a genuine security threat) and animosity toward refugees (who generally do not) have been conflated in a way that allows far-right populists to seize on Islamic State attacks as a pretext to shut the doors to desperate refugees, many of whom are themselves fleeing the Islamic State, and to engage in blatant discrimination against Muslim fellow citizens. But this isn’t happening only in European countries. In recent years, anti-immigration rhetoric and nativist policies have become the new normal in liberal democracies from Europe to the United States. Legitimate debates about immigration policy and preventing extremism have been eclipsed by an obsessive focus on Muslims that paints them as an immutable civilizational enemy that is fundamentally incompatible with Western democratic values. Yet despite the breathless warnings of impending Islamic conquest sounded by alarmist writers and pandering politicians, the risk of Islamization of the West has been greatly exaggerated. Islamists are not on the verge of seizing power in any advanced Western democracy or even winning significant political influence at the polls. The same cannot be said of white nationalists, who today are on the march from Charlottesville, Va., to Dresden, Germany. As an ideology, white nationalism poses a significantly greater threat to Western democracies; its proponents and sympathizers have proved, historically and recently, that they can win a sizable share of the vote — as they did this year in France, Germany and the Netherlands — and even win power, as they have in the United States.

"The actress Rose McGowan said in an Instagram post overnight that her Twitter account had been temporarily locked after a series of posts about Harvey Weinstein’s misconduct, including toward her. “TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE,” Ms. McGowan wrote on her Instagram page after midnight Eastern time on Thursday. She included a snapshot of a message from Twitter saying she would be able to send only direct messages from her account unless she deleted tweets that violated Twitter rules. The screenshot announced a temporary freeze that prevented her from tweeting, retweeting or liking for 12 hours. Unlike a full suspension, this measure left her account visible. The message in the screenshot said the lock was in effect because Ms. McGowan’s account had “violated the Twitter rules.” By midmorning on Thursday, as the Twitter universe was in full steam about Ms. McGowan’s situation, the company moved to explain its actions. In a statement, a Twitter representative said Ms. McGowan’s tweets had violated the company’s privacy policy because one of them included a phone number. "
"Fashion has an addiction problem. I am not talking about illicit substances here, though the industry’s past issues with those have been well documented. Rather, I am talking about illicit … well, talk. Gossip. It seems unable to stop, and it is getting worse. In Paris last week there was more leaking going on in the maisons of Avenue Montaigne than in the Trump White House. Rumors were rampant on the front row and in the back rooms; during dinner parties and over cocktail canapés. This designer was leaving this brand. That designer was coming. This house was firing that guy. That creative director was wildly unhappy. The whispering went beyond the Kim Jones-to-Versace rumors, which may be true but are largely presented as fact. (Remember what happened to the last Versace fact, that Riccardo Tisci was taking the helm? Nothing!) It went beyond the knock-on speculation about what would happen at Louis Vuitton men’s wear if Mr. Jones left that label and who might be migrating there (though that was a big topic of discussion). It encompassed at least three other big brands that were maybe, possibly, it could happen, undergoing a change. Some of the talk made no sense at all. Some of it was plausible. None of it was officially denied or confirmed, which meant it continued to gain currency. I have never heard so much flagrant muckraking. I’d like to say this season was an anomaly, but actually I think this may be the new normal. It’s all hearsay, all — or most of — the time. And that is a problem not just for the brands and people involved — not just for the designers, executives and, perhaps more important, all the relatively unsung men and women who work in the ateliers and on the design teams — but also for the clothes we are all supposed to wear.

Here’s what you need to know: • The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, above, had a question for Catalonia’s separatists: Did you declare independence or not? Mr. Rajoy said the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, had sown “deliberate confusion” in his latest speech and gave him until Monday morning to respond. Pending that reply, Mr. Rajoy said he was initiating a request to invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would allow Madrid to suspend Catalan lawmakers and take charge of the region’s administration. _____ "
"A new talk-show host arrives on BET with a fresh perspective. And two shows with rabid fan bases return to the CW. THE RUNDOWN WITH ROBIN THEDE 11 p.m. on BET. Ms. Thede, formerly the head writer for “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore,” will dive into her own show on Thursday as the only black female talk-show host on the air. And there will be another distinction that separates her from the pack: “We’re not going to spend a half-hour telling you Trump is bad, because black people didn’t vote for him anyway,” she told The New York Times in an interview this week. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 8 p.m. on BBC America. Twenty-five years before his methodical, menacing turn on “Westworld,” Anthony Hopkins changed cinema by slipping into the role (and mask) of Hannibal Lecter in Jonathan Demme’s psycho-thriller. His seductive frostiness and overwhelming brilliance led the American Film Institute to name him the greatest villain of the century; his electric and terrifying tête-à-tête with Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) still induces shivers. GOTHAM 8 p.m. on Fox. The young Bruce Wayne of this Batman origin series continues to mature and embrace darker and more theatrical impulses. In this episode, Bruce (David Mazouz) seeks to uncover the meaning of a knife that seems to incite violence wherever it goes. Meanwhile, Ra’s al Ghul (Alexander Siddig) goes to extremes to achieve what he wants. ARROW 9 p.m. on the CW. Two shows with rabid fan bases return to the CW on Thursday night. Season 5 of “Arrow,” the ever soapy and explosive superhero series, ended with a literal bang: The Lian Yu island blew up, leaving the survival of almost every character (except for the protagonist, Oliver Queen, and his son) in doubt. The showrunners have teased that Thursday’s season premiere will take place five months after the explosion — and will feature the death of a major character. At 8, SUPERNATURAL returns for its 13th (count them!) season; it’s the network’s longest-running show, and a spinoff is in the works. The rugged Winchester brothers, who inspire fan conventions all over the world, will continue to battle demons — emotional and literal — after deaths in their family. I LOVE YOU, AMERICA on Hulu. Sarah Silverman threw herself into the 2016 election with brio and bite, campaigning for Bernie Sanders and then scolding his rabble-rousing supporters at the Democratic National Convention. (“You’re being ridiculous,” she said to jeers while onstage with Al Franken.) Her new series continues her pursuit of political and social issues, as she traipses across the country to talk with people who share and abhor her views. But this won’t be a complete about-face for the potty-mouthed comedian. “Anything heady or even trying to be intellectual is sandwiched in a very, very bready sandwich of aggressively stupid,” she told Jimmy Fallon about her new series.

"Owners of Wall Street banks are being taken for a Washington ride. The S. & P. 500 Bank Index has surged 12 percent since Sept. 8. That is not justified by the trajectory of earnings, as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results Thursday that were no better than steady. Tax cuts would support higher stocks, but they’re at best some way off. In the meantime, banks have other concerns. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo each trade around 50 percent above their book value. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are neck-and-neck at some 1.3 times book, while the laggards Bank of America and Citigroup trade at par. Using the rule of thumb that big banks need to deliver 10 percent returns for their shareholders, JPMorgan Chase’s valuation means it ought soon to be cranking out a 15 percent return on book equity. Yet the bank run by Jamie Dimon will hit a return on equity of only 13.6 percent by 2020, according to estimates collated by Thomson Reuters. Across the first three quarters of 2017, it managed only an annualized 11 percent. If President Trump and Republicans in Congress succeed in cutting corporate tax rates to, say, 25 percent from the current 35 percent headline rate, that could, in theory, improve any taxpaying American company’s net profit by 15 percent — turning JPMorgan Chase’s sub-14 percent return into one above 15 percent. It’s a similar story at Citigroup. A return on equity of just over 7 percent so far this year, increasing to an estimated 8.7 percent in 2020, could get near 10 percent with lower taxes. The trouble is, that wouldn’t just require difficult tax legislation. It also needs banks to dodge problems elsewhere. Sluggish loan growth is one. That’s especially true for large banks, where lending has grown just 1 percent this year, compared with 6 percent at smaller banks, according to the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan managed a 3 percent increase in the year to September — though core loans grew faster. Citigroup’s loan book expanded by 2 percent. Loan defaults are rising, too. Citigroup has already warned of higher losses in its United States credit-card unit. Even share buybacks, which reduce book equity and share count, thus increasing return on equity and earnings per share, offer less bang for the buck: bank stocks are over a third more expensive than on the eve of the election last November. There may be no obvious calamity ahead. But there are enough obstacles to slow American bank bulls down. "
"On just the first day of a war between the United States and North Korea, according to a Stanford University assessment, one million people could be killed. Yet after my five-day visit to North Korea with three New York Times colleagues, such a nuclear war seems terrifyingly imaginable. In the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, it was clear that President Trump’s threat to “totally destroy” North Korea had backfired and is being exploited by Kim Jong-un for his own propaganda and military mobilization. The country has seized on Trump’s words to reinforce its official narrative that its nuclear arsenal is defensive, meant to protect Koreans from bullying American imperialists. And North Korean officials use Trump’s bombast as an excuse for their own. “The American Trump uttered nonsense about demolishing our country,” a military officer, Lt. Col. Hwang Myong-jin, told me. “So as soon as our supreme leader gives us an order, we will turn the entire country of the U.S. into fire.” One typical propaganda image shows a powerful North Korean soldier stepping on the face of an evil-looking blond American soldier and reads, “Death to invaders.” Kim doesn’t want to appear weak and seem as if he is caving to American pressure, and officials in North Korea repeatedly cited Trump’s threats to justify their military mobilization and their reluctance to engage in dialogue or conciliation.

"Don’t say that we weren’t warned. In a September 2015 speech before the National Press Club in Washington, the Louisiana governor and Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal said: “Donald Trump is dangerous. But not in the way you think. Many people think he’s dangerous. They say, ‘Well, you wouldn’t want somebody like that with such a hot head with his fingers on the nuclear codes.’ And yeah, that’s certainly true. That’s not the real danger. The real danger is that ironically Donald Trump could destroy America’s chance to be great again.” During the second Republican presidential debate that same month, the CNN anchor Jake Tapper referred to Jindal’s concern about Trump and the nuclear codes, and asked Carly Fiorina, “Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump’s finger on the nuclear codes?” Fiorina hemmed and hawed, deflected and redirected, doing anything not to say what everyone knew — that Trump with the nuclear codes was a horrible idea. Jeb Bush also cowered when the question was put to him. But Rand Paul was forthright and forceful, saying: “I think really there’s a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. I’m very concerned about him, having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his visceral response to attack people on their appearance — short, tall, fat, ugly — my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?” During a December 2015 Republican debate, Dana Bash, the CNN anchor, referred to a statement Ted Cruz made on the campaign trail about his actual beliefs about Trump and nuclear weapons, saying, “Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to attack Mr. Trump in public.” She continued, “But you did question his judgment in having control of America’s nuclear arsenal during a private meeting with supporters.” Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign, in a foreign policy speech in June 2016, “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.” "
"Thanks to Ivana Trump’s new memoir, we now know that Donald Trump once did have a dog. Well, actually it was Ivana’s. A poodle named Chappy. And Donald didn’t like him. Nevertheless, this appears to be the closest our current president ever came to having a pet, so attention must be paid. This is possibly the biggest insight in “Raising Trump,” by Donald’s first ex-wife. (We are not going to go into her contention that people who have been married more than 10 years seldom have sex more than “a few times a month.”) I’m sort of presuming that you’re not going to read it, despite the fact that it includes several recipes. So let me summarize. The book is supposed to be about good parenting. But the most important thing you learn is that we can never say another mean thing about Donald Jr. again. Really, it sounds like the worst childhood ever. His story begins with Dad resisting the idea of naming the baby after him, in case his first born turned out to be “a loser.” As a toddler, Don Jr. broke his leg due to a negligent babysitter. Then one day when Ivana was out of town, he and Eric called hysterically to report they had found their nanny unconscious in the basement. (She died.) Wait, there’s more: During their infamous divorce, Dad sent a bodyguard from his office to get Junior, announcing: “You’re not getting him back. I’m going to bring him up myself.” "
"“You can’t get sick now” in Puerto Rico, Lisandra Figueroa told The New York Times after her father died last week when breakdowns in supplies and transportation deprived him of bottled oxygen. Three weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, scarce medical supplies, equipment and power mean illnesses easily treated under normal conditions now can be a death sentence in remote areas. Puerto Ricans who suffered injuries in the storm, who contracted infections from polluted floodwaters or drinking water, or who have chronic conditions requiring continuous care are not receiving help, and are dying. The humanitarian crisis affecting 3.4 million American citizens will not be helped by the administration’s allowing the expiration this week of a waiver of the Jones Act, which prohibits foreign-flagged or foreign-built ships from carrying goods from the mainland to the island commonwealth. (And it doesn’t help that on Thursday, President Trump threatened to withdraw FEMA and first responders from the island, in one of several cruel, misguided gestures he has already made.) While President Trump, since touching down for a photo op in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, has been focused on his usual schedule of tweets, insults and golf, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been hauling away tons of debris and contending with power and communications problems in their effort to deliver water, food and tarps for tens of thousands of homes without roofs. But residents’ needs have exceeded what the government has provided, and aid organizations have been forced to become ever more creative in filling the gap, delivering items like generators and medical supplies to the island, particularly its stricken interior. Securing the goods is the easy part. Delivering them to port, warehousing them and trucking them to people in need are the battles that will determine the outcome of the war. Some of the biggest humanitarian organizations arrange their own logistics. But most organizations must buy those services, and after large-scale disasters even the largest groups must scramble to supplement their networks. Delivery logistics consumes 60 to 80 cents of every aid dollar contributed, aid groups say, even without the headaches involved in actually finding and scheduling reliable transportation to disaster-stricken areas where communications are down and roads destroyed.

"Read the latest details on the freeing of this couple here. WASHINGTON — An American woman and her Canadian husband who were held hostage by militants in Afghanistan for five years have been freed along with their young children, President Trump said on Thursday, ending a case that has long frustrated diplomats and F.B.I. agents trying to secure their release. Pakistan’s military said that “through an intelligence-based operation,” it took custody on Wednesday of the hostages from the Haqqani network, the Taliban faction that had seized Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her husband, Josh Boyle, 34, in 2012. The Pakistani military pledged to repatriate them, and American intelligence agencies were tracking the hostages as they crossed into the rugged tribal areas of northwest Pakistan. The Trump administration and the Pakistani government worked together to free them, Mr. Trump said, but a senior American official said Pakistan’s intelligence service arranged the handover of the family after being pressured by American officials.
