"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller, the former F.B.I. director, above, to serve as a special counsel to oversee its investigation into Russian meddling in the election. The appointment of Mr. Mueller dramatically raises the stakes for President Trump in the multiple investigations into his campaign’s ties to the Russians. While a special counsel would remain ultimately answerable to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — and by extension, the president — he would have greater autonomy to run an investigation than a United States attorney. _____ 2. “No politician in history, and I say with surety, has been treated worse, more unfairly.” President Trump used his commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy to portray himself as mistreated by the media.

"CANNES, France — After weeks in the desert, dehydrated and afraid, refugees and migrants who are apprehended crossing the United States-Mexico border are regularly locked in what are called las hieleras: the freezers. They are meant to be short-term holding cells — they have no beds — but they also exact a kind of extrajudicial punishment. As revealed by a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015, migrants are trapped there for nearly two days on average. Children are separated from their families; detainees are deprived of food. Sometimes their lips split. Sometimes their skin turns blue. The cold of the hieleras is the first thing you feel in “Carne y Arena” (“Flesh and Sand”), a groundbreaking hybrid of art exhibition, virtual reality simulation and historical re-enactment by the Mexican film director Alejandro G. Iñárritu on view here ahead of its art-world debut in June at the Prada Foundation in Milan. You enter a cold-storage chamber, spare but for a few industrial benches, and are instructed to remove your shoes and socks. Dusty slippers and sneakers, recovered from the border zone, litter the floor. Barefoot, you exit the cold room and enter a larger one, its floor covered with sand. Attendants equip you with an Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset, headphones — and a backpack. The darkness gives way, and you find yourself on the border, and in danger. In the gloaming you can make out an old woman who has broken her ankle, moaning in Spanish for help; a people-smuggler, or coyote, complains in English that they’re slowing down. You can walk through the sand to get close to them, since your headset is equipped with a motion detector. But soon a helicopter appears overhead, its spotlight bearing down on you, and border agents with guns and dogs are ordering you in two languages to put your hands up. With a rifle in your face, you instinctively throw your hands in the air. Politically urgent and technically accomplished, “Carne y Arena” is the first virtual-reality installation to screen in the official selection of the Cannes Film Festival, which opened its 70th edition this week. Its debut here in an airplane hangar, far from the glamorous Croisette, is a foretaste of its display in arts institutions. Along with its showing at the Prada Foundation, which produced the work with Legendary Entertainment, it will also travel to two museums on either side of the border that President Trump has promised to divide with a wall. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art will host “Carne y Arena” starting in July; the Tlatelolco museum in Mexico City will also feature the VR work this summer. Museums will most likely provide a better context for this powerful three-room installation than the world of cinema. Mr. Iñárritu’s virtual reality, or VR, project has a sternness and resolve similar to some of his previous movies, notably the survivalist epic “The Revenant” and the California-Mexico strand of “Babel,” which netted a best director prize here in 2006. But “Carne y Arena” is not a film, and it succeeds by acknowledging that virtual reality is a wholly different medium, posing different theoretical and narrative challenges. Editing, essentially, is gone. Framing is gone too. Characters must be positioned in three dimensions, not just two. The medium is almost a hybrid of video game and live theater, and to excel, you have to think like a philosopher as much as a techie. “Carne y Arena” took Mr. Iñárritu four years to figure out — he made the relatively low-tech “Revenant” in the process — but he got there. In “Carne y Arena,” whose virtual-reality component runs about seven minutes, traditionally photographed landscapes provide the backdrop for digitally rendered performers. Advances in technology — along with the sand beneath your feet — make the experience truly transporting, and as the dust rises from the ground, you quickly forget that the Riviera is right outside. (The outdoor images, detailed and menacing, were shot near the border by Emmanuel Lubezki, known as Chivo, Mr. Iñárritu’s frequent collaborator.) "
"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department appointed Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel on Wednesday to oversee the investigation into ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russian officials, dramatically raising the legal and political stakes in an affair that has threatened to engulf Mr. Trump’s four-month-old presidency. The decision by the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, came after a cascade of damaging developments for Mr. Trump in recent days, including his abrupt dismissal of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and the subsequent disclosure that Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to drop the investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Rosenstein had been under escalating pressure from Democrats, and even some Republicans, to appoint a special counsel after he wrote a memo that the White House initially cited as the rationale for Mr. Comey’s dismissal. By appointing Mr. Mueller, a former federal prosecutor with an unblemished reputation, Mr. Rosenstein could alleviate uncertainty about the government’s ability to investigate the questions surrounding the Trump campaign and the Russians. Mr. Rosenstein said in a statement that he concluded that “it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authorities and appoint a special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter.” “My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted,” Mr. Rosenstein added. “I have made no such determination.” "
"David A. Clarke, the Milwaukee County sheriff who once claimed that ISIS and Black Lives Matter activists were forming an alliance to destroy America, said on a radio show Wednesday that he would accept a senior position at the Homeland Security Department. Appearing on a Milwaukee radio show, Sheriff Clarke said he would take over the office that coordinates the Department of Homeland Security’s outreach efforts for state, local, tribal, territorial governments and local law enforcement agencies. The position does not require Senate confirmation. But the White House declined to comment on Sheriff Clarke’s announcement, and the Homeland Security Department, in an emailed statement, said that “such senior positions are announced by the department when made official by the secretary. No such announcement with regard to the Office of Public Engagement has been made.” On the radio program, Sheriff Clarke, known for his cowboy hats and brash statements, said, “I’m both honored and humbled to be appointed to this position, working for the Trump administration.” Sheriff Clarke, who gained national attention when he spoke at the Republican National Convention, is a vocal proponent of gun rights and a member of the National Rifle Association. That association has often brought him into conflict with the Black Lives Matter movement, which was formed after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager, in 2014 Ferguson, Mo. Sheriff Clarke called the Ferguson demonstrators “vultures on a roadside carcass.” This month, a grand jury recommended criminal charges against several staff members at a jail run by Sheriff Clarke in connection with the death of an inmate last year. Terrill Thomas, who had bipolar disorder, died in April 2016 after the staff members cut off the water in his cell for a week. The grand jury did not recommend criminal charges against Sheriff Clarke, who has declined to discuss the matter. The sheriff will replace John Barsa, who is listed as the current acting assistant secretary. After Sheriff Clarke’s announcement, Chris Abele, the Milwaukee County executive, said in a statement, “The appointment of Sheriff Clarke to a position intended to build partnership and engagement is not a decision made by someone interested in partnership or engagement.” Some former Homeland Security Department officials expressed outrage that Sheriff Clarke would take a position at the agency. Juliette N. Kayyem, who was assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter: “I am floored. And feel for my career staff.” Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, wrote in a Twitter post: “Sheriff David Clarke’s unconscionable record makes him unfit to serve. This appointment is a disgrace.” "
"During a private meeting in February with the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, President Trump floated a proposal that, even by the standards of a leader who routinely advertises his disdain for the news media, brought editors and reporters up short. You should consider, Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey, jailing journalists who publish classified information. Presidents are rarely afraid to wrangle and bully reporters, and Mr. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, was pilloried by news organizations for aggressively prosecuting leakers. But Mr. Trump’s suggestion, first reported by The New York Times, breached new territory for political reporters who already consider their profession under siege. “Suggesting that the government should prosecute journalists for the publication of classified information is very menacing, and I think that’s exactly what they intend,” said Martin Baron, The Washington Post’s executive editor. “It’s an act of intimidation.” The White House did not respond on Wednesday when asked if Mr. Trump supported imprisoning reporters who publish stories based on leaked material. The president’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters on Air Force One that Mr. Trump did not believe the Times article “was an accurate representation of that meeting.” Mr. Trump often derides the coverage of him and his administration, even as he submits to interviews with a variety of journalists, including from news organizations that he attacks. He told graduates at the Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday that “no politician in history has been treated worse or more unfairly” by the media. "
"THE END OF EDDY
By Édouard Louis
Translated by Michael Lucey
192 pages. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. $23. It took a few dozen pages to see it, but once I did, it was very hard to unsee: Édouard Louis’s “The End of Eddy” is the “Hillbilly Elegy” of France. Both Louis’s deeply autobiographical novel and J. D. Vance’s memoir are stories by precocious young men about the savagery of their childhoods. Both explore cultures of spectacular violence. Both are set in decaying manufacturing towns — places where the men and women scuff and strain against economic morbidity, class invisibility and narcotizing boredom. Yet these same men and women have a paradoxical relationship with the government, at once resenting its power and depending on its largess. Welfare is as common as rain. Both books became unexpected cultural phenomena. “The End of Eddy” sold 300,000 copies in its first year after publication in 2014, when Louis was 21; “Hillbilly Elegy” has been on The New York Times’s best-seller list for more than 40 weeks. And both authors, after escaping their hometowns against insuperable odds (“You don’t even understand that flight is an option,” Louis writes), have been recruited to interpret nativist movements in their countries. Louis has spent the last three years explaining the allure of Marine Le Pen — just recently in this publication — while Vance spent the run-up to the 2016 election assaying the appeal of Donald J. Trump. In July 2016, Vance had a conversation about Trump with the journalist Rod Dreher that was so popular it crippled the website of The American Conservative. Three weeks later, Dreher published a letter from a reader in France, telling him about “an amazing book on the same subject” but in French: “En Finir avec Eddy Bellegueule.” This analogy has its limits, obviously. “The End of Eddy” is also a gay coming-of-age story; “Hillbilly Elegy” is not. Nor is the context for these two books the same: France is a social democracy, extending to its citizens benefits Americans would find unimaginable; the United States remains, as ever, enthusiastically capitalist, with an instinctive distaste for big government. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The word “impeachment” was bouncing around Washington as lawmakers invited the dismissed F.B.I. chief, James Comey, to address reports that President Trump asked him to scuttle the investigation of Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who did not fully disclose his Russian contacts. “No politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly,” Mr. Trump said. The Justice Department appointed a widely respected former F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller, to serve as a special counsel to oversee its investigation into Russian meddling in the election. _____ "
"TEL AVIV — On Monday, The Washington Post reported that President Trump had disclosed highly classified intelligence to senior Russian officials in a meeting at the White House last week. The intelligence had come from an American ally in the Middle East that had not given permission for such sharing, breaching a cardinal rule of intelligence cooperation among allies. On Tuesday, we learned that this ally was Israel, and that the intelligence reportedly involved information about Islamic State plots to blow up airliners with bombs planted in laptops. The specific accuracy of these press reports is a secondary issue. The primary issue is the affront to protocol, as well as reported concern for the safety of the intelligence source, which was compounded by the impression that the leak came from a witless leader oblivious to the gravitas of his office. Or worse, that Mr. Trump might be a “useful idiot,” sucking up to a wily and authoritarian Moscow regime that serves as his role model. To be sure, leaders, including Israeli ones, do on rare occasion leak classified information. And they have the authority to do so. Often, such leaks reflect a conscious political calculation that the potential reward justifies any possible damage. In such circumstances, the intelligence community simply has to roll with the punches. This instance, however, does not appear to reflect this sort of considered decision making. We can only hope that when confronted with the damage to American interests from this leak, Mr. Trump will learn to be more careful. So what is the likely fallout? As a rule, where allies like the United States and Israel share so many vital interests, the partners have no alternative but to absorb the damage from the leak and continue to share intelligence. This is doubly true for Israel, in view of its considerable strategic dependency on American support. But this event did not come entirely out of the blue for Israel. Back in January, there were reports that American intelligence officials had warned their Israeli counterparts of the risk that Mr. Trump might pass on their intelligence to the Russians. Since that warning has apparently been vindicated, the strategic ramifications both for the United States and for Israel are far-reaching. "
"Wow, Donald Trump can’t even give a commencement speech to the military without making it all about him. “Now I want to take this opportunity to give you some advice. Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve,” the president warned as he was addressing the Coast Guard Academy graduating class Wednesday. How many of you think Trump was envisioning an unjustly embattled seaman? “Look at the way I’ve been treated lately, especially by the media,” he went on. “No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly.” We will pause now to recall that Abraham Lincoln was accused of everything from drunkenness to treason to being a “fungus from the corrupt womb of bigotry and fanaticism” before being assassinated. You’d think Trump would remember that, since he seems to regard himself as an expert on Lincoln. (“Most people don’t even know he was a Republican,” he informed a fund-raising dinner recently.) But no, nobody has been persecuted as much as Donald Trump, despite all he’s done for us. The president also took time out from extolling the Coast Guard’s service to run through the “tremendous amount” his administration has already accomplished. “We’ve saved the Second Amendment,” he bragged. This was presumably his successful fight to make sure that people who are so mentally disturbed they can’t handle their own Social Security benefits still are guaranteed the right to purchase lethal weapons. But the topic of the day at the Coast Guard Academy was protecting America. And since nobody — particularly Trump — can talk about anything except Trump, let’s look at what the president has done recently to assure our security. "
"WASHINGTON — The account from the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey of President Trump pressing him  to drop an investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, has escalated talk among the president’s critics that his actions may amount to obstruction of justice and grounds for impeachment. “Asking F.B.I. to drop an investigation is obstruction of justice,” Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “Obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense.” But several legal specialists across party lines cautioned that talk of impeachment was premature while the facts remained unclear; the White House has denied that Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Comey to drop the case. Still, the early chatter has heightened interest in how the impeachment process works. Here’s what you need to know: The Constitution permits Congress to remove presidents before their term is up if enough lawmakers vote to say that they committed “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Only three presidents have been subjected to impeachment proceedings. Two were impeached but acquitted and stayed in office: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999. A third, Richard M. Nixon in 1974, resigned to avoid being impeached. First, the House of Representatives votes on one or more articles of impeachment. If at least one gets a majority vote, the president is impeached — which essentially means being indicted. (In both the Nixon and the Clinton cases, the House Judiciary Committee considered the matter first.) "
"If President Trump thought that by sacking the F.B.I. director, James Comey, he could kill off the investigation into his associates’ ties to the Russian government and its attempt to deliver him the White House, he was wrong. The investigation will go on, now under the leadership of a former F.B.I. director — and this one the president can’t fire on his own. Robert Mueller III, who was named special counsel on Wednesday to oversee the Trump-Russia investigation, is charged with revealing the truth about suspicions that reach into the highest levels of the Trump campaign and White House. Given the “unique circumstances” of the case, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in making the appointment, a special counsel “is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome” of the investigation. Mr. Rosenstein is absolutely right, and he has done the nation a service in choosing Mr. Mueller, one of the few people with the experience, stature and reputation to see the job through. Mr. Mueller led the F.B.I. for 12 years under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. In 2004, he and Mr. Comey, then deputy attorney general, threatened to resign if President Bush allowed a domestic-surveillance program to continue without Justice Department approval. Mr. Rosenstein, who was upset when the White House initially tried to make him the fall guy for Mr. Comey’s dismissal, showed similar independence on Wednesday. He stood up to a president who has repeatedly signaled he wants no investigation whatsoever. In fact, he refrained from even notifying the White House of Mr. Mueller’s appointment until after he had signed the order. This appointment does not lift the burden on Congress to conduct its own, bipartisan inquiry, nor does it end the need for an independent commission. But under Justice Department regulations, Mr. Mueller will have significant latitude, including to pursue criminal prosecutions, if necessary — although Mr. Rosenstein has the power to overrule him. (Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who would normally have this authority, properly recused himself in March from the investigation because of his own ties to Russia.) Even before the stunning events of the past week, Mr. Mueller would have had plenty to work with. But after the president’s abrupt firing of Mr. Comey on May 9 — followed by his apparent admission that he did so with the Russia investigation in mind, followed by reports that he previously pressed Mr. Comey to pledge his loyalty and asked him to drop a related inquiry into Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser — it became clear that the investigation needed to be kept alive at all costs, and as far from Mr. Trump as possible. Mr. Trump could still interfere by ordering Mr. Rosenstein to fire Mr. Mueller. The last president to order the firing of a special prosecutor investigating his associates was, of course, Richard Nixon. "

may be new to Australia, but The New York Times is not. Our first mention of Australia appeared in print on Jan. 3, 1853, and over the many years that have followed, we’ve published thousands of articles on it — from war reports to book reviews to Op-Eds. I can’t claim to have read them all, but my abbreviated tour through the TimesMachine archives (an amazing resource for subscribers, hint, hint) brought all kinds of revelations about how Australia sees itself, and the way outsiders tend to approach this country’s history and people. One clear conclusion: Even early on, The Times seemed to emphasize the links between Australia and the United States, and the fact that Australia tends to get overlooked. An article from Aug. 6, 1865, for example, begins: What was that struggle about? Land rights — and a fight between those favored by the British and those who were not. “It was a fierce conquest,” the article said, “between democracy and an oligarchic class.” (Someone might say the same thing today about real estate in Sydney.) The 20th century brought more coverage of more complicated issues. In 1922, an Op-Ed asked, “Will Australia Stay White?” In 1925, we published a short mention of Australia’s lifting its ban on immigration from Turkey and other countries it had fought in World War I. "
"WASHINGTON — On Day 118 of the Trump administration, a special counsel was appointed. The word impeachment was uttered on the floor of the House of Representatives. And the president of the United States contemplated how to go forward with the next 1,343 days. The notion that President Trump will actually be impeached seemed like liberal wishful thinking, but a new prosecutor represented a serious threat and Washington was abuzz on Wednesday with the surround sound of scandal. Lawmakers demanded documents. The Dow Jones average fell by more than 370 points. Watergate talking heads flooded cable news shows. For a president who in most polls has never commanded the support of a majority of his public, the accumulated toll of self-inflicted wounds has been a challenge from the start. Now he faces perhaps the most daunting moment of his young administration after his decision to fire the F.B.I. director, his disclosure of sensitive information to the Russians and a report that he tried to shut down an investigation into a former aide. Like other presidents before him who felt under siege, Mr. Trump expressed resentment rather than remorse, insistent that he has done nothing wrong and convinced that he has been persecuted. “No politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly,” he complained to Coast Guard graduates on Wednesday, hours before the appointment of the special counsel. “You can’t let them get you down.” But he is down, and so are his aides, many of whom wait for the ax they fear is coming as they hear whispers of shake-ups. With his first foreign trip as president starting on Friday, Mr. Trump is looking for ways to fend off the attacks and investigations while reinvigorating a presidency that has lost control of its narrative. That became inordinately more difficult at 6 p.m. on Wednesday with the announcement by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, that he was appointing Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel, another term for special prosecutor. "
"“I think Putin gets personal pleasure from exploiting the vulnerable position Trump has found himself in.” VALERIY SOLOVEY, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, about President Vladimir V. Putin’s offer to provide a transcript of the meeting with Russian diplomats at which President Trump disclosed classified intelligence. "
"WASHINGTON — During one of the searing moments that Robert S. Mueller III proved his willingness to stand up to the power of a president, he had his friend, James B. Comey, by his side. It was 2004 and Mr. Mueller, then the F.B.I. director, and Mr. Comey, the deputy attorney general, together blocked efforts by President George W. Bush to reauthorize a secret government surveillance program. After racing to a Washington hospital room, Mr. Mueller and Mr. Comey prevented top Bush aides from persuading a severely ill attorney general to reauthorize the surveillance program over their objections. The scene — and their later threats to resign — became the stuff of legends at the Justice Department and the F.B.I., cementing their reputations for independence. Now, Mr. Mueller, retired after 13 years at the bureau’s helm under Mr. Bush and former President Barack Obama, will oversee a sprawling investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election — and any collusion between President Trump’s campaign and Moscow. The inquiry will include Mr. Trump’s interactions with, and abrupt firing of, the man who until last week had been leading the investigation: Mr. Comey. Mr. Mueller’s role as special counsel also will put him in charge of pursuing the truth about the president’s efforts, if any, to impede the F.B.I.’s investigation. "
"WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn told President Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Mr. Flynn of the inquiry, Mr. Trump made Mr. Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Mr. Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by American intelligence agencies. Mr. Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Mr. Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Mr. Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported. His legal issues have been a problem for the White House from the beginning and are at the center of a growing political crisis for Mr. Trump. Mr. Flynn, who was fired after 24 days in the job, was initially kept on even after the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that he might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to Washington. After Mr. Flynn’s dismissal, Mr. Trump tried to get James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, to drop the investigation — an act that some legal experts say is grounds for an investigation of Mr. Trump for possible obstruction of justice. He fired Mr. Comey on May 9. The White House declined to comment on whether officials there had known about Mr. Flynn’s legal troubles before the inauguration. "
"WASHINGTON — Republicans on Wednesday abruptly pivoted and rushed to call on James B. Comey, who was fired as F.B.I. director by President Trump last week, to testify before several committees, produce memos and provide greater detail of his encounters with the president. After days of showing limited interest in drawing more attention to the emerging controversy about the president’s role in the investigation into Russian election meddling, Republicans were now offering Mr. Comey highly public forums to lay out his version of events. Mr. Comey, who has served as a foil, an object of derision and a political martyr for both parties, is suddenly Capitol Hill’s most-wanted man. On Wednesday, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Mr. Comey with the committee’s vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, asking him to appear in both closed and open hearings before their committee. The two senators also requested that Andrew G. McCabe, the acting F.B.I. director, provide the committee with the memo that Mr. Comey is said to have written suggesting that Mr. Trump asked him to shut down an investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said he planned to extend the same invitation for as early as next Wednesday after vowing to use his power to subpoena Mr. Comey’s memo if necessary. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee — who had largely dismissed the seriousness of the investigations into Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia and other matters — also asked Mr. Comey to appear before his committee. And Mr. Grassley joined Democrats in calling on the F.B.I. to provide all memos relating to Mr. Comey’s interactions with his superiors in both the Trump and Obama administrations and for the White House to provide records of interactions with Mr. Comey, including any audiotapes, which Mr. Trump has suggested he made. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump leaves on Friday for a nine-day, five-city foreign excursion, his first trip outside the United States as the country’s leader and top diplomat. He doesn’t really want to go. In recent days, Mr. Trump has groused to several friends that he is not looking forward to leaving his new White House cocoon for high-profile, high-pressure meetings with dozens of world leaders in unfamiliar settings. At one point, he barked at an aide that he thought his first tour abroad should be only about half as long. He will have to abandon his well-known preference for sleeping in his own bed (or in one at the hotels or golf resorts he owns) as he hops between Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium,  Italy and the Vatican — all places without a Trump-branded property. But the trip comes at a critical moment for Mr. Trump’s young presidency. It is his first opportunity to deliver specifics about his “America first” worldview to a global audience that has watched his initial, chaotic months in the White House with a mix of amusement, befuddlement and alarm. The president’s packed schedule is filled with opportunities for Mr. Trump to slip up, publicly or privately: back-to-back discussions with the leaders of other nations, many of whom are veteran negotiators well versed in issues they care deeply about. By contrast, it could also serve as a much-needed change of subject for a president besieged at home with an agenda frozen by scandal. "
"WASHINGTON — Did you hear the one about the Russians paying off the future president of the United States? It seems House Republicans have. Their two highest-ranking members on Wednesday walked into a firestorm of their own making, negotiating the latest Republican headache after The Washington Post reported that Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, said in a private session last year that President Trump, then a candidate, could be receiving payments from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin immediately intervened during the meeting and brought the conversation to a halt, according to a June recording reviewed by The Post, swearing his colleagues to secrecy amid laughter. The New York Times has not obtained a recording and cannot appraise the tone of Mr. McCarthy’s original remarks. On Wednesday, he said he was just kidding. “It’s a bad attempt at a joke; that’s all there is to it,” Mr. McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol. “No one believes it to be true from any stretch of fact.” The trouble began in June, with a meeting of Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. It was then, according to The Post, that Mr. McCarthy delivered his assessment, playful or otherwise: “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” Mr. McCarthy said. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, is known as Mr. Putin’s most vigorous defender in Congress. Mr. McCarthy’s comments drew some laughter, according to The Post, prompting him to add, “Swear to God.” Mr. Ryan then instructed other attendees not to share the conversation. “No leaks,” he said, according to The Post. “This is how we know we’re a real family here.” The paper reported that spokesmen for Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy at first denied the exchange had taken place until being told that The Post would cite a recording. On Wednesday, Mr. McCarthy and aides to Mr. Ryan repeatedly sought to frame the episode as a stab at levity. Asked whether he still has confidence in Mr. Trump, Mr. McCarthy replied, “100 percent.” Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan, said the remarks were “clearly an attempt at humor.” “No one believed the majority leader was seriously asserting that Donald Trump or any of our members were being paid by the Russians,” Mr. Buck said. His team pointed reporters to news articles detailing Mr. Ryan’s criticisms of Mr. Putin and Russia. At least one member of Congress does not seem to share those foreign policy views in full: Mr. Rohrabacher, long the chamber’s most unapologetically pro-Russian lawmaker. He said Wednesday that he had not taken offense at Mr. McCarthy’s remark, which he also interpreted as a joke. “He sort of makes jokes like that,” Mr. Rohrabacher said. He added that Mr. McCarthy had reminded him of the exchange on Wednesday. “You mean you misspoke? My gosh!” Mr. Rohrabacher recalled saying to Mr. McCarthy, feigning surprise. “Like I’ve never misspoke. I’ve been here 30 years.” "
"Immigration arrests shot up 38 percent in the first three months of the Trump administration compared with the same period last year, according to figures released Wednesday, one of the first clear indications that the president’s hard-line policies are being carried out on a grand scale. While President Trump’s more attention-grabbing ideas have been blocked or stalled, like building a border wall and temporarily stopping travel from some Muslim-majority countries, the statistics released by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement suggested that the more street-level aspects of his immigration agenda have achieved significant results, and quickly. From Jan. 22 to April 29, ICE officers arrested 41,318 people, at a rate of more than 400 people per day, compared with 30,028 over roughly the same period in 2016, the data showed. “These statistics reflect President Trump’s commitment to enforce our immigration laws fairly and across the board,” said Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, on a phone call with reporters. Many of the arrests took place at immigrants’ homes, as teams of agents spread out in the early hours of the morning to catch people before they left for work, a common tactic designed to avoid a public scene. But agents also have been moving more aggressively, taking into custody people who arrived for routine check-ins, and even apprehending people arriving at courthouses on nonimmigration matters. "
"Within the first few pages of “Men Explain Things To Me,” her essay collection on modern gender politics from a feminist perspective, Rebecca Solnit elucidates the ways that physical brutality works as a means of control. “Violence is one way to silence people, to deny their voice and their credibility to assert your right to control over their right to exist,” Solnit writes. This is exactly how Gilead thrives. Violence and silence work in tandem to keep women like Offred in line. But the bodies of handmaids speak volumes even when they don’t open their mouths. Hands lopped off. Eyes plucked out. Bruises. Burns. These marks speak of the high price women pay to survive. In this week’s episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” these emblems of Gilead’s darkness — the blood, the hanged bodies, the handmaids who can’t hide their brutalization — are hidden from sight so that the Commanders can present their society as an enviable portrait of moral fortitude to a delegate from Mexico. This allows the series to hint at how the world beyond Offred’s narrow perspective is faring. People speak of troubling weather patterns, ruined harvests and dour birthrates in Mexico. Handmaids are positioned as important to selling the lie of Gilead’s superiority. This seems to be the perfect opportunity to peel back the stoic layers of other handmaids who are shepherded along with Offred to a grand reception dinner and inspected by Serena Joy. But interiority remains scant for these handmaids, who are mostly silent figures, important only when the show is poised to bludgeon us with another empty girl-power message like the closing scenes of Episode 4. Instead, Episode 6 details the past triumphs and current tragedies of the show’s most enigmatic character, Serena Joy. As played by Yvonne Strahovski, Serena Joy evokes several historical figures, including Ivanka Trump, the televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker and even feminists of the anti-pornography movement like Catharine MacKinnon. Executive producer Bruce Miller, who wrote the episode, doesn’t shy away from presenting Serena Joy as a true believer of Gilead’s rules— indeed, the episode takes its title, “A Woman’s Place,” from a novel Serena Joy published pre-Gilead. But she’s more than just a believer. As the flashbacks demonstrate, she had an active role in establishing the regime. It’s Serena Joy who reassures Fred when he seems regretful over the terrorist attacks they planned to usurp government control. “We’re saving them,” she says as they sit among a diverse set of people in a crowded movie theater. Her politics are abhorrent, but this origin story doesn’t indict Serena Joy; it bathes her in a sympathetic light. She’s a complex woman who thought her beliefs about “reproduction as a moral imperative” were the salve for a disintegrating world. She didn’t expect it would lead to a loveless marriage with a man who no longer respects her intellect or to empty days spent tending the rose garden. That the Mexican delegate, Mrs. Castillo (Zabryna Guevara), is a woman is an even more cutting reminder of what Serena Joy has lost. Strahovski makes a meal out of every scene she’s in. Serena Joy goes soft when Mrs. Castillo quotes her book, describing it as a “thoughtful argument for domestic feminism.” Her jaw locks as she’s needled about her current role in society. Her icy facade cracks to reveal a woman of blistering ambition and longing. She ignores the prying eyes of other commanders and their wives when her past is dredged up, full of holding rallies and getting arrested. “Back then, did you ever imagine a society like this — a society in which women can no longer read your book or anything else?” Mrs. Castillo asks, striking at the heart of Serena Joy’s contradictions. Serena Joy is cunning but thwarted from attaining true power. She yearns for a better world but sees no problem with the horrors enacted to make that world possible. Strahovski nails the subtlety required to communicate Serena Joy’s mix of vulnerability and steeliness. "
"In case you’ve had the pleasure of forgetting, “The Flight 93 Election” was the title of a portentous essay, published last September under a Roman pseudonym in The Claremont Review of Books, that declared the stakes for the United States in 2016 thus: “Charge the cockpit or you die.” In the lurid imagination of the author — it turned out to be Michael Anton, who now holds a senior job in the White House — the American republic was Flight 93, a plane deliberately set on a course for destruction by liberals and their accomplices in the Republican establishment and the globalist “Davoisie.” As for Donald Trump, Anton implied that he was the political equivalent of Todd Beamer, the heroic passenger who cried “Let’s Roll” in a desperate bid for salvation. “You may die anyway,” Anton warned. “You — or the leader of your party — may make it into the cockpit and not know how to fly or land the plane. There are no guarantees. Except one: If you don’t try, death is certain.” And here we are, not four months into the collapsing Trump presidency, living Anton’s dreams. In recent days, the radio host Michael Savage has acknowledged “the administration is in trouble.” John Podhoretz in the New York Post and later The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page each compared Trump to Jimmy Carter — the most damning of all conservative indictments. Then there’s Ann Coulter. In an interview with The Daily Caller, the author of “In Trump We Trust” said of the presidency that “it has been such a disaster so far,” and that it was possible that “the Trump-haters were right.” She even dropped the f-bomb — “fascist” — to describe Trump’s hiring of his relatives to senior White House posts. “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost Middle America,” Lyndon Johnson is reputed to have said (perhaps it’s apocryphal) after the CBS anchorman said in 1968 that the Vietnam War was unwinnable.

"UNITED NATIONS — The number of children traveling by themselves among documented refugees and migrants has nearly quintupled to the highest on record, and many of them are at risk from smugglers, sex traffickers and other predators, the United Nations said in a report published on Wednesday. The report said the findings amounted to an alarming international lapse in providing basic safety and security for the world’s most vulnerable people. “One child moving alone is one too many, and yet today, there are a staggering number of children doing just that,” said Justin Forsyth, the deputy executive director of Unicef. “We as adults are failing to protect them.” At least 300,000 unaccompanied and separated children were recorded in 80 countries in 2015 and 2016 combined, compared with 66,000 in 2010 and 2011, the report said. The 300,000 figure included 170,000 children who had applied for asylum in Europe and 100,000 who had been detained at the border between Mexico and the United States. In a telephone interview, Mr. Forsyth said the report documented not only a rapid rise in the number of unaccompanied children but also “a lot more abuse” by traffickers and members of organized crime who exploit them. He also said the numbers in the report understated the problem because they reflected only children found among registered populations of refugees and migrants. “This is the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “Many children who never register fall into the hands of smugglers. The real number is much bigger. We lack an enormous amount of data.” Mr. Forsyth said the release of the report was timed to come ahead of the Group of 7 summit meeting on May 26 and 27 in Taormina, Sicily, where the refugee and migrant crisis will be an important topic. Italy has been the principal entry point for refugees and migrants making the treacherous Mediterranean crossing from Africa, and the United Nations report said roughly 90 percent of children undertaking that voyage were traveling alone — mostly from Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Guinea and Nigeria. The report urged the Group of 7 participants, which will include President Trump, to strengthen protections for child refugees, including by ending their detention at border crossings, finding ways to keep families together and combating the “discrimination, xenophobia and stigma” that often victimizes uprooted children.

"A substantial fall on Wall Street cooled demand Wednesday night at a Christie’s auction of contemporary works that was regarded by many as the first serious test of the art market in the Trump economy. The 71-lot sale raised $448.1 million with fees against a low estimate of $339 million. Ninety-six percent of the works found buyers — helped by the auction house’s guaranteeing the minimum price of no fewer than 39 works — but bidders were conspicuously cautious, and few lots sold significantly above their estimates. Fifty-five percent of the lots were bought by American bidders, Christie’s said. “If Wall Street hadn’t taken a dive, there would have been fireworks,” said David Benrimon, a New York dealer. “While the sale was strong over all, it did change the mood among American bidders, and these contemporary sales are about Americans.” The core of Christie’s sale was a group of 25 works formerly owned by the eminent Kings Point, N.Y., collectors Emily and Jerry Spiegel, who both died in 2009. In September, their collection was divided between their daughters, Pamela Sanders and Lise Spiegel Wilks, who were reported to be feuding. Ms. Sanders is selling a total of 107 pieces with a value of more than $100 million at Christie’s while Ms. Wilks will be offering a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting valued at $60 million at Sotheby’s on Thursday night. Both sisters have been guaranteed minimum prices by the auction houses. Ms. Sanders’ most highly valued Spiegel collection works at Christie’s were Sigmar Polke’s 1964 Ben-Day dot canvas, “Frau mit Butterbrot,” and “Untitled,” a 1988 Christopher Wool word painting emblazoned with “PLEASE” six times. Both works sold toward the low end of their estimates to telephone bidders, for $17 million and $17.2 million. "
"BRUSSELS — American and European officials met on Wednesday in Brussels to discuss aviation security after the United States Department of Homeland Security said it was considering a ban on laptop computers and tablets in the cabins of trans-Atlantic flights. The session, between Elaine C. Duke, the deputy secretary of homeland security, and representatives of various European Union countries and the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, was called after the Europeans asked for clarification about any new restrictions — and the terrorist threats that prompted them. A senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting said that certain European officials were given insight into a developing aviation security threat. Terrorist groups, the official said, were pursuing various innovations, including putting explosives in consumer devices. The official added that the homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly, could impose the measure in the next several days or weeks. A senior European Union official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks, confirmed that the Americans shared information about what was behind the reports about the proposed restrictions.

"The Trump presidency may now be disintegrating, tumbling toward entropy. By firing James Comey as F.B.I. director, President Trump set in motion the appointment Wednesday evening of Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller is a Trump nightmare: a pro who ran the F.B.I. for 12 years and is broadly respected by both parties in Washington for his competence and integrity. If Trump thought he was removing a thorn by firing Comey, he now faces a grove of thistles. One crucial lesson here: Pressure matters. It was public opinion that stalled the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, and it is public opinion in part that will ensure the integrity of this investigation. While the Justice Department didn’t precisely cave to polls, it truly does matter that a majority of Americans want this cloud over our presidency investigated and removed; legal decisions unfold in a political context. Keep up that pressure, for the coming months may be particularly dangerous. We don’t, of course, know what Mueller will find, and Trump has reiterated his denial of collusion with the Kremlin. Some Democrats seem to assume an investigation will prove a secret deal between Trump and Vladimir Putin, but many smart people I speak to wonder if it will end up more gray. They foresee evidence of collusion by Trump’s aides, and of financial pathways linking Moscow to Trump and his campaign, but perhaps no proof of a quid pro quo involving Trump himself. The aides most at risk may be Paul Manafort and Mike Flynn, and NBC is reporting that multiple subpoenas have been issued for records involving them. In addition, The Washington Post reported Wednesday on a remarkable recording in which House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy declared last June that he believed that Putin finances Trump. Talking with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other leaders, McCarthy said, “I think Putin pays” Trump. When people laughed, McCarthy quickly added, “Swear to God!” "
"TOKYO — Japan’s economic engine may not exactly be roaring, but there is a definite hum in the air. The economy grew for a fifth consecutive quarter at the start of 2017, the longest stretch of growth in more than a decade. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying for four and a half years to coax the economy into a higher gear. Although Japan’s output is still the world’s third-largest, after the United States and China, consistent growth has been elusive — the result of headwinds like a declining population and deflation. Japanese gross domestic product increased by 2.2 percent in annualized terms in the three months through March, the government’s Cabinet Office said in a preliminary estimate on Thursday. The economy has now been expanding for a longer period than at any time since 2005-6, when it grew for six quarters in a row. The pace of expansion also accelerated from the previous quarter, and was stronger than economists had expected. Analysts surveyed by news agencies had forecast a growth rate of 1.7 percent, on average. Exports have been lifting output since the start of the expansion, and they did so again last quarter. A broadly recovering global economy is helping, as is a weaker yen, which makes Japanese cars, electronic components and other goods more affordable abroad. (Japan’s trade surplus irritates the Trump administration, which has criticized some of the country’s practices.) The domestic side of the economy has been shakier, with spending by consumers and businesses mostly weak and inconsistent. But in the latest quarter, consumption and business investment both rose. A warm one, certainly. Output grew 1 percent in all of 2016 — not exactly China-fast, but about twice what economists estimate Japan should be able to achieve given its shrinking pool of workers and consumers. For the first few years after Mr. Abe came to office, in 2012, on a promise to kick-start growth, the economy lurched between expansion and contraction. Now it appears to have found a more stable groove. The government and the central bank have been pouring money into the economy, and there’s little doubt that those moves have helped lift growth. But a crucial ingredient is missing: inflation. The big idea behind “Abenomics,” as Mr. Abe’s strategy is known, was to engineer a rise in consumer prices, which would in turn lift corporate profits and workers’ pay. That, the government said, would make the economy grow not only faster but also more consistently. Prices have barely budged, however, leaving many economists speculating that the current streak, though welcome, will fade. "
"CHICAGO — The Chicago Police Department announced new rules on Wednesday that restrict when officers can fire their guns or use other forms of force. The policy instructs officers to defuse tense situations, requires them to seek aid for wounded suspects and limits the circumstances under which a fleeing person can be shot. “Above all else,” Superintendent Eddie Johnson told a room full of officers and reporters, “we will aim to de-escalate situations peacefully, with the use of deadly force as a last resort.” Chicago officials, and even some longtime skeptics of the department, hailed the new regulations as a sign that the police here are improving even though federal scrutiny of the department has eased since President Trump was inaugurated. But the rules set fewer limits on officers than a draft published in October, and some said they did not go far enough to prevent police abuses. The draft would have required officers to use the “least amount of force necessary,” while Wednesday’s version said only that force must be “objectively reasonable, necessary and proportional.” The new regulations were perceived as one early measure of how cities under pressure to overhaul their police departments may proceed under an administration that does not favor federal consent decrees as a way to compel change. Craig B. Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said the “watered-down” 42-page policy “shows a significant retreat” from a promise by Chicago’s leaders to address a pattern of civil rights violations described by federal investigators in the final days of Barack Obama’s presidency. Mayor Rahm Emanuel pledged then to work toward a federal consent decree, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions is skeptical of such agreements, and one seems unlikely to materialize. "
"President Trump, hoping to nominate a new F.B.I. director before leaving on a long foreign trip on Friday, interviewed four potential candidates on Wednesday, including Joseph I. Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut. The task of coming up with a credible replacement for James B. Comey, whom the president fired as director last week, has taken on new urgency over the last few days. Mr. Trump accelerated his search after The New York Times reported on Tuesday that he had pressured Mr. Comey to drop his investigation of Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, amid a broader F.B.I. inquiry into possible collusion between the president’s 2016 campaign and Russian officials. Several administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations, described a rushed and fluid process in which the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions had swung nearly hour by hour on which candidate they preferred. Mr. Lieberman’s name surfaced publicly for the first time on Wednesday after Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, added him to the list of candidates Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions were scheduled to interview before the president departs for a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. Mr. Spicer said the other three candidates were the acting F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe; former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, a Republican; and Richard A. McFeely, a former top official at the F.B.I. Mr. Trump is also considering a handful of other candidates, including Raymond W. Kelly, a former New York City police commissioner; Judge Michael J. Garcia of the New York State Court of Appeals; and Alice S. Fisher, a former Justice Department official. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, took his name out of consideration on Tuesday. Mr. Lieberman, 75, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, is friendly with Mr. Sessions. He is also close to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who briefly considered Mr. Lieberman as his vice-presidential running mate in 2008. Mr. Lieberman was Al Gore’s Democratic running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign. Mr. McCain suggested on Tuesday that reports that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to end the Flynn investigation conjured Richard Nixon’s actions during Watergate. "
"Updated Oct. 30, 2017 Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, charged Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign manager, and a business associate with money laundering, tax fraud and foreign lobbying violations. The indictment was the first to be filed since Mr. Mueller took over in May the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and possible links to Mr. Trump and his associates. Mr. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein after Mr. Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director. Here is a look at what Mr. Mueller’s position entails — and doesn’t. Mr. Rosenstein’s letter gave Mr. Mueller the authority to look into not only Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and any coordination with Trump campaign officials, but also “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” And it included a reference to a Justice Department regulation that permits special counsels to investigate attempts to impede their inquiry. That mandate would seemingly give Mr. Mueller a writ to investigate whether Mr. Trump’s interactions with Mr. Comey amounted to obstruction of justice. Given the circumstances, “he is required to look” at whether there was obstruction of justice, said Julie O’Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal law at Georgetown University. “He can’t ignore this.” "
"In 2019, two square blocks in Times Square have been “irradiated,” and in response, President Trump has imposed martial law. That is the backdrop of “Building the Wall,” a new two-character piece by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Robert Schenkkan (“The Kentucky Cycle”) that is one of the first political dramas to imagine explicitly the darkest ramifications of the 2016 election. Mr. Schenkkan’s last New York production, “All the Way,” took us inside the Oval Office of Lyndon B. Johnson. The heart of the new play is a conversation between a liberal African-American history professor (Tamara Tunie) and a white supervisor of a private prison (James Badge Dale), who also happens to be a Trump supporter. “Building the Wall,” which is scheduled for a limited run, through July 9, and is directed by Ari Edelson, displays the theater’s ability to respond quickly to current events.

"To the Editor: Re “When a Child Is Leading the World” (column, May 16): Can we all please stop using “child” and “adolescent” as epithets? David Brooks laid out the ways that President Trump is still a child, and therefore deficient. The three reasons Mr. Brooks gives are that he: 1) can’t sit still; 2) “needs perpetual approval to stabilize his sense of self”; and 3) is unable to “perceive how others are thinking.” Yet none of these flaws are true of children, certainly not the way they apply to Mr. Trump. Most children have no trouble sitting still by the time they reach first grade. Nor do children need “perpetual approval.” If they did, they would find it wanting. Children are also quite adept at understanding the thoughts of others. Most feel sympathy for the suffering of others and are quick to help someone in need, even as toddlers. Donald Trump is a dangerous person, and he occupies a position of unparalleled power. That is the reality that faces the country and the world. Stop insulting children and adolescents by comparing him to them, and hold him accountable for his own offenses. JEFFREY JENSEN ARNETT

"Are your students more interested than ever in making a difference in the world? According to this Feb., 2017 piece, “The Snapchat Cohort Gets Into Politics, and Civics Is Cool,” both liberal and conservative students seem unusually attuned to current events: Of course, teachers rightly avoid telling students what to believe politically, but student civic action projects that grow out of their genuine interests and questions can offer a productive approach to grappling with the news. Below, Steven Zemelman, author of “From Inquiry to Action: Civic Engagement With Project-Based Learning in All Content Areas,” details a five-step process for giving students agency in taking on problems they see in their own communities and in the world — and learning to be responsible citizens along the way. He points out that though some teachers may worry that students will focus exclusively on partisan topics, most are drawn to immediate, local issues rather than those that are directly political. These actions, too, let young people know that their voices matter and their ideas can be taken seriously. _________ Overview: Five Steps for Getting Started Many outstanding teachers guide student civic action in their classrooms, and some have been at it for a long time. In fact, this kind of learning was repeatedly promoted over the past century, as this 1928 article from The New York Times shows. At times, as in this New York City public school project in 1992, foundations have even funded it. What can these projects look like? Chicago high school teacher Elizabeth Robbins explains one approach in the TEDx talk above. "
"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey came to Washington for his first meeting with President Trump with hopes of achieving a “turning point” in an alliance that is vitally important to both sides, but has been profoundly strained by policy issues involving efforts to defeat ISIS in Syria. His demands were mostly unreasonable, which means continued tensions. The enduring image of Mr. Erdogan’s visit will not be the pomp at the White House but that of his security guards and other supporters beating up protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence. The police described the attack as “brutal” and the State Department called it an intolerable assault on free speech. Eleven people were injured, including a police officer, and nine were taken to the hospital. Some Republican lawmakers said Turkey should apologize. The Turkish Embassy blamed the demonstrators for “aggressively provoking Turkish-American citizens who had peacefully assembled to greet” Mr. Erdogan. Washington’s Metropolitan Police will now have to determine accountability. That could be tricky; Mr. Erdogan and his security people are back in Turkey. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has shown a shocking indifference to Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarian crackdown on his own people, which in turn makes it even more important to show that the United States will follow the rule of law. As for policy issues, Mr. Erdogan demanded, among other things, that the United States abandon the Syrian Kurds, whom he views as terrorists. But Mr. Trump had already approved a plan to arm Syrian Kurds so that they can help in the campaign to take Raqqa, the capital of ISIS’ self-declared caliphate. Mr. Erdogan considers the Syrian Kurds to be indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party or P.K.K., a separatist group fighting his government in Turkey. For their part, American military commanders have long argued that the Kurds are among the most skilled fighters in the region and must be part of the ground force if Raqqa is to be recaptured anytime soon. Mr. Erdogan may have thought he could sweet-talk the mercurial Mr. Trump into changing this policy; indeed, some senior American officials feared that this could happen, given Mr. Trump’s fondness for strongmen and the suspicious ties of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to Turkey. But Mr. Trump correctly stuck with his decision to reinforce the Syrian Kurds. "
"WASHINGTON — On the afternoon of May 1, President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, welcomed a high-level delegation of Saudis to a gilded reception room next door to the White House and delivered a brisk pep talk: “Let’s get this done today.” Mr. Kushner was referring to a $100 billion-plus arms deal that the administration hoped to seal with Saudi Arabia in time to announce it during Mr. Trump’s visit to the kingdom this weekend. The two sides discussed a shopping list that included planes, ships and precision-guided bombs. Then an American official raised the idea of the Saudis’ buying a sophisticated radar system designed to shoot down ballistic missiles. Sensing that the cost might be a problem, several administration officials said, Mr. Kushner picked up the phone and called Marillyn A. Hewson — the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, which makes the radar system — and asked her whether she could cut the price. As his guests watched slack-jawed, Ms. Hewson told him she would look into it, officials said. Mr. Kushner’s personal intervention in the arms sale is further evidence of the Trump White House’s readiness to dispense with custom in favor of informal, hands-on deal making. It also offers a window into how the administration hopes to change America’s position in the Middle East, emphasizing hard power and haggling over traditional diplomacy. The Trump administration is expected to frame the deal, worth about $110 billion over 10 years, as a symbol of America’s renewed commitment to security in the Persian Gulf. But former officials pointed out that President Barack Obama, whose arms sales to Saudi Arabia totaled $115 billion, had already approved several of the weapons in the package. “Both sides have an incentive to herald this as a new era in Gulf cooperation,” said Derek H. Chollet, who served as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs under Mr. Obama. “I see this as largely continuity.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump called the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, weeks after he took office and asked him when federal authorities were going to put out word that Mr. Trump was not personally under investigation, according to two people briefed on the call. Mr. Comey told the president that if he wanted to know details about the bureau’s investigations, he should not contact him directly but instead follow the proper procedures and have the White House counsel send any inquiries to the Justice Department, according to those people. After explaining to Mr. Trump how communications with the F.B.I. should work, Mr. Comey believed he had effectively drawn the line after a series of encounters he had with the president and other White House officials that he felt jeopardized the F.B.I.’s independence. At the time, Mr. Comey was overseeing the investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia. Those interactions included a dinner in which associates of Mr. Comey say Mr. Trump asked him to pledge his loyalty and a meeting in the Oval Office at which Mr. Trump told him he hoped Mr. Comey would shut down an investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Trump has denied making the request. The day after the Flynn conversation, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, asked Mr. Comey to help push back on reports in the news media that Mr. Trump’s associates had been in contact with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign.

"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — At the start of each school year, Colombian schoolchildren are still given specially prepared instruction manuals in the form of comic books to teach them how to avoid stepping on land mines. Despite these efforts, during 52 years of war, more than 1,000 Colombian children, usually from the poorest of our farming families working their fields, were killed or maimed by land mines. I ran for president of Colombia to lead a nation where the books we give Colombia’s schoolchildren teach reading, science, math and poetry, not warnings against stepping on explosives. Today – having signed a historic peace agreement between my government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, on Nov. 24 – we are building a peaceful Colombia. In more than 203 Colombian municipalities, the dangerous work of locating, disabling and removing Colombia’s land mines is being carried out by NGOs, specially trained units of the Colombian armed forces and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Our goal is to make Colombia land-mine free by 2021. Last year, we saw the lowest level of violence in our country in more than 40 years. FARC guerillas are turning their arms over to United Nations supervisors. But the agreement does more than silence weapons; it delivers a welcome end to conflict for Colombians, a majority of whom have never lived in a country at peace. The agreement sets out to bridge the historic divide between the Colombia of developed urban centers and that of the vast, impoverished interior, where historically there has been little or no government presence and, as a result, limited security, weak rule of law and deficient health care and education. To close this gap, my government has committed itself to a far-reaching program of rural development for the largely low-income population, including land, titles, credit, roads and crop substitution programs.

"WASHINGTON — Packing to cover a nine-day presidential trip with stops in four countries — Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium and Italy — is a bit more complicated than packing for your typical family vacation. So what are White House correspondents Peter Baker, Mark Landler and I taking with us when we accompany President Trump on his first official foreign trip? Here’s a peek inside our suitcases. Michael: On these presidential trips abroad, I take the usual things: toiletries, a mix of warm-weather clothing (it will be 110 degrees in Saudi Arabia) and cold-weather clothing (a high of 60 in Brussels), and a bunch of ties. But because I’m a technology geek, my packing regimen revolves around my gadgets. I’ve got my MacBook Pro, of course, but also an iPhone 7, an iPad Air, an Apple Watch, AirPods and a big portable battery that can charge all of them. In addition, I always bring a bagful of cables: Lightning, USB-C, Ethernet, wall chargers and some HDMI adapters. The other thing I make sure to do: load my iPad with movies and TV shows, for those hours sitting in a van in the motorcade. For this trip, I’ve got some “Madam Secretary,” “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Designated Survivor” and “Sense8.” Mark: Mark tells me that he never goes on these trips without a baseball cap and 100 SPF sunscreen, a shoulder pillow and eyeshades for sleeping, extra notebooks and noise-canceling headphones for those times on deadline in big ballrooms with hundreds of other reporters. For this trip he’s also taking a stash of euros (borrowed from a colleague who just returned from Europe with extra cash). Asked whether he’s bringing a book to help him with Italian, Mark said he would just use Jason Horowitz, our Rome bureau chief, as his translator. (That’s actually how the two met, when Mark was in Italy on a story years ago and tapped Jason — then a news aide in the Rome bureau — to interpret.) Peter: Peter will pack lighter — in part because he’s covering only the first leg of the trip, to Saudi Arabia and Israel. He says he’ll take a few shirts and a blazer, some suntan lotion and converters so he can charge his phone. On Air Force One, Peter will try to finish a new biography of Mikhail Gorbachev (as a former Moscow bureau chief, he’s reviewing it for The New York Times) and might listen to the audiobook he has on his phone: “Ike’s Gamble,” on President Eisenhower and the Middle East.

"WASHINGTON — Congress fired the official starting gun on its big plans to overhaul the tax code on Thursday, publicly debating, sometimes sharply, the shape of legislation that could affect every part of the American economy. Republicans have been scrambling to find a way to pass an ambitious re-engineering of the tax system in the next six months amid a raft of looming fiscal fights and dysfunction in the White House. Several congressional leaders have expressed skepticism that it will happen this year. But the first public hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee on overhauling taxes gave Republicans a chance to begin the debate. Democrats denounced the rehashing of “trickle down” tax policies of the past. Advocacy groups unfurled new campaigns to kill the central provision of the Republicans’ plan, a border adjustment tax on imports. Facing such daunting obstacles, Republicans insisted that it was now or never for major tax revisions and that they must not let fantasies of a perfect “unicorn” tax code get in the way of getting something done. “While there is no perfect way to tax, there are proven solutions to grow our economy and improve the lives of all Americans,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

"Update | Read the work of this year’s 10 winners here and this year’s runners-up here. _________ For the past four years we’ve invited students to write short editorials about issues they care about, and each year thousands take up the challenge. Students often start with thoughtful questions from their own lives: Why is my school’s athletic program better funded than its music program? Why do we hide in the corner of our classroom during active shooter drills? Why don’t my classmates stand during the Pledge of Allegiance? And they develop sophisticated, sincere and well researched answers in response. Students look at the nation’s and world’s problems and hunt for solutions — to improve the plight of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in China, for example, or to reduce recidivism rates for U.S. prisons. We really like this contest because it asks students to look closely at their world and find something, large or small, they want to change. So, if you don’t like being last in line all the time because your surname starts with “Z,” then take a stand. If you want more characters in books and movies to be more like you, then write about it. If you want society to be less wasteful or more tolerant, then tell the world. Change starts with noticing, thinking critically, and starting meaningful conversations — and that’s what these students have done in their editorials. But winning this contest? It’s no easy task being selected as a winner out of 7,895 entries, a record. How do you make your writing stand out from the piles of other editorials submitted to our contest — especially when you have no more than 450 words to get your point across? Here’s one way: Start strong. Grab our attention in the first few sentences, but don’t take too long to state your argument. "
"Our guide to cultural events in New York City for families with children and teenagers. ABTKids at the Metropolitan Opera (May 20, 11:30 a.m.). Even if the young members of your household haven’t yet developed a taste for ballet, this program will appeal to anyone’s sweet tooth: Among the highlights will be excerpts from Alexei Ratmansky’s “Whipped Cream,” a new production whose characters include a Princess Praline, a Gumball Lady and cupcake children. This hourlong presentation, part of an American Ballet Theater series introducing young people to classical dance, will also include parts of other titles from the company’s spring season: “Swan Lake,” “The Sleeping Beauty,” “Le Corsaire” and “Don Quixote.”
212-362-6000, abt.org FLEECE FESTIVAL at the Prospect Park Zoo (May 20-21, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.). With warm weather arriving, spring is a great time to get a haircut — and that applies to sheep as well as to humans. At this annual Brooklyn celebration, children can watch as the zoo’s Shetland, Cotswold and Jacob sheep are shorn; ask questions of a shearing expert; and help make felt. On Sunday only, starting at 1 p.m., they can also assist in transporting the fleece to the nearby Lefferts Historic House for “Fun on the Farm,” an afternoon of washing, carding and spinning wool the old-fashioned way. A bonus this year: a chance to see the three Shetland lambs that were born at the zoo over Easter weekend.
718-399-7339, prospectparkzoo.com TIM KUBART AND THE SPACE CADETS at Flushing Town Hall (May 20; workshop at 1 p.m., concert at 2:15 p.m.). The name of his band may evoke other worlds, but Mr. Kubart has been quite successful here on earth: He hosts the preschool television show “Sunny Side Up”; his release “Home” won a Grammy Award for best children’s album; and he was co-author of the “Sesame Street” song that introduced Julia, a new Muppet with autism. Now he’s bringing his danceable pop music, which celebrates the adventure in the everyday, to Queens. But first he’s leading young fans in a workshop to design paper bag puppets and perform with them; apparently, he’s a visual artist, too.
718-463-7700, Ext. 222; flushingtownhall.org ‘MEET THE FISHES’ at Pier 40 in Hudson River Park (May 23, 4 to 7 p.m.). Aquatic species can’t shake hands, but at least some will be amenable to tactile introductions at this free event, presented by the River Project, a conservation nonprofit. In addition to offering a “touch tank” filled with creatures like shrimp, mud crabs and mud dog whelks (a type of snail), this celebration will welcome lots of fish and other estuary residents to the Wetlab on the south walkway of Pier 40, where they’ll become subjects for environmental studies. The fun will also include raffles, refreshments (not fish!) and, this year, a special attraction: Three divers will descend into the Hudson to bring up live specimens for observation.

"Our guide to dance performances. AMERICAN BALLET THEATER at the Metropolitan Opera (through July 8). The company continues performances of its first full-length production of the season, “Don Quixote,” staged by Kevin McKenzie and Susan Jones, through Saturday. (Saturday’s evening performance will feature Christine Shevchenko and Thomas Forster in debuts as Mercedes and Espada.) But the spring gala on Monday heralds a new treat: Alexei Ratmansky’s “Whipped Cream,” set to music by Richard Strauss, with whimsical scenery and costumes by the acclaimed pop-surrealist artist Mark Ryden. In the ballet, a young boy samples too many pastries and dreams of Princess Praline and her court. This New York premiere will also be the return of the principal David Hallberg, who has — for too long — been absent from the stage because of injury. He takes on Prince Coffee.
212-362-6000, abt.org VANESSA ANSPAUGH at Danspace Project (May 25-27, 8 p.m.). In “The End of Men, Again,” the choreographer Vanessa Anspaugh reflects on life under President Trump as she explores and critiques male masculinity. Ms. Anspaugh, a lesbian mother of a young son, exorcises masculine archetypes with the help of an entirely cisgender male cast: Massimiliano Balduzzi, Lacina Coulibaly, Tristan Koepke, Gilbert Reyes, Simon Thomas-Train, Connor Voss and Jesse Zaritt. For this choreographer, “The End of Men, Again” — a sequel to “The End of Men; An Ode to Ocean” — is a continuing project that takes on the notions of maleness and femininity and strives to find a place where the two can live together.
866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org DANCE PARADE NEW YORK at Broadway and East 21st Street (May 20, 12:45 p.m.). The theme of this annual celebration is “Dance for Peace.” With more than 150 participating dance groups, the parade is led by four grand marshals: the capoeira master Mestre João Grande; the Broadway dancer Maurice Hines; the techno and house D.J. Frankie Bones; and Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, Democrat of Manhattan. After a ribbon-cutting ceremony, the group will groove its way down Broadway, past Union Square and through Astor Place Plaza; the ultimate destination is Tompkins Square Park, where DanceFest, held from 3 to 7 p.m., will offer social dancing and free lessons.
267-350-9213, danceparade.org MOVE FOR CHANGE DANCE RALLY at Brooklyn Studios for Dance (May 21, 3-7 p.m.). The dancers Colin Stilwell and Sarah White-Ayón, along with Brooklyn Studios for Dance, host a rally in response to the current political situation. In Move for Change, which was inspired by recent protests, Mr. Stilwell and Ms. White-Ayón will call on the dance world to unite for an afternoon rally, featuring live music by AmmoCake, Justice Team, Dorian Wallace and Ryan Wolfe, as well as — of course — dancing. Money raised will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Art Therapy Project.
bksd.org NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through May 28). The Here/Now Festival is nearly over, which means one thing: It’s time to wipe the stage clean with the season’s glorious closer, George Balanchine’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” This 1962 ballet, filled with fairies and butterflies — and, of course, the antics of that mischievous goofball Puck — brings Shakespeare to dancing life in a beloved two-act production that starts out with arguments and misunderstandings and ends with a double wedding. For his version, Balanchine, who played an elf in a St. Petersburg production as a child, choreographed one of his most romantic pas de deux; this serene look at love is a jewel within a jewel.

"What great books will emerge from the Trump era? Novels? Reportage threaded into volumes that will resemble “The Best and the Brightest” or “All the President’s Men”? Cookbooks? (When some of us feel shattered, we turn toward the stove.) One of the finest and least-known books about Richard M. Nixon’s presidency and the shrinking American soul is, of all things, a nonpolitician’s memoir: Charles L. Mee Jr.’s “A Visit to Haldeman and Other States of Mind,” first published by M. Evans & Company in 1977. It’s a moody, patriotic, paranoid (“When politics goes berserk,” Mee writes, “we all go mad”), unbuttoned and deeply literate book about one man’s search for what went wrong with the American experiment, and what still might be worth upholding and defending in our politics. It’s never felt more relevant. It reads like a subversive civics class written by Michael Kinsley by way of Charles Portis, Warren Zevon, Garry Trudeau’s Mike Doonesbury and the madcap 1960s underground journalist Raymond Mungo. It’s a short, strange trip. Mee was and is — now in his late 70s, he’s a professor of theater at Columbia University — a complicated cat. He was in his 30s when he wrote “A Visit to Haldeman.” He’d already composed plays, books of history (“Meeting at Potsdam,” published in 1975, was a main selection of the Literary Guild) and had been the editor of magazines including Horizon and Playbill, the theater guide. He was a twice-divorced Harvard graduate, a proto-hippie, a polio survivor and the co-founder and chairman of the National Committee on the Presidency, which worked for Nixon’s impeachment. He racked up big bar tabs at Elaine’s. "
"Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows. BOAST RATTLE at Union Hall (May 20, 8 p.m.). Kyle Ayers hosts this clever, positive spin on roast battles, which usually feature two comedians slinging insults at each other until one is deemed the champion. Here, however, the comedians will face off to see who can deliver the better compliment. The praise-heaping competitors include Emmy Blotnick, Matt Koff, Josh Gondelman, Maeve Higgins, Giulia Rozzi and Robert Dean, with the D.J. Will Winner.
718-638-4400, unionhallny.com KING HIPPO COMEDY SHOW AND AFTER PARTY at the Mockingbird (May 25, 8 p.m.). This new weekly stand-up show, started by Ayanna Dookie and Mike Brown, aims to fill the void of Thursday night East Village stand-up shows created when the long-running Comedy as a Second Language ended last year. Each King Hippo show will feature a D.J. and an after party. The inaugural lineup includes the comedians Seaton Smith, Jon Laster, Dave Lester and Chloe Hilliard, with music by Thug Passion.

Tape Face, the alter ego of the New Zealand comedian and mime Sam Wills, was a finalist on the most recent season of “America’s Got Talent.” With tape over his mouth all performance long, he mimes full scenes using props pulled from his messenger bag. Although entirely free of speech, his one-of-a-kind shows are far from silent, as he uses musical cues and sound effects to great effect. Tape Face is also known to pull audience members onstage to participate in elaborately goofy and joyful games.

"What happened to conservatism? Two new books — one by Patrick Buchanan, the other about William F. Buckley — trace the movement’s roots and its unexpected Trump-era evolution. Joshua Ferris presents a dynamic story collection full of discord and delusion; Richard Russo’s stories go right ahead and break your heart. And for young readers, new books show how big issues like migration and fracking can change the course of a family and a life. Radhika Jones
Editorial Director, Books TRAJECTORY: Stories, by Richard Russo. (Alfred A. Knopf, $25.95.) In this collection of stories, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Empire Falls” returns to the male archetypes he knows so well. Russo is also a screenwriter now, and one of the characters in this volume appears to be modeled on Robert Redford. The story in which he appears “will abruptly break your heart,” our critic Jennifer Senior wrote. “That’s what Richard Russo does, without pretension or fuss, time and time again.” NIXON’S WHITE HOUSE WARS: The Battles That Made and Broke a President and Divided America Forever, by Patrick J. Buchanan. (Crown Forum, $30.) Nixon’s young aide emerges as the most intriguing figure in his own account, urging his boss to create a new majority anchored by the white working class, not just in the South but also in Northern, mostly Catholic, enclaves. Buchanan’s grand strategy, Joe Klein writes in our review, “has made him one of the most consequential conservatives of the past half-century. Indeed, he’s a reactionary who was also an avatar: the first Trumpist.” A MAN AND HIS PRESIDENTS: The Political Odyssey of William F. Buckley Jr., by Alvin S. Felzenberg. (Yale University, $35.) Felzenberg’s accomplished and admiring biography highlights Buckley’s efforts to exclude “extremists, bigots, kooks, anti-Semites and racists” from the conservative movement. Reading the book in light of events since Buckley’s death in 2008 — from the rise of Sarah Palin to the rise of Donald Trump — one realizes that the odyssey in question is that of conservatism itself. THE DINNER PARTY: And Other Stories, by Joshua Ferris. (Little, Brown, $26.) For some accomplished novelists, short stories are mere doodles, variations on themes better addressed at length. Not so for Ferris. Anxiety, self-consciousness and humiliation are the default inner states of the characters in these 11 stories, which are dynamic with speed yet rich with novelistic denseness. Ferris’s collection is a magnificent black carnival of discord and delusion. "

"The report in The New York Times that President Trump in February asked James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, to stop the investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, by saying “I hope you can let this go” has fueled talk of possible obstruction of justice. Add this to Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey a week ago for his persistence in the investigation of Russian interference in the election, and it seems to some like a clear case of interference in a federal investigation. Although it is easy to claim that a crime might have been committed — especially for political purposes — it turns out that proving obstruction of justice is far more difficult in a criminal prosecution. The appointment of Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel covers the investigation of possible Russian interference with the 2016 election “and related matters.” Mr. Mueller has a broad mandate under Justice Department regulations to investigate matters that include any interference with his office, “such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence and intimidation of witnesses.” That can include seeking out evidence that the president improperly sought to block the investigation of Mr. Flynn. Any inquiry into possible obstruction will confront Supreme Court decisions that have been notably hostile to obstruction cases that push the limits of the law. There is plenty of wiggle room in the statutes that make it difficult to prove the necessary intent to obstruct justice, so gathering credible evidence to show what was in the mind of anyone who might try to impede the investigation will be paramount. There are numerous laws dealing with different types of obstructive conduct in the federal criminal code, like witness tampering, interfering with a federal audit and the examination of a bank. Three broad provisions might apply to the president’s dealings with Mr. Comey, but each has limitations that would require more evidence than currently available to prove a crime. "

The married actors Rebecca Hall (“Machinal”) and Morgan Spector (“Incognito”) play a wedded pair onstage in this new drama by Clare Lizzimore, directed by Gaye Taylor Upchurch for the Atlantic. Ms. Hall stars as an increasingly unhinged woman whose domestic bliss curdles into something a lot less blissful.

"Earlier this month, the federal government announced the completion of an initiative called Project New Dawn, a program whose name suggests a battle to curb escalating rates of depression, or expand space exploration to the outer galaxies. Because of the ferocious pace with which the current presidential administration generates news, it received little notice; enter the term into a search engine, and the first listing that appears is for a service that aids homeless men and women in Australia. Project New Dawn is an operation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency’s homeland security investigations division, and is aimed at dismantling transnational gangs, which President Trump has designated chief among the enemies of public safety. In his dystopian view of the American city, pack violence driven by immigrants, many here illegally, proceeds unreined. It is not the data that have shaped his view. Countless studies have determined that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than those born in this country. Two years ago, a report of the American Immigration Council analyzing 2010 census data showed that the rate of incarceration for immigrant men between ages 18 and 39 — at 1.6 percent — was half the rate for the native-born in the same age range. That sort of disparity has persisted since the 1980s. Gang raids like those involving Project New Dawn have been conducted by immigration officials for more than a decade, though this action, the authorities noted, was the largest to date. Over a six-week period, Project New Dawn yielded 1,378 arrests, most in metropolitan areas around New York, Newark, Houston and Atlanta. Of those arrested, 445, which is to say fewer than a third, were immigrants. Among the total brought in, 104 were members of the notoriously savage MS-13, the Salvadoran gang that the Trump administration has made a focus of its rage. And yet this represented one of the two smallest groups belonging to any one syndicate. Speaking to members of the National Rifle Association’s Leadership Forum last month, Mr. Trump argued that for too long, Washington has gone after “law-abiding gun owners” while making life “easier” for gang members, and singling out MS-13, which has plagued certain localities, Suffolk County on Long Island for example, more than others. Although compiling accurate statistics on gang-related homicides is an extremely difficult business — if a gang member shoots his girlfriend, is that an act of gang violence or domestic assault? — Jessica Vaughan of the nonpartisan Center for Immigration Studies has testified before Congress that her organization, through its examination of open-source material, found that MS-13 was responsible for approximately 40 murders in this country between 2014 and early this year. While the real figure is sure to be considerably higher, it is clearly nowhere near the 33,000 deaths that are attributable to guns in this country every year. "
"When President Trump sets off on his first international trip as president on Friday, his itinerary will include two Middle Eastern countries, Israel and Saudi Arabia, where he explored business deals before taking office. In Israel, Mr. Trump has long sought a tower project in Tel Aviv. But he has shelved that ambition for now, given his self-imposed ban on foreign deals during his presidency and the appearances of embarking on such a venture while attempting to broker peace in the region. In Saudi Arabia, his executives scouted a hotel deal in recent years, but opted not to move forward. Before his inauguration, Mr. Trump handed his business, the Trump Organization, over to his eldest sons and his executives. But even with that distance, Mr. Trump continues to be the face of the company that bears his name, adding an unusual dimension to his foreign tours and diplomatic outreach — with the potential that he could return again as a businessman. In fact, Mr. Trump has registered or applied for a number of trademarks in both Israel and Saudi Arabia in the last decade, according to a review of international trademark databases, in categories that cover both potential real estate development projects and consumer goods. Also, Jared Kushner, his senior adviser and son-in-law, who is expected to be part of the presidential delegation, has his own deep ties to Israel as a real estate developer and investor. His company had joined with one of Israel’s wealthiest families to buy dozens of New York apartment buildings and has borrowed money from Israel’s largest bank. On his trip, Mr. Trump will also visit Belgium, for a NATO meeting; Italy; and the Vatican, where he is planning a meeting with Pope Francis. "
"To the Editor: Re “It’s Chicken or Fish” (column, May 17): Thomas L. Friedman believes that the Republicans in Congress will never jump President Trump’s “Good Ship Lollipop” even if he “resembles Captain Queeg more each day.” He may be wrong. At some point, perhaps soon, they may realize that removing him from office and replacing him with Mike Pence, who is truly one of their own, would be the best possible way to get their agenda back on track. JOHN F. DAVENPORT, NEW YORK To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman suggests that Democrats should give up the fantasy of a Donald Trump impeachment and focus on the 2018 elections to win over the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate. His argument makes good sense. Democrats should not even pursue impeachment. It would be better to run against the presidency of Mr. Trump in 2018 than Mike Pence, a sane, mentally stable, true conservative who would become president if Mr. Trump were impeached and removed from office. But would that be putting politics before country? KENNETH L. ROFF, BROOKLYN To the Editor: Thomas L. Friedman, like too many others, seems to think we can wait until the 2018 elections to counter President Trump’s programs that threaten to tear our country apart. We must ask if it may well be too late to wait until then to solve the problems that are being created virtually daily. I hope not. CLAUDE M. GRUENER, ALBANY "
"Wall Street is finally waking up to the reality in Washington. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.8 percent on Wednesday in the most notable reversal to the so-called Trump rally since last year’s election. Stockholders nevertheless remain too optimistic about any policy uplift. The promise of relaxed regulation, corporate tax cuts, and investment in America’s crumbling roads and bridges under President Trump and a Republican Congress has excited investors for most of the past six months. Clinging to that cheery outlook required overlooking a plethora of warning signals, not least the daily dysfunction in the nation’s capital and the possibility of detrimental decisions on matters such as trade. There were also the slapdash efforts at overhauling United States health care and regular leaks about investigations into potential links between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling into the election. Investors elsewhere have expressed a good deal of concern about the chances of Congress’s passing legislation that might buoy both the economy and corporate bottom lines. The United States dollar index is right back where it was in early November. The 10-year Treasury yield, after soaring to 2.6 percent from under 2 percent, has retreated to 2.2 percent. The biggest market slump since September means equity investors are getting rattled, too. For that to happen, though, it took news that Mr. Trump had asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end an investigation into the administration’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn — along with the ensuing fallout, which has stirred mention of the word impeachment on Capitol Hill. There are, of course, other factors behind the stock market surge. For example, nearly all S & P 500 constituents have reported first-quarter results, revealing average profit growth of about 15 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Interest rates are low, and the employment picture is solid. Even after Wednesday’s wobble, however, bank shares have jumped by more than a fifth, and the broader market is still up by some 13 percent since Mr. Trump won at the polls. That translates into a valuation of about 25 times earnings, a multiple hard to justify without at least factoring in ancillary benefits such as a tax cut. It should mean there is a bigger D.C. discount in store. "
"Before Donald Trump rode the anger of forgotten (white) America to an “America First” presidency, before Breitbart News became a “platform for the alt-right” and before there were “alternative facts” and dueling versions of reality, Roger Ailes saw a divided country but an undivided news media. And he set out to change it. Empowered by Rupert Murdoch, who was intent on upending the traditional news media, Mr. Ailes built a network, the Fox News Channel, that would speak to and for those Americans he said were being ignored and disrespected. They were the people who went to Friendly’s for milkshakes, flew the American flag on their car antennas and didn’t see much point in trying to “understand” America’s enemies. His network would load its prime-time slots with opinionated talk-radio-style personalities while presenting news with an approach he called “fair and balanced,” an indictment of the rest of the news media as excessively liberal. He implicitly injected the news with politics — and set Fox to the right of its rivals — even as he professed to be doing the opposite. When Mr. Ailes was done, his network was in first place (for 15 years running), the mainstream news media was divided and weakened and Fox News was arguably a more powerful force in American politics than either the Republican or Democratic parties. Mr. Ailes, who died on Thursday at 77, exited Fox News with his reputation in tatters. He was ousted last summer amid allegations that he preyed on women who worked for him with offers of advancement in return for sex. He denied the claims. And in the months before his death he watched his legacy become further tarnished as similar harassment allegations led to the departure of the network’s top star, Bill O’Reilly, and a federal investigation began to examine the business practices during his tenure. He was as divisive in death as he was in life. Tributes rolled in through conservative talk radio and his own network: “When Roger Ailes is on your team, you do not lose” (Rush Limbaugh, on his show on Thursday); “a visionary” (Laura Ingraham, in response to an email seeking comment); “a patriot” (Shepard Smith, on his show on Fox). But they clashed with the multitudes of harsh assessments: He “made this the hate-filled moronic country it is today” (Rolling Stone); “He ushered in the post-truth society” (Jeffrey P. Jones, director of the prestigious Peabody Awards). "
"Fliers and posters were the social media of the pre-internet era on the Lower East Side, covering walls and other surfaces with general announcements, political communiqués and personal manifestoes. Affixed with sticky wheat paste and nearly impossible to scrape away, they were a scourge to some, but to others they were a code that could be used to trace the neighborhood’s rich political discourse. Along with their equally tenacious cousin, spray-painted stencils, they provided commentary and promoted events effectively if illegally. The effort it took to produce the messages resulted in a longevity that 140-character tweets or dashed-off blog posts often lack. Many were created by people who were not only political activists but graphic and fine artists. Now, reproductions of more than 100 of those images are on display in a storefront museum on Avenue C, artifacts of a rebellious time when that neighborhood was the setting for contentious battles over development and homelessness, police conduct and control of its central public space, Tompkins Square Park, in the East Village. The show, “Taking It to the Streets! The Art & Design of Posters and Flyers on the Lower East Side in the ’80s & ’90s,” is a project by ABC No Rio, a cultural center that is continuing programming while building a new headquarters on Rivington Street. The exhibition includes works by artists like Sue Coe, Eva Cockcroft and Eric Drooker and will run through June 20 at the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space. “We wanted to recreate that street corner where all of these fliers and stencils could be seen,” an organizer of the exhibition, Seth Tobocman, said recently at the museum.

"The daily commute is a real grind for most people, but not for Heather McLaughlin.

And wherever Ms. McLaughlin goes, the only thing that comes out of the tailpipe is a bit of water vapor. There are no pollutants, no greenhouse gases. “On cold mornings you can actually see drops of water — it’s so cool,” Ms. McLaughlin said recently. “Driving to work is usually the best part of my day.” Right now, a morning ride in a hydrogen-powered car is possible only in California. But in the coming months, environmentally minded consumers on the East Coast will have the opportunity to join in. Automakers and environmentalists have long hailed fuel cells as a revolutionary technology that can reduce planet-warming tailpipe emissions, which account for a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released in the United States. After years of development, several models are now on the road, like the Toyota Mirai and the Honda Clarity FC. The next challenge is building networks of hydrogen stations so owners can refuel their cars. So far California has 30, enough to enable owners to drive throughout the state without worry of running out of hydrogen, and it intends to expand that to 100 by 2020. Sales of fuel-cell vehicles have been limited to the state so far. "
"WASHINGTON — American warplanes in Syria attacked a pro-government convoy on Thursday after it ignored warnings and violated a restricted zone around a base where United States and British Special Forces train Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State, Pentagon officials said. The American strike, corroborated by both pro- and anti-government fighters on the ground, was at least the third time in recent months that the United States military has attacked forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. On Thursday, American officials said, more than 20 vehicles drove within 18 miles of the al-Tanf base in southern Syria housing the American and British Special Forces, breaching the so-called deconfliction zone radius around the encampment. Low-flying American aircraft buzzed the convoy and fired a warning strike, trying to get the vehicles to reverse course, the Pentagon officials said, but when the convoy continued, the planes opened fire. Syrian opposition fighters said there were numerous casualties and several vehicles were hit, including at least four tanks. In a second encounter on Thursday, Pentagon officials said, a Syrian SU-22 fighter-bomber that had entered the deconfliction zone was intercepted by a pair of F-22 fighter jets, but it was not fired upon and left the area.

"The Trump administration announced sanctions against eight members of Venezuela’s Supreme Court, singling out judges loyal to President Nicolás Maduro who tried to dissolve the country’s legislature this year. The announcement, published Thursday by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, froze any assets in the United States belonging to seven judges of the court’s Constitutional Chamber as well as the court’s chief magistrate, Maikel Moreno, and barred Americans from doing business with them. American government officials, in a call with reporters on Thursday, said the measures were intended to pressure the court to stop its efforts to obstruct the National Assembly, the legislature controlled by Mr. Maduro’s opposition. The court has nullified almost every major measure passed by lawmakers since the president’s rivals took control of the body last year, including efforts to free political prisoners. “The Venezuelan people are suffering from a collapsing economy brought about by their government’s mismanagement and corruption,” the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in a statement. “Members of the country’s Supreme Court of Justice have exacerbated the situation by consistently interfering with the legislative branch’s authority.” There was no immediate response from Venezuelan officials. For six weeks, the country has experienced turmoil on the streets, after a decision by the court to essentially disband the National Assembly and take powers for itself. While Mr. Maduro later ordered the court to reverse much of its ruling, his opponents have called hundreds of thousands of protesters into the streets to demand new elections. At least 43 people have died in clashes, according to the authorities. It was the second round of sanctions this year by the United States against top Venezuelans. In February, the Treasury Department said it would freeze the assets of Tareck El Aissami, the country’s vice president, along with those of a business associate. The United States called Mr. El Aissami a drug kingpin and said he had worked with Mexican and Colombian drug runners to move narcotics out of the country. "
"Jon S. Corzine is a 6-foot-2 bear of a man who has spent decades roaming expansive halls of power. He held the top job at the old Goldman Sachs office tower, a concrete pinnacle of American capitalism. And after that, he had the run of the governor’s mansion in New Jersey — all 18,000 square feet of it. On a recent afternoon, however, he squeezed into a 100-square-foot office in the Flatiron district of Manhattan — no nameplate on the door — where a pair of Bloomberg terminals consumed much of the space. His eyes fixed on one, Mr. Corzine scribbled notes about his trades on a yellow legal pad as a computer chimed an imitation closing bell. In the final seconds of trading, Mr. Corzine watched as a tiny sliver of his day’s profits slipped away, prompting him to utter a profanity or two and grumble about not ending the afternoon on more of “a high note.” It has been years since the last major high note in Mr. Corzine’s career. In 2011, he faced the ignominy that came with the collapse of the brokerage firm he ran, MF Global, when about $1 billion of customer money temporarily went missing. It ranked as one of the largest Wall Street bankruptcies since Lehman Brothers’. Now, here in his cramped office, Mr. Corzine is plotting his next and possibly final act: starting a hedge fund. And not just any hedge fund, but one designed to take advantage of the turmoil in the Trump era. Wall Street’s wheel of fortune has spun plenty of comeback stories over the years, from Michael Milken to Henry Blodget. This will be the third spin of the wheel for Mr. Corzine, who won a United States Senate seat after being maneuvered out of Goldman, and who took the reins of MF Global after losing the New Jersey governorship to Chris Christie.

"In normal times, the appointment of a former F.B.I. director as a special counsel to investigate whether a sitting president’s associates colluded with the Kremlin to put him in office would be a powerful reaffirmation of the rule of law. The official who appointed the counsel is a former federal prosecutor, and he demonstrated independence by not informing the White House in advance. In normal times, those who believed the president colluded with the Kremlin could be reassured that the investigation would be credible. Those who believed the Kremlin conspiracy was a partisan myth could feel confident that the counsel would not fall prey to political pressures. But we have not been living in normal times since Donald Trump was inaugurated in January and set about making a mockery both of his oath and of the office of the presidency. And the appointment of Robert Mueller, the former F.B.I. chief, to investigate the Kremlin Kaper is a classic too-little-too-late action taken by the wrong person. Mueller was chosen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a former United States attorney, because Rosenstein’s boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, had recused himself from the Russia investigation. But Sessions’s recusal does not seem meaningful since we know that he took part in a White House meeting at which Trump demanded that James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, be fired. And Rosenstein himself is tainted. He was also in that meeting and seems to have obeyed the president’s orders to gin up a memo making it appear as though Comey was being dismissed over the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. The White House, in fact, tried to put the entire responsibility for Comey’s dismissal on Rosenstein, until Trump blurted out that he was motivated by the Russia inquiry and had decided to fire Comey before the meeting.

If you have a leading lady or gentleman who is easy to get along with, undemanding, friendly and charming, the cast follows suit, and you have few if any problems.

"WASHINGTON — Republican senators signaled on Thursday that the Justice Department’s special counsel investigation into Russia’s interference in the presidential election and possible collusion by associates of President Trump would quite likely slow and narrow the scope of their own inquiries. Five different Senate and House committees — including both congressional intelligence committees — are running inquiries into the Russian meddling. But the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who was appointed on Wednesday, is widely expected to ask Congress to scale back public hearings with witnesses who might be integral to his investigation. The entire Senate, in a highly unusual gathering, was briefed on the Justice Department inquiry by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who stunned some lawmakers when he suggested that he had known President Trump had planned to fire James B. Comey as F.B.I. director before he provided a memo to the president outlining a rationale for his dismissal. Mr. Rosenstein also affirmed that the Justice Department’s inquiry was focused on possible crimes, meaning that potential subjects of investigation would almost certainly refuse to testify before Congress or withhold documents from lawmakers for fear of possible prosecution. Congress needs “to be focused on what our role is,” said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a member of the Intelligence Committee. “We’re not the F.B.I. We’re not the Department of Justice. We’re conducting oversight investigations and that’s, I think, our appropriate role.” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said, “You’ve got a special counsel who has prosecutorial powers now, and I think we in Congress have to be very careful not to interfere. Public access to this is probably going to be very limited now. It’s going to really limit what the public will know about this.” "
"WASHINGTON — Contrary to how it might look on social media or on the cable news network of your choice, people here are not exactly running through the streets en masse, gripped by the latest news about President Trump, screaming about a possible impeachment. At least not yet. With the city beeping and chirping with updates related to various investigations and leaks surrounding the White House, the capital this week has felt on the verge of overheating, both literally and politically. And the people of Washington seemed to be in a strange existential place: unable to get enough of an off-the-rails news cycle, and yet on the verge of Trump-related fatigue from the breathless pace. At the Capitol on Wednesday, roving packs of reporters waited in 90-degree heat, ready to ask lawmakers what they thought about the latest news that has stemmed from Mr. Trump’s abrupt firing of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, who was investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russian officials. At least one lawmaker resorted to sarcasm: When asked if he was having fun, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, one of the few Republicans visibly stepping away from Mr. Trump, smiled and said, “Oh, it’s fantastic.” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, wasn’t in the mood to joke: “Don’t assume that this democracy holds for another 230 years,” he said. “You’ve got to be actively tending to it and protecting it.” Beyond the confines of the Capitol, the Dow Jones average dropped and the Metropolitan Police chief condemned a “brutal attack” by Turkish security forces on people protesting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, in town for a visit. There was a less frenzied mood in the bars and restaurants in the streets surrounding the Capitol, where men and women in suits sipped Coronas during happy hour under TVs tuned to CNN. The Capitol Lounge was flooded with real estate agents who had rented out the Nixon room, and down the street at the quieter Hawk ‘n’ Dove, two young men were huddled near the end of the bar, watching the latest news about Mr. Trump. "
"The simmering talk of impeachment swirling around President Trump largely concerns whether he committed a crime by asking James Comey, when he was still the director of the F.B.I., to end an investigation of Michael T. Flynn, the onetime national security adviser. From the perspective of criminal law, the resulting questions, which pertain mainly to the president’s intent in making the request, are inescapable. From the perspective of the decidedly political act of impeachment, they are irrelevant. The purpose of impeachment is not punitive. It is prophylactic. Criminal law looks backward toward offenses committed. The object of impeachment is not to exact vengeance. It is to protect the public against future acts of recklessness or abuse. Consequently, the issue in deciding whether Mr. Trump is liable to impeachment is less what happened in the Oval Office between him and Mr. Comey than what those events say about what will happen in similar situations in the future. That is not a case for casual impeachment. On the contrary, since it is harder to predict future acts than to prove what has already occurred, such a standard may be harder to meet. Our tendency to read the impeachment power in an overly legalistic way, which is ratified by 230 years of excessive timidity about its use, obscures the political rather than juridical nature of the device. The Constitution applies presidential impeachment to “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” The famous latter phrase does not refer to offenses like burglary on the one hand or loitering on the other. If it did, impeachment would be available for casual transgressions, which no framer of the Constitution intended. The phrase dates in American constitutionalism to the founder George Mason’s proposal to make the president liable to impeachment not just for treason and bribery — the original formulation at the Constitutional Convention — but also for what he called “maladministration.” His fellow framer James Madison objected to the vagueness of the term, so Mason substituted “high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” That phrase, in turn, is traceable to the British legal commentator William Blackstone, a contemporary who was revered in colonial America, who applied it to the “mal-administration of high officers,” among other things. Mason’s intent was clearly to delineate a political category, something Alexander Hamilton — who did not shrink in the defense of executive power — recognized in Federalist 65, which says that impeachment applied to offenses “of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they related chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” The victim Hamilton identified — “the society itself” — defined the nature of the offense. Earlier, at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Madison had indicated the same understanding. Note, crucially, the purpose for which he said impeachment should be available: “Mr. Madison thought it indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the community against the incapacity, negligence or perfidy of the Chief Magistrate.” "
"President Trump, 24 hours from his self-imposed deadline for picking a new F.B.I. director, told reporters on Thursday that he was “very close” to choosing a successor to James B. Comey, and he named Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist. But members of Mr. Trump’s staff — alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience — have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire. By late Thursday, the president appeared increasingly likely to leave Friday for a nine-day foreign trip without picking a new director, according to three senior administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Lieberman, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., whose agents prize the bureau’s independence as one of Washington’s few apolitical institutions. Judges and former prosecutors, not elected officials, have frequently been chosen. Administration officials described the search as fluid and said the president and his team were keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid the leaks that Mr. Trump believes are endemic to the West Wing. Still, Mr. Trump, speaking briefly with reporters in the Oval Office as he met with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, offered an emphatic “yes” when asked whether Mr. Lieberman was among the finalists. “We need a great director of the F.B.I. I cherish the F.B.I. It’s special,” he told reporters later at a joint East Room news conference with Mr. Santos. “All over the world, no matter where you go, the F.B.I. is special. The F.B.I. has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even, you could say — directly or indirectly — with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.” "
"WASHINGTON — New video surfaced on Thursday that shows President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey looking on as armed members of his security team violently charge a group of protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence here. The Voice of America’s Turkish Service posted the video on its Twitter account with a brief description in Turkish. The confrontation on Tuesday came after President Trump had welcomed Mr. Erdogan to the White House and praised him as a stalwart ally in the battle against Islamic extremism. Mr. Trump did not speak of Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarian crackdown on his own people. It is unclear if Mr. Erdogan, who is seen in the video sitting in a black Mercedes sedan, communicated with the would-be assailants. An aide can be seen leaning into the car, then speaking to another aide who walks toward the group of supporters and out of the range of the camera. Seconds later, members of the group run toward and confront the protesters. The second aide then returns to the president’s car as Mr. Erdogan exits and enters the residence. "

"To the Editor: Re “Special Counsel Will Investigate Russia Influence” (front page, May 18): When Donald Trump promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, I’m sure he didn’t think that the process would begin in the White House. The appointment of Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel is welcome news. History tells us that the road ahead of him is long and that we can expect many obstacles to be thrown in his path. Even before the appointment, the Trump administration had begun to circle the wagons. It appears that Mr. Trump may have committed acts that could amount to obstruction of justice. That’s why Mr. Mueller’s appointment is so important.

PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “The Special Counsel America Needs” (editorial, May 18): As it turns out, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, is a stand-up guy who cares more about the country than his own job. President Trump must be absolutely fuming over the appointment of a former F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller, as the special counsel who will lead the inquiry into any possible collusion between Mr. Trump or his campaign and Russian officials. Mr. Mueller is a man of unquestionable integrity, great ability and a keen understanding of how investigations and prosecutions should be handled. He will not only have broad authority over the possible Trump-Russia connections, but he will also be able to look into any questions relating to obstruction of justice, as in the case of James Comey’s allegations that Mr. Trump asked him to shut down the F.B.I.’s investigation of Michael Flynn, the fired national security adviser. Mr. Trump has gambled and lost, and his superheated ego and lack of judgment have backed him into a very tight, uncomfortable corner. HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: In “Trump Transition Said to Know of Flynn Inquiry Before Hiring” (front page, May 18), you report that on Jan. 4 Michael T. Flynn informed Donald McGahn, chief lawyer for the Trump transition team, that he was under investigation for secretly acting as a paid agent of Turkey. At that time, the head of the transition team was Vice President-elect Mike Pence. But Mr. Pence is named only twice in the story, both times in regard to having been “misled” by Mr. Flynn. It is hard to believe that Mr. Flynn would have dropped such a bombshell with Mr. McGahn without its being reported to the head of the transition team. How can this be reconciled with Mr. Pence’s claims to have been unaware of Mr. Flynn’s activities on behalf of Turkey and Russia? In the days ahead it is important to ask: What did the vice president know and when did he know it? RICHARD S. HOLMES, SYRACUSE "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration gave Congress official notice on Thursday that it plans to renegotiate Nafta but provided only the vaguest of hints about modest changes President Trump would seek to an agreement that he has called “the worst trade deal ever.” In a brief letter to lawmakers, Robert Lighthizer, the newly confirmed United States trade representative, said the administration aimed to support economic growth and better-paying jobs through unspecified improvements to Nafta that would modernize the 23-year-old agreement. But the notice — a drastically scaled-back version of a draft the administration circulated this year — promised no major modifications of the sort that the president has hinted he will seek. Mr. Trump had threatened to withdraw completely from the agreement, only to relent in late April when the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the other parties to the deal, called and asked him to renegotiate instead. Sonny Perdue, his secretary of agriculture, also presented Mr. Trump with a map illustrating the potential negative consequences for American farmers if the deal were shut down. The president, whose campaign-trail vows to tear up Nafta appealed to his base of disaffected working-class voters aggrieved by globalization, is under mounting pressure to follow through on his pledge. But Mr. Trump faces stiff resistance from business-minded Republicans in Congress and sectors that fear major changes would disrupt well-established supply chains and harm their bottom lines. “Today, President Trump fulfilled one of his key promises to the American people,” Mr. Lighthizer said on Thursday. “For years, politicians have called for the renegotiation of this agreement, but President Trump is the first to follow through with that promise.” "
"The death of Roger E. Ailes, who helped build Fox News into a cultural and political force, capped what has been an extraordinary period of upheaval at the network.

This is what life has been like for the network in the last 10 and a half months. Ms. Carlson, a prominent Fox anchor, sends shock waves through the media world when she files a lawsuit against Mr. Ailes, accusing him of forcing her out after she refused his sexual advances and complained to him about persistent harassment in the newsroom. Ms. Carlson’s charges included an allegation that Mr. Ailes, during a meeting in his office, explicitly asked her for a sexual relationship. It was a public attack on a towering figure in broadcast journalism and Republican politics who had typically enjoyed absolute loyalty from his employees. "
"JERUSALEM — President Trump leaves for the Middle East on Friday. The trip’s objectives, his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, has told reporters, is to “broadcast a message of unity to America’s friends” and to pay his respects to the “homelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths.” Mr. Trump will begin in Saudi Arabia, with which his administration is nearing consummation of a $100 billion arms deal; he’ll meet with leaders of the Arab League — America’s “partners,” as General McMaster says — whom he’ll encourage “to take bold, new steps to promote peace and to confront those, from ISIS to Al Qaeda to Iran to the Assad regime, who perpetuate chaos.” In Jerusalem, Mr. Trump will “reaffirm America’s unshakable bond to the Jewish state” and in Bethlehem, “express his desire for dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians.” American leadership is necessary to “move the region toward the peace, security and stability that the people there so deserve,” General McMaster said. Let’s strain to ignore the latest reasons to question Mr. Trump’s fitness for office or, indeed, his survivability in it: the firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director, the intelligence leak to Russia. General McMaster has laid out the policy lines of a Republican administration that is just beginning its four-year term. To be sure, the approach has been enigmatic so far. But that may be an advantage, since progress toward those goals does not depend on the president alone. Among Trump advisers like General McMaster, a refreshed realists’ view of the Middle East seems to be unfolding. Impeach Mr. Trump and you get Mike Pence, who was instrumental in replacing Michael Flynn with General McMaster and was the lead adviser in appointing Jim Mattis as secretary of defense and Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Just before the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, visited Washington in early May, General McMaster said at the Israeli Embassy that the administration “seeks to challenge failed policies of the past with a businessman’s results-oriented approach.” The question is, what results would General McMaster want, and for whom? The answer, while still emerging, has changed since before Mr. Trump took office. Then, he and the Republican leadership seemed determined to bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. They mocked the United Nations Security Council’s condemnation of settlements and promised to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem. And within days of Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the State Department froze the last payment to the Palestinian Authority authorized by President Barack Obama. "
"WASHINGTON — When Air Force One touches down in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this week, President Trump can be sure of one thing: His Saudi hosts have firmly pressed the reset button on a relationship that became strained in the latter years of Barack Obama’s presidency. Mr. Obama made four visits to Saudi Arabia, more than any other United States president. He agreed to sell the Saudis more weapons than any other president. He provided American military support for the Saudi intervention in the civil war in Yemen. Yet the Saudis rightly saw him as so anxious to solidify his legacy of the nuclear deal with Iran that he was willing to weaken the United States’ 75-year-old strategic relationship with their country. In fact, it appeared as if Mr. Obama was willing to tacitly accept Iran’s efforts to dominate the Middle East. Saudi leaders believe they have a better ally in the new American president, whose administration came out early with clear and forceful warnings that it was “putting Iran on notice” after Tehran tested a ballistic missile. This was followed by the approval of the sale of ammunition to Saudi Arabia that Mr. Obama had suspended. The rapprochement culminated in a high-profile visit by the Saudi deputy crown prince to the White House in March. After several years of distancing, the views of Washington and Riyadh seemed very much aligned. Still, the Saudis will be listening intently this weekend for even more reassurance from Mr. Trump that the Iran page has truly been turned and that the Saudi-American alliance is back on track. Mr. Trump should offer three strong messages for his Saudi hosts. First, he should state publicly and strongly that he understands that the kingdom is on the front lines of the war against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. Sunni extremists are not an existential threat to the United States, but they have repeatedly attacked Saudi Arabia, making no secret that they dream of replacing its government with their “caliphate.” With control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and Saudi Arabia’s vast oil reserves, any such caliphate would have a terrible, malevolent influence in the Muslim world and beyond.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump declared angrily on Thursday that he was the victim of a witch hunt, and all but contradicted his deputy attorney general on the firing of the F.B.I. director, in an extensive denial of any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Mr. Trump used a chaotic White House news conference with Colombia’s leader to directly confront a weeklong barrage of criticism and questions in a political storm that he said was dividing the nation. He also conspicuously distanced himself from aides like his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in repeating his claim that Moscow and its agents had not secretly assisted his campaign. “I respect the move,” Mr. Trump said of the Justice Department’s decision on Wednesday to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter. “But the entire thing has been a witch hunt.” “And there is no collusion between, certainly, myself and my campaign — but I can always speak for myself — and the Russians,” he said. “Zero.” Mr. Trump made his comments while standing alongside Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos. As he dug in his heels, Mr. Trump further muddied his explanation of why he dismissed the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey — and in doing so, offered a different version of events from one given to senators just hours earlier by the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. In that meeting, Mr. Rosenstein outlined his decision to appoint Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel. Several senators emerged afterward to say Mr. Rosenstein had told them he was certain that the president was going to dismiss Mr. Comey, even before he wrote a memo critical of the director’s performance.

The Trumpian chaos that’s enveloped the country should not be surprising. Our president is less qualified to hold the office than any of the previous occupants. “A man with a deformed personality and a defective intellect runs a dysfunctional administration,” as Bret Stephens writes. But the last 10 days have included one very surprising episode: the apparent disappearance of Rod Rosenstein’s ethics. To review: Rosenstein is a widely admired longtime Justice Department official. George W. Bush chose him as the top federal prosecutor in Maryland. Barack Obama decided to leave Rosenstein in the job, a reflection of bipartisan respect. Then Trump picked Rosenstein as his deputy attorney general. Last week, though, Rosenstein disappointed — shocked isn’t too strong a word — his many admirers in the legal community by doing Trump’s bidding. With Trump wanting to fire James Comey as F.B.I. director in order to disrupt the Russia investigation, Rosenstein wrote a shoddy memo that gave Trump a rationale for doing so. Shortly thereafter, Trump admitted the truth, making Rosenstein look all the worse. The events were deeply confusing. Rosenstein’s history made his actions almost impossible to believe. Yet the facts left no defensible explanation. It was a cautionary tale of the dangers that good people face when they go to work in the Trump administration. Fortunately, the Rosenstein story took a new turn on Wednesday afternoon. As the official overseeing the Russia investigation, he named a special counsel — Robert Mueller, a former F.B.I. director — to take over. That is precisely the move that many people (including The Times Editorial Board, in an open letter last week) have been urging. It doesn’t erase what Rosenstein did last week — and it doesn’t guarantee a real investigation — but it is a big deal. It’s the single best thing Rosenstein could have done to atone for his mistake. In coming days, I expect that more members of the Trump administration will find themselves under pressure to violate their own principles. I hope they will remember both lessons of the Rosenstein saga. Helping Donald Trump isn’t worth your reputation. And you can often recover, at least partially, from your own mistakes. In The Times, Nick Kristof writes, “One crucial lesson here: Pressure matters,” while Gail Collins reviews Trump’s remarkable graduation speech yesterday. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes to us from Jennifer Medina, a national correspondent in Los Angeles. School board campaigns are often sleepy affairs, not the sort of electoral battle that generates widespread attention and outside donations. But this week’s election for the Los Angeles Unified school board was something of an epic proxy fight. Some saw it as a battle over the influence of the teachers’ union. Others cast it as a fight against the education agenda of President Trump and Betsy DeVos and the expansion of charter schools. After Tuesday’s results, the seven-member school board that governs the nation’s second largest public school system will be dominated by supporters of charter schools who may move to increase the number of publicly funded but privately run schools across the city. The election drew in some $14 million — making it among the most expensive school board races in the country’s history — and a host of high-profile endorsements. In the end, the candidates who portrayed themselves as supporters of dramatic changes won out, leaving the teachers’ union and its supporters angered and worried about the future. Steve Zimmer, the school board president who lost to the challenger Nick Melvoin, was so angered by the defeat that he refused to make the customary congratulatory call. Mr. Zimmer called the results “devastating” and said he would never run for office again. There are already more charter schools and charter school students in Los Angeles than in any other school system in the country; charter school students make up more than 20 percent of the district’s enrollment. But supporters of the schools say that there is room for many more and that students in the district should have more options. "

"Roger E. Ailes, who shaped the images that helped elect three Republican presidents and then became a dominant, often-intimidating force in American conservative politics at the helm of Fox News until he was forced out last year in a sexual harassment scandal, died on Thursday morning. He was 77. The cause was complications of a subdural hematoma that Mr. Ailes sustained when he fell and struck his head on May 10 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., the local authorities said. “Fair and balanced” was Mr. Ailes’s defining phrase for Fox News, along with another slogan: “We report. You decide.” Though routinely mocked by liberal critics, who regarded the network as decidedly unfair and imbalanced, those words amounted to an article of faith for Mr. Ailes, who created Fox News with Rupert Murdoch’s money and guided it for two decades. “If we look conservative,” he said, “it’s because the other guys are so far to the left.” In his mordant humor, CNN stood for Clinton News Network and CBS for Communist Broadcasting System. What Fox News did, he said, was apply a necessary corrective. From its debut on Oct. 7, 1996, the network, under his tutelage, did its share of straightforward reporting but also unmistakably filtered major news stories through a conservative lens. Evening programming, which embodied the Fox News brand, was dominated by right-wing commentators like Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity, who hurled opinions and vented resentments with a pugnacity that reflected their boss’s own combativeness. As the network’s chairman and chief executive, Mr. Ailes was widely feared, particularly by conservative politicians who sought his favor. He cultivated a swaggering persona, accentuated by bursts of obscenity-laced anger. Once, he became so enraged that he punched a hole in the wall of a control room. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — When President Trump heads to Saudi Arabia on Friday for his first trip overseas since taking office, it will be for much more than a run-of-the-mill state visit. The Saudis have internationalized the event, organizing a sprawling “Arab Islamic American Summit” with leaders from dozens of Muslim countries, as well as talks with the king, the inauguration of a counterterrorism center, forums for business executives and young people, and a country music concert. Saudi Arabia, home to some of Islam’s holiest sites, will be pulling out all the stops for a man who has declared “Islam hates us” and said the United States was “losing a tremendous amount of money” defending the kingdom. But Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies were so angry over President Barack Obama’s Middle East policies that they appeared prepared to dismiss Mr. Trump’s remarks as campaign rhetoric, and to see in him a possibility of resetting relations. The grandiose reception seeks to convince Mr. Trump that his priorities are theirs, too, and that they are indispensable partners in fighting terrorism, in confronting Iran, in bolstering American businesses and perhaps even in pursuing peace between Israelis and Palestinians. “This administration has vision that matches the view of the kingdom with regards to the role of America in the world, with regards to getting rid of terrorism, with regards to confronting Iran, with regards to rebuilding relations with traditional allies, with regards to trade and investment,” Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, told reporters on Thursday.

"There is still no consensus on why the last housing boom and bust happened. That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future. But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives — like tales of getting rich through “flipping” houses and shares of initial public offerings — that constitute the shifting mentality of the era. Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn’t tell us why. Real home prices rose 75 percent from February 1997 to December 2005, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, corrected for inflation by the Consumer Price Index. And then, from 2005 to 2012, real prices reversed course, falling to just 12 percent above their 1997 level. In the years since 2012, they have climbed 29 percent, about halfway back to their 2005 peak. This is a roller coaster in national home prices — it has been even scarier in some more volatile cities — yet we have no clarity on why it happened. The problem for economists is that these changes don’t correspond to movements in the usual suspects: interest rates, building costs, population or rents. The Consumer Price Index for Rent of Primary Residence, compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and corrected for inflation, went up only 8 percent in 1997 to 2005, so unmet demand for housing services can’t explain the huge increase in real home prices. It doesn’t explain the 29 percent rise in real home prices since 2012 either, because inflation-adjusted rents increased only 10 percent in that period. So what has been driving the wild ride in home prices? I believe the price swings have something to do with the changing mentality of the times, changes caused by narratives that have gone viral and swept across the population. Looking for answers in such popular stories contrasts starkly with the prominent approach of modeling people as though they react logically to economic forces. But a less orthodox approach can be quite useful. "
"What a year the last few days have been, huh? This is news in the era of President Trump. It slaps you awake, follows you around all day, intrudes on your conversations, interrupts your dinner, whispers as you try to sleep. It has been coming at a relentless pace. From a hundred directions at once. Breaking news alerts on your phone. Memes shared on Facebook. Angry tweets from your friends (or the president). And cable news? Let’s just say there have been a lot of split screens and a lot of yelling. A new bombshell came on Wednesday when Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, was named special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russian meddling in the United States presidential election. But the barrage began on May 9 when President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director. It was hard to keep track of the reasons the administration gave for the firing. First, Mr. Trump’s advisers said Mr. Comey was dismissed because of how he had treated Hillary Clinton. But then the president went on television and said he had fired Mr. Comey because he did not want the F.B.I. to keep investigating possible ties between his campaign and Russia. A few days later came reports that the president had shared highly classified intelligence about the Islamic State — which the United States had not even shared with its allies — with the Russian foreign minister. The next day, we learned that Mr. Comey had written in a memo that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey back in February to drop the F.B.I. investigation into his now-fired national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. And that is the highly abridged version. This has been a lot for people to take in. One reader of The New York Times, who commented on the website under the name Michael B., evoked the image of a fire hose to describe the onslaught of breaking news. “Watergate was like drip, drip, drip. Every week or two, we’d learn something new,” he wrote. “Trumpgate is like gush, gush, gush, GUSH! The sheer volume of scandalous news, one new scandal after another, is simply breathtaking.” Another commenter, who identified herself as Christine McM from Massachusetts, compared the turmoil in Washington to an unpleasant TV-watching experience. “I feel like I’m being forced to binge watch five seasons of a Netflix series in one week!” she wrote. So, readers, tell us in the comments section: How has the onslaught of news been treating you? What have you been doing to stay informed while also staying sane? "
"Did anyone else experience déjà vu when James Comey was fired last week? We thought it reminded us of something, but we couldn’t put our finger on it — until we spent some time in the archives of YouTube, watching old clips of “Celebrity Apprentice.” It turns out that hints of Donald Trump’s style of governance are right there in the boardroom scenes: not just his penchant for sudden dismissals, but also how much he relishes performing the role of a powerful person. We invited Emily Nussbaum, the Pulitzer Prize-winning television critic for The New Yorker to talk with us about Trump’s obsession with TV and what shows we should consider watching in the wake of Trump. We take a look at the rise of fictional television shows that seem to speak to our new political reality — shows like “Veep,” “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Leftovers.” Those last two are set in dystopian versions of the future, where abnormal, unsettling events begin to seem ordinary, and they prompted us to ask a question: When we turn to art to explain to us a world that feels increasingly unreal, what can it tell us?

"WASHINGTON — Several White House advisers and personal associates of President Trump have urged him to hire an experienced outside lawyer to help him deal with issues arising from a surging controversy over whether his campaign had ties to Russia, according to several people briefed on the conversations. The recommendations came even before a special counsel was named on Wednesday to lead the investigation into any collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russian officials. Mr. Trump’s aides and allies were said to be especially concerned by the revelation that James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump, has contemporaneous, detailed memos reconstructing conversations with the president. While the office of the president is represented by the White House counsel, presidents in the past have employed outside lawyers when their private actions were called into question. Mr. Trump has signaled he is likely to hire a new lawyer, but has not yet made a decision, according to three people who have spoken with him. Aides to Mr. Trump did not immediately comment on his discussions. Mr. Trump is said to recognize that he needs help beyond the White House counsel. But he is deeply cautious in selecting people he trusts, and he adds new people to his orbit slowly. "

"So much for concerns that traders weren’t fearful enough. On Wednesday, markets in the United States appeared to have been rattled by a report in The New York Times that President Trump had asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down an investigation into his former national security adviser. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index sank 1.8 percent, the most since September, and the VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” a measure of volatility, jumped 46 percent as investors became pessimistic about Mr. Trump’s agenda. Asian stock markets followed suit on Thursday, but the dollar edged up in volatile trading. It’s far from certain that this means the “Trump trade” has come to an end, but the market reaction contrasts with the collective shrugs that followed the firing of Mr. Comey last week, and even the news that Mr. Trump had shared confidential intelligence information with Russian diplomats. “For the first time, there is real concern that Trump has overstepped his boundaries, which may create some chaos in the market,” said Curtis Schenker, co-founder of Scoggin Capital Management. Amid a stream of news that has put the White House in a state of constant upheaval, Republicans in Congress seem to be less optimistic that they will be able to pass any changes to the tax code. Speculators are increasing their bets on Mr. Trump’s impeachment, The Financial Times noted. But The New York Times has eight reasons that Republican leaders haven’t deserted Mr. Trump and explains how his most loyal supporters are building alternative narratives. "

"Louisiana has the nation’s highest incarceration rate. But this week, Gov. John Bel Edwards struck a deal to reduce sentences and the prison population, saving millions annually. If lawmakers approve the changes, Louisiana will be following more than 30 states, including Georgia, Texas and South Carolina, that have already limited sentences; expanded alternatives to incarceration, such as drug treatment; or otherwise reduced the reach and cost of the criminal justice system. Many of those states say they have saved money while crime rates have stayed low. In Washington, though, the nation’s top law enforcement officer, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has charted the opposite course. He announced last week that federal prosecutors should aim to put more people in prison for longer periods, adopting the sort of mass-incarceration strategy that helped flood prisons during the war on drugs in the 1980s and 1990s. His move — which he said would promote consistency and respect for the law — alarmed critics who feared that the Trump administration was embracing failed, even racist, policies. Even more, Mr. Sessions’s approach conflicted with one of the few major points of bipartisan national agreement over the past decade: that criminal justice could be more effective by becoming less punitive to low-level offenders; treating root causes of crime, like drug addiction; and reserving more resources to go after serious, violent criminals. But if Mr. Sessions’s appointment has dampened the hopes of those wishing for congressional action to reduce incarceration, advocates say it has had little effect on state efforts. "
"The federal courts in San Diego are full of cases like this: a 22-year-old man caught driving a car loaded with 33 kilograms of hidden methamphetamine — worth hundreds of thousands of dollars — across the Mexican border into California. So, what’s a fair punishment for this crime? In the plainest reading of federal law, a kingpin-size haul like that would be punished with a kingpin-size sentence: from a minimum of 10 years in prison to life without parole. But the drugs were not his — he said he thought he was smuggling marijuana — and there was no evidence that he played any role other than as a one-time courier. The man, Kevin Mejia, was poor and had a pregnant girlfriend, and he had been promised $1,000 to drive the car. In 2013, Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general under President Barack Obama, told prosecutors not to use mandatory minimum sentences for defendants like this — low-level, nonviolent, no prior offenses to speak of. In a memo, Mr. Holder even gave prosecutors a simple alternative: omit the weight of the drugs from the indictment, because mandatory minimums are triggered by quantity. Judges then would have considerable leeway in sentencing. Under this guidance, the percentage of defendants who faced a mandatory minimum plummeted, while the number of prosecutions of more serious crimes, like those involving guns or cartel leaders, increased. The federal prison population declined. Crime stayed at record lows, with the exception of a few cities where gun violence and homicides spiraled upward. "
"European and Asian markets fell sharply on Thursday after declines in American stocks, dragged down by worries that President Trump’s policy agenda was being drowned out by persistent turmoil at the White House. Just this month, Mr. Trump has fired the director of the F.B.I. and shared confidential intelligence details with Russian diplomats, and revelations have emerged that the president had asked for a federal investigation into his former national security adviser to be shut down. By contrast, Mr. Trump’s stated ambitions of lowering corporate taxes, overhauling the American health care system and rolling back business regulations have gained little traction. Major Asian markets fell on Thursday, with Japan’s Nikkei-225 index dropping 1.3 percent, while European indexes including London’s FTSE-100 and Paris’s CAC-40 dropped more than 1 percent. On Wednesday, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 1.8 percent, the largest single-day drop since September. "
"■ President Trump insisted that there was no collusion between his presidential campaign and Russian officials, though he added, “I can only speak for myself.” ■ Earlier, during a brief photo opportunity with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia in the Oval Office, the president said he was “very close” to choosing a new F.B.I. director. ■ Senators leaving a closed meeting with the deputy attorney general, Rod J.

"The sudden appointment of Robert S. Mueller as a special counsel for the federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s relationship with Russia highlights a key question: Which choice poses the greater risk for Republicans in Congress, to support a potential impeachment or to close ranks behind the president? To defy Trump or to defend him? To provoke anger among the legions of Trump loyalists back home or to run the risk of turning the 2018 midterms into a Democratic wave election? In his classic 1974 study, “Congress: The Electoral Connection,” David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale, based his analysis on a simple but profoundly illuminating premise: that members of the House and Senate are “single-minded seekers of re-election.” For that reason, for congressmen trying to titrate their response to the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation as it unfolds, the most important development on the Republican side of the aisle is the rise in recent years of primary challenges from the right. Highly conservative insurgents have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to defeat Congressional incumbents who fail to toe the line. Being “primaried” from the right dates back at least to 1978. That year, Clifford Case, a pro-civil rights Republican senator from New Jersey — first elected to Congress in 1944 — was defeated in the primary by Jeff Bell, a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan’s 1976 presidential campaign, an opponent of affirmative action, a defender of “pre-birth personhood” and a supporter of applying “the 14th Amendment to the unborn.” (Bell ended up losing to Bill Bradley in the general election.) Case’s primary defeat marked the onset of a purge of moderate Republicans from Congress. As a 1978 Times editorial pointed out, from the day Case arrived in Washington The threat to centrist Republicans — a lineage that includes President Eisenhower, Governor Nelson Rockefeller, President Gerald Ford and two Senate Majority Leaders, Howard Baker and Bob Dole — intensified in 2010 when Tea Party-backed candidates on the far right of the conservative spectrum defeated 22 sitting members and establishment-backed candidates in primaries from New York to Nevada. "
"TEL AVIV — On Tuesday morning, the heads of Israel’s intelligence community awoke to reports that President Trump had disclosed classified information during his meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia. By the end of the day, it became clear that the highly sensitive secret material had been acquired and supplied to the Americans by Israeli espionage agencies. Feverish investigations have been underway in Israel to ascertain which exact item from among the myriad pieces of intelligence that Israel has given the United States about Syria was the one that Mr. Trump cavalierly shared with the Russians. At the same time, damage control efforts have begun. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who treats Mr. Trump with the utmost delicacy, instructed his aides not to react to the news. The prime minister is concerned by Mr. Trump’s volatility, and he is doing everything to avoid marring next week’s presidential visit to Israel. Mr. Netanyahu’s intelligence chiefs, though, are up in arms. Israel and the United States have been locked in a mutually necessary and beneficial intelligence-sharing relationship for more than 60 years. But what if it’s not so beneficial anymore? A source in one agency told me on Tuesday evening: “Trump tweeted that he has the right to share intelligence with the Russians, because he’s the president. I’m no expert on American law — that can be looked into by someone else — but to take material that is clearly not America’s and that was conveyed to a limited American group, and only them, is a blatant violation of everything that has ever been agreed to between our two countries and a kick aimed at the sacred confidence upon which our special relationship is founded.” The report of the presidential leak was greeted with anger, but it cannot be said that there was great surprise. At a meeting between American and Israeli intelligence officials a few weeks before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Americans recommended to the Israelis that they refrain from passing to his White House sensitive secret information, or material that could lead to the baring of sources or methods of intelligence gathering — at least until it became clear that Mr. Trump or members of his staff were not linked inappropriately to the Russians or exposed to extortion by Moscow. An Israeli who took part in that meeting told me it was “a bizarre scene” and “against all the rules of protocol.” Israel has good reason to be concerned about its intelligence making its way to Moscow: Russia is a major player in the war in Syria on Israel’s northern border, where it has also become a close ally of Iran and Hezbollah, Israel’s sworn enemies. But the problem goes even deeper: If Israeli intelligence that has been shared with the United States — whether the National Security Agency, the C.I.A., the Defense Department or the White House — is not safely guarded, Israel faces a major threat to its security. Cooperation with America’s agencies is deeply embedded in Israel’s intelligence community. "
"The reported effort by President Trump to pressure the F.B.I. director to drop the investigation into Russian influence over his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has provoked cries of “obstruction of justice.” Trump critics are demanding an independent prosecutor, à la Watergate, or at least the appointment of a nonpartisan, neutral F.B.I. director to continue the investigation. Those critics may hope to get a combination of both in one, with the Justice Department’s appointment on Wednesday of Robert Mueller, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel to continue the inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Both Democrats and Republicans, however, will find it near impossible to turn Mr. Trump’s core executive powers against him. Instead, Congress should turn to the powers designed by the framers for exactly such circumstances: the tools of funding, oversight and, as a last resort, impeachment. As described in notes that the F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, made about his meeting with the president, Mr. Trump’s comments come close to obstruction of justice but don’t clearly cross the line. According to those notes, Mr. Trump said of the investigation into Mr. Flynn, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.” Both Republicans and Democrats have declared a desire to get to the bottom of the conversation. Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, promised to subpoena the Comey memos, and the Democratic minority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said that such a “brazen attempt to shut down the F.B.I.’s investigation of Michael Flynn is an assault on the rule of law that is fundamental to our democracy.” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, commented, “I think it’s reaching the point where it’s of Watergate size and scale.” But standing alone, Mr. Trump’s comments do not unambiguously show an intent to obstruct justice. While he set out his favorable opinion of Mr. Flynn, he stopped short of ordering Mr. Comey to drop the investigation. Mr. Trump’s words carried an implicit recognition that Mr. Comey would make the final call. "
"In defending their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Republican leaders in Congress argue that the insurance marketplaces created by the law are failing. They aren’t completely wrong. Trouble began with faulty websites during the rollout in 2013. Since then, enrollment continues to be below expectations. Obamacare plans often have higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses than expected. Some markets, mainly in rural areas, may not attract a single insurer in 2018. And insurers that stay are likely to impose double-digit premium increases. The Republican plan to replace Obamacare would do little to stabilize the exchanges. But there is a better way to provide insurance to the 11 million beneficiaries of Obamacare plans: Allow them to buy into the Medicaid system. For President Trump, “Medicaid for more” would be both good policy and good politics. Let’s start with a political puzzle. Why has Medicaid become the nation’s largest health insurance program, with over 70 million enrollees, even though both conservatives and liberals criticize it? First, it has surprisingly strong support from hospitals and nursing homes, insurers and states, which receive federal funds to help finance care. Second, since Medicaid is administered in different ways by different states, it cannot be labeled a monolithic national program. Third, its cost is shared among federal, state and local governments. Finally, Medicaid works: It provides access to good-quality care for low-wage Americans and more secure funding for the medical safety net. So why does Medicaid have a bad reputation in both parties? The answer is that both conservatives and liberals buy into a series of Medicaid myths. Many conservatives mistakenly believe Medicaid is an out-of-control entitlement and want to cap federal Medicaid spending. But Medicaid provides low-cost care to millions of the nation’s oldest, sickest and most vulnerable populations. In 2013, a report by the Urban Institute demonstrated that if an average adult on Medicaid had traditional private insurance instead, the cost of care would be over 25 percent higher. "
"To hear the world leaders who gathered in Beijing last weekend boast about China’s ambitious plans to spend more than $1 trillion on roads, ports, energy and other major projects in 60 countries, linking Asia, Europe and Africa, is to be reminded how America’s vision and influence have shrunk under President Trump. While Mr. Trump pushes an America First agenda of isolationism and protectionism and embroils himself in controversies that raise doubts about his competence, President Xi Jinping of China exudes purpose and confidence as he tries to remake the global economic and political order and lure nations into Beijing’s orbit. Mr. Xi held the Beijing forum to showcase his One Belt, One Road initiative, which is aimed at creating a modern version of the Silk Road, a network of trading routes from China to Africa and Europe. Dozens of world leaders, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, attended. Many of them praised Mr. Xi’s vision, which he first voiced in 2013, and were enthusiastic about locating projects in their countries, financing them, building them or managing them. The plan offers many ways countries can participate; Britain and Singapore, for instance, seem eager to handle private financing. China’s leader has advantages in promoting his agenda. He’s in control. (It’s worth remembering that he is hardly a democrat.) His government has lots of money to invest. His propaganda machine is disciplined and relentless. And Mr. Xi himself is a Barnum-like salesman. “Development holds the master key to solving all problems,” he said at the forum, as if One Belt, One Road were the ultimate cure-all. No less important, many countries are desperate for infrastructure investment and jobs. China itself is eager to open new markets to nourish its own growth and to absorb an overproduction of steel, cement and machinery. Completing just a small fraction of the projects could help lift millions of people out of poverty and stabilize poor nations. "

Mueller III as a positive step to be careful what they wish for. While he concedes that the move will restore public faith in the ability of federal law enforcement to deal with such a politically charged matter, he has little confidence that Democrats and “assorted Trump critics in media” will refrain from using the investigation for “partisan ends irrespective of the eventual outcome.” Read more » _____ • Rick Wilson in The Washington Post: “Sticking with Trump to the bitter end and pretending the unfolding chaos is just ‘fake news’ won’t save your reputation as the walls close in. It won’t ease the judgment of history. It won’t do anything to polish up your future Wikipedia entry.” Mr. Wilson has been a Republican consultant for thirty years, and during that time, he writes, he’s dispensed with a lot of private advice. Now, Mr. Wilson — who vociferously staked out his position as a never-Trumper from early in the campaign — feels compelled to speak publicly to Republican staffers working for the administration. His message? The time to quit is now. Read more » _____ • Robert W. Merry in The American Conservative: “The elites figure that if they can just get rid of Trump, the country can return to what they consider normalcy — the status quo ante, before the Trumpian challenge to their status as rulers of America.” "
"He said it softly, and it seemed to be a joke. But John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, probably did not intend for his quip suggesting President Trump use a sword “on the press” to be recorded such that the world could hear. The remark came on Wednesday after Mr. Trump gave a commencement address to the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., in which he lauded the service before telling graduating cadets that no leader in history had been treated more unfairly by the news media. Mr. Trump then proceeded to shake numerous hands, before a representative of the Class of 2017 presented him with a sword as a token of their appreciation. “That is beautiful,” Mr. Trump can be heard saying on video recordings of the event. “Thank you, thank you very much.” Mr. Trump then posed for a picture of himself with the sword and the person who presented it to him, before handing it off, and sitting back down next to Mr. Kelly. “Use that on the press, sir,” Mr. Kelly said. “Yeah,” Mr. Trump replied, before chuckling. What might have been harmless banter on another day instead came during a tumultuous week for the White House that further strained its tense relationship with reporters. Just a day before, The New York Times reported that in a February meeting with James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey should consider putting reporters in prison for publishing classified information. The suggestion was swiftly denounced by some members of the news media as an “act of intimidation.” The Homeland Security Department and the White House did not immediately respond to emails late Wednesday seeking comment about the brief exchange.

"The major networks  unveiled their offerings for the coming television season to advertising buyers in Manhattan this week. Money, prestige and cultural import were at stake. Two New York Times reporters who cover media — John Koblin and Sapna Maheshwari — assess what they saw at the CBS presentation on Wednesday, the fourth and final upfront presentation from the major broadcast networks. JOHN What a difference a year makes. Last year, Stephen Colbert barely earned a footnote in CBS’s upfront — he was trailing Jimmy Fallon by as much as a million viewers a night, and he was being badly outshined by his colleague, “The Late Late Show” host, James Corden. CBS all but ignored him. This year, with Colbert surging and unexpectedly besting Fallon’s “The Tonight Show,” he was featured prominently in CBS’s opening sizzle reel and then came out to lead a song-and-dance number. He even took on the role of Company Man, proudly promoting all the top shows that CBS has on the air. CBS’s top dog, Les Moonves, admitted to the upfront crowd, “And if you think I love Stephen more now because he’s No. 1? You’re right.” (Colbert took it to another level later: His first guest on his show Wednesday night was “The Talk” co-host Julie Chen, Moonves’ wife.) Sapna, Colbert set the tone for what was probably the most high-energy upfront we’ve seen all week. SAPNA I absolutely agree, John, and ad buyers at the after-party felt that way. It didn’t hurt that CBS executives appeared to pay the right amount of attention to Google, Apple, Amazon and the rest of the internet while also hyping their own unique wares. We’ve seen the networks touting how they’re “No. 1” all week, but CBS, as we know, is able to lay claim to the most viewers over all. The Colbert opening was a huge hit, helped by what a wild news week it’s been — his jokes riffed off James Comey, Sean Spicer and, of course, President Trump, and appeared to land right on target. JOHN And one other joke I need to mention from Moonves: “One year ago, who would’ve predicted Stephen Colbert would be winning late night on CBS and Bill O’Reilly would be doing a podcast in his underwear?” After talking to a bunch of folks, there’s a consensus about this year’s upfronts: lackluster. NBC’s effort — for the second year in a row — at combining its broadcast network with all of its cable channels didn’t gel. (What’s the through line between “This Is Us,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer and USA’s W.W.E. competitions?) Fox was too sports-heavy, and the trailers for the network’s new shows were uneven. ABC’s was a wee bit too nostalgic. But CBS hit a different chord, and we heard genuine enthusiasm from advertisers at Carnegie Hall. SAPNA One ad buyer we talked to mentioned how lead-ins were absent from several of the presentations this week, but that CBS seemed to nail it by scheduling “Young Sheldon,” a sitcom that tells the back story of a “Big Bang Theory” character, to air after new episodes of that show. In effect, he said, it captures the audience that flicks the television to CBS at 8 p.m. and leaves it on for a few hours. It didn’t hurt the audience enthusiasm that “Young Sheldon” features the deeply “aww”-worthy Iain Armitage from HBO’s “Big Little Lies.” "
"WASHINGTON — When House Democratic leaders hastily called a news conference Wednesday to demonstrate their outrage at President Trump’s latest dramatics, they took great pains to show they were not seeking to railroad him out of the White House. “No one ought to, in my view, rush to embrace the most extraordinary remedy that involves the removal of the president from office,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the sober-minded senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. He warned that Democrats should not let their actions “be perceived as an effort to nullify the election by other means.” At that very moment, Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, was in the well of the House thundering, “The president must be impeached!” The barrage of reports about Mr. Trump’s chaotic and controversial administration has helped revive Democrats, raising their hopes that they can ride a Trumpian backlash to great success in next year’s elections. But with the cloud over the White House darkening each day, liberal activists are courting a backlash of their own as they demand of their lawmakers nothing short of driving the president from office by any means necessary. The demands of the radicalized party base are being amplified by growing calls from a series of Democratic candidates for statewide office who, in an effort to outflank their primary rivals, have started clamoring for Mr. Trump’s impeachment. Democratic members of Congress have for weeks sought to find their own political safe space when it comes to questions about removing Mr. Trump, calling for a special prosecutor and a thorough investigation and airing of all the facts. But the decision Wednesday by the Justice Department to name the former F.B.I. director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel for the investigation into Russia’s interference in last year’s election has complicated their position. "
