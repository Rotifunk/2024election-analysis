"Senate Republicans voted on Tuesday to strike down a sweeping new rule that would have allowed millions of Americans to band together in class-action lawsuits against financial institutions. The overturning of the rule, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a 50-to-50 tie, will further loosen regulation of Wall Street as the Trump administration and Republicans move to roll back Obama-era policies enacted in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis. By defeating the rule, Republicans are dismantling a major effort of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog created by Congress in the aftermath of the mortgage mess. The rule, five years in the making, would have dealt a serious blow to financial firms, potentially exposing them to a flood of costly lawsuits over questionable business practices. For decades, credit card companies and banks have inserted arbitration clauses into the fine print of financial contracts to circumvent the courts and bar people from pooling their resources in class-action lawsuits. By forcing people into private arbitration, the clauses effectively take away one of the few tools that individuals have to fight predatory and deceptive business practices. Arbitration clauses have derailed claims of financial gouging, discrimination in car sales and unfair fees. The new rule written by the consumer bureau, which was set to take effect in 2019, would have restored the right of individuals to sue in court. It was part of a spate of actions by the bureau, which has cracked down on debt collectors, the student loan industry and payday lenders. The arbitration rule has sparked a political battle that has taken on broader significance in the new administration. Republicans latched on to the rule as a way to cast the agency as a player in the regulatory regime that was impeding business and the economy. Shortly after the rule was adopted in July, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce pointed to it as a “prime example of an agency gone rogue.” "
"Two months before Sgt. La David T. Johnson died in an ambush in Niger, he told his sister in an hourlong video chat that he was ready to come home. He wanted to see his children again and return to his wife, then four months pregnant with their third child. “He was ready,” said Torneisha Ghent, 24, who along with her brother grew up in Carol City, a neighborhood in north Miami-Dade County. But Sergeant Johnson remained committed to his role as an Army mechanic serving the 3rd Special Forces Group as part of a mission to train African troops in the fight against terrorism. He told friends and family he wanted to help his team. He also needed the money to buy a home for his growing family. Ms. Ghent would never see her brother again. Weeks after their last exchange, Sergeant Johnson’s family learned that he had disappeared in a firefight. Days later, they learned of his death after an ambush. And then came the controversy over President Trump’s call to Sergeant Johnson’s widow, Myeshia Johnson, and the swirling feud that followed involving the president, his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, Ms. Johnson and Representative Frederica S. Wilson, Democrat of Florida, over what was said in the call. Yet many who knew the slain soldier now lament that Sergeant Johnson’s story has gotten lost amid the flurry of criticism and accusations. The bitter back and forth is a marked contrast to his life, which family, friends and fellow soldiers say was characterized by kindness and an optimism that allowed him to rise above a tough upbringing, when so much around him seemed set on keeping him down.

"You know that part in “Jurassic Park” when Dr. Grant and the kids are about to get chomped by velociraptors, but the Tyrannosaurus rex shows up and demolishes the raptors with her superior jaws? And you kind of forgive the T. rex for the first half of the movie when she was insatiably hungry for child meat, because in the end she stuck her neck out, as only a dino could, so our heroes could get away? That’s how I feel when Megyn Kelly goes in on Fox News and Bill O’Reilly. Except, of course, that Kelly, unlike a fictional dinosaur, has been through some truly horrific sexual violations, including vile and gendered comments from a man who is now the president of the United States, as well as an online silencing campaign that will most likely continue for as long as she refuses to capitulate. (Though, by the same token, that T. rex, as far as we know, has never gone on television and insisted that “Santa just is white.”) It’s a long, silly way to express the conflict at the heart of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Sometimes the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy. Kelly spent more than a dozen years as part of the Fox News machine, churning out the same brand of soft propaganda that helped lead to the Iraq war, the Tea Party and, eventually, “fake news” and President Trump. Kelly happily trafficked in racist tropes for profit — black communities have a “thug mentality,” asking repeatedly whether the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown were necessarily related to race — until her own dehumanization at the hands of Roger Ailes, O’Reilly and others became untenable. If you’ve heard the term “white feminism” tossed around your social media feeds, this is a prime example: fighting for freedom and justice as far as the boundaries of your own identity and not beyond. It’s an unfortunate reality that Kelly’s stature as a right-of-center icon confers a degree of credibility that the Fox News rank and file — and, let’s be honest, the public — withhold from the traditional heralds of the ills of rape, abuse and sexual harassment: feminists. Activists and scholars who devote their lives to the study of gender-based violence and its legislative and social amelioration have been systematically smeared as reactionary liars. America’s traditionalist wing has set a tidy trap: The more you actually know about the way abuse functions, the less seriously you’re taken. So, what do we do with the fact that, as destructive as some of Kelly’s work has been, there are people who listened to her indictment of Ailes who would never have listened to, say, Anita Hill. When Kelly finds a righteous purpose, she is potent. She found one this week, when — with the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations still at a fevered peak — news broke that O’Reilly had agreed to pay a $32 million settlement to the former Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl.

"BEIJING — The ceremony in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on Wednesday was meant to introduce the world to China’s new leaders, members of an elite committee that for decades has tried to govern by consensus and sometimes has been compared to a corporate board of directors. Instead, the nationally televised event was more a display of the political power that Xi Jinping has amassed in just five years as president. None of the other members of the new Politburo Standing Committee could be considered equals or potential rivals. The six men stood stiffly in dark suits on the stage, each bowing as Mr. Xi introduced them. After reciting their names, Mr. Xi added almost offhandedly: “More information about them can be found through media outlets.” The debut of the new Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in China, capped a weeklong Communist Party congress that became a celebration of Mr. Xi’s one-man style of rule and his promise to lead a resurgent China to a place at the center of the world stage. “A new era needs a new look, and even more needs new accomplishments,” Mr. Xi said as his colleagues, all men in their 60s, lined up before cameras. For the first time in a generation, the new Standing Committee did not include a younger leader who would be groomed as heir apparent. The decision to delay anointing a successor broke with the unwritten conventions that have ensured relatively stable leadership changes since the era of Deng Xiaoping, which was troubled by schisms and purges.

"WASHINGTON — The presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee paid for research that was included in a dossier made public in January that contained salacious claims about connections between Donald J. Trump, his associates and Russia. A spokesperson for a law firm said on Tuesday that it had hired Washington-based researchers last year to gather damaging information about Mr. Trump on numerous subjects — including possible ties to Russia — on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. The revelation, which emerged from a letter filed in court on Tuesday, is likely to fuel new partisan attacks over federal and congressional investigations into Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s election and whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted in the effort. The president and his allies have argued for months that the investigations are politically motivated. They have challenged the information contained in the dossier, which was compiled by a former British spy who had been contracted by the Washington research firm Fusion GPS. The letter that was filed in court said that Fusion GPS began working for the law firm, Perkins Coie, in April 2016. Written by the firm’s general counsel, Matthew J. Gehringer, the letter said that Fusion GPS had already been conducting the research “for one or more other clients during the Republican primary contest.” Perkins Coie was paid $12.4 million to represent the Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. during the 2016 campaign, according to filings. The role of the Clinton campaign and the national party in funding the research for the dossier was first reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post. "
"WASHINGTON — A former Republican president. A senior Republican senator with a critical illness. A retiring Republican senator. And now an independent-minded Republican senator who faced a difficult, if not impossible, path to re-election. George W. Bush. John McCain. Bob Corker. And now Jeff Flake of Arizona, who delivered a stinging indictment of President Trump and his own party on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon as he announced that he would not seek another term. His stirring call to arms came minutes after Mr. Trump concluded a private session with Senate Republicans meant to unite them over their shared agenda. The four men represent a new type of freedom caucus, one whose members are free to speak their minds about the president and how they see his words and actions diminishing the United States and its standing in the world without fear of the political backlash from hard-right conservatives. But who — if anyone — will follow? Well aware of the mercurial nature of the president, most congressional Republicans are loath to do or say anything that could upset Mr. Trump and risk provoking an early-morning Twitter tirade from the White House when they are trying to delicately piece together a complex tax agreement. One can practically sense Republicans tiptoeing around the Capitol, taking extra care not to awaken the president to their presence in a way that could draw a scolding or rebuke. They are equally wary of raising the ire of hard-right activists who already had Mr. Flake in their sights, contributing to his decision. Those activists celebrated Mr. Flake’s decision, claiming a Republican scalp. "
"In 1911, in the midst of a debate about whether Britain’s House of Lords should willingly give up its veto power over legislation or fight a doomed battle to retain its privileges, a British peer, Lord Selborne, framed the debate for his fellow lords this way: “The question is, shall we perish in the dark, slain by our own hand, or in the light, killed by our enemies?” A similar question has confronted Republican politicians throughout the age of Trump, and again and again they have chosen to die in the dark. This was true of Trump’s strongest primary-season rivals, who fought him directly and concertedly during exactly one of the umpteen debates and then, finding open war hard going, chose to lose and bow out as though Trump were a normal rival rather than the fundamentally unfit figure they had described just a few short weeks before. It was true of the party functionaries, the hapless Reince Priebus above all, who denied the residual Republican forces resisting Trump the chance to fight him one last time in the light of the convention floor. It was true of the party’s leaders in Washington, both the men of savvy and the men of honor, who came up with endless excuses for why they couldn’t take on Trump directly before he won the nomination and put party over conviction thereafter. It was true of Paul Ryan; it was true even of John McCain. It was not true of everyone. Mitt Romney and John Kasich declined to fall on the sword of party unity; so did George W. Bush and his father; so did some governors and a few junior senators, Mike Lee and Ben Sasse and Jeff Flake. "

"On Wednesday “Mr. Robot” finally filled in some of the gaps surrounding the 5/9 hack, including what happened to the popcorn gun and how Elliot ended up in Tyrell Wellick’s SUV at the end of Season 1. The episode also suggested that Irving, the Thermos enthusiast and aspiring pulp novelist, has been involved with this story for a while, and revealed why Agent Santiago has often seemed to be working against the investigators who are trying to find Wellick. (The short answer: Because he is.) But the biggest gap of all has belonged to Wellick himself, the possibly insane Swede with a God complex and daddy issues. We now know his disappearing act took him to a country cabin to cool his heels, grow a beard, split wood and work on Stage 2 of E Corp’s demise. Along the way we saw him bulk up and get broken down by Wallace Shawn, here playing an fsociety mask brought to life, before making an ill-advised escape attempt that cost a small town cop his brains (and Wellick an intact thumb joint). It was a lot of Wellick, in other words. While this was necessary to bring the story up to speed — as well as answer lingering questions like, “So did he wear the suit the whole time he was gone?” — it also asked viewers to invest in the quandaries of a character we haven’t been conditioned to care much about, on an emotional level. Wellick has always been something of an enigma. He arrived as a Patrick Bateman-style corporate striver-as-sociopath — both took out their aggressions on homeless people, among others — but also oozed insecurity. Martin Wallström’s composed, confident Nordic features could turn brittle in a heartbeat, and Wellick’s frequent flights into rage suggested that, like Elliot, he had less control over himself and his situation than he’d like. His toxic ambition seemed driven mostly by his even more toxic wife, by her demands and his need to meet them. But his devotion to Elliot (really Mr. Robot), one-sided though it might have been, suggests that what he mostly craves is someone with answers to tell him what to do. Never a vision guy, Wellick’s more comfortable taking someone else’s plan and maniacally dedicating himself to it — he’s a slick suit full of avarice waiting to be directed. "

ust before I finished my story about Amazon’s arrival in Australia and its possible impact on the book industry, I started to hear something familiar in the way bookstore owners and authors were talking about their resistance to the giant American retailer. Then it hit me. Isn’t their intense opposition to Amazon’s arrival just another version of the nationalist populism of Pauline Hanson and Donald J. Trump? What if the culture industry is for the intellectual left what factory jobs are for the populist right — a piece of the economy tied to identity and nostalgia that they just can’t help but want preserved and protected at all costs? There are obviously differences between resistance to a large corporate behemoth like Amazon, and resistance to, say immigrants and refugees — big differences. But at some core human level, both are driven by fear of a future defined by outsiders, and a love for what is. I recognized the emotions I heard talking to bookstore owners and writers because it reminded me of the emotions I heard talking to working-class Americans as they struggled through the global financial crisis and its aftermath. In both cases, many of the people I talked to started with jabs of outrage only to end with sighs and worry. "
"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices. The commission’s chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion. But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated. They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google. “The marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975,” Mr. Pai said. It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry. Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry. In the spring, soon after he lifted a cap on how many stations a single company can own, the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The merger, which the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice are reviewing, would give Sinclair access to more than 70 percent of all television viewers in the United States. This week, the commission’s Republican majority lifted rules that required television stations owners to operate a main studio in each locality, which Mr. Pai said was unnecessary and costly for TV station owners. The announcement on Wednesday, at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing, pleased newspaper groups and broadcast stations, which have lobbied for changes that they say are necessary to compete with online media giants like YouTube and Facebook.

"A 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy has been detained by federal immigration authorities in Texas after she passed through a Border Patrol checkpoint on her way to a hospital to undergo emergency gall bladder surgery. The girl, Rosamaria Hernandez, who was brought over the border illegally to live in Laredo, Tex., when she was three months old, was being transferred from a medical center in Laredo to a hospital in Corpus Christi around 2 a.m. on Tuesday when Border Patrol agents stopped the ambulance she was riding in, her family said. The agents allowed her to continue to Driscoll Children’s Hospital, the family said, but followed the ambulance the rest of the way there, then waited outside her room until she was released from the hospital. By Wednesday evening, according to family members and advocates involved in her case, immigration agents had taken her to a facility in San Antonio where migrant children who arrive alone in the United States from Central America are usually held, even though her parents, who both lack legal status, live 150 miles away in Laredo. Her placement there highlighted the unusual circumstances of her case: The federal government maintains detention centers for adult immigrants it plans to deport, facilities for families who arrive at the border together and shelters for children who come by themselves, known as unaccompanied minors. But it is rare, if not unheard-of, for a child already living in the United States to be arrested — particularly one with a serious medical condition. Immigration agents have, however, detained some teenagers who are suspected of membership in gangs like MS-13, a gang rooted in Los Angeles and El Salvador that President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have repeatedly condemned. As a general matter, the Trump administration has hardened immigration enforcement across the country, lifting guidelines established under President Barack Obama that made it unlikely that any unauthorized immigrants other than recent arrivals to the country and those with serious criminal records would be deported.

"HOUSTON — A pregnant undocumented teenager in federal custody whose attempt to have an abortion set off a monthlong legal battle with the Trump administration terminated her pregnancy on Wednesday morning. She underwent the procedure a day after a court ruling forced federal officials to allow it. The teenager, who is 17 and is identified in court documents as Jane Doe, illegally crossed the border in Texas in early September and was apprehended. Her pregnancy was discovered during a physical exam, and since then she had been fighting in court to have an abortion. In a statement released by her lawyers and her court-appointed guardian, Jane Doe, who had been nearly 16 weeks pregnant, wrote of coming to the United States with dreams of one day becoming a nurse, and of not being ready to be a parent. “My lawyers have told me that people around the country have been calling and writing to show support for me,” Jane Doe wrote in her statement. “I am touched by this show of love from people I may never know and from a country I am just beginning to know — to all of you, thank you. This is my life, my decision. I want a better future. I want justice.” Jane Doe was transported from the federally funded shelter in Brownsville where she has been living to an abortion provider, which was not identified. She returned to the shelter after the procedure and remains in federal custody. She had received a state court order on Sept. 25 allowing her to have an abortion without her parents’ consent. But the decision that cleared the way came one month later, on Tuesday, when a federal appeals court in Washington sided with Jane Doe, sending the case back to a lower court, which immediately ordered the Trump administration to allow her to obtain an abortion “promptly and without delay.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday loosened some rules for commercial drones, including for package deliveries, by allowing broader testing by companies like Amazon and Wing, a part of Alphabet. Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to allow more companies to test their flying machines at night, above people, at far greater distances and with packages — activities limited by federal restrictions. The Transportation Department will work with states, towns and tribal communities to create pilot programs, the White House said. For example, a drone maker like DJI could apply with a town to test drone deliveries from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. The pilot programs are expected to be put in place within one year. The announcement is a victory for tech companies that have bet that drone deliveries will be a part of retail in the future, as well as entertainment companies that want to use the machines for filming. Amazon, Google, DJI, Intel and Hollywood lobbied the Obama administration to ease rules on commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. Amazon even proposed a future highway system in the sky, in which lower altitudes would be reserved for lighter weight drones that could deliver packages. But the Transportation Department has proceeded cautiously around allowing the machines to integrate into airspace shared by planes. Lawmakers and public interest groups have also raised concerns about privacy. Many questions remain about the program announced on Wednesday, including how many drones could be part of pilot programs. The Federal Aviation Administration is still deliberating potential rules for commercial drones, which are expected to have far more impact on the industry than Wednesday’s executive memorandum. The White House said the approach taken by the United States until now has put the country behind other nations on technology innovation. Wing is testing in Australia, Amazon in Britain and Zipline in Rwanda, said Michael Kratsios, the deputy assistant to the president at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. “To maintain U.S. leadership, our country needs a regulatory framework,” Mr. Kratsios said.

"Richard A. Dietl, known to most by the percussive nickname Bo, climbed the stairs of a subway platform at Union Square in Manhattan when he bumped into a man who knew him from his time as a police officer in crime-plagued Harlem in the 1970s. Mr. Dietl had prowled the precinct in one of the department’s old green-and-white patrol cars. The man had been a drug dealer — but he greeted the former cop like an old friend. “C’mon, Bo, man, you were an action hero in those days,” the man, Eric Pitt, 58, said as they discussed notorious drug locales from four decades ago. ""When you came out, everyone closed up shop.” Now when Mr. Dietl comes out — 66 years old, barrel-chested and wealthy from a career as a television personality and private investigator — he is in search of votes for a mayoral run that is as unworldly as it is unlikely to succeed. He has no party line to run on. He voted for Donald J. Trump, a black mark for a citywide electorate that massively rejected the president in 2016. And a recent poll showed him more than 50 points behind Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat whom he often refers to as “Big Bird.” “It is going to be an extremely uphill battle to say the very least,” said Eric Ulrich, a Republican councilman from Queens who supports Mr. Dietl. “He has a vision. He isn’t always the most articulate in explaining his positions or why he’s in the race, but his heart is in the right place.” "
"The tech giants are too big. They’re getting bigger. We can stop them. But in all likelihood, we won’t. The history of American business is one of repeated cycles of unfettered, sometimes catastrophic growth followed by periods of reflection and regulation. In previous eras of suffocating corporate dominance over our lives — when industrialists gained an economic stranglehold through railroads and vast oil and steel concerns, or when rampant financial speculation sent the nation into economic paroxysms — Americans turned to their government for a fix. In the last half-century, lawmakers and regulators set up a regime to improve the safety of automobiles and other manufactured goods, to break up a telephone monopoly that controlled much of the nation’s communications and to loosen the fatal grip that tobacco companies held over American society. We are now at another great turning point in the global economy. A handful of technology companies, the Frightful Five — Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, the largest American corporations by stock-market value — control the technological platforms that will dominate life for the foreseeable future. Yet despite their growth and obvious impact on the economy and society, technology has long been given a special pass. For nearly two decades, under Republican and Democratic presidents, most tech giants have been spared from much legislation, regulation and indeed much government scrutiny of any kind. Now, that attitude is beginning to change. I spent the past several weeks talking to people in government and public policy circles about whether we should begin thinking about how to curb the tech giants’ power through government — and, if so, how.

Senator Jeff Flake in The Washington Post: After his speech on the Senate Floor on Tuesday, Mr. Flake wrote this op-ed in The Washington Post, urging members of both parties to remember to “stand up and speak out.” Unbound by the political burdens of running for re-election, Mr. Flake writes that he intends to spend the remaining 14 months of his term “guided only by the dictates of conscience.” Read more » _____ The editors of The Weekly Standard: The editorial board of The Weekly Standard notes that it is puzzling why President Trump and his “celebrity allies” such as Stephen K.

"The Radio City Rockettes have owned Christmastime for more than eight decades. But repeated attempts to create a second Rockettes franchise show for warm-weather months have not gone smoothly, and the latest effort — a big-budget, multiweek “spectacular” that had been postponed until 2018 — is no longer in the works, people involved with the production said this week. The struggle to turn precision dance and kick lines into lucrative rites of spring and summer — akin to the Rockettes’ “Christmas Spectacular” — goes back years and at one point featured the now-disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein in a pivotal role. Once a source of great excitement, such efforts have become an enduring challenge for the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the Rockettes. Executives there torpedoed a new Rockettes show in 2014 and then mounted expensive “spectaculars” in 2015 and 2016 that drew scorn from many critics. A 2017 “spectacular” was postponed in February for a year, and the company instead made money by renting Radio City Music Hall this year to big draws like Dave Chappelle. Such lucrative rentals continue to hold strong appeal for James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, but he and other leaders still want another franchise for the Rockettes that rivals the popularity of the Christmas show, according to executives at the company and people close to the Rockettes. The current idea is for a Rockettes show that can be easily mounted, then packed up, then remounted — thereby providing flexibility so the company can make room for limited profit-making runs by the starry likes of Mr. Chappelle. David O’Connor, the company’s chief executive officer, said in a statement Wednesday: “We are actively reconceiving the show to take advantage of our technology investments in Radio City which allow us to further enhance the production as well as to more nimbly bring the show in and out to accommodate other events.” Devising a new annual entertainment tradition in an era when people have so many options, however, has bedeviled producers across fields like theater, circus, art, and concert festivals.

"To the Editor: Re “In Biting Speech, Flake Denounces ‘Reckless’ Trump” (front page, Oct. 25): Tuesday was a remarkable day in politics for the country and for the Republican Party. Two highly respected Republican senators spoke out resolutely and with great heart about the shortcomings of President Trump. They called out his incessant lack of truthfulness, and his penchant for debasing the ideals of democracy and free speech that are at the core of our great Republic. Yes, about a third of Americans don’t agree with Senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, or simply give the president a pass because they support his agenda. Seemingly for these people any price is worth the cost if their agenda is furthered. To these people I say, Be very careful what you wish for. You may find short-run satisfaction if parts of Mr. Trump’s agenda get passed, but at what ultimate cost to our country and the office of the presidency? Stay alert; our Republic is under attack from within. KEN DEROW, SWARTHMORE, PA. To the Editor: While everyone is touting the fact that Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker are standing up to President Trump, they are, in fact, capitulating. By not running for re-election, they have given in to the Stephen Bannon wing and have taken the heart out of the G.O.P. What’s even more interesting is that Mr. Flake, one of the first Tea Party members, is not far enough to the right to be re-elected. This is not a happy day because people are standing up to the president. This is a sad day because the Trump/Bannon folks have won. ED MAXWELL, SOUTH HADLEY, MASS. To the Editor: While I do not agree with many of Senator Jeff Flake’s policy views, nor those of Senator Bob Corker, the country owes them a debt of gratitude for their willingness to speak up and call out President Trump’s behavior. They have done a service to our country. If only other senators would put the country’s interests above their political future, we might return to a functioning polity where civility and problem-solving take precedence over invective and intransigence.

"WASHINGTON — A federal judge sided with the Trump administration on Wednesday in a ruling against 18 states that sought to compel the federal government to pay subsidies to health insurance companies for the benefit of millions of low-income people. “It appears initially that the Trump administration has the stronger legal argument,” Judge Vince Chhabria of Federal District Court in San Francisco wrote in the ruling. He refused to issue a preliminary injunction requested by the states, leaving the dispute to be resolved in a trial in his courtroom over the next few months. The states, led by the attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, contend that the payments are needed to prevent chaos and confusion in insurance markets during the annual open enrollment period, which starts on Nov. 1. But Judge Chhabria said at a hearing on Monday that California and other states had found “a very clever way” to protect their residents against immediate harm from termination of the subsidies by President Trump. As a result, he said in his Wednesday ruling, many low-income people will be “better off or unharmed.’’ The subsidies reimburse insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs for seven million low-income people who buy midlevel silver plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Under the law, insurers will still have to provide the discounts, known as cost-sharing reductions, but may be unable to collect reimbursement from the government. "
"Senator Jeff Flake is a conservative Republican from Arizona. I’m a Democrat from Delaware. We have opposed each other on nearly every vote for as long as we’ve served in the Senate. So his announcement on Tuesday that he won’t seek re-election in 2018 should be great news for me. That’s one way to look at it — the senator is nothing more than my political opponent, someone whose loss is my gain. But that’s not at all how I see things. I may disagree with Mr. Flake on policy, but I consider him an honorable man, a loyal friend and a valued colleague. His retirement is deeply troubling to me because he represents a principled and patriotic Republican Party, one that has long championed strong American leadership around the world, and one I now fear is falling apart. That should scare all Americans. It sure scares me. How did Mr. Flake, who served in Congress since 2003 and has been in the Senate since 2013, become such an outsider in his own party that he wouldn’t seek re-election after only one term? Over the past year, right-wing populists have mocked his principled independence, donors have funded his primary opponent and President Trump, hardly a conservative and only recently a Republican, has openly wished for his defeat. This has been Mr. Flake’s punishment for charting his own course on issues such as immigration reform and for having the courage to stand up to Mr. Trump, first as a candidate and now as president. His loyalty to the Republican Party, to his conservative principles and to his deep sense of right and wrong never wavered — which is why he refused to be silent when he believed the president was wrong. This situation didn’t come out of nowhere. Over the past few decades, our political culture has corroded. Traditions of compromise and civility have given way to a zero-sum, winner-take-all approach that is now out of control. As Mr. Flake said on the Senate floor Tuesday, “Anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.” "
"The adrenaline of a live show, the thrill of sharing air with a superstar performer and thousands of passionate fans, is difficult to replicate on a screen. But technology is trying. Images are getting sharper, speakers subtler and streaming faster. Viewers can customize and interact with real-time content while relaxing on their couches next to snacks and a clean restroom. Compared with the $92.98 average ticket price for a National Football League game or $200 for good seats at a Katy Perry concert, ordering in for entertainment is getting ever more appealing to consumers. And if the most important words for developers working on the next generation of arenas are location, location location, they’re followed closely by diversify, diversify, diversify. The English soccer club Tottenham Hotspur’s new stadium, set to open next year in London, will accommodate multiple sports with a field that can retract to reveal artificial turf to host N.F.L. games. T-Mobile Arena, the home of the N.H.L.’s Vegas Golden Knights, has two towers jutting from the interior, each serving as part-time viewing platforms and, occasionally, nightclubs. And plans for a 60,000-seat football stadium for the Washington Redskins include a recreational moat that can be used for kayaking and surfing in the summer and ice-skating in the winter, while its external skin could double as a climbing or rappelling wall. “People have so many opportunities at their fingertips to seek out the type of entertainment they want,” said Brian Mirakian, senior principal at Populous Activate, a firm that helped design the new Yankee Stadium and several Olympic stadiums. “Having the drawing power necessary to pull those people into our buildings has never been more critical.” "
"While global demand for coal is falling as the nations of the world have committed themselves to slashing carbon emissions, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia wants to help a powerful Indian conglomerate build an enormous system of coal mines in a remote stretch of Queensland. Burning the estimated 66 million tons of coal a year that the Adani Group aims to produce from six open-pit and five underground complexes known as the Carmichael mine can only make it harder for the world to meet its aspirations under the Paris climate agreement. The project has prompted huge protests across Australia. “You can’t have both the Paris climate agreement and Adani’s Carmichael coal mine,” the climate change activist Bill McKibben said. “Full stop.” Mr. Turnbull has promoted the mine with the same argument President Trump has made to remove what he sees as impediments to coal mining in Appalachia, framing mining as a job creator in a region that sorely needs jobs. The prime minister has also supported Adani’s request for a taxpayer-financed loan of $800 million. But even one of Adani’s consultants has disputed the company’s claim that the project will generate 10,000 jobs. In fact, the project could cost mining jobs elsewhere in Australia. The nearby Great Barrier Reef supports some 64,000 full-time employees, but shipping all that coal to India risks further harm to this environmentally sensitive area, already endangered by global warming. The Adani Group chairman, Gautam Adani, plans to use 60 percent of the Carmichael coal, which is of a higher quality than Indian coal, for his financially stressed Mundra coal-fired power plant in Gujarat, India. It would be a regressive move for India, which is making great strides with solar and other forms of renewable energy. In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed India to getting 40 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Existing coal-burning plants in India are running below 60 percent capacity, and while increased demand for energy may push them to full capacity, by then, “the price of renewables will be lower than the price of coal,” observes Ajay Mathur, director general of the Energy Resources Institute in New Delhi. India’s energy minister, Piyush Goyal, was clear: “We don’t wish to import coal from anywhere in the world,” he said. “We have sufficient coal capacity in our country.” Australia is helping Mr. Adani get what he wants, but it’s the opposite of what Australia, India or the rest of the world needs.

"WASHINGTON — This past summer, the Trump administration debated lowering the annual cap on refugees admitted to the United States. Should it stay at 110,000, be cut to 50,000 or fall somewhere in between? John F. Kelly offered his opinion. If it were up to him, he said, the number would be between zero and one. Mr. Kelly’s comment made its way around the White House, according to an administration official, and reinforced what is only now becoming clear to many on the outside. While some officials had predicted Mr. Kelly would be a calming chief of staff for an impulsive president, recent days have made clear that he is more aligned with President Trump than anticipated. For all of the talk of Mr. Kelly as a moderating force and the so-called grown-up in the room, it turns out that he harbors strong feelings on patriotism, national security and immigration that mirror the hard-line views of his outspoken boss. With his attack on a congresswoman who had criticized Mr. Trump’s condolence call to a slain soldier’s widow last week, Mr. Kelly showed that he was willing to escalate a politically distracting, racially charged public fight even with false assertions. And in lamenting that the country no longer holds women, religion, military families or the dignity of life “sacred” the way it once did, Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general whose son was killed in Afghanistan, waded deep into the culture wars in a way few chiefs of staff typically do. Conservatives cheered his defense of what they consider traditional American values, while liberals condemned what they deemed an outdated view of a modern, pluralistic society. “The real issue is understanding really who John Kelly is,” said former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, a Democrat for whom Mr. Kelly worked at the Pentagon during President Barack Obama’s administration. “If you understand what makes him tick, then it all fits together.” “He is a Marine first and foremost,” Mr. Panetta said. “In addition to being a Marine, he was born and raised in Boston” among blue-collar families with traditional views about God and country. “You combine those two and you realize” that he “shares some of these deep values, some of which Trump himself has tried to talk about.” "
"The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said on Wednesday that he had rebuffed a request for help last year from the head of a data firm that worked for Donald J. Trump and is now facing congressional scrutiny. On Twitter, Mr. Assange said he had been approached before the 2016 election by Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Mr. Trump during the final months of the campaign. Mr. Assange did not disclose what kind of help Mr. Nix sought, only that he had declined the request. “I can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica,” Mr. Assange wrote, “and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks.” But The Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that Mr. Nix had emailed Mr. Assange looking for copies of more than 30,000 emails that were deleted from Hillary Clinton’s private server and never publicly released. Mrs. Clinton has said that the emails were personal in nature. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday evening. It is not clear precisely when the two men corresponded. CNN reported on Wednesday that the emails were exchanged in the summer of 2016. Cambridge Analytica was being paid by a rival campaign — that of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas — through early June, according to Federal Election Commission records. By early summer, Cambridge Analytica had also begun wooing the Trump campaign, which hired the firm in June. The firm’s principal owner is the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, who backed Mr. Cruz during the campaign before switching his allegiance to Mr. Trump. It is also unclear why Mr. Nix would have believed that Mr. Assange had copies of the missing emails. Earlier last year, WikiLeaks had posted a searchable database of more than 50,000 emails from Mrs. Clinton’s private server, all of them previously released by the State Department. But Mr. Trump himself seemed eager to find the missing emails: At a campaign rally in July, Mr. Trump publicly asked Russia to obtain the deleted emails. "
"It’s less striking that a few Republican congressmen have publicly denounced President Trump’s conduct than that most of their colleagues have not. Their fellow legislators have silently accepted his outrages in exchange for policies they’ve always wanted. At his inauguration Mr. Trump said his presidency was about “transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the American people.” But he and his allies in Congress are transferring power to Wall Street, fossil fuel companies, the chemical industry and other special interests, and are stoking an anti-populist bonfire to incinerate protections for consumers and workers. On Tuesday night the Senate, with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, followed the House in voting to overturn a rule that would have allowed consumers to file class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, rather than be forced to take their disputes to arbitration. The regulation, created after fraud and malfeasance by those businesses financially ruined thousands of Americans and almost wrecked the world economy, joins a series of Obama-era rules that Congress and Mr. Trump have shredded. Meanwhile, they have taken several actions to benefit the well-off at the expense of average Americans. Mr. Trump signed an executive order allowing insurers to sell skimpy health insurance plans that do not protect people with pre-existing conditions and that will destabilize the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. He also said he would stop making payments to insurers that were authorized by the 2010 law, which will cause companies to increase premiums, hurting middle-class families. His administration shortened the open enrollment period when people can buy insurance policies for next year, and slashed spending on advertising and outreach efforts. The administration made it easier for companies to stop providing no-cost birth control to employees if they have religious or moral objections to doing so. It announced that teenage pregnancy prevention grants would end two years early. Congress repealed an Obama-era rule that forbade states to deny family planning funds to Planned Parenthood. Congress overturned a rule restricting the ability of coal companies to dump their mining debris into streams and other waterways, threatening rural communities, forests and wildlife. "
"WASHINGTON — This article was updated on Dec. 21 with more details about Fusion GPS, the company that compiled the dossier, and who paid for it. The dossier of research into President Trump’s connections to Russia is the product of a research firm founded by a former journalist, Glenn R. Simpson. It is a 35-page collection of research memos written by Christopher Steele, a respected former British intelligence agent, primarily during the 2016 presidential campaign. The memos, compiled by a research firm called Fusion GPS, allege a multifaceted conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to help Mr. Trump defeat Mrs. Clinton. The memos also detail unsubstantiated accounts of encounters between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes, and real estate deals that were intended as bribes, among other claims about Mr. Trump’s businesses. Mr. Simpson founded Fusion GPS in 2010. The firm is paid to do research by a variety of clients, including political donors, corporations, hedge funds and law firms. During election years, the firm is mostly focused on political opposition research — digging up dirt on a client’s opponent. The firm’s website lists very few details — there is a two-paragraph description of what the firm does and a single email address. During the Republican primaries, a research firm called Fusion GPS was hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, to unearth potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump. The Free Beacon — which was funded by a major donor supporting Mr. Trump’s rival for the party’s nomination, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida — told Fusion GPS to stop doing research on Mr. Trump in May 2016, as Mr. Trump was clinching the Republican nomination. After Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates — including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information. "
"President Trump falsely dismissed Senator Jeff Flake as a Democrat on Wednesday, offering a distorted timeline of their conflict a day after Mr. Flake, Republican of Arizona, announced his retirement with a strongly worded rebuke of the president. “Long before he ever knew me, during the campaign, even before the campaign — I mean, he came out with this horrible book, and I said, ‘Who is this guy?’” Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. “In fact, I remembered the first time I saw him on television I had not really been — nobody knew me in terms of politics.” “But the first time I saw him on television, I said, ‘I assume he’s a Democrat. Is he a Democrat?’” Mr. Trump said. “They said he’s a Republican. I said, ‘That’s impossible.’” In truth, the two men met in early July 2016 at a private Republican summit meeting on Capitol Hill, after Mr. Trump had won the last primaries but before the Republican National Convention, where he accepted the party’s nomination. Mr. Flake has said that he began working on his book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” during the general election. Mr. Trump posted several tweets calling him “weak” in September 2016. The book was published in August. The White House did not respond to inquiries about when Mr. Trump initially saw Mr. Flake on television or what prompted the assumption that the senator was a Democrat. But the characterization is perplexing given the Mr. Flake’s consistent standing as one of the more conservative members of the Republican Party since he was first elected to Congress in 2000. In the 1990s, Mr. Flake served as the executive director of the Goldwater Institute in Arizona, a libertarian think tank named for Barry M. Goldwater, the deeply conservative senator. While a member of the House of Representatives for 12 years, Mr. Flake staked his reputation on being a fiscally responsible conservative, voting against spending bills and waging fights over earmarks.

"The Weinstein Company is looking for a new financial lifeline after a preliminary agreement for an immediate cash infusion from Colony Capital fell through. Last week, Colony, the private equity firm run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr., reached a preliminary agreement to provide much-needed cash to the studio, which has been thrown into turmoil by allegations of sexual harassment and rape against its co-founder Harvey Weinstein. Colony was also given a limited period to exclusively pursue the purchase of some or all of the Weinstein Company’s assets. But those plans have changed. Colony has not and will not provide a cash infusion, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Wednesday to discuss private deliberations. It was unclear why the preliminary agreement had fallen apart. Colony, which has experience in distressed Hollywood assets, continues to explore the purchase of some or all of the Weinstein Company’s assets. But Colony found more disorder than it had expected — and less value — once it started closely examining the studio’s assets, according to two people who were briefed on the matter. They added that Colony saw bankruptcy as the most likely near-term outcome for the studio. Representatives for Colony and the Weinstein Company declined to comment. The Weinstein Company still has options. Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that has lent money to beleaguered film companies in the past, has been working on a potential financing package for the studio valued at roughly $35 million, which would provide enough liquidity for the studio to operate roughly through January, according to three people briefed on the matter. On Monday, the New York attorney general opened an inquiry into the studio, examining whether allegations against Mr. Weinstein reflect broad gender discrimination and other civil rights violations.

"As a child growing up in Snowflake, Ariz., a town that his Mormon pioneer great-great-grandfather helped found in the 1870s, Senator Jeff Flake learned to sing a popular children’s hymn, “Choose the Right.” He had no trouble recalling the hymn’s words on the telephone Wednesday, a day after he took to the floor of the Senate to deliver a stinging rebuke to his party and president, and to announce that he would not run for re-election in 2018. His decision was political and pragmatic, he acknowledged: he faced a tough primary battle and trailed in the polls. But his revulsion at President Trump also appeared to reflect his Mormon faith. It is a faith that puts a premium on decorum and comity, one that was born in America but is increasingly international and multicultural, and one whose young people often wear rings engraved “CTR” as a reminder of the hymn, which begins, “Choose the right when a choice is placed before you.” Mormons are also accustomed to testifying in public at monthly meetings, sometimes offering passionate stories of personal revelation. “We are taught that we ought to stand up for what we know is right, and also to be decent,” Mr. Flake said in the telephone interview. “I hope I’m acting on the faith that I believe in.” Mr. Flake came out early in the presidential primaries as an opponent of Mr. Trump, and unlike many in his party, he has remained a vocal critic, despite representing a state where the president is still popular. Although he has generally voted with Mr. Trump and the Republican majority in the Senate, he chastised his party on Tuesday for acquiescing in the lying and divisiveness that he said had come from the White House.

"Despite the fervor of President Trump’s Republican opponents, the president’s brand of hard-edge nationalism — with its gut-level cultural appeals and hard lines on trade and immigration — is taking root within his adopted party, and those uneasy with grievance politics are either giving in or giving up the fight. In some cases, the retirement of an anti-Trump Republican could actually improve the Republican Party’s chance of retaining a seat. Senator Jeff Flake’s decision on Tuesday to not seek re-election was greeted with quiet sighs of relief in a party anguished by his plunging approval ratings. But such short-term advantages mask a larger, even existential threat to traditional Republicans. The Grand Old Party risks a longer-term transformation into the Party of Trump. “There is zero appetite for the ‘Never Trump’ movement in the Republican Party of today,” said Andy Surabian, an adviser to Great America Alliance, the “super PAC” that is aiding primary races against Republican incumbents. “This party is now defined by President Trump and his movement.” On Wednesday, Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, announced that he would not run again, an indication that the Washington fever was spreading. Mr. Straus, a pragmatist with deep ties to the Bush family who had tangled with his state’s hard-liners, delivered a plea that Republicans “appeal to our diverse population with an optimistic vision,” but he still chose flight over fight. Mr. Straus’s dash for the exits followed the retirement announcements of Mr. Flake, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee and Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Pat Tiberi of Ohio and Dave Reichert of Washington State — all members of the Republican establishment.

"BAGHDAD — The American commander of the international military campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria said Wednesday that the militants were “on the run” and facing defeat as the American-led coalition made plans to kill or capture several thousand remaining insurgents. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, is clinging to roughly 5 percent of the territory it controlled in the two countries three years ago, the commander, Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk II, said in an interview. “Daesh has no chance to win,” General Funk said. “The outcome is not in doubt.” He said only about 1,500 to 2,500 militants remain in western Iraq near the Syrian border, and an additional 2,500 to 5,500 in the Euphrates River valley in eastern Syria. The coalition said that the territory controlled by the Islamic State in both countries had dropped from a peak of more than 40,000 square miles in 2014 to about 2,700 square miles today, split roughly between Iraq and Syria. “They cannot hold territory,” General Funk said. “They cannot hold any viable cities. Their leaders have abandoned them.” But he warned that Islamic State militants in both countries were likely to mount terrorist attacks and maintain underground cells even after losing control of territory. He said the coalition planned to turn soon to training Iraqi security forces to combat any Islamic State resurgence. The Trump administration and the Pentagon have not specified how long the American train-and-assist mission would last, but they have emphasized they will not repeat the Obama administration’s decision in 2011 to withdraw.

"Banks just scored a victory against disgruntled customers — and, in the longer term, against themselves. The Senate has killed a rule allowing groups of consumers to sue financial firms and card issuers even when the small print of their contracts prohibits them from doing so. Clauses that keep customers out of the courts have caused reputational problems for Wall Street before, and will again. Industry lobbying paid off when the Senate overturned a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on Tuesday night. The measure was proposed by Richard Cordray, the head of the agency, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama. Mr. Cordray argued that consumers needed protection from fine print forcing them to rely on private arbitration, which often favors the firms, when they feel they have been wronged. Banks said the rule would increase costs for consumers. Their celebration could be short-lived. Equifax, the credit-scoring agency, had to drop its arbitration clause for the 145.5 million consumers who may have been affected by a data breach it disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general. And after Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration. Before the vote, the industry had been enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington. Wall Street wasn’t even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they needed further antitrust regulations. The Senate vote reignited their ire, with Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, calling it “a giant wet kiss to Wall Street.” Bashing banks is also still in style among the populist base that elevated Donald J. Trump to the presidency. The shrinking political target on the backs of banks is set to grow again. "
"ST. LOUIS — In 1977, when I was 2 years old, my family and I moved from Iran to America so that my father could pursue his doctorate in chemistry at Michigan State University. Two years later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini seized power and Iran was no longer the country my family knew. We stayed in the United States, becoming permanent residents and eventually citizens by 1999. My parents were raised Muslim but they stopped practicing after leaving Iran, so our household was secular. In many ways, my family was the picture of assimilation. We lived in Edwardsville, Ill., and my father taught chemistry at the local university. My mother opened a tailoring shop. I played tennis, joined a fraternity at the University of Illinois and married my wife in a Catholic church. My sister was in the National Honor Society, and my brother was on the high school football team and played bass in punk bands. Today, he is a corporate chef who hires and supervises hundreds of American workers, and she is a local prosecutor specializing in crimes against children. None of these accomplishments, however, have shielded us from the indiscriminate damage of President Trump’s travel ban, which my mother is challenging as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and partner organizations. In December 2016, my family received the devastating news that my father’s liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer that was first diagnosed in 2014, had returned. His prognosis was terminal. We needed family more than ever during that time. Fortunately, my aunt who lives in Iran had plans to travel here for my sister’s wedding, so she offered to stay for a month or so to support my mother. (They are sisters, and my aunt knows best how to help my mom.) But on Jan. 27, President Trump issued an executive order that revoked visas from Iranians, as well as from citizens of six other Muslim-majority countries. To this day, my aunt has not been able to get her visa, even though she has passed background checks twice. After courts stopped the first two versions of Mr. Trump’s ban, he issued a third on Sept. 24. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court dismissed the last remaining appeal in a pair of cases opposing the second ban, and lawyers are challenging the third version, which is even worse. If implemented, all of our relatives will be permanently barred from visiting us here. I was just with my father in the hospital, and such naked bias, from a country he loves and has raised his family in, deeply hurts him. "
"It’s a tough time for Republicans. Although there are worse things in the world than being stuck with Donald Trump as president. You could be locked in a cage with a ravenous tiger. Tied to the leg of a stampeding elephant. Locked in a small room with a swarm of rabid ferrets. Truly, the list goes on. Stop complaining. This week Trump denounced the Republicans’ tax plan before they even had one. He appeared to change his mind once again on immigration and kept the House and Senate dangling on health care. He also told reporters that “I’m a very intelligent person.” The only two things we can absolutely be confident about are that on almost any given day, Trump will refer to himself as intelligent and remind people how many electoral votes he won. For the rest, it’s anybody’s guess. Republicans in Congress generally try to just soldier on, but some of them are starting to snap. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona denounced his party’s president in a dramatic “I’m outta here” speech that Trump shrugged off, saying, “Even before the campaign he came out with this horrible book.” This would presumably be the anti-Trump book Flake published two months ago. Did you know that Jeff Flake once appeared in a reality TV special called “Rival Survival”? I am bringing this up because there does seem to be a reality TV theme running through Washington. Some years are about “hope” and some years we have “fiscal responsibility.” This year it’s along the line of “Naked and Afraid.” “Rival Survival” paired Flake with a Democratic senator, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. The two of them were left alone on a desert island to test their ability to feed and shelter themselves with bipartisan cooperation. They got along great, but were almost completely incapable of catching fish or boiling water. You will have to come up with your own moral. Now Flake is one of the prideful Republican rebels who are standing up to Trump on a daily basis, along with Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona. Corker, whose theme is that Trump is “utterly untruthful” and sort of nuts, does not seem to have ever been in a reality TV show. However, McCain ran for president in 2008 with Sarah Palin as a running mate and that should count for something. "
"Even though it’s been on the air for less than a month, the reboot of “TRL” on MTV already has a few signature moves. There is the bumbling repetition of interview questions, because no one seems to be able to hear anything over the screaming audience members. There is the smoke that engulfs guests as they enter, and that in a few cases has left them disoriented. And there is the occasional paternal pat on the shoulder the guests give the hosts, a gesture of dominance and control, the sort of thing an elder does to let the youth know to turn it down a notch. The seams are visible, and frayed, on “TRL,” which is currently in its fourth week and no steadier than it was in its first. In its initial incarnation, which ran from 1998 to 2008, “TRL” — originally “Total Request Live” — was the essential countdown show of the teen-pop era. It took place after school and often filled the streets of Times Square with shrieking teenagers. But that was when the phone screen was less enticing than the television screen, when music was closer to the heart of MTV’s mission. The “TRL” of 2017 is less a coherent show than a series of loosely threaded distractions. Each episode is an hour but feels like two. It is preoccupied with viral moments but creates none of its own, or barely anything even worth a GIF. (One exception: the recent sketch that found DJ Khaled break dancing and dropping to the floor for a backspin.) "

"URGENCH, Uzbekistan — Muhammad Bekjanov, often called the world’s longest-imprisoned journalist, did 18 years of hard time in some of Uzbekistan’s most notorious prisons, with nicknames like “Goodbye to Youth.” He was a writer with never much hope for a happy ending to his own story. “I was accused of insulting President Karimov,” he said, referring to Islam A. Karimov, the thin-skinned and iron-fisted former president of Uzbekistan, a strategically important country north of Afghanistan. In prison, Mr. Bekjanov lost his hearing in one ear and contracted tuberculosis. And yet, despite his years of suffering and deprivations, Mr. Bekjanov has become an improbable spokesman for a political and economic overhaul underway in Uzbekistan that began after Mr. Karimov’s death last year, a movement sometimes called the Uzbek Spring. The thaw, which started to take shape quietly this year, has already loosened police controls on the population and is testing the limits of gradual political change in a region more noted for its revolutions, such as those that deposed authoritarian leaders in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. “I am hopeful,” Mr. Bekjanov said of the shift. So far, the government has elevated the authority of locally elected councils, met with human rights observers and, this fall, freed thousands of students from the usual drudgery of picking cotton in state-owned fields for little or no compensation. It has also loosened the screws on political journalism, allowing a few live talk shows on television. The opening is one of the more improbable developments in the politics of the former Soviet states, among which Uzbekistan, the third-most-populous former Soviet country, has long been written off as a black hole of repression and poverty.

"WASHINGTON — Update: The National Archives on Thursday released thousands of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Read the coverage, here » Few seem as excited about the release of the final batch of secret documents from the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy as the current occupant of the Oval Office. “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow,” President Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “So interesting!” Surely, then, it was just a coincidence that Mr. Trump posted that message while on Air Force One heading to, of all places, Dallas. Or was it? Fifty-three years and 11 months after the event that gave rise to a thousand conspiracy theories, the president even landed at Dallas Love Field Airport, where Kennedy’s body was brought for the final flight home, and his motorcade came within a few miles of Dealey Plaza, where the fateful shots rang out. Somehow it feels only appropriate that the remaining papers from one of history’s most infamous mysteries would be made public by the administration of a president who dabbles in conspiracy theories himself. After all, it was Mr. Trump who during last year’s campaign suggested that the father of his Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the Kennedy assassination. And one of his longtime advisers, Roger J. Stone Jr., wrote a book blaming the killing on Lyndon B. Johnson. Moreover, this is a president who, unlike most of those who have occupied the White House over the decades, has been in open war at times with the agencies that seem most worried that the release of documents may embarrass them by disclosing evidence of mishandling or even, some suspect, collusion of some sort. “Of all the presidents since 1963, this is the one who would mind the least if the release of these documents damaged the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., two organizations that he’s very angry at at the moment,” said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian.

"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Scott Brown, the United States ambassador to New Zealand, was investigated and cautioned by the State Department about comments he made to women while on an official trip to Samoa, he revealed Wednesday. Mr. Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, told Fairfax Media that he had been instructed to be more culturally aware after the July trip in which he called guests at a Peace Corps event in Samoa in July “beautiful,” and told a woman serving food and drink at the function that she could “make hundreds of dollars” as a waitress in the United States. But he suggested his comments had been misinterpreted and that complaints about them had been politically motivated. Mr. Brown’s revelations come amid increased scrutiny of the behavior of men in high-ranking positions toward women after allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against the movie executive Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Brown, who was among the first leading politicians to endorse Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential bid, has been in his New Zealand posting since June. The United States ambassador to New Zealand is also the envoy to Samoa, an independent state in the Polynesian islands. In a short video statement released Wednesday, Mr. Brown, sitting next to his wife, said he had become aware through “rumor and innuendo” of media reports that there was an “administrative investigation” into his comments underway. Fairfax reported that the State Department sent investigators to Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, to interview people who were at the dinner, including the ambassador. "
"Update: The National Archives on Thursday released thousands of documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Read the coverage, here » The granddaddy of all conspiracy theories has re-emerged in the American psyche with the planned release of the National Archives’s final trove of records about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy’s death on Nov. 22, 1963, and the numerous investigations that followed were simultaneously some of the most secretive and public events in modern history. The last of the sealed government papers relating to the assassination are expected to be made public by Thursday, after President Trump announced last week that he would not block their release. Government agencies, Hollywood big shots and amateur sleuths have floated theories of what happened to Kennedy: a plot by Cold War adversaries like Cuba and the Soviet Union; an elaborate mafia-backed hit; a covert federal government coup. And it’s been going on for over 50 years. Kennedy’s was one of the most public murders in history, a victim shot in front of hundreds of spectators, with a coterie of news reporters in tow. Page One of The Times blared the news of the assassination, reporting that “he died of a wound in the brain caused by a rifle bullet that was fired at him as he was riding through downtown Dallas in a motorcade.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. This morning’s headlines are about Jeff Flake, but I find myself thinking about Roy Moore. Right now, it seems that the Republican Party has room for Moore but not Flake. Flake, of course, is the Republican senator and Trump critic who announced yesterday that he wouldn’t run for re-election, because he thought that winning would require giving in to Trumpism. “It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end,” he said on the Senate floor. Moore is the former judge who recently won the Republican nomination for a Senate seat in Alabama. He is also a demagogue who has called homosexuality “evil” and “so heinous” and who engaged in a discussion, on video, about whether it should be “punished by death.” After Flake’s speech, his Senate colleagues applauded and honored him. But applause is easy. The more important question is: What are those same senators doing about Moore — a man who, unlike President Trump, can still be prevented from taking high office? They are endorsing him, that’s what. Mike Lee of Utah has praised Moore’s “tested reputation of integrity.” Rand Paul of Kentucky has lauded Moore for “defending and standing up for the Constitution.” Ted Cruz, just a couple of hours before Flake’s speech, released a full-throated endorsement of Moore that celebrated his “lifelong passion for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.” "

"WASHINGTON — The idea for “The Sweat of Their Face,” a coming exhibition at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, came from a plumber. When Dorothy Moss, the museum’s curator of painting and sculpture, was researching her graduate dissertation, she found news accounts from 1897 about a plumber who visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art on a break but was asked to leave because he was wearing overalls. Thinking of the plumber, Ms. Moss became interested in one of the central questions of museums: Whom are they for? “The Sweat of Their Face,” which she curated with the museum’s senior historian, David C. Ward, tries to address that question. Consisting of more than 75 portrayals of American laborers from the 18th century through today, the gallery will open in November as part of the museum’s 50th anniversary celebration. Though the selections were made months before the election, several of the exhibition’s themes are essential to today’s politics: the role of the migrant worker, the lost glory of the coal miner, the devastation of the factory. What better time than now, Ms. Moss said, to think about ordinary life in an artistic sense, and in the nation’s capital. "
"Do brains trump brawn? A remarkable new study of how the human body prioritizes its inner workings found that if you intensely think at the same time as you intensely exercise, your performance in both thinking and moving can worsen. But your muscles’ performance will decline much more than your brain’s will, the study found. The results raise interesting questions about the roles that our body’s wide-ranging abilities may have played in the evolution of humans and also whether a hard workout is the ideal time to be cogitating. Compared to almost all other animals, we humans have disproportionately large brains for our size. Our supersized cranial contents probably provided an advantage during our evolution as a species. Smart creatures presumably could have outwitted predators and outmaneuvered prey, keeping themselves fed, uneaten and winners in the biological sweepstakes to pass on their genes. But most other species eschewed developing similarly outsized brains during evolution, because large brains carry a hefty metabolic cost. Brains are extraordinarily hungry organs, requiring, ounce for ounce, more calories to sustain their operations than almost any other tissue, and these caloric demands rise when the brain is hard at work. Thinking demands considerable bodily fuel. In order to feed and maintain these large brains, early humans’ bodies had to make certain trade-offs, most evolutionary biologists agree. Our digestive systems shrank during evolution, for one thing, since food processing is also metabolically ravenous. But whether a similar trade-off occurred with our muscles has remained in doubt. Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger. "
"SYDNEY, Australia — Australia and Papua New Guinea have failed to protect hundreds of asylum seekers sent to Manus Island under Australia’s contentious offshore processing policy, and threats to their safety and health will increase if Australia closes the island’s main detention center next week as planned, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday. In a report based on interviews with 40 of the 770 refugees and asylum seekers on Manus, which is part of Papua New Guinea, Human Rights Watch investigators said that several had been assaulted or robbed by local young men, who in some cases were drunk and armed with knives or screwdrivers. At least three victims since June required emergency medical attention in Papua New Guinea’s capital, Port Moresby, or in Australia, according to the report, which said that in most of the cases no one was charged or punished. “There has been an escalation in violence in the last six months and there has been little to no action by police,” Elaine Pearson, the Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview. “It’s simply not safe to move them out of the facility.” The report, which includes video interviews with refugees from a trip to Manus in September, was released days before the planned closing on Tuesday of the main processing center on Manus, and as debate about the costs and risks of Australia’s refusal to accept asylum seekers who try to arrive by boat continues to flare. In Parliament this week, Australian immigration officials told lawmakers that 606 people at the main center in Manus were refusing to move out by the Tuesday deadline. Senator Nick McKim of the Greens party said the government’s plan to cut off food, water and power after the deadline was an attempt to “starve out” the remaining asylum seekers, all of whom are men.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified. And when such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else. It is dangerous to a democracy.” That was Senator Jeff Flake, challenging both President Trump and Republican leaders on Tuesday in an extraordinary speech in which he announced he would not seek re-election next year. After tangling with the president for months, Mr. Flake faced worsening poll numbers in Arizona. He now joins what our chief Washington correspondent, Carl Hulse, calls “a new type of freedom caucus”: Republicans who are free to speak about Mr. Trump without fear of the political backlash. • We have video highlights and a full transcript of Mr. Flake’s speech. • Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for research that was included in a dossier containing salacious claims about connections between Donald Trump, his associates and Russia.

"TORONTO — More than 20 years ago, a precocious teenage girl made a surprising request of the novelist Margaret Atwood. She had just read Ms. Atwood’s “Alias Grace” and found herself entranced by the true story of Grace Marks, a 19th-century Irish immigrant and servant who became a celebrity “murderess” in Toronto. So she sent Ms. Atwood a letter seeking the movie rights. Ms. Atwood’s correspondent was Sarah Polley, then best known as a Canadian child star from the Disney Channel’s “Road to Avonlea” and years away from becoming a screenwriter and director of independent films like “Away From Her” and “Take This Waltz.” Ms. Atwood declined. Obviously. “She was 17!” she said. “I didn’t think she had the wherewithal.” Now, at the age of 38, Ms. Polley is seeing her Hail Mary of a pitch come to fruition: She is the writer and a producer of the mini-series adaptation of the Booker Prize-shortlisted book, debuting on Netflix on Nov. 3. After decades of sputtering starts — both Jodie Foster and Cate Blanchett were attached at various points — “Alias Grace” arrives at a time of peak Atwood. This September the Hulu adaptation of the novelist’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” became the first streaming-service show to win an Emmy for best drama; the iconic red cloaks the handmaids are forced to wear have become popular costumes for both protesting and Halloweening; her backlist is on best-seller lists; and the 77-year-old author is herself an internet star. (Ms. Atwood has 1.77 million followers on Twitter, and when she carried her black velvet purse on stage at the Emmys, a gotta-be-me violation of unwritten awards-show etiquette, she sent social media into a loving frenzy.) “The Handmaid’s Tale,” now shooting its second season in Toronto, depicts a near-future dystopia where women are forced into surrogacy for a dictatorial elite. “Alias Grace,” meanwhile, is a six-part period piece based on the unsolvable mystery of a poor housemaid (Sarah Gadon) who either abetted the murders of her boss and his housekeeper/lover (Anna Paquin), or was sacrificed by Victorian moralists for being a little too free, a little too desirable.

"WASHINGTON — One week before they are set to unveil a sprawling overhaul of the federal tax code, Republicans struggled on Wednesday with key parts of their plan, reigniting a fight over retirement savings and racing to cut a deal with lawmakers from high-tax states ahead of a critical budget vote in the House on Thursday. The challenges — and the dogged effort to resolve them on Capitol Hill — highlight the increased importance of the tax issue for a fractured party desperate for a legislative victory. The prospect of a once-in-a-generation bill to cut taxes on businesses and individuals increasingly appears to be the best hope for a party anxious to find common ground and advance an effort that it has long championed as the pinnacle of Republican orthodoxy. It is a bit like having a baby to save a failing marriage. But, like a crying newborn, the drafting of the bill is already costing party leaders sleep. That was evidenced on Wednesday, when President Trump and a top House Republican sparred over whether the plan would include sharp reductions in how much Americans might save, before taxes, in 401(k) accounts. Meanwhile, congressional leaders worked to forge a compromise on state and local tax deductions that could be necessary for the House to pass a budget measure that is needed to ensure the tax bill does not fall to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Republicans from states where the state and local tax — or SALT — deduction is widely used were not making it easy. “To me, the only way to stop this is to defeat the budget tomorrow,” Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said on Wednesday. “Once the budget passes, they hold all the cards.” "
"FORT BRAGG, N.C. — The sentencing hearing for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009, began on Wednesday with an ex-Navy SEAL’s assertion that he knew the military operation to find the missing soldier would be dangerous. “Somebody’s going to get killed or hurt trying to get that kid,” Jimmy Hatch recalled telling another member of his task force before setting off on a mission to find Sergeant Bergdahl. Mr. Hatch was shot in the leg during the rescue effort and later underwent surgery 18 times. The defense declined to cross-examine Mr. Hatch. In other developments, the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance, said he was not yet ready to rule on the defense’s argument that recent comments by President Trump had made a fair hearing impossible. The defense has argued that the president seemed to endorse previous assertions, made when he was a candidate, that Sergeant Bergdahl was a traitor and deserved execution. As commander in chief, he is the superior officer of all the military officials responsible for disciplining Sergeant Bergdahl. Sergeant Bergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban and held captive for five years, has pleaded guilty and faces up to life in prison. Colonel Nance will determine his sentence after a hearing that is expected to last into next week. Mr. Hatch’s testimony was intended to support a charge Sergeant Bergdahl’s actions had endangered other troops. The charge, formally known as “misbehavior before the enemy,” is rarely used today but has a colorful history. The charge is so broadly written it could seemingly cover most war-zone misconduct, including cowardice, failing to do the utmost to destroy the enemy, and failing to do everything possible to assist and relieve allied troops.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey has become a household name in Silicon Valley thanks to his role as the chief executive and co-founder of Twitter, President Trump’s favorite megaphone. People will sometimes mention, as an afterthought, that Mr. Dorsey also runs another start-up he helped found, the payment company Square. Sometime in the very near future, though, the value of Mr. Dorsey’s distinctly less-sexy second company, where he tends to work in the afternoon, is likely to become more valuable than his more well-known first company, where he works in the morning, separated by a short walk between the two companies’ headquarters in San Francisco. Thanks to its steadily ascending stock price, Square’s value — as measured by the value of its outstanding shares — has been closing in quickly on Twitter, which has seen its stock price stuck in neutral for months. On Wednesday, Square was worth $12.62 billion, or just $3 million less than Twitter. Just a year ago, Square was worth less than half as much. If current trends continue, the two could switch places as soon as Thursday, when Twitter announces its most recent quarterly financial results. Square, coming off five straight quarters of exceeding Wall Street expectations, will provide its results in November. (By one method of counting shares, including options given to employees, Square is already worth more than Twitter.) "
"Lost in all the attention to the Trump administration’s effort to scuttle President Barack Obama’s clean power plan is its attempt to prop up the struggling coal industry by doing something very un-Republican — subsidizing it. Last month, Rick Perry, the secretary of energy, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — the independent agency that regulates electricity markets — to adopt a new rule to pay certain coal and nuclear plants more than they would otherwise earn in a competitive market. In essence, consumers would pay these plants a premium for electricity that competitors could produce, and are already producing, more cheaply. Mr. Perry’s plan is premised on two unfounded claims: First, it assumes that coal and nuclear power plants, because they can stockpile fuel on site, are uniquely able to enhance the “reliability and resiliency” of the electric power grid, especially in times of fuel supply disruptions. Second, it assumes that those plants are being driven out of business by unfair subsidies to renewable-energy producers, as Mr. Perry has repeatedly claimed or implied. But a Department of Energy study conducted under Mr. Perry’s direction concluded otherwise. In fact, the retirements of aging coal and nuclear plants, the study showed, have not compromised reliability, the term used to describe the grid’s ability to keep the lights on under normal conditions. While the grid might need more bolstering in the future, “reliability is adequate today despite the retirement of 11 percent of the generating capacity available in 2002, as significant additions from natural gas, wind, and solar have come online since then,” the report noted. The study also found that the availability of cheap natural gas, not renewable energy subsidies, was “the biggest contributor” to driving old coal and nuclear plants out of business. Other factors included the low growth of electricity demand, the rising availability of solar and wind power, and the costs of complying with environmental regulations, according to the report. By putting a thumb on the scale for coal, Mr. Perry’s proposal would reverse 30 years of dogged work by successive FERC commissioners to promote fair competition in electricity markets. Rather than setting rates for each energy provider based on its production costs plus a reasonable return on investment — as FERC’s top-down regulation used to do — the agency has moved steadily to let the market set prices.

Challenging Mr. Xi could now amount to ideological heresy, as the party’s revised Constitution effectively puts him on par with Mao. Globally, Mr. Xi has positioned his country as a stable alternative to an increasingly inward-looking U.S. Domestically, his unease with the rise of outspoken entrepreneurs could end up hurting economic growth. Separately, the fate of a Chinese-born Swedish publisher who disappeared in Thailand two years ago and reappeared in a Chinese jail took another strange twist: he’s missing. "
"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Laura Ingraham landed here in a private jet and climbed into a waiting S.U.V., accompanied by her personal assistant, a publicist, and a single piece of luggage. The private plane was paid for by the publisher of her latest book, “Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution From Reagan to Trump.” The publicist came courtesy of her new primary employer, Fox News. “I love it out here,” Ms. Ingraham said, seated in the back seat as a string of desert resorts glided by last week. She was on her way to speak at a fund-raiser for Kelli Ward, the insurgent Republican primary challenger to Senator Jeff Flake. Stephen K. Bannon — the executive chairman of Breitbart News, former White House chief strategist for President Trump and one of Ms. Ingraham’s pals — was also on the program. Next week, Ms. Ingraham, 53, will take over one of the most coveted slots on cable television: 10 p.m. on Fox News. At the event for Ms. Ward, she served up some of her high-dudgeon populism to a Hilton hotel ballroom filled with several hundred fans, denouncing the “Democrat-media complex” before launching into an acidic attack on Mr. Flake, a critic of President Trump. “Since we are in the south, I can say bless his heart, but it’s time to melt the snowflake,” she said as the room vibrated with boos. A chant of “Build that wall!” broke out. "
"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The Trump administration on Wednesday imposed sanctions on eight individuals and a business affiliated with the Islamic State in Yemen and with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the first coordinated action taken with a newly formed center to combat terrorist financing led by the United States and Saudi Arabia. The fresh round of sanctions was unveiled by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, as he embarks on a four-country trip to the Middle East intended to strengthen America’s capacity to crack down on terrorist financing networks. President Trump has made attacking terrorist financing a priority in his first year in office, and the Treasury has been increasingly working with Persian Gulf countries to freeze the assets of people who are plotting attacks. The Terrorist Financing Targeting Center was established in May during Mr. Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are also members of the group, and have agreed to share information about the financing of terrorism. “Our enemies have felt the effects of being blocked from the world financial system,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a speech at the Future Investment Initiative summit in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. “They are finding it harder to raise, move and distribute money.” The United States has in recent months imposed sanctions to stem North Korea’s financing and development of weapons of mass destruction and earlier this month targeted Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard. Mr. Mnuchin said he is also focused on targeting fund-raising efforts that prop up the Taliban in Afghanistan and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Among the individuals sanctioned on Wednesday were Abu Sulayman al-Adani, the head of the Islamic State’s Yemen affiliate, Nashwan al-Wali al-Yafi’I, the group’s chief financial officer, and Khalid al-Marfadi, a militant who helped coordinate joint operations between the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in Yemen.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) With a vacancy rate of around 1 percent, Santa Rosa was a tough place to find a home before its recent disaster. Then the Tubbs fire wiped out about 5 percent of city’s housing stock — roughly 3,000 homes. For some of the displaced, the question is now: Do you stay? Chris Coursey, Santa Rosa’s mayor, said the common reaction of fire victims has been a determination to rebuild. Even so, he added, “I would be naïve to say nobody is going to leave because of this.” Many homeowners who held insurance policies will be able to erect new houses on their ash-laden properties. But the wine country’s zigzagging infernos didn’t discriminate between rich and poor. Low-income people who were displaced now face a housing market where the median monthly rent hovers around $2,500, double the national average. The median home price is more than $600,000. Those figures are expected to rise. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump continued his attacks on two retiring Republican senators on Wednesday, and said a recent meeting with lawmakers in his party was mostly a “love fest with standing ovations.” Two of Mr. Trump’s early morning Twitter posts on Wednesday were about Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, both Republicans, who have announced they would not run for re-election. “They had zero chance of being elected,” Mr. Trump said. “Now act so hurt & wounded.” Mr. Flake, of Arizona, announced his retirement on Tuesday. The senator, who has been outspoken against Mr. Trump for months, is the fourth prominent Republican to issue a stinging and recent rebuke against Mr. Trump’s presidency and style of governing. Senate Republicans cannot afford to lose any support from their own party if they want to pass significant tax legislation that the president has promised for months. "

"ALBANY — For as long as anyone can remember, dysfunction has ruled New York’s capital: Corruption is common, power is limited to a few, and habitual calls for change disappear like the sun on a January day. But next month, the voters of New York have a chance to force a wide-open, monthslong, everything-on-the-table examination of the state’s founding document by authorizing a constitutional convention, a sight not seen here since Robert F. Kennedy was the state’s junior United States senator. If passed, Proposition 1 would trigger the first such state convention in the nation in more than a quarter century; the last one, in 1992 in Louisiana, was limited to discussing the bone-dry issue of state and local revenues. In New York’s case, however, the changes to the State Constitution could be profound, as could the impact on the inner workings of Albany and beyond. Ethics reform, sweeping changes to the judiciary, easing the stranglehold of power exerted by the governor and legislative leaders — all of it would be fair game for consideration. But it is that freedom that terrifies some groups, many of them unions that fear that such a free-for-all could enable anti-labor forces to undermine collective bargaining rights, or gut pensions. Potential rollbacks of personal freedoms — from abortion rights to the Second Amendment — have galvanized opponents on the left and the right, as have concerns about protections for the environment and public education. “It comes down to fear versus hope,” said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a good government organization that is neutral on Proposition 1. “The fear that something bad could come out of it, and the hope that something good could.” "

"GENEVA — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Thursday that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not remain in power, but that negotiations about the country’s future should continue while Mr. Assad was in charge. “The United States wants a whole and unified Syria with no role for Bashar al-Assad in the government,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters, adding, “The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end. The only issue is how that should that be brought about.” The comments came after Mr. Tillerson met in Geneva with the United Nations special envoy on the Syrian crisis — the last stop on a weeklong visit to the Middle East and South Asia in which he dashed among capitals in the region, often spending only a few hours on the ground before getting back into his motorcade and heading to the next stop. While he came home with no major accomplishments, the trip was also not interrupted by tweets from President Trump contradicting his efforts, as happened early this month with the secretary’s efforts on North Korea. Mr. Tillerson’s visit on Tuesday to Pakistan was perhaps the most interesting of the trip, since Mr. Tillerson had just the week before heaped praise on India, Pakistan’s longtime rival, while bluntly insisting that Pakistan had to do more to fight terrorism. The Pakistanis nonetheless showered Mr. Tillerson with kindness. When they sat down for talks, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi gave an effusive statement for the gathered reporters that Pakistan was fighting terrorism more than any other country. "
"To the Editor: “Chemical Industry Insider Now Shapes E.P.A. Policy” (“Trump Rules” series, front page, Oct. 22), about the development of chemical safety rules, follows a well-worn path of reducing a complex policy debate to a garden-variety turf battle between two officials of the Environmental Protection Agency. The decision to define the concepts of “best available science” and “weight of the scientific evidence” in chemical safety rules will support the use of credible studies and transparent decision-making. This clarity is in the public interest. The chemical safety law, passed in 2016, prioritizes transparency, flexibility and safety. There are ample opportunities for public comment. All methods, policies and procedures must be reviewed every five years so new developments can be applied. And the E.P.A. can prioritize chemicals it judges to be in most need of review. The article’s misleading depictions and personal attacks distract from the ways that the well-written final chemical safety rules will enhance public safety, the scientific credibility of E.P.A. decisions and transparency throughout the regulatory process.

"Amid the slow-motion agonies of Puerto Rico, it is heartening to see the reopening of some schools — though fewer than one in 10 — signaling the local resolve to prevail over Hurricane Maria’s devastation more than a month ago. Comparable resolve, however, and a far greater sense of urgency are needed from the federal government if the crippled island is ever to have a decent chance at recovery. The key — restoring electrical power to the island’s 3.4 million American citizens — remains a frustrating and mysterious process, with 75 percent of the island still without electricity. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló’s vow to have 95 percent restoration by mid-December was quickly dismissed as unrealistic by the Army Corps of Engineers, which is working to rebuild the island’s flattened power grid. Confidence has not been helped by the news that a two-person, two-year-old Montana electrical company with limited experience was able to land a $300 million contract for a part of the task that is far larger than any project the company has ever done. The contract is stirring suspicions of inside favoritism, prompting the financial oversight board that manages Puerto Rican affairs to consider appointment of a special monitor over the island’s power authority. A congressional inquiry is being promised as lawmakers look into the fact that the company, Whitefish Energy, is from the same Montana town as the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, and that its chief executive knows Mr. Zinke. Both the secretary’s office and the Whitefish executive, Andy Techmanski, say this is a hometown coincidence; they deny that there was inside help in winning approval from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. “We just answered the call,” Mr. Techmanski said of the hurried deal. The company claims it now has more than 300 utility subcontractors in Puerto Rico, with more arriving daily. The power authority, which is facing deep financial problems of its own, says Whitefish won by claiming experience in working in difficult mountainous terrain and also by not asking for money up front, as another company did. But an overriding question is why the power authority did not use the industry’s “mutual aid” agreements to rush in thousands of emergency workers from other utilities, as Texas and Florida did after recent hurricanes. Industry groups say they offered to go but never heard from the island power authority. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — Fires need fuel. In this era of political rage, a Twitter account that called itself the unofficial voice of Tennessee Republicans provided buckets of gasoline. Its pre-election tweets were a bottomless well of inflammatory misinformation: “Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.” A mysterious explosion in Washington, it said, had killed one of Mrs. Clinton’s aides, raising her “body count” to six. Another proclaimed, “Obama is the founder of ISIS.” The account, @TEN_GOP, eventually reached more than 130,000 followers — 10 times that of the official state Republican Party’s Twitter handle. It was one of the most popular political voices in Tennessee. But its lies, distortions and endorsements came from the other side of the world. @TEN_GOP was a Russian troll account devoted to stoking division in America, according to a report earlier this month by RBC, a Russian media company with a history of independence. Twitter declined to even discuss the account, which had posted 10,000 tweets by the time it was finally shut down in August. That was more than a year after Republican officials in Tennessee had first complained about its misrepresentations to Twitter. “It’s disappointing and disheartening to see how an outside actor can pinpoint areas of division in America and then exploit them,” said Brent Leatherwood, the former executive director of the Tennessee Republican Party. “You think we’re getting to a better place and then something like this throws a Molotov cocktail into it.” Perhaps no form of communication has ever established itself so quickly and so thoroughly as social media. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information. Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning. They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump ordered the long-awaited release on Thursday of more than 2,800 documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, but bowed to pressure from the C.I.A. and F.B.I. by withholding thousands of additional papers pending six more months of review. While incomplete, the documents were a treasure trove for investigators, historians and conspiracy theorists who have spent half a century searching for clues to what really happened in Dallas on that fateful day in 1963. They included tantalizing talk of mobsters and Cubans and spies, Kremlin suspicions that Lyndon B. Johnson was behind the killing, and fear among the authorities that the public would not accept the official version of events. Paging through the documents online on Thursday night was a little like exploring a box of random papers found in an attic. There were fuzzy images of C.I.A. surveillance photos from the early 1960s; a log from December 1963 of visitors, including a C.I.A. officer, to Johnson’s ranch in Texas; and reports that Lee Harvey Oswald obtained ammunition from a right-wing militia group. Some of the documents convey some of the drama and chaos of the days immediately after the murder of the president. Among them is a memo apparently dictated by J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, on Nov. 24, 1963, shortly after Jack Ruby shot and killed Oswald as he was being moved from Police Headquarters to a local jail. “There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead,” the memo begins laconically, before reciting the day’s events.

"The United Nations investigator of human rights abuses in Myanmar expressed deep disappointment Thursday at what she described as an indifferent response by the country’s Nobel laureate leader to the violence raging against the Rohingya Muslim minority. The comments by the investigator, Yanghee Lee of South Korea, a leading child rights expert appointed to her United Nations human rights post in 2014, underscored international frustrations over the behavior of the Myanmar leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, regarding the persecution of the Rohingya. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a hero of democratic rights who endured years of house arrest by Myanmar’s military to become the top civilian politician of her country and de facto head of the government, has not criticized the deadly campaign against the Rohingya, who are widely reviled among the country’s Buddhist majority. The campaign, carried out by Myanmar’s armed forces and allied militias, has uprooted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from their villages in the western border state of Rakhine since August. The fallout has created a refugee and public health crisis in Myanmar’s impoverished neighbor, Bangladesh, as more than 600,000 people have fled across the border. Other top United Nations officials have called the anti-Rohingya purge a campaign of ethnic cleansing or worse. Diplomats of the Security Council are discussing a draft resolution aimed at pressuring the Myanmar military to end the violence. The Trump administration also has threatened to take punitive action. Speaking to reporters at the United Nations on Thursday, Ms. Lee said “there is so much hatred and hostility against the Rohingya” in Myanmar that few dare speak out against it. Well-documented accounts of killings, rapes, burned villages and forced displacement get no coverage in Myanmar’s news media. "
"WASHINGTON — Under pressure from Republicans and Democrats, the Trump administration on Thursday turned over to Congress a list of Russia-connected entities it will use to determine new sanctions meant to rebuke Russia for actions in Eastern Europe, Syria and the 2016 United States presidential election. Administration officials made clear to lawmakers that they intended to impose sanctions on individuals in the United States and elsewhere who did “significant” business with the Russian entities, sending an early warning that such deals must soon end. The list appeared to be an attempt to mollify critics — including Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland — who said that the administration had not moved quickly enough to punish a key American adversary, using legislation passed by Congress in July and signed by President Trump in August. That legislation required that the administration produce the list of entities by Oct. 1. Administration officials said the list, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, was not itself an imposition of sanctions, but rather the government’s assessment of organizations or persons “that are part of, or operating for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors of the government of the Russian Federation.” Under the law, persons who “knowingly engage in a significant transaction” with these entities could be subjected to sanctions as soon as Jan. 29. Officials said they intended to work with individuals and the United States’ allies to help them avoid sanctionable activity. "

"It was a calamitous ambush. On Oct. 21, militants fired rockets and detonated explosives in the desert southwest of Cairo, killing at least 59 Egyptian police officers and security officials in the worst assault on security forces since 2015. The shocking attack is the latest reminder of the very real threat that armed militants pose to Egypt’s security forces. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seems incapable of quelling this menace: An insurgency that has killed hundreds of troops and police officers in northern Sinai continues; judges and police officers in Cairo have been attacked. So with such a real and present danger, why would Mr. Sisi’s government, aided by a team of media personalities and religious authorities, spend the past month whipping up a frenzy over another kind of “threat” altogether? As part of what can best be described as hysterical homophobia, more than 65 people, mostly gay men, have been arrested in the crackdown against L.G.B.T. Egyptians. At least 20 people have received prison sentences, ranging from six months to six years. Several men have been subjected to anal examinations, which human rights groups describe as a form of torture, ostensibly to determine whether they have engaged in anal sex. This wave of arrests and raids began after gay-pride rainbow flags were flown at a concert by a Lebanese indie-rock band, Mashrou’ Leila, whose lead singer, Hamed Sinno, is openly gay. It was not the first time fans displayed rainbow flags at a Mashrou’ Leila concert, a gay friend who has attended some of the band’s previous concerts in Cairo reminds me. He also reminds me that rainbow flags were flown in Tahrir Square during the 18 days of protest that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Same-sex relationships are not illegal in Egypt, but gay men are arrested under “debauchery” laws. So why now? Why the parade of men “confessing” to being gay and “repenting” on TV talk shows, and the psychiatrists touting “conversion therapy”? "
"SAN DIEGO — The Department of Homeland Security unveiled several border wall prototypes here on Thursday that the agency said was the first step in carrying out President Trump’s plan to build a barrier along the nearly 2,000-mile border that the United States shares with Mexico. Agency officials said they would test the mock-ups over the next few months to determine which worked best in curbing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. “The prototypes are vitally important to the future of border security,” said Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol. Mr. Vitiello said the walls were central to the agency’s efforts to secure the border. As Mr. Vitiello spoke alongside the prototypes, erected near existing fencing along the border in San Diego, a few Mexican police officers stood on the other side, watching. Before he spoke, Mr. Vitiello walked over and shook their hands. Despite the fanfare, the prototypes are still far from the “physically imposing” and “aesthetically pleasing” border wall that Mr. Trump promised during his campaign and ordered built shortly after assuming office. For now, Mr. Trump’s vision remains largely aspirational. For one, Congress has not appropriated funds; the Homeland Security Department used money from other programs to pay for the prototypes. The House Homeland Security Committee voted to approve a bill that provides $10 billion for a border wall, but Senate Democrats have vowed to block attempts to provide funding for it. "
"WASHINGTON — The Republican race to overhaul the tax code broke into a sprint on Thursday, with House members narrowly clearing a budget blueprint that would allow a tax bill to pass Congress without any Democratic votes, and Senate leaders signaling that the bill could be introduced, debated and approved in both chambers by the end of November. Those ambitions are already complicated by difficult math, both in terms of tax revenues and vote counts. The budget vote put those competing factors on display, with 20 Republicans defecting and the resolution narrowly passing, 216 to 212, in part over concerns about the possible elimination of a tax break that disproportionately benefits residents of high-tax states. A potential reduction in contribution limits for 401(k) retirement accounts also appears to be stoking an intraparty fight. Neither the retirement issue nor the squabble over the deduction for state and local taxes was resolved on Thursday, but party leaders vowed to push ahead at an even faster pace than they had previously outlined. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said his committee would introduce a bill on Nov. 1 and begin amending it on Nov. 6. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters that the Senate would follow about a week behind the House. “We need to get the tax bill out of the Senate by Thanksgiving,” he said. Privately, Republican leaders echoed that aggressive timeline. The exacting pace is meant to maximize party cohesion and neutralize attacks by Democrats and business groups. If Republicans stick to it, they will speed what could be a 1,000-page piece of legislation, affecting every corner of the United States economy, through the House and the Senate in less than three weeks. Democrats were swift to criticize the approach, saying it was an attempt to hide tax changes that will hurt, not help, middle-class families. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill was shaping up to be “a bunch of false promises to the middle class.” Republicans, he said, “know the details — the specifics of what they’re really about — will be hard to argue in the sunlight.” "
"Mark Halperin built an empire as journalism’s ultimate political insider, spinning the world of government into dramatic narratives of power and ambition. His best-selling books and television appearances made him one of the most prominent and highly paid reporters in the country. That empire began to collapse on Thursday after allegations surfaced that he had sexually harassed multiple women years ago while working as the director of political coverage at ABC News. A report published by CNN late Wednesday included interviews with five unidentified women who described Mr. Halperin making unwanted and aggressive sexual advances toward them. It was the latest instance of harassment claims against a towering figure in American media, and the fallout was swift. MSNBC, where Mr. Halperin was an analyst on the influential show “Morning Joe,” said he would no longer serve as a contributor. HBO dropped a planned television adaptation of Mr. Halperin’s upcoming book about the 2016 presidential election. And by Thursday evening, his publisher, Penguin Press, said in a statement that it had canceled plans for the book entirely, “in light of the recent news.” In a statement, Mr. Halperin denied any nonconsensual contact with the women who spoke to CNN, but he apologized for his behavior with his ABC News colleagues.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday directed the Department of Health and Human Services to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency, taking long-anticipated action to address a rapidly escalating epidemic of drug use. But even as he vowed to alleviate the scourge of drug addiction and abuse that has swept the country — a priority that resonated strongly with the working-class voters who supported his presidential campaign — Mr. Trump fell short of fulfilling his promise in August to declare “a national emergency” on opioids, which would have prompted the rapid allocation of federal funding to address the issue. His directive does not on its own release any additional funds to deal with a drug crisis that claimed more than 59,000 lives in 2016, and the president did not request any, although his aides said he would soon do so. And he made little mention of the need for the rapid and costly expansion of medical treatment that public health specialists, including some in his own administration, argue is crucial to addressing the epidemic. “No part of our society — not young or old, rich or poor, urban or rural — has been spared this plague of drug addiction and this horrible, horrible situation that’s taken place with opioids,” Mr. Trump said during an elaborate and emotional ceremony in the East Room of the White House, attended by families affected by opioid abuse, members of Congress and administration officials. “This epidemic is a national health emergency.” To combat the epidemic, the president said the government would produce “really tough, really big, really great advertising” aimed at persuading Americans not to start using opioids in the first place, seeming to hark back to the “Just Say No” antidrug campaign led by Nancy Reagan in the 1980s. “This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs,” Mr. Trump said, “it’s really, really easy not to take them.” He shared the story of his brother Fred, who he said had struggled with alcohol addiction throughout his life and implored Mr. Trump never to take a drink — advice the president said he had heeded.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. “GOP failure to preserve #SALT will devastate NY and LI. Must vote NO on budget to stop this!” That tweet — and I’ll decode the acronyms momentarily — may sound as if it comes from an unhappy Democrat, but it doesn’t. Pete King, the Long Island (“LI”) Republican who’s been in the House for almost 25 years, sent the tweet Tuesday evening. He is unhappy with the current Republican tax plan because it would eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes (“SALT”), and he has company in the Republican caucus. The deduction reduces income taxes for millions of families across the country. Nationwide, almost 30 percent of taxpayers benefit — and at least 17 percent of households in every state benefit. The Republican tax plan would eliminate the deduction, which disproportionately benefits the upper middle class, largely to help pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy. No wonder some House Republicans are grousing. Tom MacArthur, a Republican from New Jersey, has said that there are enough members unhappy about losing SALT to block the House budget — a first step toward a tax cut — from passing. (It’s not clear if he’s correct about that. House leaders said last night that they would proceed with a vote today on the House budget, which is a sign of confidence.) Either way, though, a theme is emerging: The Republicans are having a hard time passing bills that shower gifts on the wealthy and stick everyone else with the bill. "

"Good Thursday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin, who is flying back from Saudi Arabia, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We’re thinking about Masayoshi Son’s comment to Andrew that $100 billion isn’t enough for his tech-investing ambitions. More on that in a minute. A reminder: DealBook’s sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9. Want to join us? Apply to participate here. The SoftBank founder told Andrew at the Saudi Arabia conference on Wednesday that his $93 billion Vision Fund was only the first part of a colossal series of tech investments. The highlights from the interview: • Mr. Son said the Vision Fund has made a $3 billion profit and a 22-percent return over the last five months. Dan Primack of Axios noted on Twitter: “Only public security known is Nvidia. Only up 12 percent since announced but SB did months earlier. So it’s possible.” • Mr. Son said of Vision Fund: “People said it’s too much. I say it’s too little. It’s not that much.” Regarding how long it will take to invest that giant sum, he said, “It’s not going to take five years — it’s going to take much less.” The dreams of other investment moguls: Mr. Son’s ambitious plans have others in private equity thinking about creating supersize funds dedicated to specific industries like health care. Could they attract all the deals in one sector in the way that Mr. Son has with tech? "
"WASHINGTON — Frustration over President Trump’s delay in imposing the stiff tariffs he has promised on imports of foreign steel and aluminum is morphing into a fight over two of Mr. Trump’s trade policy nominees. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Thursday that he would block the nominations of Gilbert B. Kaplan for the top international trade post at the Commerce Department and Nazakhtar Nikakhtar for assistant secretary of commerce until the White House advanced a stalled effort to protect American metal producers from cheap Chinese products. Mr. Schumer’s timing is intentional, coming just ahead of Mr. Trump’s trip to Beijing early next month. Blocking the president’s nominees is one of the few levers Democrats have to try to force Mr. Trump to move ahead with his trade agenda, which is supported by labor unions and some Democrats, but opposed by some in the president’s own party. The nominees can be approved even with Mr. Schumer’s hold, but it will force the Senate to go through a more time-consuming cloture vote for approving officials, delaying these and other nominations in the pipeline. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Schumer said he was frustrated that a process the president began this spring as a precursor to imposing tariffs had not culminated in any action and had actually made things worse for United States companies. When the administration announced the investigation, “we felt, O.K., they’ve got the message. But they’ve just dragged their feet and delayed and delayed,” Mr. Schumer said. “The bottom line is the president has been a total paper tiger on this issue, and as a result, we feel the need to hold up nominees for the Commerce Department.” "
"Last year, as it became clear that Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination, analysts on both the right and the left speculated that millions of regular Republicans would be repulsed by his ethnonationalism and misogyny. Writing in the Washington Post in August of 2016, Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, warned: Come Election Day, however, Republican voters did not abandon their party. The Republican share of the electorate grew slightly, from 32 percent in 2008 and 2012 to 33 percent in 2016, and Trump carried these voters 11 to 1. This pattern has continued into the present and shows no signs of letting up. In recent days, prominent Republicans, including George W. Bush, Bob Corker, John McCain and Jeff Flake, have warned in various ways that Trump is leading their party and the country in a very dangerous direction. For the moment, however, it is the president’s critics who are butting their heads against a brick wall. The reality is that neither Flake nor Corker is seeking re-election, and both would have struggled to win renomination if they presented themselves as adversaries of President Trump. In short, the Trump-Steve Bannon-Laura Ingraham wing of the Republican party is ascendant. As Mike Allen headlined his post on Axios Wednesday: “Virtually every Republican now a Trump Republican.” Allen went on: Why is this still true, despite their “private gripes”? Because of the “strong, sustained support of G.O.P. voters” that the president enjoys. In an email, Alex Theodoridis, a political scientist at the University of California-Merced, put the state of play in a larger perspective: “The real story of Election 2016 is that the vast majority of Republicans voted for Trump” despite the fact that he was an outlier candidate who “lacked the normal credentials in terms of experience, ideology and character.” The nomination of an untraditional candidate from outside the party’s mainstream turned the 2016 election into “a stress test for Republican partisanship, and it passed with flying colors,” Theodoridis wrote.

"A battle between two political titans in New Jersey could cost $20 million by the time November’s election is over. And it is not the governor’s race. The high-priced campaign is unfolding in a largely rural legislative district in the southwest corner of the state where the New Jersey Education Association, which is considered the state’s most influential union, is engaged in a feud with Stephen M. Sweeney, the powerful president of the State Senate. It is a clash that, on paper, is perplexing. The education association, which represents about 200,000 public-school teachers, leans Democratic: Of its 105 endorsements this year, 91 were Democrats. Mr. Sweeney is a Democrat. His opponent, Fran Grenier, the chairman of the Salem County Republican Party, supports the departing Republican governor, Chris Christie, and President Trump, both of whom the union routinely vilifies. But a dispute over pension benefits that dates back to 2011 has put the union on a mission to defeat Mr. Sweeney. The multimillion-dollar campaign is reverberating beyond the district, which Mr. Sweeney has represented since 2001 and where he has rarely faced any serious competition. Democratic groups estimate they will spend $11 million to support Mr. Sweeney, while the teachers’ union is on pace to spend more than $8 million. Other unions are pouring money in on Mr. Sweeney’s behalf and by Election Day, Nov. 7, the total amount spent on the single race could easily eclipse $20 million. Additionally, the money flooding this race by Democrats would, in other years, be spent propping up other candidates around the state. "
"That was quite a philippic Arizona Republican Jeff Flake delivered on Tuesday from the Senate floor, announcing his decision not to seek re-election while denouncing Donald Trump’s “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior and “flagrant disregard for truth and decency.” And that was some speech George W. Bush gave in New York the other day, warning pointedly of “nationalism distorted into nativism,” and a politics “more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.” And who will ever forget Republican Senator Bob Corker’s acid description of the White House as an “adult day care center,” or John McCain’s magnificent denunciation of “people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems”? Who will forget? Republicans will, led by the pro-Trump intelligentsia that has spent the past 18 months abasing itself so it could normalize him. In 1927 the French philosopher Julien Benda wrote “The Treason of the Intellectuals” (La Trahison des Clercs), a short book that pointed a damning finger at the ultra-nationalist thinkers of his time.

Here’s what you need to know: • “There is zero appetite for the ‘Never Trump’ movement in the Republican Party of today,” an adviser to a fund-raising group told us. “This party is now defined by President Trump and his movement.” More and more of the party’s establishment lawmakers are reaching the same conclusion and choosing flight over fight. • But there’s one thing, at least, that Republicans can all agree on: tax cuts. The budget resolution that would allow for $1.5 trillion in additional deficits faces a key vote in the House today. • This afternoon, President Trump will order the government to declare the epidemic of drug use a public health emergency, senior administration officials said. The move would free up federal money and ease laws and regulations to address the crisis, which Mr. Trump called a “national emergency” in August. "

"The Syrian Air Force was responsible for a lethal sarin chemical attack on a northern rebel-held village on April 4, a United Nations investigative panel said Thursday. Its report represented the first time that a politically independent investigation had concluded which side in the Syrian civil war had carried out the attack on the village, Khan Sheikhoun. The early morning attack killed dozens of civilians, including children, and is regarded as one of the worst chemical weapons atrocities in the conflict. The panel’s finding could place new pressure on Russia, the Syrian government’s most important ally, which pledged four years ago to ensure that President Bashar al-Assad purge all his chemical weapons. But the determination is also likely to be assailed by Russia as flawed, and could raise doubts about whether the panel, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, will be able to continue its work. A second finding in the report concluded that Islamic State militants had carried out an attack using sulfur mustard poison in Um-Housh, in Aleppo Province, on Sept. 16, 2016. "
"WASHINGTON — Three times in a single day last week, Senator Lindsey Graham’s cellphone rang. The first time, President Trump called about the health care fight in Congress. The second time, the president thanked the senator for defending his honor on television. Then Mr. Trump rang seeking more intelligence on health care. Mr. Graham — Republican of South Carolina and a onetime target of the president’s barbs on Twitter — has transformed himself into the Senate’s Trump whisperer, shrugging off the White House chaos, personal insults and deep ideological differences in exchange for Mr. Trump’s ear. The metamorphosis of Mr. Graham from chastised to cheerleader is all the more striking as his best friend and longtime mentor in the Senate, John McCain of Arizona, moves in the other direction, defiantly standing against the president as he battles brain cancer. And it comes as other senior Republican senators who share Mr. Graham’s long-held beliefs in an activist foreign policy and toleration toward immigrants challenge their colleagues to condemn Mr. Trump and his inward-looking “America First” views. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said Tuesday that the president was “debasing” the country. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona criticized what he called the president’s “reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior.” Both lawmakers have said they will retire from office rather than continue to work with Mr. Trump. Mr. Graham — who worked with Mr. Flake on immigration and Mr. Corker on foreign policy — said he shared those “concerns about what the president says and how he behaves.” But cozying up is the better choice, he said. “I’m going to try to stay in a position where I can have input to the president,” Mr. Graham, 62, said in a lengthy interview. “I can help him where I can, and he will call me up and pick my brain. Now, if you’re a United States senator, that’s a good place to find yourself.” "
"Donald Trump’s pledges to “drain the swamp” of corruption in Washington attest to his genius for unintentional irony. Nepotism, egregious conflicts of interest, flights on the public dime to see Wimbledon and the eclipse — the Beltway wetlands are now wilder and murkier than ever. It would be a mistake, though, to dismiss the swamp metaphor on account of Mr. Trump’s hypocrisy. You can’t make sense of his shocking victory last year without reference to the downward spiral of public faith in governing elites and established institutions. Years of stagnating incomes, combined with dimming prospects for the future, have primed voters for the message that the system is “rigged” and that only an outsider not beholden to the corrupt establishment can clean it up. In other words, one key to this populist moment in American politics is the link in the public mind between dysfunction in Washington and the economic malaise of the 21st century. An effective political response to this perilous moment begins with the recognition that this link is real — and that key changes in the policymaking process, supported by a major push from organized philanthropy, will be needed to turn things around. The image of the swamp conveys a profound truth about the American economy. Our predicament of slow growth and sky-high inequality has many causes, but one important factor is the capture of the American political system by powerful insiders — big businesses, elite professionals, wealthy homeowners — that use it to entrench their own economic power. In so doing, they protect themselves from competition, fatten their bank accounts with diverted wealth and slow the creative destruction that drives economic growth. Four key policy areas shed light on the growth of this political-economic swamp — financial regulation, intellectual property, occupational licensing and zoning. They show that the swamp isn’t confined to Washington; it can also be found in 50 state capitals and countless local jurisdictions. In the financial sector, a web of regulatory subsidies sustains financial institutions’ unhealthy reliance on extremely high levels of debt. These subsidies, including policies that strongly encourage mortgage securitization as well as the implicit promise to bail out “too big to fail” institutions, swell profits in the near term while increasing the systemic risk of a catastrophic meltdown in the long run. The result is a financial sector much bigger than the economy needs, chronic misallocation of capital and the diversion of some of the country’s top talent into counterproductive work. Luring people into excessive debt, draining their savings with hidden fees, inflating the next asset bubble — these and other dubious “contributions” by finance to the economy need to be curtailed.

"There’s been a flood of hand-wringing and tut-tutting over some observations that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. offered during the argument earlier this month in the big Wisconsin gerrymander case. He dismissed as “sociological gobbledygook” the metrics the plaintiffs offered for determining when districting decisions cross the line from ordinary politics to blunt force. He warned that the court would be putting its legitimacy in the eyes of the public on the line if it became the state-by-state arbiter of partisanship gone too far. “Gobbledygook” has received the most attention, some playful and some fairly snarky. A public letter addressed to the chief justice from Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, president of the American Sociological Association, was somewhere in between (with a dose of academic self-importance for good measure). He offered to “put together a group of nationally and internationally renowned sociologists to meet with you and your staff,” adding that “given the important ways in which sociological data can and have informed thoughtful decision-making from the bench, such time would be well spent.” Doubtless. My interest is not in the chief justice’s flippant remark, but in his serious one. He was addressing Paul M. Smith, the lawyer for the Wisconsin Democrats who, in the lower court, successfully challenged a Republican-drawn state Assembly map that gave Republicans 60 out of the 99 seats although the party drew only 48.6 percent of the statewide vote. (By a 5 to 4 vote in June, the justices granted Wisconsin a stay of the lower court’s decision striking down the redistricting map, to last until the Supreme Court itself decides the case, Gill v. Whitford. Dissenting from the stay were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.) The chief justice observed to Mr. Smith that if the plaintiffs prevailed, “there will naturally be a lot of these claims raised around the country.” He went on: “We will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win. So it’s going to be a problem here across the board. And if you’re the intelligent man on the street and the court issues a decision, and let’s say the Democrats win, and that person will say: ‘Well, why did the Democrats win?’ ” At this point, Chief Justice Roberts offered a rough approximation of the plaintiffs’ formula-driven approach to map drawing, and continued: “And the intelligent man on the street is going to say that’s a bunch of baloney. It must be because the Supreme Court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans. And that’s going to come out one case after another as these cases are brought in every state. And that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country.” Although the chief justice had not, in fact, posed a question, Mr. Smith ventured an answer: “It may be that you can protect the court from seeming political, but the country is going to lose faith in democracy, big time.” "
"By now, it’s pretty obvious that President Trump sees foreign policy as an extension of the business world. In both, his strategy has been hard-nosed brinkmanship, trying to cow businessmen and world leaders like Kim Jong-un of North Korea with his refusal to compromise, even if getting his way risks significant damage to his interests and those of his friends. More than one administration official has described the president’s approach as the “madman theory,” the idea that one way to make a threat effective is to persuade your opponent that you’re unstable enough to follow through. Madman theory is nothing new, and there’s a reason Mr. Trump’s recent predecessors have avoided it: It doesn’t work. Nuclear strategists have been talking about madman theory at least since Herman Kahn declared, in his 1962 book “Thinking About the Unthinkable,” that it could be effective to “look a little crazy” in inducing an adversary to stand down. This was not a recommendation to American leaders, but rather an admonition about the sorts of adversaries they might have to confront. Behavior like that of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis was probably what Kahn had in mind. Khrushchev had a reputation for irrational behavior — consider his shoe-brandishing  episode at the United Nations in 1960 — and seemed to confirm it by deploying nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba, 90 miles from the American mainland. It was President John F. Kennedy’s cool deliberation and calibrated response to this rash move that compelled Khrushchev to withdraw the missiles (albeit in exchange for the United States’ secret pledging to subsequently remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey), making Moscow look weak and heedless and contributing to Khrushchev’s political demise. Kennedy’s conduct during the Cuban missile crisis was the opposite of the current president’s swaggering, ill-informed recklessness. In essence, Kennedy put into practice the ideas of the great civilian strategists, who counseled showing resolve through firm declarations of resistance and sober clarifications of military capacity, while leaving an adversary a palatable opportunity to back down and the diplomatic channels through which to do so.

"Senator Jeff Flake gave a powerful, even poetic speech on Tuesday rebuking Donald Trump and the menace of Trumpism consuming the damaged Republican Party. But he undercut the power of the speech by coupling it with the announcement of his impending retirement from the Senate. Anyone who has ever left a job knows that what you say during your exit interview — no matter how compelling and profound — is of limited utility. More important, this was the kind of speech where people focus more on the excerpt-worthy flourishes than on the disturbing minutiae. Yes, it was historic to have a sitting senator attack the sitting president of his own party from the Senate floor. But Flake wasn’t only excoriating Trump, he was also excoriating his fellow elected officials, particularly Republicans, and the Republican Party, which finds itself caught in a perpetual rage spiral, in which no one but extremists are pure enough. The circle of inclusion is being drawn smaller and tighter around an electorally deadly singularity: White people who espouse Christianity, accept patriarchy and misogyny, and turn a blind eye to (or sometimes openly encourage) white supremacy. Look at all the times Flake chided the “we” in that speech. As he said at one point, putting the blame squarely on his Senate colleagues: “And what do we, as United States senators, have to say about it? The principles that underlie our politics, the values of our founding, are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics because politics can make us silent when we should speak and silence can equal complicity. I have children and grandchildren to answer to.” "
"PARIS — When friends come to Paris and ask what they should buy as gifts to take home, I start with a two-word answer: dish towels. Dish towels are practical, easy to pack, good value and, ideally, made in France. If you’re in Paris on a weekend, start by logging on to vide-greniers.org, which announces weekly street markets. Vide-greniers means “empty the attics,” but the site includes gatherings of itinerant professional dealers and residents participating in neighborhood yard sales. Crisply pressed old linens are usually for sale. Otherwise, my go-to place is the Marché St.-Pierre near the Sacré-Coeur basilica in the heart of Montmartre. One of the biggest fabric shops in the world, it spreads over five floors and covers almost 27,000 square feet. You can get lost for hours in the bolts of silks, satins, linen and lace. It is a journey into the past, a place where fabric cutters walk the aisles brandishing huge scissors and long wooden rulers. It is also not for the faint-of-heart shopper. Head straight to the second floor to find fine dish towels; the linen ones are about $7, and $21 will buy a crisp stone-beige all-linen chef-style apron. If you are brave enough to confront bolts of silks, satins, linen and lace, look for linen cloth with protective wax coating in solid colors. It makes an elegant, no-wash-or-iron dining room tablecloth. At $19 per 1 meter by 1.5 meter (around 3.2 feet by 4.9 feet), it’s a bargain. Dish towels tied with a ribbon around something else are an eco-friendly way to offer two presents instead of one. I have little patience for clothes and shoe shopping, so I recommend sticking to shops that focus on cooking and dining to find that special “something else.” These are some of my favorites. "

"The billionaire founder of Insys Therapeutics was arrested on Thursday on federal charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe a fentanyl-based painkiller intended for cancer patients. John Kapoor, the Insys founder, was charged with engaging in conspiracies to commit racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud in an indictment filed in Federal District Court in Boston. He was arrested in Arizona, where Insys is based, and added as a defendant in a case that was previously filed against six former Insys executives and managers, including Michael Babich, the former chief executive, prosecutors said. In a statement, Brian Kelly, a lawyer for Mr. Kapoor, said, “My client is innocent and he intends to fight these charges vigorously.” Insys, which has been in talks with the Justice Department about a settlement in connection with the inquiry, declined to comment. Its stock price closed down 22.64 percent to a four-year low of $5.74 on Thursday. The charges escalate the continuing inquiries into Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid. They came as President Trump declared the country’s opioid problem a public health crisis. William D. Weinreb, the acting United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said the charges reflected a commitment on the part of authorities to combat the opioid-abuse epidemic. Opioids drugs were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable, just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer,” Mr. Weinreb said in a statement. Mr. Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a member of its board, stepped down in January as the company’s chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015. He is currently chairman of the drugmaker Akorn Inc. and president of the investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises. Prosecutors said that after bringing Subsys to market in 2012, Mr. Kapoor, Mr. Babich and others devised a scheme to pay speaking fees and other bribes to medical practitioners who prescribed the drug. They also sought to defraud insurers into approving payments for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said. The other defendants include Alec Burlakoff and Michael Gurry, former company vice presidents; Richard Simon, a former national sales director; and Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan, former regional sales directors. They have pleaded not guilty. "
"Some of President Trump’s liberal critics are characterizing the Oct. 4 ambush in Niger that killed four American soldiers as “Benghazi on steroids” — a reference to the yearslong partisan uproar over the 2012 attacks on two United States compounds in Libya. A few parallels can be drawn between the incidents. In each, four Americans died at the hands of Islamic extremists. After the Benghazi attacks, the Obama administration struggled to explain exactly what happened, and why. And now, President Trump and his top officials have yet to satisfy questions from Congress about the deaths in Niger, Republicans and Democrats said on Thursday. But popular allegations about Mr. Trump’s role in Niger have ranged from premature to conspiratorial. Liberal blog posts, shared online tens of thousands of times, falsely claim that Mr. Trump sent American troops to Niger to aid Russia. One, for example, reads: “Four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger two weeks ago, and no one knows what they were doing there — except that it came shortly after Niger curiously signed a military cooperation agreement with Russia.” "
"In the film “Bill Nye: Science Guy,” Mr. Nye, the 1990s children’s-television personality with the signature bow tie, warns of “an anti-science movement” afoot in this country. And this delightful, revealing documentary, directed by David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg, offers evidence supporting that assessment. Mr. Nye, who left his Emmy-winning series after around 100 episodes, has embraced a new mission: educating an older generation as he champions space exploration and challenges creationists and climate-change deniers. In TV clips, Sarah Palin impugns Mr. Nye’s credentials, and an Obama-era Donald J. Trump declares, “Our president is worried about global warming — what a ridiculous situation.” Joe Bastardi, the former chief long-range forecaster at AccuWeather and a frequent Fox News guest, insists that extreme weather is merely meteorological variation, not the result of human-caused global warming. (Mr. Nye is polite but resolute as he argues with Mr. Bastardi during a visit to his home.) “As we stand here, the Juno spacecraft just went into orbit around Jupiter,” Mr. Nye says. “It’s an extraordinary accomplishment of engineering and rocket science.” “Here is anti-science,” he adds, gesturing in the direction of the Kentucky tourist attractions the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter, whose exhibits present such sights as prehistoric humans cohabiting, Flintstone-like, with dinosaurs, and a sauropod (a dinosaur species) dwelling on Noah’s ark. Mr. Nye debates the museum’s chief executive, Ken Ham, on a stage, though his efforts only galvanize Mr. Ham’s supporters. The documentary also follows Mr. Nye’s work as chief executive of the Planetary Society, as he collaborates with the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and spearheads the LightSail project (a small spacecraft powered by photons from the sun), a tribute to Mr. Nye’s mentor Carl Sagan. And it accompanies Mr. Nye to Greenland, where he witnesses melting ice caps and ice-core studies revealing climate temperatures of centuries past and our fossil-fuel-poisoned present. Most inspiring, it finds him at a conference of adoring science teachers, who applaud him as a defender of all they hold dear. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — It may not be politically popular to raise concerns about the human rights of Islamic State fighters and their families. But the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has monitored the treatment of the wounded, prisoners and civilians in wartime for a century and a half, sought to do just that in a strongly worded statement on Thursday. The organization is concerned about rhetoric that “dehumanizes” and “demonizes” the enemy or suggests that a particular adversary is “outside the bounds of humanity” and can be treated “as if humanitarian law doesn’t apply,” the group’s deputy director for the Middle East, Patrick Hamilton, told reporters via a telephone conference call. Language that could appear to justify or encourage war crimes and illegal treatment of detainees has become more common on all sides of the sprawling conflicts in Syria and Iraq, Mr. Hamilton said, to the point that the Red Cross felt it necessary to remind all combatants that international law requires due process and humane treatment of detainees “with no exceptions.” His comments come as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh, is surrendering more territory  to an array of government and militia forces. Several Western officials have said that it would be best if their citizens who have fought with the Islamic State died in combat. The Red Cross has a longstanding policy of not singling out governments or groups for criticism, because it seeks to preserve access to all sides in order to carry out missions such as monitoring the treatment of detainees and prisoners. The organization said its warning was directed at all combatants as well as countries that might receive returning Islamic State fighters. “It’s not that we are going to name no one,” Mr. Hamilton said of his warning against inflammatory rhetoric. “We name everyone.” "
"LONDON — The letter is as British as it gets: polite, polished and understated. Written by a senior Conservative Party lawmaker, Christopher Heaton-Harris, and sent to British universities, it asked officials to reveal the names of professors involved in teaching students about Europe, including Britain’s decision last year to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit. “Furthermore,” the missive read, “if I could be provided with a copy of the syllabus and links to the online lectures which relate to this area I would be much obliged.” Despite its apparently mild tone, the letter has provoked a national debate on freedom of speech in universities and whether the country is being subjected to political censorship in a British version of McCarthyism. The uproar increased on Thursday after The Daily Mail, a popular tabloid that has vociferously supported Brexit and which carries an anti-immigrant slant, published a front-page article citing instances in which it said university professors had encouraged students to oppose a Brexit. On another page, more than a dozen headshots of academic leaders were assembled around a headline that read: “Just why is every new Oxbridge head a leftie?” (“Oxbridge” is shorthand for the two leading universities in Britain: Oxford and Cambridge.) While the letter itself is the work of a single politician, the backlash underscores the toxic climate and the searing divisions that dominate Britain more than a year after its referendum on Brexit. There is deep uncertainty and little consensus over what Britain’s future should look like. Negotiations with the European Union over divorce terms have all but stalled. Even the ruling Conservative Party, which called for the referendum in the first place, is divided over what kind of a break it wants. Resentment against elites remains as acerbic as ever. "
