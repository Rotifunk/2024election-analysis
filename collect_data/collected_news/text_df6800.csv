"Before there was a hint of collusion with Russia, there were questions about Donald Trump’s finances. In those more innocent days, the questions were mainly about propriety — why wouldn’t he release his tax returns like other presidential candidates had? — and perhaps a hint of ox-goring: “Billionaire? He’s no billionaire!” This week it has become clearer that questions about Mr. Trump’s finances, and those about whether his campaign cooperated with Russian hacking of the 2016 election, need to be asked in the same breath. On Tuesday, we learned that a company linked to a Russian oligarch — as well as corporations with business before the administration — gave a total of more than $1 million to a shell company that the president’s fixer, Michael Cohen, set up just before the election to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels, the porn star who says she had sex with Mr. Trump in 2006. Those corporations — AT&T, the pharmaceutical company Novartis and Korea Aerospace — paid the shell company, Essential Consultants, during last year. All do business with the federal government or can be affected by federal actions, such as possible controls on drug prices or the Justice Department’s lawsuit against AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner. On Wednesday, Novartis said it had actually spent $1.2 million in total, $800,000 more than was originally reported, and AT&T said it had paid as much as $600,000, three times what had been reported. Both issued statements denying any wrongdoing but still leaving the impression that they were paying for access to the president or his fixer. Korea Aerospace told The Wall Street Journal that it had hired Essential for legal counseling regarding American accounting standards. Seriously. This sort of suspicious cash was at the heart of a recent report by The Washington Post that found that in the decade before the election, Mr. Trump did something unusual for a real estate developer — he all but stopped borrowing money. Multiple bankruptcies had no doubt exhausted his welcome at any reputable bank, so perhaps the man who called himself the “King of Debt” became more prudent, or he simply faced reality. What happened next, though, was more unusual. Beginning in 2006, the Trump Organization spent $400 million in cash on various projects. The president’s son Eric said they were able to do that with cash generated by other Trump businesses, even at the height of the Great Recession. That explanation has raised the eyebrows of business experts. "
"WASHINGTON — More than a dozen House Republicans defied Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Wednesday and moved to force a vote on immigration in the House, aiming to settle the uncertain futures of so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children. The group is gathering signatures for a so-called discharge petition, a parliamentary maneuver that could be used to circumvent Mr. Ryan by bringing legislation to the House floor with the support of a majority of members. The party out of power often uses such petitions, but they rarely succeed because a signature from a member of the party in power is seen as a betrayal of leadership. This time around, 17 Republicans had signed as of Wednesday afternoon. “We are well aware that the speaker’s preference was not to have this process,” said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, who introduced the petition Wednesday morning. “I’ve made the argument to the speaker personally that this process actually empowers him.” If nine more Republicans sign on, along with all House Democrats, the group will be able to revive an immigration debate that had appeared all but dead. Its goal is to force debate on four immigration-related measures, including one of the speaker’s choosing. Under a little-used rule known as Queen of the Hill, the measure that received the most votes would be adopted, and advance to the Senate, so long as a majority of the House voted in favor. Representative Jeff Denham, Republican of California and the architect of the strategy, said such a rule could be brought up on the first and third Monday of every month. The next opportunity to do so, he said, would be June 11. Mr. Ryan has repeatedly said that he is opposed to the strategy, contending that it might produce legislation that President Trump would not sign. “We continue to work with our members to find a solution that can both pass the House and get the president’s signature,” his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said Wednesday. "
"WASHINGTON — The chief executive of the aerospace giant Boeing downplayed the fallout from the president’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact, saying on Wednesday that the company would abide by the Trump administration’s decision to cancel Boeing’s licenses to sell $20 billion of aircraft to Iran. “We will continue to follow the U.S. government’s lead,” Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive, told a luncheon crowd at the Economic Club of Washington. He said Boeing had not committed to any production slots for the planes the company had planned to build for Iran, given there was a chance the United States would pull out of the 2015 pact. Mr. Muilenburg spoke a day after the administration said Boeing would see its $20 billion contract to supply aircraft to Iran terminated because of the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear deal, thus restoring stringent sanctions it had imposed previously. Boeing’s rival, Airbus, will also lose its license to sell to Iran, administration officials said. “Under the original deal, there were waivers for commercial aircrafts, parts and services, and the existing licenses will be revoked,” the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Tuesday, in reference to Boeing and Airbus. “The licenses are coming down. The objective is to put and maintain maximum sanctions on Iran; that is the objective here.” The announcement means Boeing will lose out on a lucrative new market for jetliners, but the move will likely cost the company less than it will Airbus. Boeing agreed to sell 80 passenger jets to Iran Air for about $17 billion in 2016, but it never began building the planes or factored them in as future revenue. "
"To the Editor: What a tragic disconnect there is between two May 8 news articles. One describes the rollout of Melania Trump’s long-awaited program as first lady, to be called “Be Best” and dedicated to the idea that, as Mrs. Trump announced, “children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence.” The first lady wants to use her platform to “help as many children as she can,” according to her spokeswoman. Enjoying the festive air of the rollout, guests in the Rose Garden snacked on cookies emblazoned with the new slogan in red and blue while a military band played Eric Clapton’s “Change the World.” It sounds like a fun party and a good photo op. But as another article reports, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced an enlarged policy of criminal penalties for border crossers, including the forced separation of parents and their young children. All children, not just documented ones, deserve the opportunity to enjoy their innocence, and a government that heartlessly separates young children from their parents does not deserve to call itself great. PERRIE L. RIDLEY
RIDGEFIELD, CONN. To the Editor: Like Melania Trump, I support programs that teach children about substance abuse and responsible social media use. But unlike the first lady, I do not subscribe to the idea that “children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence.” Children cannot be protected from knowledge of the world in which they live. That was never possible. Today, access to the internet and social media has rendered that fantasy even more unrealistic. Our responsibility is to help children make sense of that world with all its many shortcomings, a world that we have neither made nor always approve of. JONATHAN SILIN, AMAGANSETT, N.Y.

"Frank Bruni, a Times Op-Ed columnist, hosted an online conversation on Wednesday morning with Corry Bliss, the young Republican strategist at the very heart of the party’s effort to hold on to its congressional majority in November. Bliss serves as the executive director of the American Action Network and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a potent super PAC that raises money for, and directs it to, high-priority House races nationwide. Bliss, 37, managed four Republican Senate campaigns between 2012 and 2016, including Rob Portman’s 21-point victory in Ohio over Ted Strickland, the state’s former governor. Bliss and Bruni talked about what Republicans should fear in November, and what they can reasonably hope for. Frank Bruni: Corry, thanks for joining me. Obviously, yesterday’s primaries are on all political junkies’ minds right now, and I’m curious for starters how much of a relief Don Blankenship’s defeat in the West Virginia Republican Senate primary was? If he’d been the nominee, would the Republican Party have had to give up its hope of getting that Senate seat from the Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin? Would Blankenship have dragged the rest of the party down? Does he still haunt it, in that he ran that odious campaign of his (“Cocaine Mitch!”) under a G.O.P. banner? Corry Bliss: Frank, thanks for having me! I’m glad your first question is a Senate question. Technically I’m a House guy now, but I’ll always be a Senate guy at heart. Blankenship would’ve lost the general election. Period. The entire Republican Party owes Majority Leader McConnell and Steven Law, the president of the super PAC American Crossroads, a big debt of gratitude for taking him out. Last night was probably the worst night of Joe Manchin’s political career. Patrick Morrisey, the state attorney general and now the Republican nominee, will win that race. But for me, that wasn’t the most important story of the night. Bruni: What was the most important story of the night? I’ll concede that we in the media have been known to concentrate on flashy objects at the expense of weightier stuff. Bliss: I’m glad you asked about the most important lesson from last night. The only thing reporters like you (!) want to write is that the blue wave is coming, and it’s going to be so big that it might take 50 years to recover from. Ohio voters didn’t get the memo — with competitive primaries on both sides, Republicans outperformed Democrats by nearly 150,000 voters in the governor’s race. The G.O.P. outperformed Democrats in every single statewide race, and G.O.P. turnout was up 48 percent over 2014. Maybe the wave is going to skip Ohio. Bruni: I knew you were going to bring that up, and if I may crow a bit, those numbers were on my list of questions to ask. So the whole belief that Democrats in November will be much more exercised, much more passionate, and will turn out more reliably — you don’t buy it? "
"To the Editor: Re “How Many Funerals Will Trump Skip?” (column, May 9), about Senator John McCain’s dying wish that President Trump not attend his planned memorial at the National Cathedral in Washington: Frank Bruni got it just right: Decency is what is missing from the Trump administration. What I have so much trouble understanding is why that deficiency does not bother more people. I always thought of Americans as decent. Now I’m not so sure. MARC CHAFETZ, WASHINGTON "
"A woman who accused Donald J. Trump during the presidential race of forcibly kissing her at Trump Tower more than a decade ago won an uncontested Democratic primary on Tuesday for a seat in the Ohio State Legislature. Three weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Rachel Crooks was among several women who came forward to accuse Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct, detailing how she said he grabbed her in 2005 outside an elevator in his Manhattan building and repeatedly kissed her. But her story did not have a sizable effect on his campaign, a frustrating development that helped spur Ms. Crooks’s political ambitions. On Tuesday night, Ms. Crooks took a step closer to becoming the first Trump accuser to hold public office, winning an unopposed Democratic primary for an Ohio House of Representatives seat. She is part of a national surge of female political newcomers this year, in both parties and at all levels, who hope to take leading roles in statehouses and in Washington. Ms. Crooks’s run to represent House District 88, a swath of farmland and manufacturing southeast of Toledo, has garnered particular interest nationwide. Her campaign raised $57,500 leading up to the primary, twice as much as her opponent, with 84 percent of the donations from people who live outside Ohio, according to campaign finance records. “For others, especially those across the United States, I think they view me running as part of the anti-Trump movement that they want to support,” Ms. Crooks, 35, said in an email on Wednesday.

"He is a Baptist minister who opposes gay marriage, a Republican who is critical of his party’s leaders in Congress, and a candidate who ran a shoestring campaign against a House incumbent. And on Wednesday, Mark Harris found himself in another role: A giant-killer of the 2018 midterm elections. Mr. Harris beat Representative Robert Pittenger in a Republican primary in North Carolina on Tuesday, making Mr. Pittenger the first incumbent from either party to lose his seat in Congress due to a primary challenger this year. House Republicans were already concerned about Mr. Pittenger’s chances against the well-funded Democratic nominee, the Iraq war veteran Dan McCready, but believed he would fend off the challenge from Mr. Harris, who instead beat him by fewer than 1,000 votes. “People are catching on to that ‘drain the swamp’ thing, and I think that is a message we have to consider,” Mr. Harris said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “Is it fair to say the establishment was surprised by what happened last night? Definitely so.” [Read our six takeaways from Tuesday night’s primary elections.] Mr. Harris, 52, will now face a Democrat whose campaign war chest vastly outmatches his own: Last month, Mr. McCready’s campaign had more than $1.2 million in the bank, while Mr. Harris had just $70,000. Mr. McCready beat a primary challenger of his own, Christian Cano, with more than 82 percent of the vote. Mr. Harris, who nearly unseated Mr. Pittenger two years ago, won by portraying the three-term incumbent as a Washington insider who violated the spirit of a 2012 campaign pledge to support term limits. He also criticized Mr. Pittenger for his vote in favor of a $1.3 trillion spending bill, which was both signed and rebuked by President Trump in March. "
"WASHINGTON — Mick Mulvaney, the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will move the agency’s student loan division into the bureau’s consumer information unit, a shift that career officials fear will sidetrack a major enforcement case the agency is pursuing against Navient, the nation’s largest student loan collector. The change, outlined in an email sent to the bureau’s staff Wednesday morning, is part of an effort by Mr. Mulvaney to refocus the agency away from its consumer finance enforcement and rule-writing mission and more toward providing consumers with information about their legal rights. It follows a similar move Mr. Mulvaney made in February, when he folded the bureau’s fair lending division into the consumer unit, telling staff it would “continue to focus on advocacy, coordination and education.” Among the bureau’s career staff, the shift was regarded as a new attack on one of the bureau’s core statutory functions, and another attempt by Mr. Mulvaney and his team to dismantle a consumer watchdog reviled by President Trump. One person at the bureau familiar with the student loan office’s work said it clearly was being targeted. Mr. Mulvaney’s reorganization left untouched several other groups with similarly specific focuses, including offices that concentrate on protecting service members and older Americans. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the agency, called the move a “very modest organizational chart change.” "
"Major Democratic donors in New York have discreetly formed a new political alliance to raise roughly $10 million that would be injected into as many as two dozen key House battlegrounds in an effort to wrest control of Congress from Republicans. Admission to be an official partner in what’s being called the House Victory Project comes with a $108,000 price tag. More than 80 people have each committed that sum, according to a half-dozen donors familiar with the group, whose existence has not previously been reported. The $108,000 pledge allows each donor to effectively give the maximum $5,400 contribution to 20 different House candidates. With nearly $9 million in commitments amassed so far, each Democratic recipient could see a windfall of as much as $432,000 — an amount that, for many House candidates, equals months of fund-raising in one fell swoop. Jane D. Hartley, a former ambassador to France under President Barack Obama, said that the donors were a “very diverse” group that included philanthropists who have previously not engaged in political giving. “Many have not been involved in politics in the past, but they’ve said they can’t sit out this election,” she said. Ms. Hartley, who hosted an event in recent months to pitch donors on the idea, is one of five organizers of the project, donors said. The others include Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton; Roger C. Altman, the former deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration; and two investment bankers who are major Democratic fund-raisers, Deven J. Parekh and Blair W. Effron. "
"The New York Times is going Hollywood. The cable channel FX announced on Wednesday that it would be making a new weekly documentary series centered on stories that appear in The Times and the journalists who report them. The show, which will be called “The Weekly,” builds on the success of the podcast “The Daily,” which began last year and generally examines a story a day from the Times newsroom. FX has given “The Weekly” a 30-week commitment and a Sunday night time slot. The show, at 30 minutes per episode, is expected to debut later this year, possibly in time for the midterm elections. Hulu has the rights to stream the new series, giving the program a dedicated streaming platform the day after it premieres on cable. Unlike “The Daily,” which is hosted by Michael Barbaro, the television version will not have a dedicated host, FX said. But in keeping with the podcast’s format, “The Weekly” will follow a reporter or team of journalists as a Times story makes its way toward publication. For The Times, the FX show signals a turn toward the entertainment world. The company recently made a deal with Netflix to turn a feature from The New York Times Magazine into a documentary series called “The Diagnosis,” with Scott Rudin producing. Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures and Plan B, a production company co-founded by Brad Pitt, have gobbled up the rights to make a movie about how The Times broke the Harvey Weinstein story. Later this month, “The Fourth Estate,” a four-episode series from the documentary filmmaker Liz Garbus chronicling the Times newsroom during the first year of the Trump administration, will premiere on Showtime. Times leaders have been sending signals that this would be the year it would be aggressive in entering the crowded television space. "
"On Wednesday morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a confirmation hearing for Ryan Bounds, a federal prosecutor who has been nominated to the influential United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. The hearing is taking place despite the refusal of his home-state Democratic senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, to return their “blue slips” — blue pieces of paper that senators use to indicate their favorable or unfavorable opinion of a nominee from their state. Blue slips are not provided for in the Constitution or by statute; they are merely a Senate tradition, and the importance given to them has varied over the years. But this latest shift in blue-slip practice has generated loud opposition, especially from the left, because in recent history — and during the entire Obama administration — no hearing or vote was held on a nominee unless both home-state senators had returned their blue slips. Now blue slips seem to be going the way of the filibuster for judicial nominees. Democrats eliminated that practice in 2013 for lower-court nominees, and Republicans eliminated it last year for Supreme Court nominees. Last November, Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled a hearing for an Eighth Circuit nominee, David Stras, even though Al Franken, then the senior senator from Minnesota, refused to return his blue slip. Now Senator Grassley will hold a hearing for Mr. Bounds, who lacks even one blue slip from his senators. (I should note that Mr. Bounds is a friend of mine from law school.) Mr. Grassley appears to be taking his cue on blue slips from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Last fall, Senator McConnell told The New York Times that “the blue slip, with regard to circuit court appointments, ought to simply be a notification of how you’re going to vote, not the opportunity to blackball.” (He said he had no problem with honoring blue slips for district or trial-court judges, who, unlike circuit judges, hear cases just from their own states.) Many people have bemoaned the demise of the filibuster and now the blue slip. It certainly reflects a decline in senatorial courtesy. It’s bad news for individual senators, who now have less power to scuttle nominations. "
"Hold on to your crown jewels, members of Parliament: Caitlyn Jenner will address the House of Commons on Wednesday. The talk is part of a series of lectures on the importance of diversity; other speeches have come from the British actors Riz Ahmed and Idris Elba. Ms. Jenner, the former Olympic athlete and reality show star, will be speaking in Westminster about the issue of gender identity and the heavy burdens carried by trans people worldwide. You could reasonably ask whether Caitlyn Jenner is the right person to address Parliament on this issue, and many advocates are doing just that; she was, after all, an early enthusiast of Donald Trump, the biggest disaster for trans people in decades. But that’s not what unsettled me when I first learned of her speech. What gave me the willies was the news that she’d also be participating in Tuesday night’s “Genderquake: The Debate,” which ran on Britain’s Channel 4, the sponsor of the diversity lecture at Westminster. On that show, she debated the legitimacy of transgender experience with, among others, the feminist icon Germaine Greer — a woman who over the years has said no small number of heartless things about trans people, including, “I’ve asked my doctor to give me long ears and liver spots and I’m going to wear a brown coat, but that won’t turn me into a cocker spaniel.” I deeply resent the idea that my identity gets to be “debated” in the first place. I’m not alone in this; a number of activists in Britain protested the show for this very reason. (Others boycotted it because of Ms. Jenner herself.) As Dr. Adrian Harrop — a trans advocate who declined an invitation to be part of the show — told the website Pink News: “This debate is not about incorporating trans people into mainstream society and improving their lives and making sure they can access and engage with society on a meaningful level. This is a very basic debate around whether existing as a trans person is a valid, legitimate way to live one’s life.” I understand that trans people participate in these public whippings in hopes of opening the hearts of strangers. But I’ve begun to wonder whether this work sometimes is self-defeating. As James Thurber once wrote, “You might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backward.” "
"THE ROAD TO UNFREEDOM
Russia, Europe, America
By Timothy Snyder
359 pp. Tim Duggan Books. $27. Historians of the first half of the 20th century take little pleasure in today’s renewed interest in their subject. We don’t like the parallels between the West then and now: the rise of intolerant nationalist right-wing parties; the loss of faith in democratic institutions and the longing for a strong leader; the demonization of minorities like Jews or Muslims; or the unwillingness or inability of democracies to work together. We are living in dangerous times, Timothy Snyder argues forcefully and eloquently in his new book, “The Road to Unfreedom.” Too many of us, leaders and followers, are irresponsible, rejecting ideas that don’t fit our preconceptions, refusing discussion and rejecting compromise. Worse, we are prepared to deny the humanity and rights of others. In his chilling “Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,” Snyder explored the ghastly consequences of tyranny and the breakdown of human values and norms in the center of Europe. The road to unfreedom, as Snyder sees it, is one that runs right over the Enlightenment faith in reason and the reasonableness of others — the very underpinning, that is, of our institutions and values. Recent examples, found around the world, demonstrate both how important conventions and mutual respect are as a way of maintaining order and civility — and how easily and carelessly they can be smashed. Just think of President Trump’s regular impugning of the loyalty of those who work for the American government, in the F.B.I., for example. So many of us no longer care, as we should, about understanding ourselves and our pasts as complex and ambiguous. Rather we look for comforting stories that claim to explain where we came from and where we are going. Such stories relieve us of the need to think and serve to create powerful identities. They also serve the authoritarian leader who rides them to power. Snyder makes a valuable distinction between the narratives of inevitability and those of eternity. The former are like Marxism or faith in the triumph of the free market: They say that history is moving inexorably toward a clear end. The latter do not see progress but an endless cycle of humiliation, death and rebirth that repeats itself. Not surprisingly these often draw on powerful religious iconography. Both, as Snyder points out, produce intolerance of those who disagree. By questioning the narrative’s supposed truth, you are removing yourself from the community of true believers. "
"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Cecilia Kang, a technology reporter based in Washington, discussed the tech she’s using. What are your most important tools for covering technology policy? Tech has become a big focus in Washington these days, which means I’m spending much of my time on the go, hopping around various agencies and congressional offices to cover news and to meet with sources. I have on me — at all times — my MacBook Air, iPhone X, chargers, earbuds (one pair for my phone and another for my laptop), and many notebooks and pens. I put a lot of thought into what kind of backpack I would buy to carry it all because I’m often standing on buses or the Metro, and clocking lots of steps. I’m happy with my backpack from Knomo of London, which is sleek and light and has just the right pocket compartments to stay organized. I rely on lots of communications apps. My contacts are very particular about how we communicate, so I have about half a dozen apps I use regularly for interviews. Some sources prefer encrypted apps like Signal and others like to email, text, direct message on Twitter or trade messages on Facebook. I have contacts who will only meet in person and insist that I take notes by hand. Once, a source called me and heard me typing, hung up and showed up in my office lobby to talk in person. When I’m covering members of Congress or meeting with government officials, I like to record the conversations and rely on the Voice Memos app. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo extended an olive branch to senior North Korean officials on Wednesday: “All the opportunities your people so richly deserve” in exchange for the shutting down of the North’s nuclear weapons program. “For decades, we have been adversaries,” Mr. Pompeo said in a toast during a lunch in honor of his visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. “Now we are hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve.” Mr. Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang on Wednesday on a mission to smooth any remaining wrinkles in the weekslong preparations for a planned summit meeting between North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump, according to pool reports by journalists traveling with Mr. Pompeo. He also secured the release of  three American citizens detained in the isolated country on charges of committing espionage and other vaguely defined “hostile acts.” In his planned meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump hopes he can persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons by offering better ties with Washington that would help Mr. Kim rebuild his impoverished country. Mr. Kim has said that he is willing to discuss denuclearization, but that Washington needs to make North Korea feel secure enough to focus on economic recovery. “There are many challenges along the way,” Mr. Pompeo said on Wednesday, addressing a senior North Korean official, Kim Yong-chol. “But you have been a great partner in working to make sure our two leaders will have a summit that is successful.” Kim Yong-chol, a vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party, has been a crucial aide to the North Korean leader in his fast-paced diplomatic overtures in recent weeks, accompanying him to talks with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and President Xi Jinping of China. Kim Yong-chol has also been a key North Korean contact for Mr. Pompeo as both governments have prepared for their leaders’ planned meeting. "
"The job of New York attorney general over the past two decades has proved to be a launching pad for aspiring politicians who used their legal authority to go after Wall Street hucksters, corrupt politicians and real estate scofflaws. It was a strategy laid out by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who had both held the role. And Eric T. Schneiderman showed no reservation in following a similar playbook when he went after the big banks for mortgage abuses and the ride-hailing company Uber for its use of customer data. Mr. Schneiderman’s confrontations with President Trump, mainly through a series of lawsuits to counter the administration’s attempts to roll back environmental and financial regulation, bolstered his national profile and played especially well in progressive political circles. Now Mr. Schneiderman’s legacy is in tatters, after he said on Monday that he would resign in the wake of a report in The New Yorker about allegations that he physically assaulted four women he had dated. Before his sudden downfall, there was no denying that Mr. Schneiderman, 63, had a knack for getting results and getting attention during his more than seven years as attorney general. A former state senator, he brought a politician’s approach to the job, announcing investigations both large and small and issuing news releases galore. Just last month, his office issued 42 news releases. Their topics ranged from guilty pleas in an investigation of a dogfighting ring on Long Island to a lawsuit against the federal Environmental Protection Agency. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Six candidates for governor of California met on Tuesday for their final debate before the June 5 primary. Here are a few takeaways. 1. The gas tax passed by the Legislature clearly divides Democrats from Republicans. The Democrats — Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor; Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles; John Chiang, the state treasurer; and Delaine Eastin, a former Assembly member — are for it. The two Republicans — Travis Allen, a member of the State Assembly, and John Cox, a business executive — oppose it. Mr. Cox: “You can’t keep picking the pockets of the taxpayers of this state.” Mr. Newsom: “I applaud the courage of the Legislature that did the right thing.” 2. The four Democrats opposed the immigration compromise backed by Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, to provide money for a border wall in exchange for protecting so-called Dreamers from deportation. “Absolutely not,” said Mr. Chiang. “California is about building bridges, not walls.” 3. Gov. Jerry Brown can rest just a little easier about the fate of his high-speed train, assuming any of these Democrats are elected (a pretty good bet): They all said it was a good idea. By contrast, Mr. Allen said it would “never be built.” 4. President Trump. Surprise. Ms. Eastin called him a “racist misogynist.” Mr. Villaraigosa was also critical, but said: “Talking and tweeting about Trump every day is not going to solve poverty, fix schools and make our streets safer.” (That’s a shot at Mr. Newsom, for those keeping score.) "
"SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump announced on Wednesday that North Korea had freed three American prisoners, removing a bitter and emotional obstacle ahead of a planned meeting between him and the young leader of the nuclear-armed nation. The release of the three prisoners, all American citizens of Korean descent, was a diplomatic victory for Mr. Trump and in some ways the most tangible gesture of sincerity shown by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to improve relations with the United States after nearly seven decades of mutual antagonism. Mr. Trump said in a tweet that the three were freed following a visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, for more discussions with North Korean officials about the expected meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. The president said that Mr. Pompeo was “in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen” and that the group seemed “to be in good health.” South Korea welcomed the release of the prisoners — two of whom were arrested during Mr. Trump’s presidency — calling it “very positive for a successful North Korean-United States summit,” said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in. "
"TEHRAN — Iran’s supreme leader on Wednesday hinted that his country might step up its nuclear program, signaling a possible escalation in an already volatile relationship with Washington after President Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that the United States would leave the agreement under which Iran agreed to strict limits for 15 years on its development of nuclear fuel. The deal was intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, in return for an easing of economic sanctions. But now, Mr. Trump said, the United States will reimpose sanctions. Iran has always insisted that its uranium enrichment was intended only to operate nuclear power plants and conduct research, but it also put Iran closer to producing fuel that could be used in atomic bombs. “Last night, you heard the president of America making petty and mindless statements,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, told a group of teachers in his Tehran office, according to the semiofficial news agency Fars. “There were perhaps more than 10 lies in his statements.” “He threatened both the system and the nation that ‘I will do this and that,’” the ayatollah said. “I say on behalf of the nation of Iran: ‘Mr. Trump, you won’t do a damn thing!’” The other parties to the deal — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the European Union — continue to support it.

"SHENZHEN, China — Not Apple. Not Huawei. The first casualty of the high-tech cold war between the United States and China might be the biggest electronics maker you’ve never heard of. The Chinese firm ZTE said on Wednesday it had ceased “major operating activities” after the Trump administration banned the company last month from using components made in the United States. With manufacturing halted at the ZTE plant in Shenzhen, factory workers have been getting called in for training sessions every other day or so — a snooze, they say. The rest of the time, they loaf around in nearby dorms. Trading in the company’s shares has been suspended for weeks. Staff members have been instructed, in new guidelines reviewed by The New York Times, to reassure anxious clients, while being sure to avoid discussing with them the American technology from which the firm is cut off for the next seven years. One of China’s most internationally successful technology suppliers, with about $17 billion in annual revenue, ZTE is facing a death sentence. The Commerce Department has blocked its access to American-made components until 2025, saying the company failed to punish employees who violated trade controls against Iran and North Korea. [Catch up on what ZTE is, and why President Trump wants to help it.] American microchips power ZTE’s wireless stations. American optical components go into its optical fiber networks. Google’s Android operating system runs its smartphones. As the Trump administration threatens a trade war to stymie China’s plans for promoting advanced industries, the firm’s travails are proving an apt demonstration, for China’s leaders, of exactly why the country needs to be more self-sufficient in technology. President Xi Jinping recently issued a rousing call to action, according to the state news agency Xinhua. "
"This requires context. Ms. Haspel is right that before the enhanced interrogation program was created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, C.I.A. interrogations usually entailed a conversation or polygraph exam with potential informants or defectors. The C.I.A. has no detention authority and, as a matter of mission, generally does not interrogate detainees. But the agency has occasionally been involved in interrogations in its past. A Senate Intelligence Committee report on C.I.A.’s use of torture that was released in 2014, and the agency’s own website, provides several examples. The relevant portion of the 2014 report reads: Methods described in KUBARK, like forced standing and sensory deprivation, were used by the C.I.A to interrogate a Soviet K.G.B. officer to determine whether he was a legitimate defector. The KUBARK manual became the basis for the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual, which provided “interrogation training in Latin America in the early 1980s,” according to the Senate report. Additionally, a 2007 study posted on the C.I.A.’s website detailed a specific interrogation of a North Vietnamese officer who was captured during the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese officer was kept for three years in an isolated cell that was painted bright white. His C.I.A. interrogator nicknamed him “the man in the snow white cell.” Another study described the Phoenix program, a security program that the C.I.A. ran in South Vietnam during the 1960s. The program, the agency’s study said, involved 600 C.I.A. and military personnel in the interrogation of Viet Cong militants. Morley Safer, the renowned newsman who had covered the Vietnam War, described the Phoenix program this way in a book review in The New York Times in 1990: "
"HOUSTON — President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal has so far had no more than a muted effect on oil and gasoline prices. But that could easily change. The full impact on global oil markets may not be seen for weeks or months. It will depend on how tightly the administration enforces new sanctions on Iran, and whether the entire deal collapses or can somehow be salvaged. That may well depend on the responses of a diverse cast of geopolitical actors from Moscow to Beijing to New Delhi since the United States imports no oil directly from Iran. A cascade of unpredictable events may follow the administration’s action, one that could ultimately lead to compromise. If not, there could be even greater instability across the Middle East and possibly an oil-price spike. The biggest wild card is how Iran will respond. European leaders have urged Iran to continue to abide by the agreement to freeze its nuclear development, despite the American withdrawal. President Hassan Rouhani has said he wants to negotiate with the Europeans, Russia and China on terms for continuing the deal, but the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has left the door open to resuming its nuclear program. For additional leverage, Iran could unleash allied militias based in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen against Israel and Saudi Arabia. A blockade or mining of the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point for global oil trade on the Persian Gulf, would be the ultimate retaliation that could send global oil prices soaring if tensions in the region rise. “Oil could go up $10 a barrel, but it’s all unpredictable,” said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a Houston-based oil service company that operates in Egypt and Iraq. “The Iranians could do anything and go berserk, or they could have cool heads and work with the Europeans and the Russians.” "
"As President Trump took office in early 2017, two corporate behemoths — the Swiss drug maker Novartis and the telecommunications company AT&T — were eager to establish ties to an administration that did not operate in the traditional circles of power. They ended up hiring an unorthodox consultant who promised insights into Mr. Trump’s thinking: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer and longtime fixer. But in the first meeting with Mr. Cohen after he signed as a consultant, Novartis said on Wednesday, the company realized that he would not be able to deliver. Nevertheless, the giant drug company paid him $1.2 million for a one-year contract that ended in February of this year. Similar payments were made by AT&T, which paid a total of about $600,000 to Mr. Cohen’s firm for a yearlong contract, according to a person familiar with the agreement. An aircraft manufacturer, Korea Aerospace Industries, also had a contract with Mr. Cohen’s company. The companies’ payments were revealed on Tuesday after Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump, released some financial details of a company started by Mr. Cohen. Ms. Clifford was paid $130,000 by the company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., to keep quiet about the alleged affair with Mr. Trump. Novartis said Wednesday that it had spoken about the payments to lawyers for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Novartis said that it had cooperated fully, and considered its role in the matter closed. . "
"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a lifelong advocate of Christian education, moved on Wednesday to loosen federal regulations on religious colleges and universities, after a Supreme Court decision that restricted states from denying some kinds of aid to religious institutions. The measure is part of a sweeping deregulatory agenda for the Education Department announced on Wednesday by the White House budget office, which outlined several rules and regulations for the department to scrap or amend. Among those are rules that restrict faith-based entities from receiving federally administered funding. “Various provisions of the department’s regulations regarding eligibility of faith-based entities and activities do not reflect the latest case law regarding religion or unnecessarily restrict religion,” said Liz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman. “The department plans to review and to amend such regulations in order to be more inclusive.” Education Department officials appear to be targeting regulations that would pose a legal risk after the Supreme Court ruled in June that states must sometimes provide aid to faith-based organizations. In the decision, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc. v. Comer, the court ruled that Missouri had engaged in unconstitutional religious discrimination when it denied a church-run preschool publicly funded tire scraps for its playground. Additionally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a memo last fall in which he listed 20 principles that should guide agencies in enforcing federal laws. “Except in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,” Mr. Sessions wrote. “Therefore, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government activity, including employment, contracting and programming.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he expects Iran to continue to comply with the terms of the 2015 deal that limits Tehran’s nuclear program, even as the United States violates it by reimposing what he called “among the strongest sanctions that we’ve ever put on a country.” “I would advise Iran not to start their nuclear program,” Mr. Trump told reporters in a vague warning at the White House, a day after he withdrew the United States from the accord that was brokered between Iran and world powers. Beyond betting that Iran’s leaders will return to the negotiating table, and seek a better deal, once they feel the sanctions’ bite, the president appeared to acknowledge that he has no Plan B for dealing with Tehran. “Iran will come back and say, ‘We don’t want to negotiate,’” Mr. Trump told reporters. “And of course, they’re going to say that. And if I were in their position, I’d say that, too, for the first couple of months: ‘We’re not going to negotiate.’” “But they’ll negotiate, or something will happen,” Mr. Trump said. “And hopefully that won’t be the case.” President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Tuesday that he had instructed his foreign minister to determine if negotiators from European nations, Russia and China could make up for the economic benefits that Iran would lose after the American withdrawal.

"Gina Haspel has shown she has all the qualities to become the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency, except one. For 33 years with the agency, Ms. Haspel has been on the front lines of America’s greatest security challenges, rising from station chief, to deputy director of the clandestine service, to deputy director of the agency. Former bosses and colleagues from both parties praise her leadership and professionalism. What’s prevented her from being a shoo-in for the top job is her role at the center of one of the federal government’s most sickening and indefensible programs, a brutal interrogation regime that used torture against terrorism suspects after the Sept. 11 attacks. It wound down during President George W. Bush’s second term, then was banned by President Barack Obama after stirring domestic and international outrage. In 2002, Ms. Haspel headed a C.I.A. detention facility in Thailand where a suspect linked to Al Qaeda, accused of orchestrating the attack on the American destroyer Cole off the coast of Yemen, was waterboarded and brutalized in other ways. And in 2005, under her boss’s direction, she drafted a cable ordering the agency to destroy more than 90 videotapes of its interrogation of that man. At Ms. Haspel’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, she was pressed on how she now viewed torture and whether she would ever revive the program, even if President Trump ordered her to. That’s a vital concern since he’s spoken of bringing back waterboarding, in which a detained person is doused with buckets of water to the point of near-drowning. “Having served in that tumultuous time,” she said, “I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership, C.I.A. will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.” "

he ritual of Australia’s federal budget, with leaks, a lockup and then a flood of coverage about winners and losers often reminds me of an awards show. It’s the Oscars for fiscal fanatics, politics reporters and a boom-era government that has plenty of money to move around. Last year, I went to Canberra for the festivities. This year I did not, which gave me a chance to focus on one element of the budget announcement: Australia’s relationship to the wider world. A few items that factor into the equation (with figures in Australian dollars): • Intelligence: The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) will receive a funding increase of $24 million for operations, plus $18 million for a legal review, along with $52 million for intelligence oversight. And there’s another undisclosed pool of money for undisclosed activities. • Foreign Aid: Australia’s total aid budget will remain frozen at $4 billion until 2022, and is now at its lowest level ever as a share of the budget — 0.23 percent of gross national income. Aid is also shifting toward the Pacific, with plans to open a new embassy in Tuvalu. • Border Security: Security at airports, international mail centers and air cargo facilities will be strengthened over four years as part of a comprehensive $293.6 million package of new initiatives.

"New Yorkers reacted with revulsion when State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned this week amid allegations he had beaten, choked and threatened to kill women he dated. Albany lawmakers, true to form, saw political opportunity. Assembly Democrats, who have the power to pick Mr. Schneiderman’s replacement, are moving behind closed doors to bump out the supremely qualified acting attorney general, Barbara Underwood, and install New York City’s public advocate, Letitia James. This back-room deal offers dividends to just about everybody except the public the legislators took an oath to serve. Ms. Underwood, who, as state solicitor general, temporarily took over Mr. Schneiderman’s job when he left office, should be allowed to remain in the position until voters choose a permanent replacement in November. Ms. Underwood, a former Yale Law School professor, has decades of experience, has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court and clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. She is more qualified than anyone else whose name has been mentioned. Instead of doing the responsible thing, though, politicians are poised to take advantage of an unexpected vacancy to advance their own political causes. The Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, said Wednesday that he had created a committee to interview candidates to fill the post and was accepting résumés from qualified applicants. Under law, the decision is made by a joint vote of the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Heastie holds sway because his Assembly Democrats would alone be only a handful of votes short of the number needed. "
"After paying off a pornographic film actress and doing other tasks to help his boss win the presidency, Michael D. Cohen was surprised to find that the doors to the White House were mostly closed to him. Mr. Cohen did not land a hoped-for job in President Trump’s administration — he imagined himself as chief of staff — and in January last year he left the Trump Organization, where he had long served as the in-house fixer without a clear portfolio. But he managed to turn what looked like an exile into a lucrative opportunity. Armed with the self-appointed title of “personal attorney” to the president, Mr. Cohen, who had served as a personal-injury lawyer and owned a taxi business, became seen as the man who could help others gain access to the seat of power that had been denied to him. Major corporations including AT&T, Novartis and the law firm Squire Patton Boggs collectively paid him over $2 million for advice about navigating the suddenly foreign terrain of Mr. Trump’s Washington. Most of the arrangements remained a secret until Tuesday, when details first appeared in an account released by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the actress who was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump and is now suing to be released from the agreement. The New York Times confirmed many of Mr. Avenatti’s disclosures through a review of financial records. On Wednesday, additional details emerged. Novartis, the Swiss drug maker, said it had paid Mr. Cohen $1.2 million after he approached the company early last year promising insights into Mr. Trump’s views on health care. AT&T, which has been pursuing a major corporate merger, said it had paid him $600,000 for advice on regulatory matters. "

Here’s the latest: • Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, above, reacted angrily to President Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and hinted at stepping up the country’s nuclear program, prompting a warning from Mr. Trump. European leaders, humiliated by Mr. Trump’s decision, have nevertheless vowed to work with Iran to preserve the deal, while trying to shield E.U. companies doing business there from American sanctions.

On “The Daily” podcast, our White House correspondent looks back at why President Barack Obama signed the deal in 2015. _____ • North Korea freed three American prisoners, in perhaps the most tangible gesture by its leader, Kim Jong-un, to improve relations with the U.S. It was a diplomatic victory for President Trump.

"Frustrated and defiant, his White House dysfunctional, President Trump has been musing about a potentially bold stroke: What if he removed his chief of staff, John Kelly, and replaced him with … no one? The president has already, by many accounts, been ignoring or circumventing Mr. Kelly. He reportedly told friends that, after all, Lyndon B. Johnson didn’t need a chief, so why does he? This is a formula for failure. It is true that President Johnson did not designate any of his aides as first among equals. But Mr. Johnson’s model of governance is completely wrong for the 45th president. Never mind that Mr. Trump, with no governing experience, is nothing like Mr. Johnson, a master legislator of the 20th century. For all his early domestic achievements, Mr. Johnson lost America’s longest war and was driven from office. (This may come as news to a president who reportedly does not read.) Every president since him has learned, sometimes the hard way, that the only thing worse than a White House with a flawed chief of staff is a White House without one. Since Richard Nixon, no president has governed effectively without a chief of staff who could execute his agenda and tell him, when necessary, what he did not want to hear. This has been especially true of “outsider” presidents: Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan — and Mr. Trump. There is nothing in the Constitution about a chief of staff, and early presidents functioned without one. But as the size and complexity of government have grown exponentially, modern presidents need someone to instill discipline, coordinate policy and carry out their agenda. Dwight Eisenhower, who created the position, installed a civilian version of his Army chief of staff: a former New Hampshire governor named Sherman Adams, a gatekeeper so gruff he was known as the “Abominable ‘No’ Man.” But John Kennedy scrapped the position. Determined to be a hands-on president, Mr. Kennedy at first governed according to a model called the “spokes of the wheel,” with a gaggle of top advisers reporting directly to him. It was a mistake. Within months, President Kennedy was embroiled in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. After the debacle, believing his generals had lied to him, he leaned heavily on his brother Bobby as a de facto chief of staff and teller of hard truths. "
"JERUSALEM — Iranian forces in Syria fired about 20 rockets into the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights early Thursday, targeting forward positions of the Israeli military, according to a military spokesman. The spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, said Israel had responded to the attack but did not provide details. If confirmed, this would be the first rocket attack carried out directly by Iran, rather than by one of its proxies, against Israel. Colonel Conricus said that several of the rockets had been intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. He said that he was not aware of any casualties and that damage to Israeli facilities was low. The Israeli military said in a statement that it “views this event with great severity and remains prepared for a wide variety of scenarios.” The Syrian state news agency reported that the country’s air defenses responded to at least two waves of Israeli missile attacks after the strike against the Israeli positions. Israel and Iran have been conducting a shadow war in Syria under the cover of that country’s civil war. As Iran has tried to build up its military capabilities inside Syria, Israel has carried out scores of strikes against what it says are advanced weapons and convoys destined for its enemies in the region. The rocket attack early Thursday appeared to come in response to Israeli strikes on positions in southern Syria on Wednesday. "
"The moment of political reckoning began a day after President Trump’s inauguration, when millions of marchers protested his policies and treatment of women. That outpouring of energy has rippled through elections over the last 16 months, as women have turned out in force to vote — and often to punish the Republican Party. But for Democrats, the process of confronting sexual misconduct in politics has also grown complicated and emotionally fraught. If Mr. Trump’s election ignited this national conflagration, the president himself has largely escaped consequences for his behavior so far. And a number of the politicians exposed as predators and abusers have been men whom the left once viewed with admiration. Mr. Trump and his advisers have reveled openly in the #MeToo-era downfall of prominent Democrats, most recently Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who cast himself as a heroic opponent of Mr. Trump and a crusader for women’s rights. After four women accused him of physical abuse, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s chief political aides, tweeted: “Gotcha.” The White House’s exultation grated on politicians and strategists in both parties, who view Mr. Trump as a fatally compromised messenger on women’s rights. As galling as some Democrats’ hypocrisy may be, a president accused by more than a dozen women of groping and forcible kissing can only make things uncomfortable for his party by engaging in a political tit-for-tat, some Republicans outside the White House say. Amanda Carpenter, a Republican strategist who has been critical of Mr. Trump, said the administration’s gleeful reaction to Mr. Schneiderman’s resignation on Monday had been off key and politically myopic. “There’s no expression of sympathy for those women,” Ms. Carpenter said, referring to Mr. Schneiderman’s accusers. “It’s win-at-all-costs power politics.” But Ms. Carpenter, a former aide to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said voters might not turn to Democrats as an alternative to Mr. Trump unless they do more to inspire confidence. “Democrats keep falling for this fantasy that because Donald Trump’s personal character issues are so awful, that voters will naturally rally to their side,” she said. “You have to give people a reason to rally.” "
"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A day after the first major primary contests of 2018, the political armies on the left and the right repositioned themselves for an intense general election across Rust Belt states that President Trump carried two years ago — and where his personality and record will define the battles leading to the midterms. Three states that voted Tuesday — Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana — were the heart of Trump country in 2016, and the president is moving aggressively to hold onto them; he has already intervened in one Senate race and plans to campaign in another one Thursday. But historically this heartland region was in play for both parties, and Democrats hope it will be again, after earlier two-party contests around the country have seen a wave of disaffected voters reject Republican candidates in places as diverse as suburban Pittsburgh and Tidewater Virginia. Republican strategy is straightforward: The victors on Tuesday heaped praise on Mr. Trump, inviting him to visit their states to campaign, and tarred opponents as “liberals,” while invoking the name “Chuck Schumer,” the New York senator and Democratic leader, as an epithet to hurl at opponents. “You’ve been to this state now four times,” Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate nominee in West Virginia, said in his acceptance speech, addressing the president. “I’d like you to come back as many times as you can between now and November.” The pressure on Mr. Morrisey’s opponent, Senator Joe Manchin III, mounted immediately on Wednesday as an outside group allied with Mr. Trump released an ad urging West Virginians to call Mr. Manchin and demand he vote for Gina Haspel, the White House nominee to lead the C.I.A., who is facing tough questions about the agency’s use of torture on suspected terrorists.

"WASHINGTON — The United States cannot forcibly transfer an American citizen being held in Iraq as an Islamic State suspect to the custody of another country without first proving that he is an enemy combatant, a federal appeals court has ruled. A major decision on presidential war powers and individual rights, the ruling was handed down by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on Monday and unsealed on Wednesday. It rejected the Trump administration’s argument that it has the authority to transfer the man against his will. “We cannot accept the government’s argument,” Judge Sri Srinivasan wrote. “We know of no instance — in the history of the United States — in which the government has taken an American citizen found in one foreign country and forcibly transferred her to the custody of another foreign country.” The man, an American-born dual citizen of Saudi Arabia whose name has not been made public, was captured by a Syrian militia in September and turned over to the American military. The Trump administration wants to transfer the man to another country — apparently Saudi Arabia — but he has objected. However, Judge Srinivasan wrote, if a review were to find that the government is lawfully holding the man as an enemy combatant, that would likely give American officials the legal authority to transfer the man to an ally in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. The man has apparently said he went to Syria to be a journalist and was arrested by the Islamic State, then worked for the group as a condition of being freed from prison. But the government has said it seized Islamic State records that show he registered with the group as a fighter. "
"President Trump on Friday is expected to meet with the chief executives of the world’s major automakers to deliver a pointed message: Get on board with the administration’s plan to dramatically roll back fuel economy requirements, according to interviews with four people close to the administration’s thinking. However, this past Tuesday in House testimony, Mitch Bainwol, the auto industry’s top lobbyist, suggested that the automakers have a different message: They are continuing to urge the Trump administration, he said, “to find a solution that continues to increase fuel efficiency standards.” That sets up an awkward meeting with Mr. Trump. It is a tricky situation of the carmakers’ own making. “He has seen them on his side, and now there is disagreement about how far this should go,” said Myron Ebell, who led the E.P.A. transition team.  The thinking was that “the automakers have succumbed to Stockholm syndrome” in their relationship to environmentalists, Mr. Ebell said. “They now identify with their kidnappers, and need therapy to recover.” The auto industry, embracing Mr. Trump’s promise of a more industry-friendly administration, has lobbied aggressively for a relaxation of the strict Obama-era rules. But the administration ultimately went well beyond what the industry was seeking. The administration’s proposed fuel-economy rollback goes so far, in fact, that California and a dozen other states have said they will retain the stricter rules, threatening to split the United States auto market in two. Automakers are also facing a public backlash over their calls for looser pollution rules: Sierra Club, the environmental group, said this week it had delivered a petition with more than a quarter million signatures opposing the rollback to Ford’s  headquarters.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Pyongyang freed three American prisoners, in perhaps the most tangible gesture by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to improve relations with the U.S. It was a diplomatic victory for President Trump. Mr. Trump said he planned to meet the detainees, all U.S. citizens of Korean descent, seen above on a news broadcast, when they land in the U.S. at 2 a.m. Eastern. He also announced that the time and location had been set for the summit meeting with Mr. Kim, giving only one detail: It will not be at the DMZ.

He hinted at stepping up the country’s nuclear program, citing the need for electricity. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, poised on Friday to unveil his strategy to lower prescription drug prices, has an idea that may not be so popular abroad: Bring down costs at home by forcing higher prices in foreign countries that use their national health systems to make drugs more affordable. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump rebuffed his European allies by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Threatened tariffs on steel and aluminum have strained relations with other developed nations. And now the administration is suggesting policies that could hit the pocketbooks of some of America’s strongest allies. “We’re going to be ending global freeloading,” Mr. Trump declared at a meeting with drug company executives in his first month in office. Foreign price controls, he said, reduce the resources that American drug companies have to finance research and develop new cures. The White House Council of Economic Advisers fleshed out the idea three months ago in a report that deplored the “underpricing of drugs in foreign countries.” The council said that profit margins on brand-name drugs in the United States were four times as high as those in the more regulated markets of major European countries and Japan. The United States, it said, needs to “address the root of the problem: foreign, developed nations, that can afford to pay for novel drugs, free-ride by setting drug prices at unfairly low levels, leaving American patients to pay for the innovation that foreign patients enjoy.” Mr. Trump plans to lay out his ideas on Friday. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in a speech on Wednesday that the administration would attack several problems, including high list prices set by drug manufacturers; rising out-of-pocket costs for consumers; and “foreign governments free-riding off of American investment in innovation.” "
"WAR ON PEACE
The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence
By Ronan Farrow
Illustrated. 392 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95. In 2010, just before Thanksgiving, American foreign-policy makers flew into a panic. The United States government had gotten word that an outfit called WikiLeaks was preparing to release an enormous cache of secret diplomatic cables, in coordination with teams of journalists from this and other newspapers. At the time, I was a policy hand in the State Department. It fell to me and my colleagues to dutifully craft apologies on behalf of our bosses, whose sensitive communications and private insults — speculation about, say, a foreign leader’s mental aptitude or mysterious wealth — were about to become public. They, meanwhile, confronted weightier concerns, scrambling to anticipate the coming fallout. Would missions and sources be compromised? Would activists be exposed to persecution? Would anyone ever talk to American officials again? Almost no one, however, anticipated what would prove to be one of the more lasting consequences of the leak: surprised admiration for American diplomats. “My personal opinion of the State Department has gone up several notches,” the British historian and journalist Timothy Garton Ash wrote. He compared one veteran ambassador’s prose to Evelyn Waugh’s, and deemed other analyses “astute,” “unsentimental” and “hilarious.” Beneath their “dandruffy” exteriors, he concluded after browsing the classified offerings, these diplomats were sharper, and funnier, than they looked. Ronan Farrow aims to achieve a similar effect in “War on Peace.” At a time when the Trump administration has called for gutting the State Department’s budget and filled foreign-policy jobs with military officers, Farrow draws on both government experience and fresh reporting to offer a lament for the plight of America’s diplomats — and an argument for why it matters. “Classic, old-school diplomacy,” he observes, is “frustrating” and involves “a lot of jet lag.” Yet his wry voice and storytelling take work that is often grueling and dull and make it seem, if not always exciting, at least vividly human. A Foreign Service officer’s hairstyle is “diplomat’s mullet: peace in the front, war in the back”; an Afghan strongman’s choice of décor is “warlord chic,” with “leatherette La-Z-Boy recliners” and “a giant tank full of sharks.” With his knack for getting high-level, on-the-record access — he recently shared a Pulitzer Prize for his New Yorker reporting on Harvey Weinstein’s abuses — Farrow managed to interview every living secretary of state, up to and including Rex Tillerson, in his waning days presiding over a department “increasingly unmanned and cut down to size.” In a sense, Farrow is telling a story with a well-known ending but a surprise beginning. Much has been made of Trump’s disregard for diplomats. But the disproportionate flow of resources to military and intelligence solutions has been going on much longer, at least since 9/11. “In many of America’s engagements around the world,” Farrow argues, “military alliances have now eclipsed the kind of civilian diplomacy that once counterbalanced them, with disastrous results.” He traces those results through fights over Afghanistan strategy, as well as through less prominent policy debates — like the case of a massacre by an American-backed Afghan militant (currently serving as his country’s vice president). "
"Relatives of Americans imprisoned in Iran implored the Trump administration on Wednesday not to forget their loved ones, whose fates may have just become murkier now that the United States has quit the nuclear accord. Their angst was further complicated by word that three Americans incarcerated by North Korea had been freed. While happy over that news, some worried that President Trump’s decision to abandon the nuclear agreement would antagonize the Iranian authorities, dimming any prospects of prisoner releases in Iran anytime soon. Mr. Trump’s success at securing the freedom of North Korea’s prisoners, and failure so far to do the same in Iran, underscored the complexities of the estranged American relations with the two countries, which have vexed successive White House administrations for decades. At least five American citizens — four of them dual citizens of the United States and Iran — are known to be incarcerated in Iranian prisons. Babak Namazi, whose father and brother, both American citizens, have been serving 10-year prison sentences in Iran on vaguely defined espionage charges since October 2016, said in a telephone news conference that he had met with two high-level White House officials to emphasize the family’s concern. “I was assured that the administration continues to treat my family and other hostage cases with high priority,” Mr. Namazi said. “All that matters to me is the safe and immediate return of my family.” "
"Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general who resigned this week after four women accused him of assault, was one of the most active state-level opponents of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations. He was also the first attorney general to open an investigation into Exxon Mobil’s climate policies and statements. Most of Mr. Schneiderman’s environmental initiatives will almost certainly continue without him, in New York and other states. But a prominent figure in the legal fight against climate change has left the arena, and his eventual replacement could set different priorities. Beginning the day before President Trump took office — when Mr. Schneiderman filed a motion with five other state attorneys general to protect an Obama-era rule on air pollution that crosses state borders — the office of the New York attorney general has led or taken part in dozens of legal actions, including lawsuits, that opposed Washington’s deregulatory wave. The State Energy and Environmental Impact Center of the New York University School of Law has counted 55 actions by New York during the Trump era, more than any other state but California, which also has 55. The lawsuits and other legal filings, brought largely by attorneys general in blue states, follow a range of similar suits filed by conservative counterparts during the Obama administration. Scott Pruitt, now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, achieved a level of prominence as Oklahoma’s attorney general by filing 14 lawsuits against the agency he now leads. Among the actions taken by Mr. Schneiderman’s office: While none have worked their way through the entire judicial process, these legal sorties have scored a half-dozen early court victories, often based on claims that the Trump administration, with its rather chaotic approach to rule making, has committed violations under the Administrative Procedures Act.

"DALLAS — The objects themselves — machined steel barrels, lathed brass casings, cast lead slugs — are functional and practical, designed for maximum efficiency, be it in shooting targets, animals or human beings. They are more than that though. The guns and weapons parts on display at the N.R.A. convention in Dallas last weekend represent ingrained ideals of this country’s identity, a nation forged an hardened by wars. Firearms were not the most common accessory among the 75,000-odd attendees. That honor went to Old Glory. The flag was emblazoned on T-shirts and caps, incorporated into outfits, printed on backpacks and purses, pinned through lapels, tattooed in skin, and painted on walls, signs and guns. The portion of the country that demands strict gun control often just sees the gun. Another portion sees firearms as indivisible from its very sense of self. "
President Trump said on Tuesday that he will withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal. He promised that he will get a better deal that will also control Iran’s ballistic missiles and its regional influence. 
"WASHINGTON — Ohio primary voters selected establishment candidates on Tuesday for the next big test of the Democrats’ promised “blue wave,” a House special election this August in the suburbs of Columbus that could indicate just how strong Democrats will be in November with college-educated, affluent voters. After winning a six-way primary in central Ohio on Tuesday, Danny O’Connor, 31, a Franklin County official, will ask voters to send him to Congress on Aug. 7 to fill the House seat vacated by a long-serving Republican, Pat Tiberi. The special election, which will take place 13 weeks before Election Day, will offer clues of Democratic strength, particularly on the kind of suburban terrain that will be critical in numerous races this fall as Democrats try to wrest control of the House. Mr. Tiberi’s seat in the Columbus area has hardly been a swing district: It has been in Republican hands since 1983, when his predecessor, John R. Kasich, now Ohio’s governor, began his first term. But Democratic candidates in special elections for vacant House seats in more forbidding territory — including Arizona, southwestern Pennsylvania and South Carolina — have performed strongly since President Trump’s inauguration. And the makeup of the Ohio district suggests it could be fertile ground for a competitive — and expensive — race. Most of the recent special House elections in Republican seats have built up steam until an Election Day that has garnered remarkable attention, even in seats where the Democrat had little shot. The Tiberi seat is likely to be no different. “If I was the Republican Party, I’d be pretty concerned about it,” said Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio. Voters were fond of Mr. Tiberi, he said, but he predicted that Mr. O’Connor could win over people repelled by the “constant chaos” and “demeaning nature” of the Trump presidency. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Abandons Iran Pact He Long Scorned” (front page, May 9): The aftermath of President Trump’s announcement of his ill-advised withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal is proving to be even more concerning than the lead-up to it. Our allies and many Americans are appropriately worried that, other than sanctions, there is no “Plan B” in the nuclear realm. This validates what is increasingly alarming — that we have at the helm a president whose singular mission is to disengage from the established international order, especially that which is associated with his predecessor. As with the Paris climate accord and trade agreements, President Trump no doubt has found it easy to disengage. What to do next requires a vision that he surely lacks. ROGER HIRSCHBERG
BONDVILLE, VT. To the Editor: Re “Where’s That Better Deal?” (editorial, May 9): You write that President Trump is “reneging” on the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran. What he has done is exercise his clear authority to disavow an agreement of a prior administration, which it acknowledged to be nonbinding, that he believes endangers national security interests. President Barack Obama knew that he had no hope of winning the two-thirds Senate vote required for ratification of a treaty; indeed, the agreement was opposed by bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress. He therefore conveniently characterized the deal as an “executive agreement” that did not require congressional approval, even by a simple majority. There is accordingly no basis to claim that a new executive should not have reviewed an imprudent “executive agreement” made by his predecessor. And in view of the agreement’s failure to provide for “anytime, anywhere” inspections, its allowance of continued development of ballistic missiles, and the “sunset” provisions that begin voiding restrictions on Iran in 10 years, withdrawing from the agreement was clearly warranted. "
"WASHINGTON — The release of three American prisoners cleared away a last obstacle on Wednesday to a landmark nuclear summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. North Korea freed the prisoners, all Americans of Korean descent, even as the two countries finalized details for a meeting between their leaders. The move was North Korea’s most tangible gesture aimed at improving relations with the United States since Mr. Trump took office. The resolution of the prisoner standoff hardly guaranteed success at the meeting, which will grapple with the far more complicated issues of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, divisions on the peninsula and security in Asia. But American officials said it sent another signal that North Korea may be serious about ending its long confrontation with the United States and its allies after nearly seven decades of mutual antagonism. Mr. Trump exulted over the release and publicly entertained talk that he could even win a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomacy. He was so eager to associate himself with the freed prisoners that he decided to personally travel to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington in the middle of the night to welcome them back to the United States, something other presidents have not typically done in similar circumstances. “Nobody thought this was going to happen, and if it did, it would be years or decades, frankly,” Mr. Trump said at the White House shortly after they were released. “Nobody thought this was going to happen. And I appreciate Kim Jong-un for doing this and allowing them to go.” The three were handed over to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who made a second visit to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to lock down details of the upcoming meeting between the president and Mr. Kim. Mr. Trump said it would not be held in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, as he had earlier suggested, and speculation centered on Singapore, a neutral site that has better facilities and is close to North Korea. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Pyongyang freed three American prisoners, removing a bitterly emotional obstacle ahead of a planned summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Mr. Trump said the detainees, all U.S. citizens of Korean descent, were on their way back to the U.S. with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, above, who offered an olive branch to senior North Korean officials during his short visit. But en route he committed the gaffe of referring to Mr. Kim as “Chairman Un.” Mr. Trump also announced that the time and location had been set for his meeting with Mr. Kim, giving only one detail: It will not be at the DMZ. The talks may suffer from Mr. Trump’s decision to exit the Iran nuclear accord if, as many analysts think, the takeaway is that the U.S. is an untrustworthy negotiating partner. _____ • Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reacted angrily to President Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and hinted at stepping up the country’s nuclear program, citing the need for electricity. President Hassan Rouhani said, “Everything depends on our national interests.” "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump mused about brokering peace between North and South Korea during a recent campaign rally, the chants from his supporters rumbled through the Michigan sports complex: “Nobel. Nobel.” For Mr. Trump, who has toggled with unsettling ease between volatile threats of “fire and fury” and impassioned calls for peace, the possibility of receiving a Nobel Peace Prize once seemed far-fetched. (The committee that awards the prize said this year that a nomination for him had been forged  twice, by an unknown perpetrator whose motives remain a mystery.) But the idea of his 2019 nomination, formally submitted by a group of 18 House Republicans and heartily endorsed by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, has started to take root among his supporters over the past few weeks as his own potentially historic summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea looms. “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” Mr. Trump said with a laugh on Wednesday when asked if he deserved the prize. “The prize I want is victory for the world.” Critics of the president and his often inflammatory rhetoric balk at the idea of Mr. Trump receiving one of the world’s most prestigious diplomatic awards. But some laureates and historians of the prize acknowledge that there are instances where such an honor was bestowed on contentious politicians in order to acknowledge and encourage efforts for peace. “Part of the strength of the Nobel Peace Prize is that it is controversial,” said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the prize after roughly eight months of deliberation over hundreds of nominations. “If it was a global consensus prize, it wouldn’t have the relevance and the authority that it actually has today.” "
"Our question for today is: What do Tuesday night’s primary results mean to you? A) Really going to miss that exploding-mine guy in West Virginia. B) Should be exciting matchups this fall! C) Primary what? Hey, I know you’re concerned citizens who are worried about who controls the House and Senate next year. Even so, it’s possible you did not feel compelled to follow every single race. Except maybe the one in West Virginia featuring Don Blankenship, the guy who served a year in jail for conspiring to break mine safety rules after an explosion killed 29 people. The Republican Party was terrified voters would race out to support this guy. Why do you think they were so worried? The polling was pretty hazy. Yet political professionals seemed to feel there was a danger of a stampede toward Mr. Mine Disaster. Who was also actually a resident of Nevada. Mitch McConnell was a nervous wreck and even Donald Trump got in the stop-Blankenship movement. Maybe the Democratic incumbent, Senator Joe Manchin, could run on a “Republicans think West Virginians are imbeciles” campaign. Manchin is high on the list of endangered red-state Democrats, and many of his supporters were rooting for Blankenship, figuring it would be easy to beat a crazy guy with terrible business ethics and a gift for pandering to the lowest possible denominator. However strategic this kind of thinking is, I want you to remember how it worked out with Trump. West Virginians came through, however low the bar might have been. Blankenship lost. The race cost him an estimated $100 a vote, one of the most pathetic showings since Rudy Giuliani ran for president and spent $110 per vote in the process of winning nothing whatsoever. "
"WASHINGTON — Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, defended the agency’s torture of terrorism suspects as her confirmation hearing on Wednesday served as another reckoning of the extraordinary measures the government employed in the frantic hunt for the Sept. 11 conspirators. Ms. Haspel, a 33-year C.I.A. veteran who oversaw a secret prison in Thailand in 2002 while a Qaeda suspect was waterboarded there, said that she and other spies were working within the law. Though the C.I.A. should never resume that type of work, she said, its officers should also not be judged for doing it. “I’m not going to sit here, with the benefit of hindsight, and judge the very good people who made hard decisions, who were running the agency in very extraordinary circumstances,” she told the Senate Intelligence Committee. But poised to take over the agency, Ms. Haspel vowed that she would not start another interrogation program like the one developed under President George W. Bush after 9/11 while the United States was actively trying to thwart terrorist plots. It involved brutal techniques like waterboarding detainees, dousing them with ice water, forcing them to stay awake for as long as a week and subjecting some to medically unnecessary rectal feeding. “Having served in that tumultuous time,” she said, “I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership, C.I.A. will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.” Ms. Haspel, 61, appeared headed for confirmation after two senators considered swing votes — Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican — said later on Wednesday that they would support her.

"To the Editor: Re “Releasing Three, North Koreans Signal Openness” (front page, May 10): President Trump is treating the prisoners released by North Korea as heroes. Many of us remember when Mr. Trump declared that Senator John McCain was “not a war hero” because he had been captured after his plane was shot down over North Vietnam. It looks as if the significant difference for Mr. Trump is not the distinction between political versus combat prisoners, but whether he got to play a role in their release. ROBERT AMSTERDAM, NEW YORK "
"President Trump was undoubtedly happy to learn on Monday of the shocking accusations against, and rapid resignation by, New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. He was a longtime adversary of Mr. Trump, both rhetorically and in the courts. But more than that, Mr. Schneiderman’s former office is a key part of the backup scenario of state prosecutors taking over should Mr. Trump shut down federal investigations into him and his associates. That fail-safe has now suffered a blow. While Mr. Schneiderman’s resignation was the only appropriate response to the appalling claims against him, consideration of this backup plan is critical as the New York Legislature considers an interim replacement. It’s not just about getting a good lawyer in the job; it’s about finding the person with the right mix of prosecuting experience and constitutional law expertise. There are a variety of ways that Mr. Trump might seek to frustrate the federal investigations: He could have the special counsel, Robert Mueller, fired. Or he could fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mr. Mueller’s investigation as well as the one into Mr. Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen. If Mr. Rosenstein were removed and replaced with a Trump crony, that individual could choke off both. Or the president could issue broad pardons for himself and his associates. It is in response to this last strategy that the New York attorney general comes in: Mr. Trump’s authority to pardon “offenses against the United States” does not extend to state crimes. Mr. Cohen’s situation is instructive, as we explain in a new paper about the possible pardon strategy. Press accounts suggest federal prosecutors are looking at whether he may have misled his lender in connection with borrowing funds to make the $130,000 payment to the performer Stormy Daniels. That could, if proven, constitute federal bank or wire fraud. But his main place of business is in New York, and the New York State penal code also governs the financing aspect of Mr. Cohen’s actions. It specifically prohibits fraud in refinancing or modifying residential mortgage loans. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump, exulting in the release of three Americans from prison in North Korea, confirmed Thursday that he would meet Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, in Singapore on June 12, setting the date for a once unimaginable encounter. The choice of Singapore, a tidy, prosperous city-state with ties to both the United States and North Korea, is a small victory for Mr. Trump’s advisers, who talked him out of meeting Mr. Kim in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea — a far more symbolic, but politically problematic, location. “We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!” Mr. Trump said in a midmorning post on Twitter, hours after he traveled in the middle of the night to Joint Base Andrews near Washington to greet the three men: Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song. North Korea’s release of the Americans lifted a major obstacle to the summit meeting. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has taken charge of the diplomatic opening to the North, finalized its date and location during a 90-minute meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. Afterward, Mr. Pompeo left with the detainees on his plane. For Mr. Trump, basking in the glow of floodlights and TV cameras, it was a jubilant moment as he descended the steps of the aircraft with the three Americans, who flashed peace signs. But he acknowledged that the most difficult phase of the negotiations — persuading North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons arsenal — lies ahead. “We’re starting off on a new footing,” he said. “I think he did this because I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.” "
"The Republican Party has celebrated itself for nearly 50 years as the “law and order” party. But in the past month, a disconnect has grown between the rule of law and the party. Vice President Mike Pence recently praised the former sheriff Joe Arpaio — who was found guilty of criminal contempt of court for ignoring a judicial order — as a champion of the rule of law, comments that unfolded as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein battled a caucus of Republican House members, led by Mark Meadows, who seem focused on destroying the separation of powers as they seek to undermine the Justice Department’s independent investigation of the White House. In rare public remarks, Mr. Rosenstein issued a strong rebuke to such efforts, which included talk of impeaching him. “The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,” he said. These Republican assaults — and others, like Rudy Giuliani’s comparing F.B.I. agents to “storm troopers” over last month’s raid of Michael Cohen’s office and residence — on the traditions of the rule of law have not gone unnoticed by people like James Comey, a lifelong Republican. He recently said that Republicans “don’t represent anything I believe in.” “I’m shocked, disappointed and disgusted,” he added. “I don’t know what it stands for honestly, and it’s going to have to answer those questions.” Mr. Comey explained that when he first identified with the party in the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan, he was attracted to the notion that character mattered, and said that “values matter most of all — that’s where you start in evaluating a person, an entity or a country.” The disillusion of Mr. Comey and comments like Mr. Rosenstein’s are clear indications of how the Republican Party is no longer the conservative party and no longer the party of Mr. Reagan’s conservative vision — a values-based, anti-Russia, law-and-order, constitutionalist philosophy, empowered by global alliances abroad and grounded at home in checks and balances that ensure government won’t overstep its bounds.

"For months, the Trump administration has rightfully been trying to thwart attempts by some European governments to impose a new corporate “digital tax” on American high-tech giants. This campaign to block internet-inspired extraterritorial taxation — taxation of income earned outside of a jurisdiction — is strongly supported by the American business community. But the White House, in an odd twist that turns its European Union digital tax arguments upside down, just argued before the Supreme Court that the same kind of extraterritorial taxation is acceptable when carried out by American states on retail sales on the internet. Does the left hand of the Trump administration know what the right hand is doing on internet-related tax policy? Are American corporate leaders who have ignored the issue of internet sales taxes about to suffer a key setback in relation to the European Union tax grab? And does sound tax policy go out the window if the president seems to think Amazon is in the cross hairs? The implications of tax policy for internet business models is important: Many enterprises, large and small, are adopting a range of internet-enabled services. Good principles of taxation are the same at the state, national and international levels. They include the idea that each state or country has carte blanche to tax income, sales and whatever else it wants within its borders (as long as its taxpayers are O.K. with the burden), but they should not step on the toes of other political jurisdictions by taxing activity that happens across the border. Given the eternal lure of governments to tax people who can’t remove them from office (remember the old “No taxation without representation” mantra?), this is a timeless concern. This is the issue at the heart of the Supreme Court case South Dakota v. Wayfair, a multibillion-dollar retailer with no physical facilities in South Dakota that is using the internet to serve South Dakota customers. If South Dakota were to win this case, extraterritorial taxation would be allowed by states. Retailers would be forced to abide by every state’s in-state sales tax laws regardless of whether they have any in-state business operations. This has been a goal of states for over 50 years, and it’s the third time the issue has reached the Supreme Court. The result of the last visit, in 1992, is referred to in tax circles as the Quill decision. State governments want to see Quill overturned because they’re eager to collect more sales tax revenues to balance their books instead of cutting spending. The desire to tax out-of-state businesses has been consistent over the decades, but the pitch is now that the internet changes everything. It makes doing business over large distances too easy, some argue, so government shouldn’t be constrained by outdated considerations like borders and geographical business locations. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Spend some time reading political writers on Twitter, and you may come across “Dems in disarray.” It’s become something of a joke among certain political analysts — a reference to the fact that pundits almost always say that the Democrats are in shambles. The joke appears to date from a 2005 “West Wing” episode that included a (fictional) cover of Time magazine with the phrase. It received new life thanks to a March 2006 New Yorker piece by Hendrik Hertzberg, the first two paragraphs of which each began, ironically: “The Democrats are in disarray.” Sure enough, those disarrayed Democrats retook the House of Representatives later that year. The idea lives on in the Trump era. The contemporary versions of it include: Progressive activists are pulling the party too far to the left. The Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren wing of the party is at war with the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama wing. And the party lacks any strong leaders or strong 2020 presidential contenders. My advice is to channel Hertzberg and to view all the angst skeptically. The Democrats are by no means assured of retaking the House or the Senate in November. To do so, they will need to win a lot of tough races this year. But so far, the party is doing almost exactly what it needs to be doing. (As for 2020, there is still plenty of time for leaders to emerge.) "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) One day, it was at an intersection not far from the Veteran Affairs hospital in Westwood. “What does that man’s sign say?” she asked from her car seat. A couple of weeks later, she asked about the woman I handed a $1 bill to outside my car. Not long after that, as we got off the freeway near Venice, she spotted them before I did: “Mommy, why are there are those tents there?” she said, pointing to a grassy clearing near the off-ramp. I do not try to shield my two young children from seeing the homeless people we pass as we go about our lives in Los Angeles. And I always try to answer the many questions that come from my kids, ages 3 and 5. Still, every time I try to explain why people are homeless and what we can do about it, I find myself worrying that I am doing it all wrong. Last month, a young couple set up a tent on a corner two blocks from our home, which means my children pass it daily on the way to and from school. The kids have asked about it almost every time we see it: Why do they have a dog? How did they buy the tent? Where do they cook the food they’re eating? Even when I’m flummoxed by the questions, I silently hope that they keep coming. I do not want them to become inured to the sight of people sleeping on sidewalks, under freeway overpasses and on bus stop benches. We’ve packed bags filled with toiletries for the homeless, along with many other young families from our school. But most of us are reluctant to take our children to deliver them. As one friend put it: “I am worried about what the impact of seeing thousands upon thousands of homeless people on Skid Row will do to my already anxious 10-year-old.” Another friend said she tried to always carry food in the car, so that her children can point out someone they think who might need help, offering them toothbrushes and bandages that they carry as well. With the homelessness crisis all over the state, other parents must be grappling with the same issues. Are you having these conversations with your children?

Everybody is afraid to make that wrong choice, but the truth is, no matter what choice it is, if you get behind it 100 percent it becomes the right choice.” — Jerry Blevins, relief pitcher for the Mets “If you’re not scared of your job, get a new job. Those butterflies in your stomach are a sign that you’re on the right path, that you’re taking on challenges that will force you to grow. But keep in mind the limits of professional success.

"The July 2015 nuclear deal officially ended Iran’s isolation and economic punishment, but the comprehensive sanctions that the country had endured for nearly a decade continued to take a toll. Those sanctions have profoundly damaged the Iranian economy. The government — hemmed in by domestic opposition and its own corruption — has done little to repair it. There have been encouraging signs of life since the nuclear deal, but they turned out to be short-lived. President Trump announced on Tuesday that he would withdraw from the nuclear agreement and reinstate sanctions that had been lifted as part of it. This is not just a potentially fatal blow to the accord between Iran and five world powers. It is a damaging blow to average Iranians. The only beneficiaries here will be the hard-liners in government and the corrupt elite. The news on Tuesday wasn’t a surprise. Since his campaign, Mr. Trump has expressed a strong, irrational distaste for the nuclear deal. In March, when he appointed John Bolton, who has called for regime change in Iran, as his national security adviser, it was clear which direction things were headed. Iran has been divided over the nuclear deal. The elites have reacted with either steely reserve or fiery anger. Vice president Eshaq Jahangiri said that Mr. Bolton’s appointment “will change nothing in Iran.” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Mr. Trump’s moves “shallow and ridiculous.” Members of Parliament burned an American flag. But among most people — average Iranians — the news elicited feelings of bitterness and resignation. At dinner tables and in bakery lines and taxi pools, people across Iran are discussing their traumatic memories of life under punishing sanctions. Iranians now experience the disturbing prospect of crippling inflation, budget cuts, delayed payments and shortages of basic goods, especially imported medication upon which many lives depend. "

"Should taxes on households making $250,000 or more a year be raised? When you ask Democrats this question, you get a very interesting answer: Those on the bottom of the income distribution appear to want lower taxes on high earners than those on the top do. Among Democrats making less than $30,000, 48 percent say yes; among those making more than $75,000, 68 percent do, according to data provided to The Times by Bridget Johnson of the Pew Research Center. Among Democrats with high school degrees, 48 percent say yes; among those with college degrees, it’s 71 percent. Separately, John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, found in a January 2018 YouGov survey that 87 percent of Democrats from households making more than $120,000 annually support a tax hike on rich households. Two questions present themselves: Why are well-off Democrats the most supportive of policies seemingly adverse to their own interests? And, most important, how reliable is elite support for this redistributive agenda?

"Last week at a conference in Miami, the director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council, Juan Cruz, took aim at the regime of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. Mr. Cruz cited part of the Venezuelan Constitution, drafted under Mr. Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chávez, that says the people “shall disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates the values, principles and democratic guarantees or encroaches upon human rights.” He was directing his comments at the Venezuelan military, imploring its members to honor their commitment to the Constitution. As when Rex Tillerson made similar statements in February as secretary of state, Mr. Cruz’s critics said that it was unwise for Washington to encourage a coup d’état. But Mr. Cruz is merely facing facts. Mr. Maduro holds his power through the systematic violation of human rights and constitutional order, which has brought on an economic and social collapse and a refugee crisis that is affecting the whole continent. A regime steeped in corruption and narcotrafficking, whose violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 and 2017 left 200 dead and thousands injured, will never cede power voluntarily. Rather than fear a coup, the international community should encourage all Venezuelans — including soldiers — to restore democracy. "
"Before the next two months are out, the Supreme Court will decide two high-visibility cases that at first glance appear to have little to do with each other. One is the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, about the baker who won’t design a cake for celebrating a same-sex marriage, and the other is Trump v. Hawaii, the challenge to the president’s latest travel ban. One is as domestic as it gets, while the other is infused with issues of foreign policy and presidential power. What they have in common is the claim of religious discrimination at the heart of each. Does Colorado’s public accommodations law, which covers sexual orientation, make the unwilling baker a modern-day Christian martyr for his refusal to create and sell what he regards as his art to celebrate a union that he thinks is unholy? Does a travel ban that applies to citizens of five overwhelmingly Muslim countries, issued by a president who has made abundantly clear his desire to keep Muslims out of the United States, amount to religious discrimination in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause? I recognize that placing these cases in a religious-discrimination frame obscures their many distinct complexities. The Masterpiece case, at least on the surface, is primarily about free speech; the justices have to grapple with the nature of the baker’s “expression” before they can get to the question of whether being required to bake the wedding cake would unconstitutionally coerce him to express sentiments that violate his religious beliefs. In the travel ban case, the court will surely be attentive to the claims about national security and presidential prerogative that are the administration’s principal defense. Described in this way, the link between the two cases is submerged. My point here is not to offer a full-dress analysis of the cases, but rather to suggest that the imminent decisions will tell us a lot about how the current court thinks about religion — specifically, how it defines religious discrimination and who it thinks needs the court’s protection. Classically, the Supreme Court invoked the religion clauses of the First Amendment — the protection for free exercise and the prohibition against government “establishment” of religion — on behalf of minority religions. Rulings on behalf of Jehovah’s Witnesses who wouldn’t salute the flag, Amish parents who wouldn’t send their children to high school and non-Christians who objected to organized prayer in public school form the backbone of the First Amendment canon. But in recent years, the court’s concern has flipped. Four years ago, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, the court gave its approval to the regular inclusion of Christian prayer at town meetings. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s majority opinion suggested that anyone who took offense was just being thin-skinned. The Hobby Lobby case that same year marked the court’s emerging view of Christians as victims of an overbearing government and, by extension, of an insensitively secular society. The Hobby Lobby decision, holding that the religious owner of a privately held for-profit corporation couldn’t be required to cover birth control in his employees’ health plan, was based on the court’s interpretation of a statute, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, rather than on the Constitution itself. But the opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., with its solicitude for the business owner’s far-fetched claim that he would be complicit in sin if his employees were to make use of their federally mandated benefit, clearly reflected the majority’s First Amendment sensitivities.

"WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain wasn’t interested in getting the last word on his decades at the center of American political life. He was interested in getting thousands of them. In a new 380-page memoir written as he confronts brain cancer and his mortality, the occasionally ornery maverick Republican from Arizona looks back on a series of major episodes from both his own history and the United States’. He recounts his presidential runs, his leading roles in fights over immigration, campaign finance, health care and foreign policy. He takes a few shots at President Trump, talk radio “blowhards” and House backbenchers. He says he would like Americans to “recover our sense that we are more alike than different.” True to his nature, John McCain is not one to go quietly. “It should be required reading for anyone who wants to lead in a democracy,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and Mr. McCain’s best friend in the Senate. He sees the book as a call to arms around the idea that “America’s values make us better than our enemies.” Mr. Graham visited Mr. McCain on Tuesday in Arizona, where they watched their favorite western, one that features an idealistic senator: “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.” Mr. Graham found Mr. McCain upbeat and gaining strength. “I hope he has another run in him,” said Mr. Graham, reflecting a sentiment shared widely in Washington.

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Eric Schneiderman, New York’s former attorney general, may have been a longtime champion of women’s rights, but he now stands accused of beating and verbally abusing multiple women. After hearing the accusations against him, Samantha Bee said that she didn’t feel at all conflicted about condemning the onetime liberal darling. Schneiderman’s willingness to take on domestic abusers in the political sphere didn’t make Bee any less ready to bid him good riddance. Bee also revisited the sexual-misconduct accusations against prominent men in the news media and entertainment worlds. Eventually she got to Charlie Rose — who was recently said to be considering hosting a comeback television show that focuses on accused men. Ms. Bee revealed that she had experienced his sexual oversteps firsthand, saying that he had planted an unwanted kiss on her lips before she appeared on his show years ago. She also made fun of Rose for the skimpy attire that some former female employees said he wore around them. News surfaced on Tuesday that Michael Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer, had sold access to Trump and insights into the president’s thinking to private companies for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The companies included some with ties to Russian oligarchs. Meanwhile, the shell company that received the payments was the same one that Cohen used to send hush money to Stephanie Clifford — also known as Stormy Daniels — on Trump’s behalf. "
"No books were harmed in the making of this motion picture. There will be no such disclaimer at the end of my new film, because we burned a lot of books. We designed powerful, kerosene-spitting flamethrowers and torched books — en masse. This was not easy for me to do. I was taught at a very young age to read and respect books. Even setting a teacup on a book was considered a sin. In my parents’ household, Hafez’s book of Persian poetry, “The Divan,” was revered like a religious text. But now I was making a film adaptation of Ray Bradbury’s seminal novel, “Fahrenheit 451,” which presents a future America where books are outlawed and firemen burn them. The protagonist, a fireman named Guy Montag, begins to doubt his actions and turns against his mentor, Captain Beatty. When I set out to adapt the novel early in 2016, I was faced with a big question: Do people still care about physical books? I asked an 82-year-old friend for advice. “Go ahead and burn books,” he said. “They mean nothing to me. I can read anything on my tablet, from the ‘Epic of Gilgamesh’ to Jo Nesbo, and I can read them in bed, on a plane or next to the ocean, because it’s all in the cloud, safe from your firemen’s torches.” If he felt this way, what would teenagers think? Bradbury’s novel is a classic taught in high schools across America. But the more I thought about it, the more relevant the novel seemed. For Bradbury, books were repositories of knowledge and ideas. He feared a future in which those things would be endangered, and now that future was here: The internet and new social-media platforms — and their potential threat to serious thought — would be at the heart of my adaptation. I had never adapted a book, let alone one so important. Altering a work so brilliant and beloved always upsets some fans. I knew Bradbury had supported François Truffaut’s 1966 film adaptation. More important, Bradbury himself had reimagined “Fahrenheit 451,” first as a stage play and then as a musical, changing many elements, including letting Montag’s neighbor Clarisse McClellan live. (In the novel, she dies early on.) With Bradbury as my guide, and a vow to stay true to his ideas, I began working on the script. “Fahrenheit 451” was written in the early 1950s, not long after Nazis burned books and, eventually, human beings. America was living under a cloud of fear created by the House Un-American Activities Committee and McCarthyism, which brought political repression, blacklists and censorship of literature and art. These anxieties permeate the novel. "
"CONNEAUT LAKE, Pa. — The next stop on Kathy Rentz’s mission to rescue American democracy was the Pizza Hut on Route 322. In a drably lit room in the back, more than a dozen people were already gathered, huddling over cheese sticks, pitchers of Diet Pepsi and maps of state legislative districts. The subject was how to end gerrymandering. The meeting opened with a brief talk about how parties in control — Republicans, in Pennsylvania’s case — draw districts to lock in power. But it quickly turned to political tactics. Should they hand out fliers at the upcoming food festival? Better to go to a stubborn lawmaker’s office in shifts or all at once? Ms. Rentz offered her counsel. “I think,” she said, “we’ve got to pester the life out of these people.” For most of her 74 years, Ms. Rentz was a mildly attentive Republican; since retiring eight years ago as a high school French teacher, she was content to spend her time gardening, knitting and spoiling her grandchildren. Now she is the kind of person who writes “Not For Trump’s Golf Trips” across her federal tax return. She leaves a plastic bin filled with canvassing paperwork outside her front door in case fellow activists are looking for something to do. At candidate forums in V.F.W. halls 45 minutes from her home, there in the back sits Ms. Rentz. “I’d really like to go down to Philadelphia for my grandkids’ piano recitals,” she said. But all this, she continued, “is now my job.” "
"In September, the United States banned American travelers from visiting North Korea. But a perceived thaw in relations after the release of three Americans imprisoned in North Korea and news of negotiations for talks between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has revived industry hopes for a corresponding travel rapprochement. The ban followed the death in June of Otto F. Warmbier, an American student who was jailed in North Korea for trying to steal a political propaganda poster from his hotel in Pyongyang. Since then, tour operators that specialize in North Korea including Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours stopped taking Americans to the country. Before that, Americans made up 20 percent of the western visitors that Koryo took to North Korea, according to Simon Cockerell, the general manager of the company, who has visited the country 169 times. “The fact that it is a place endlessly reported on and so little-known is the attraction for most visitors,” Mr. Cockerell wrote in an email. The Seattle-based tour operator Mir Corporation has led North Korea trips in the past, but through a spokesman said that until the government rescinds the ban, the company will be “waiting and watching.” "
"A
new dance always begins, for Justin Peck, with a fixation on a piece of music. He’ll listen to it over and over, sometimes for years, until he knows all its notches and grooves, every dynamic change, all the subtle modulations of mood it provokes in him. As he’s getting to know the music, he spends several hours each morning in a rehearsal studio, moving to it, seeing how it travels through his body and responding to it in a series of gestures. When he arrives at a sequence of steps he likes, he’ll practice it again and again, and then, when he’s satisfied, record it on his iPhone. He calls these “sketches” or “Legos,” the units out of which he will begin to build a new work. Five years ago, Peck’s obsession fell on a hurtling piece of electronica called “U.S.A. I-IV,” by the musician and composer Dan Deacon, a four-section suite with a pulse that seems to promise climax but never resolves. Peck knew this music was an unusual choice for a ballet composition. It was exhausting to listen to, and it might alienate the audience at the New York City Ballet, where Peck is both a soloist and the company’s resident choreographer. But by then he had made a dozen ballets for the company, work widely celebrated for taking the form in a hypermodern direction while still epitomizing its technical rigor and superior grace. He was ready to take a real risk. He wanted to create a dance that would capture the American landscape when you’re looking out the window of a fast-moving train, the way a new object appears before you’ve even had a chance to process the last. How could the static space of a stage be made to feel as if were in constant motion? The ballet would be danced entirely in sneakers (a rarity in a form still rooted in the difficult glamour of pointe shoes) and incorporate some of the hyperkinetic, intricate footwork of tap dancing. “I’m always trying to figure out where I want to fall between paying respect to the classical form and trying stuff that pushes the envelope,” Peck told me. He hoped that these small breaches of tradition would help the dancers feel free — that they could appear onstage as themselves. In the studio, he experimented with tap, mapping with his feet all the subtle details he could hear between the insistent beats of Deacon’s music. He started to make a tap duet that was based partly on a private joke. When he was a teenager, studying dance at the School of American Ballet, he and his roommate Robbie Fairchild — who would go on to become one of the most celebrated principal dancers at the N.Y.C.B. — would play Dance Dance Revolution late into the night. Each of them had a background in tap, and the video game, in which they hit colored pads with their feet to visual cues, became a jocular way of competing. The tap duet Peck created, a set of moves with such precise synchronicity that the two dancers almost merge, was a homage to that time in his life and was to be the basis for the rest of the choreography. But then, the day after Donald Trump was elected president, Peck walked into the studio to lead a rehearsal for the piece and found the dancers stricken. Their sense of outrage and despair, he realized, should be brought into of the dance. When “The Times Are Racing” had its premiere on Jan. 26, 2017, the curtain rose on a mass of dancers in a tight huddle, wearing loose T-shirts and sporty jackets emblazoned with words like “Resist,” “Unite,” “Act.” Dancers started to peel off and fling themselves outward, as if ejected from orbit. It was Peck’s interpretation of what it would mean for his dancers — and, by extension, the audience — to inhabit chaos. A nameless protagonist, played by Fairchild, emerged from the crowd and buckled helplessly to his knees. All around him, bodies bounced off one another or embraced. "
"JERUSALEM — The tense shadow war between Iran and Israel burst into the open early Thursday as Israeli warplanes struck dozens of Iranian military targets inside Syria. It was a furious response to what Israel called an Iranian rocket attack launched from Syrian territory just hours earlier. The cross-border exchanges — the most serious assaults from each side in their face-off over Iran’s presence in Syria — took place a little more than a day after the United States withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. Israel’s defense minister said that Israeli warplanes had destroyed “nearly all” of Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria after Iran launched 20 rockets at Israeli-held territory, none reaching their targets. Iran struck shortly after President Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement, raising speculation that it no longer felt constrained by the possibility that the Americans might scrap the deal if Iran attacked Israel. Israel appeared newly emboldened as well, partly because of what seemed like extraordinary latitude from Russia, Syria’s most important ally, allowing the Israelis to act against Iran’s military assets in Syria. Moscow did not condemn Israel’s strikes, as it had in the past, instead calling on Israel and Iran to resolve their differences diplomatically. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — For years, Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, has been cracking down on USB flash drives that activists smuggle into his isolated country to poison his people’s minds with outside influences, like South Korean K-pop music. But last month, when he met with the South’s president, Moon Jae-in, Mr. Moon handed him a USB drive that contained quite a different message. In charts and video clips, Mr. Moon’s memory stick laid out a “new economic map for the Korean Peninsula,” including new railways and power plants for the impoverished North, should Mr. Kim abandon his nuclear weapons, according to South Korean officials. Mr. Moon based his sales pitch on the belief that Mr. Kim wants to become the North Korean equivalent of Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw the economic liberalization of China. In this view, Mr. Kim may be willing to transform his pariah state by trading in his nuclear arsenal for diplomatic and economic incentives he needs to achieve prosperity. It is a premise that will be tested when President Trump meets with Mr. Kim in a few weeks. When Mr. Moon met with Mr. Kim on the inter-Korean border on April 27 to help set up the North Korea-United States summit meeting, he handed over the USB drive to illustrate what benefits awaited Mr. Kim should he denuclearize. “Kim Jong-un’s desire to develop his country’s economy is as strong as, and even stronger than, his desire for nuclear weapons,” said Lee Jong-seok, a former unification minister of South Korea. “But he knows he cannot achieve the kind of rapid economic growth in China that he envisions for his country while keeping his nuclear weapons — because of the sanctions.” "
"JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md. — Three American prisoners freed from North Korea arrived here early Thursday to a personal welcome from President Trump, who traveled to an air base in the middle of the night to meet them. Waving their hands and flashing peace signs, the freed prisoners — Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song — descended the stairs of their plane, flanked by the president and senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had flown to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to secure their release. Their return to the United States removed a delicate obstacle as the president prepares to sit down with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for a landmark nuclear summit meeting. But as Mr. Trump basked in the glow of floodlights and TV cameras, he indicated that the most difficult part of the negotiations, which include persuading North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, still lies ahead. As he is prone to do when it comes to negotiations with the North, he avoided striking a decisive tone. “Hopefully everything is going to work out at the highest level,” Mr. Trump said. He then issued a compliment to Mr. Kim: “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” Mr. Trump, who spent the early part of his week frustrated by news reports about a continuing investigation into his presidential campaign’s ties to Russia and faced with criticism from key European allies for withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, seemed eager to celebrate a foreign policy triumph. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, Mr. Pompeo and the first lady, Melania Trump, were among those who traveled to the base to welcome the three men. "

Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump personally greeted the three Americans who were released by North Korea on Wednesday, after they arrived back in the U.S. overnight. The return of the men, all U.S. citizens of Korean descent, removed a delicate obstacle as Mr. Trump prepares for a summit meeting with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Here’s what we know about the former detainees. • Mr. Trump was asked on Wednesday if he thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” he said. “The prize I want is victory for the world.” • Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee for director, said during her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday that the agency should never resume the brutal interrogations that were employed after the Sept. 11 attacks. But the 33-year C.I.A. veteran, who oversaw a secret prison in Thailand in 2002, also said, “I’m not going to sit here, with the benefit of hindsight, and judge the very good people who made hard decisions.” We fact-checked some of her comments. • Ms. Haspel appeared headed for confirmation, although Senator John McCain, an influential Republican voice, said in a statement that “her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying.” Mr. McCain is being treated for brain cancer and is not expected to make it to Washington for the vote.

"Perhaps the most encouraging thing about the parliamentary elections on Sunday in Lebanon is that they were held at all after years of delay and political inertia, corruption, economic stagnation and foreign meddling. Lebanon suffers from multiple crises that lead to a perpetual state of paralysis: more than one million Syrian refugees are straining social services; public debt stands at $79 billion, or 150 percent of gross domestic product; the government fails to provide basic services like electricity and garbage collection; and there are fears of a new war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Shiite party and dominant military force in Lebanon. During the electoral campaign, few candidates or parties offered solutions to these systemic problems. Instead, most of the electioneering focused on mobilizing sectarian sentiments among Lebanon’s 4.5 million people. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a Sunni who is an ally of Saudi Arabia and the United States, called on supporters to vote for “Lebanon’s stability, economy, sovereignty and Arab identity.” That was a reminder of Hezbollah’s alliance with Iran, which Mr. Hariri and other Sunni leaders have argued threatens Lebanon’s Arab identity and its relationship with Sunni Arab states. Hezbollah and its allies also deployed a sectarian narrative, which labeled Shiite opponents as agents of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. One Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper published a list of Shiite opposition candidates it claimed, based on leaked diplomatic cables, were being funded by the Emirates. Even with these sectarian appeals, a majority of voters stayed home. The turnout was 49 percent, dashing hopes that the Lebanese would embrace their first national vote in nine years. The election was originally scheduled for 2013, but the Lebanese Parliament extended its own term and postponed the balloting several times using the ruse that security concerns made it difficult to hold elections.

"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • A slowdown in lending could pose a threat to the economy. • Could oil prices return to $100 a barrel next year? • Walmart’s journey to its biggest deal. • How Michael Cohen made $2 million as a gatekeeper. • The latest fallout from Trump’s foreign policy. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. With tax cuts done and deregulation proceeding, some expect the United States economy to grow more quickly than it has in recent years. One problem: A huge driver of economic growth, lending to companies and individuals, does not point to such a bullish outcome. Borrowing allows companies and individuals to finance purchases that they might not otherwise be able to afford. When borrowing surges, new money circulates through the economy, creating demand that needs to be met with higher production. Lending has certainly not fallen off a cliff like it did during the Great Recession, but it is growing quite a bit slower than it has in recent years. If it doesn’t pick up, that could dampen growth some expect. "
"WASHINGTON — A Defense Department investigation of a Special Forces mission in Niger last fall found widespread problems across all levels of the military counterterrorism operation, but focused in particular on the actions of junior officers leading up to an ambush that killed four American soldiers. The investigation, released Thursday, found that the 11-member team had not undergone crucial training as a unit before it deployed to Niger because of “personnel turnover” and had not rehearsed its mission before leaving its base. It said the two junior officers had “mischaracterized” the mission in a required planning document filed before the team, which included Green Berets, departed. It also found that soldiers wounded on the mission — at least two Americans and three Nigeriens — were not evacuated for more than four hours, far longer than the Pentagon had acknowledged. Most Americans were unaware before the Oct. 4 ambush that Green Berets, and 800 other American troops, were stationed in Niger, and the attack led to the largest loss of American lives during combat in Africa since the 1993 “Black Hawk Down” debacle in Somalia. The deaths of the four soldiers — Sgt. First Class Jeremiah W. Johnson, Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright and Sgt. La David Johnson — set off a fierce debate over secretive American military missions in remote and far-flung battlegrounds. The investigation did not recommend specific corrective action to avoid the confusion and lax oversight that contributed to the deaths. "

"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, told colleagues she was close to resigning after President Trump berated her on Wednesday in front of the entire cabinet for what he said was her failure to adequately secure the nation’s borders, according to several current and former officials familiar with the episode. Ms. Nielsen, who is a protégée of John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has drafted a resignation letter but has not submitted it, according to two of the people. As the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Ms. Nielsen is in charge of the 20,000 employees who work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mr. Trump’s anger toward Ms. Nielsen, who was sitting several seats to his left at the meeting, was part of a lengthy tirade in which the president railed at his cabinet about what he said was its lack of progress toward sealing the country’s borders against illegal immigrants, according to one person who was present at the meeting. Asked about the heated exchange at the meeting, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that “the president is committed to fixing our broken immigration system and our porous borders.” [Update: Kirstjen Nielsen out as Trump’s homeland security secretary.] In a statement, Ms. Nielsen said she intended to “continue to direct the department to do all we can to implement the president’s security-focused agenda.” She said Mr. Trump was “rightly frustrated that existing loopholes and the lack of congressional action have prevented this administration from fully securing the border.” Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, disputed that Ms. Nielsen had drafted a resignation letter and was close to resigning, calling those assertions “false.” "
"In general, Donald Trump is notoriously uninterested in policy details. It has long been obvious, for example, that he never bothered to find out what his one major legislative victory, the 2017 tax cut, actually did. Similarly, it’s pretty clear that he had no idea what was actually in the Iran agreement he just repudiated. In each case, it was about ego rather than substance: scoring a “win,” undoing his predecessor’s achievement. But there are some policy issues he really does care about. By all accounts, he really hates the idea of people receiving “welfare,” by which he means any government program that helps people with low income, and he wants to eliminate such programs wherever possible. Most recently, he has reportedly threatened to veto the upcoming farm bill unless it imposes stringent new work requirements on recipients of SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, still commonly referred to as food stamps. Let me be upfront here: There’s something fundamentally obscene about this spectacle. Here we have a man who inherited great wealth, then built a business career largely around duping the gullible — whether they were naïve investors in his business ventures left holding the bag when those ventures went bankrupt, or students who wasted time and money on worthless degrees from Trump University. Yet he’s determined to snatch food from the mouths of the truly desperate, because he’s sure that somehow or other they’re getting away with something, having it too easy. But however petty Trump’s motives, this is a big deal from the other side. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that new work requirements plus other restrictions proposed by House Republicans would end up denying or reducing nutritional aid to around two million people, mostly in families with children.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, abruptly resigned from his law firm, which then promptly undercut his recent statements defending the president. Mr. Giuliani had taken a leave of absence last month from the firm, Greenberg Traurig, to represent Mr. Trump. But the firm, one of the nation’s largest, said in a statement on Thursday that he no longer worked there. Firm partners had chafed over Mr. Giuliani’s public comments about payments that another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, made to secure the silence of a pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied her allegations. Mr. Giuliani suggested that such payments were common at his firm, even without the knowledge of the clients. “That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do, out of his law firm funds,” he said on Fox News. He added, “Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of this with my clients.” The New York Times asked Greenberg Traurig about those remarks early this week. Shortly after Mr. Giuliani’s resignation was announced, the firm responded. “We cannot speak for Mr. Giuliani with respect to what was intended by his remarks,” said a spokeswoman, Jill Perry. “Speaking for ourselves, we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client.” "

Thank you to Sarah Gross at High Technology High School in Lincroft, N.J.; Karen Gold of The Governor’s Academy, Byfield, Mass.; Cynthia Honeycutt at Walhalla High School in Walhalla, S.C.; Chris Roth from Folsom Elementary School District in Folsom, N.J.; and Brett Vogelsinger of Holicong Middle School in Doylestown, Pa., who simply asked their students, quoted below, what they’d recommend to others right now. (We also heard from a sixth grader, Julia Sprung, who goes to the Kinneret Day School and reads The Times at home.) So please invite your students to enjoy any of the 17 fascinating pieces below, and then find their own articles — and tell us why they chose them. They should post those picks here, in the comments, through May 16. "
"WASHINGTON — No, the Korean War still is not over. While an armistice in 1953 ended active fighting, it was never followed by a peace treaty. This is why during their recent meeting, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, in addition to jointly calling for the “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula, also pledged to formally conclude the war. Much ambiguity remains about what exactly it would take to accomplish what Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon vowed to do, and many analysts have expressed skepticism about this diplomatic overture, pointing to a number of other supposed breakthroughs in the past that petered out. Yet this moment does seem different in at least one important respect. The two leaders’ joint declaration last month contained another significant clause that went relatively unnoticed: “South and North Korea affirmed the principle of determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord.” The statement is not entirely novel; there was another one like it in a 2000 joint declaration. But it underscores the fact that as much as rapprochement between the Koreas concerns other parties to the Korean War, like the United States and China — and, given the wider security implications, the rest of the world as well — it is a matter principally between the two of them. This point would go without saying were it not for this war’s curious history, which again and again relegated both Koreas to the rank of extras as they were upstaged by their Cold War patrons. American government officials should remember this overlooked truth as they prepare President Trump for his own meeting with Mr. Kim in the coming weeks — and perhaps all the more because the North Korean government is making direct gestures toward the United States, as on Wednesday when it pledged to release three American prisoners. After North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, it almost managed to push the United Nations Command, the multinational force defending the South, off the peninsula. By November, the U.N.C. was touching the Chinese border. By January 1951, after the dramatic intervention of Chinese forces, the Communists overtook Seoul again. Come June 1951, the battle line had mostly stabilized near the 38th parallel. Armistice negotiations began. At that point, neither the North nor the South wanted to stop fighting — yet both were brought to the negotiating table by their respective Cold War patrons. The United States spoke for the U.N.C.; China spoke for the Communists. The two Koreas were their voiceless accessories. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A date for Trump and Kim, Malaysia’s historic election and a Philippine women’s rights pioneer. Here’s what you need to know: • U.S.-North Korea talks are on. Singapore, June 12: President Trump made the announcement after three Americans released by North Korea arrived back in the U.S. We’ll “try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!” Mr. Trump tweeted in his announcement that he will meet with Kim Jong-un. Above, Mr. Trump personally welcomed the freed men at a Washington-area air base in the middle of the night. Mr. Trump was asked this week if he thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” he said with a laugh. _____ "
"To the Editor: Re “Nominee for C.I.A. Vows Era of Torture Is Over” (front page, May 10): Donald Trump vowed just the opposite during his campaign for president and added that he’d go beyond the torture designed and administered by the Bush-Cheney administration. Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. nominee, supervised torture of detainees at a secret prison in Thailand but said at her confirmation hearing that torture “will not restart” under her leadership of the agency. Mr. Trump will restart America’s torture program, no matter what she thinks. He promised it to his voters and the rest of the world. And, sadly, he will deliver. JAMES NEUPERT, ATHERTON, CALIF. To the Editor: Re “Deeply Versed in Spy Agency, and Dark Era” (front page, May 8): Bad enough that everyone who promoted or participated in the post-9/11 torture program enjoyed a de facto grant of amnesty. Intolerable that someone who personally oversaw an American-operated torture chamber in Thailand could be promoted to head the C.I.A. As President Trump tries to defend Gina Haspel, two points should be recalled. First, the torture program was not begun at the urging of experts in interrogation, but rather was promoted by political leaders like Vice President Dick Cheney, who gloried in the image of themselves as ruthless supporters of violence against our foes. Second, as an exhaustive Senate Intelligence Committee investigation confirmed, the unlawful torture program never yielded any intelligence of importance. Ms. Haspel was grilled about her role in the enterprise. She is fortunate that the questions were posed by senators, not by a United States Attorney prosecuting her for criminal conspiracy. MITCHELL ZIMMERMAN
PALO ALTO, CALIF. To the Editor: Gina Haspel’s defenders point out that she was told that the torture she supervised was legal, and that she had been ordered to destroy the evidence. Even so, the Nuremberg trials proved the legal principle that “I was only following orders” is not an acceptable excuse for unacceptable behavior. She should not be confirmed. DAVID L. MEISTER, NEW YORK "
"TEHRAN — It was a day like any other. The evening rush hour heralded the weekend, which in Iran starts on Thursday. People crowded the sidewalks of a West Tehran square, making their way home or to restaurants. A young street musician wearing a baseball cap and sitting in a wheelchair sang “Someone Like You” by Adele. His sister played keyboard. “I don’t understand the words, but it’s beautiful,” one passer-by told a friend. A man walked past with fresh bread. Two teenagers sitting beneath an underpass smoked and giggled. It was easy to forget that the lives of those making their way home here had been changed with the stroke of a pen, thousands of miles away, this week when President Trump formally withdrew from the nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers. Life can be like a roller coaster in Iran. Ordinary people can do little more than hang on through the twists and turns as their own leaders, and sometimes foreign ones, chart a course. Rarely are they in control. “No one ever listens to us,” said Ali Akbari, a 33-year-old tech student with a hipster beard. “That’s just the way it is. We have to go with the flow.” "
"To the Editor: Re “U.S.-North Korea Summit Set for June 12 in Singapore, Trump Says” (nytimes.com, May 10): No matter how much you hate President Trump, he has done an outstanding job thus far in dealing with North Korea. Remember, this is a problem he inherited because no other president in recent times had the confidence to tackle it. We finally have a strong leader in our president. Give him some credit!

"This feature will return on Sept. 13. For now, take a look at what else we’re offering for the 2018-19 school year. _________ Though the end of school year 2017-18 is in sight, we still get excited when we see new classes joining the conversation. This week we welcome students from Oxford, Miss., and Leland, Mich. But we also have to tell you that this is the last time this semester we’ll be choosing favorite student comments on our daily writing prompts. Instead, we invite you to transition from commenting on pieces we’ve chosen to choosing articles on your own. As you do, you’ll be practicing for our Summer Reading Contest, which poses the same question every Friday: “What interested you most in The Times this week? Why?” Since the contest doesn’t start until June 15, we reached out to a few teachers we’ve gotten to know and asked how their students would answer that question right now. Here are 17 great answers, which will introduce you to articles on everything from naked museum tours to A.I. technology. Want your pick chosen next week? Post a comment here or here telling us what you’re reading and why. We can’t wait to add your ideas to our list. Please note: All the student comments below have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. "
"For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox. The newsletter originally published the following Q. and A. and personal stories. A group suing Harvard has demanded that it publicly release data on hundreds of thousands of applicants, saying the records show a pattern of discrimination against Asian-Americans going back decades. We asked Anemona Hartocollis, our higher education reporter, about the suit. When was this suit filed? What set it off? Who is the driving force behind it? The lawsuit was filed by a group called Students for Fair Admissions, which was expressly created to challenge affirmative-action policies at colleges and universities. It is led by Edward Blum, a longtime activist against affirmative-action policies in areas ranging from education to voting rights. Students for Fair Admissions went on to recruit more than a dozen Asian-American students, who had been rejected by Harvard, to participate. They are not named plaintiffs, but their names have been submitted to the court. Are Asian-American groups and Mr. Blum an odd coupling? Not necessarily. His lawsuit was followed only months later — in May 2015 — by a very similar complaint to federal civil rights authorities by a group called the Asian-American Coalition for Education. It bills itself as a national, nonpolitical, nonprofit organization fighting for Asian-American children’s equal-education rights. That group says its leaders began organizing Asian communities against the admissions policies of Ivy League schools in 2014. In May 2015, they organized 64 Asian-American groups, including Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and Korean ones, to file a civil-rights complaint with the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, asking for an investigation into what they contended were discriminatory practices at Harvard. The Justice Department has since confirmed that it is pursuing that investigation. "
President Trump’s decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal and his Iran policy reminded some current and former U.S. officials of the buildup to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
"WASHINGTON — President Trump frequently talks about reviving the American auto industry, but his approach to trade policy may backfire on the country’s carmakers. Mr. Trump’s efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, to impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel and to reduce America’s trade deficit with China could limit the reach of companies that produce cars in the United States and depend on access to growing markets outside the country. On Friday, the chief executives of the biggest automakers plan to meet with the president at the White House. The gathering comes at a critical moment, as Trump administration officials race to finalize a Nafta rewrite in the next few weeks and prepare to meet again next week with Chinese leaders in hopes of forestalling a potential trade war. The auto industry is among the sectors most vulnerable to trade disruptions because its business model is increasingly global, in terms of both production and sales. One in five cars made in the United States is now exported, and one in four vehicles sold in America were produced in factories run by foreign-owned companies. General Motors sold nearly 1 million vehicles in China in the first quarter of the year — more than it sold in North America in the same period. In the last two decades, United States automakers have set up plants in Canada, China and Mexico, and they routinely import car parts from other countries. Mexico has added hundreds of thousands of auto-making jobs since Nafta’s enactment in 1994, while the United States has lost hundreds of thousands. Labor groups and administration officials are hopeful that the trade moves will change incentives to encourage domestic and foreign-owned carmakers to manufacture more of their vehicles in the United States. But industry representatives warn that proposals now being championed by the Trump administration could have the opposite effect, raising the prices of American-made cars and trucks, reducing vehicle sales and potentially choking off access to China, the world’s fastest-growing market for automobiles.

"JORDANVILLE, N.Y. — The message last month sounded as if it came directly from a Donald J. Trump campaign speech, with references to draining the swamp and calls for the prosecution of Hillary Clinton and James B. Comey, among others. Then, in case those Trump-cloaked allusions somehow eluded any of Representative Claudia Tenney’s followers, she asked them to sign a petition called “Lock Them Up.” Ms. Tenney, a first-term Republican congresswoman from Central New York, has remained an unabashed supporter of President Trump, even as his unpopularity in his home state is expected to drive Democrats to the polls in November’s midterm elections. She has criticized her Democratic colleagues for being “un-American” for not applauding the president during his State of the Union address in January, suggesting that they “don’t love our country.” And she has managed to exceed Mr. Trump in her criticism of those who would restrict gun rights, positing that “so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats.” Her comments have ricocheted across social media and national news outlets and even landed in a Jimmy Kimmel monologue. National Democrats have sought to capitalize on her rhetoric as out of touch, even zany. "
"Here’s a curious ritual of American politics: Whenever a large energy project is proposed, the ensuing debate revolves chiefly around how many jobs it will create. For example, backers of the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a contested 600-mile natural gas conduit that would run from West Virginia to North Carolina, have maintained that it would create nearly 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs. Similarly, President Trump’s announcement last year that he was reviving the Keystone XL pipeline suggested that it would generate 28,000 construction jobs. On the other hand, The Washington Post concluded that the real number was 3,900 construction jobs, based on a State Department estimate. Renewable energy advocates play the same game. An Environmental Defense Fund report published last year asserted that the United States’ clean energy sector employs an estimated four million to 4.5 million people. The solar and wind industries “are each creating jobs at a rate 12 times faster than that of the rest of the U.S. economy,” the report said. The problem with statistics like these isn’t just their purveyor’s bias: It’s that all the numbers are inherently misleading. Regardless of political outlook, economists generally agree that job numbers don’t convey the value of a given project or sector. Severin Borenstein, a University of California, Berkeley, economist, could have been speaking for all of them in his 2015 blog post called “The Job Creation Shuffle.” “Most of the people who take a newly ‘created’ job are leaving an existing job. Or would have found another job,” Mr. Borenstein wrote. “Then there are people who are displaced by the new jobs created — the coal miners who worked for the mine that is shut down” or “the fracking oil drillers in North Dakota laid off when cheaper crude from the tar sands is carried to market by the Keystone XL.” "
"A simmering conflict between Israel and Iran escalated overnight when Israeli jets struck dozens of Iranian targets in neighboring Syria. The strikes came after what the Israeli military described as an Iranian rocket attack against its forces in the Golan Heights. The Israelis said it was Iran’s first direct rocket attack against Israeli targets. By Thursday morning, the Israeli Air Force had destroyed “nearly all” of Iran’s military infrastructure in Syria, according to Israel’s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman. Iran is one of the most powerful backers of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. It first intervened in the war to help defend Mr. Assad against Syrian rebels and later helped Syrian government forces against the Islamic State. Iran has taken advantage of the chaos of Syria’s war to build a substantial military infrastructure there. It has built and trained large Shiite militias with thousands of fighters and sent advisers from its powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps to Syrian military bases. Even though the Syrian rebels have steadily lost ground and no clear threats to Mr. Assad’s rule remain, Iran and its allies have stayed in Syria, shifting their focus to creating a military infrastructure there that Israel sees as a threat. Iran continues to train and equip fighters while strengthening ties with its Shiite allies in Iraq and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon in hopes of building a united front in the event of a new war. “The fundamental reason why Syria has become a battleground is because of the Islamic Republic’s declared ideology and strategy since 1979 of fighting Israel and its supporters,” said Amir Toumaj, a research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which takes a hawkish stance on Iran. “Prior to 1979, Iran and Israel were allies. Iranians have no material stake in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.” "
"Everything was going smoothly until Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 reached about 32,000 feet. Then there was chaos. A deafening bang. A puff of gray smoke. Oxygen masks dropped. At first, the plane vibrated violently side to side. Then it lunged to the left. In the cockpit, alarms and warnings rang out — so loud that the pilots had to scream to talk to each other. “And that all kind of happened all at once,” Darren Ellisor, the flight’s first officer, told ABC News’s “20/20” in an interview that will be broadcast Friday night. Captain Tammie Jo Shults, who was next to him in the cockpit during the April 17 flight, was not initially supposed to be in that seat. Her husband, Dean Shults, a fellow Southwest pilot, had agreed to swap flights so she could attend their son’s track meet. “I’m not trading with him anymore,” Captain Shults joked. Captain Shults and Officer Ellisor recounted for the first time publicly the frightening and disorienting moments after the plane’s left engine exploded shortly after takeoff from La Guardia Airport in New York on its way to Love Field Airport in Dallas. "
"After months of swaggering hesitation, President Trump finally announced the United States’ withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran, to which Britain, France, Russia, China, Germany and the European Union are also parties. This action tramples on European leaders, who urged Mr. Trump to exercise restraint in the interest of international security and multilateralism. Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, reacted to Mr. Trump’s announcement with a sharp statement. The European Union and the rest of the international community, she said, would “preserve this nuclear deal.” The question is how. Notwithstanding an abundance of kvetching, European powers have not yet shown Mr. Trump that he has anything to fear from ignoring their wishes. To be sure, European leaders have expended plenty of verbiage, illuminating the broad consensus that Iran is abiding by the terms of the deal. President Emmanuel Macron of France implored the Trump administration not to scupper the agreement during a recent visit to Washington. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany echoed his sentiments, as did Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, in these pages on Sunday. But mere words aren’t going to dissuade this White House. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has treated Europe like a doormat, questioning the value of NATO, ridiculing the mission of the European Union and dismissing European exhortations on policy matters. Given all this, the European Union in particular may feel compelled to acknowledge the harsh reality that it has yet to act like an organization with a G.D.P. roughly equal to that of the United States — and to change the situation by signaling to Washington that on certain matters it refuses to be ignored. The trouble the European Union has had uniting around highly sensitive issues — immigration, for example — is perhaps understandable. But the Iran deal does not appear to be divisive: From the pro-Brexit Mr. Johnson to the avowed internationalist Mr. Macron, European politicians understand its value. "
"WASHINGTON — At 3:18 a.m. last Friday, a federal agent undercover on a task force was quietly switching out a tracking device planted on a vehicle on a dark street on Chicago’s South Side. It was a routine maneuver for the agent, who was less than a year out of the training academy of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He had been sent to Chicago as part of a Trump administration push to tackle the city’s gun crisis. But with a burst of gunshots, that Friday morning turned catastrophic. The agent was shot in the head, then thrown into a car by a fellow agent and rushed to a hospital. “I’m coming in — just take me to the hospital,” the driving agent yelled over the police scanner. “Officer hit; we need escort to a hospital now!” The shooting of the undercover agent, who is expected to fully recover, has drawn attention to the group he was assigned to, the Crime Gun Strike Force. Established by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June to combat gun trafficking and violence in Chicago, the task force is one of the most concrete examples of his efforts to fight gun violence. Twenty A.T.F. agents were assigned to it. Chicago, which has long struggled with trafficking and illegal guns, has served as a larger symbol of violent crime for President Trump, who routinely mentions the city when speaking about gun violence. If effective, the task force could serve as a model as he seeks to fulfill his promises to tackle violent crime. “The Chicago Gun Strike Force, sending 20 more permanent A.T.F. agents and adding more federal prosecutors, has contributed significantly to the effort” of making Chicago safer, Mr. Sessions said in a statement. “If we support and affirm our police and proven enforcement policies, Chicago can recover.” "
"CANNES, France — Disruptif! Before the 71st Cannes Film Festival had opened Tuesday, this tradition-proud event was in an uproar. First, there was l’affair de Netflix, which found the streaming service feuding with the festival and pulling its high-profile titles. Then came some scheduling shuffling, the first in decades, which affects how and when attendees can see movies. The festival essentially wants to delay critics from beaming out their boos and jeers until after the official premiere, but the changes were so anxiously received that the festival sent a 1,400-word communiqué assuring attendees that all would be fine, promise. Three days in, much seems the same or close enough. The stars are promenading down the red carpet past the thousands who daily congregate in front of the Palais, the concrete sprawl that serves as the festival’s headquarters. Gawkers and attendees are, in turn, under the watch of heavily armed police and army. Last year, France ended the state of emergency that had been in place since the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris; new legislation, however, instituted some of the same security measures put in place after the attacks. Even as security measures have tightened at the festival, the guards searching our bags seem friendlier. It’s a subtle softening that suggests the festival knows it was unnerving to dash past heavily armed guards on the way to the opening attraction, “Everybody Knows,” a knotty melodrama from the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, a Cannes favorite whose credits include “A Separation.” “Everybody Knows” stars a strong Penélope Cruz as Laura, whose teenager is kidnapped while the family is visiting her Spanish hometown. Ms. Cruz’s husband, Javier Bardem, plays Laura’s former lover, Paco, a winemaker whose good fortunes have stirred resentment in her family, which has experienced a self-inflicted fall in its own fortunes. Mr. Farhadi’s script is far too busy — the movie is crammed with characters and underexplored themes, including class tensions, nativism and ugly attitudes toward migrant workers — but he’s exceptionally deft at mining the spaces that open up between people, particularly during a crisis. At his news conference, Mr. Farhadi said he hoped that Jafar Panahi, whose movie “3 Faces” is in competition and who’s barred by Iran from leaving the country — could attend Cannes. That Mr. Panahi could not be here is, Mr. Farhadi said, “something that I have difficulty living with.” Perhaps because Iran is so often demonized in the United States and its auteurs are so often rightly venerated at Cannes, it was widely noted that the day that “Everybody Knows” had its premiere, President Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. (In 2017, Mr. Farhadi boycotted the Oscars in protest of the president’s travel ban; his film “The Salesman” went on to win the best foreign-language Oscar.) "
