"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Italy’s euro debate scares markets, a deadly attack hits Belgium and a Russian journalist is killed in Ukraine. Here’s the latest: • Would Italians really leave the eurozone? Europe seemed to have held off a series of far-right challenges, but the collapse of efforts to form a government in Italy, the bloc’s fourth-largest economy, shows that populism has not gone away. Now the euro is in the cross hairs. Italy’s leading populist parties — including the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, above — are pushing for new elections, which could become a referendum on the common currency. That would be a nightmare scenario for Brussels, writes our chief correspondent in Europe. Stocks tumbled on the fears that Italy might be headed toward quitting the euro, which fell to its weakest value against the dollar in nearly a year. The European Union’s budget commissioner apologized after prompting an uproar by suggesting that the markets would punish Italian voters if they voted for the populists. Here’s a look at why the concerns could escalate into a major crisis, and what it could mean for Italy, the euro, Europe and the world. "
"On Twitter on Tuesday, Roseanne Barr wrote that if “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj.” The message referred to President Barack Obama’s former senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and in it Ms. Barr traded on age-old racist ideas about black people and primates. Then she shared some incorrect nonsense about Chelsea Clinton marrying into the Soros family. It was the kind of thing Roseanne Barr has been doing online for years. This time, however, the backlash was immediate and vigorous. Ms. Barr apologized for her “joke” that wasn’t really a joke and said she was leaving Twitter as if Twitter were responsible for her racist behavior. That apology was not enough. ICM Partners, her agents, stopped representing her. The comedian Wanda Sykes, who was a consulting producer on the reboot of “Roseanne,” announced that she was quitting the show. Within a matter of hours, ABC canceled the new “Roseanne” and the original show’s reruns were pulled from TV Land, CMT and the Paramount Network. For once, a major network did the right thing. But before it did the right thing, it did the wrong thing. It is not new information that Roseanne Barr makes racist, Islamophobic and misogynistic statements and is happy to peddle all manner of dangerous conspiracy theories. ABC knew this when it greenlighted the “Roseanne” reboot. ABC knew this when it quickly renewed the reboot for a second season, buoyed, no doubt, by the show’s strong ratings. The cast, the writers and the producers knew what Ms. Barr stood for when they agreed to work on the show. Everyone involved made a decision to support the show despite its co-creator’s racism. They decided that their career ambitions, or desire to return to network television, or financial interests would best be served by looking the other way. It was only when Ms. Barr became an immediate liability that everyone involved finally looked at her racism and dealt with it directly. [Receive arguments and opinions on the pressing social issues and hidden stories around the World Cup right in your inbox. Sign up for Offsides.] I watched and enjoyed the first two episodes of the “Roseanne” reboot but I could not continue watching, given everything Ms. Barr represents. I also watched the original version of “Roseanne” when it aired. I remember the Conner family as working class and solidly invested in the greater good of their community. They seemed to be liberals, which is antithetical to the Roseanne in the reboot, who is a working-class Trump supporter. Certainly, the Conner family may have changed political affiliations and become Republicans and there would be nothing wrong with that. "
"NASHVILLE — President Trump accused Democrats on Tuesday of siding with brutal immigrant gang members over American citizens and implored Republican voters to turn out in November’s midterm elections or risk the safety of their country. During a raucous rally in Nashville, Mr. Trump invoked fears of crimes committed by illegal immigrants, particularly by the transnational gang MS-13, to argue for stricter border policies, including his long-promised wall, and charged that Democrats were standing in the way. “They don’t want the wall, they want open borders,” Mr. Trump told the crowd. “They’re more interested in taking care of criminals than they are in taking care of you.” He worked an audience of about 5,500 people into a frenzy by recalling the term he used this month during a discussion of how difficult it was to target suspected undocumented immigrants, including criminal gang members, for deportation. “What was the name?” Mr. Trump asked. “Animals!” his cheering supporters screamed back. “If you want your communities to be safe, if you want your schools to be safe, if you want your country to be safe, then you must go out and get the Democrats the hell out of office,” Mr. Trump said. “Democrats have opposed every common-sense measure necessary to stop this horrendous scourge of crime, to dismantle MS-13 and to stop illegal immigration.” Mr. Trump was in Nashville to boost Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, who is running to succeed Senator Bob Corker, who is retiring. He savaged Phil Bredesen, the state’s former Democratic governor whom Ms. Blackburn is expected to face in November, calling him “an absolute, total tool of Chuck Schumer,” the Senate Democratic leader, and “of course, the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi,” he said, referring to the House Democratic leader. "
"— President Trump, speaking Tuesday night at a rally in Nashville Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not break down deportations according to gang affiliation, a spokesman for the agency said. But based on the number of arrests alone, Mr. Trump’s estimate of “thousands” is impossible. In the 2017 fiscal year — which began in October 2016 and ended in September 2017 — 796 members of MS-13, a transnational gang that has ties to El Salvador, were arrested, and 405 were arrested in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, data that ICE provided to The New York Times shows. In all, that’s about 1,200 MS-13 members, and it’s likely not all of them have been removed. The time between an arrest and deportation can vary greatly, and backlog has stalled the process. In 2017, the average wait time for a hearing where a judge may order deportation was 685 days, according to data from TRAC, a research institute at Syracuse University. The number of MS-13 members who were arrested in the 2017 fiscal year was higher than the previous eight years, but ICE arrested more than 1,100 in the 2008 fiscal year and almost 1,300 in 2007. Those figures contradict Mr. Trump’s previous claims that “records” were set. The agency removed a total of 5,936 gang members in the 2017 fiscal year, and 1,082 in the 2018 fiscal year through March. It is unclear how many belong to MS-13. During the rally, Mr. Trump also reiterated many claims that The Times and others have previously debunked: that Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, supported MS-13 (she never said this), that illegal border crossings had declined 40 percent (they recently increased), and that tax cuts he signed into law last year were the largest in history (they rank 12th). He also incorrectly described other countries as not “sending their best” through the diversity visa program (applicants enter of their own volition), claimed construction had begun on his border wall (it hasn’t), and said that the suspect in the Manhattan truck attack in October had sponsored two dozen family members through “chain migration” (this is implausible). "
"Ivanka Trump abruptly left a conference call on Tuesday about a coming fitness event after receiving questions about her company’s trademarks in China and her father’s exercise regimen. White House officials insisted that she had always been scheduled to leave. Ms. Trump and Holli M. Richmond, the director of the White House Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, both hosted the call with reporters before a field day President Trump will host Wednesday at the White House. At the outset, a White House official said that Ms. Trump would take a few questions before departing for a meeting, and that Ms. Richmond would handle the rest. But the first reporter to ask a question broached the number of trademarks that China recently awarded Ms. Trump’s private, eponymous brand. Around the same time, Ms. Trump’s father, the president, endorsed saving the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, a move that surprised several people in his own administration. The company was left paralyzed after it was recently banned from buying American technology components for seven years as punishment for breaking American sanctions against some countries, including Iran and North Korea. When the reporter, from NBC, asked whether Ms. Trump would weigh in on the matter, the official, Ninio Fetalvo, said that he had to “refer those questions to the press office.” He quickly moved on to the next question. Ms. Trump, a top-ranking White House official, rarely takes questions from the news media in uncontrolled settings. The issue of overlap between her brand and her work at the White House has frequently raised eyebrows, including among ethics watchdogs. Later on the call, a question came up about whether Mr. Trump has changed his fitness and diet routine, which Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, his White House physician at the time, had recommended this year. Ms. Trump, Mr. Fetalvo said, had departed for another meeting and could not take the question. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A cease-fire in Kashmir, a divorce quiz in China, and the longest commercial flight in the world. Here’s what you need to know: • Kim Yong-chol, North Korea’s top nuclear weapons negotiator, landed in New York ahead of talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Above, Mr. Kim and other officials in February. One of Kim Jong-un’s most trusted aides, he is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the U.S. in 18 years. Officials on both sides have been scrambling to salvage the proposed June 12 summit meeting in Singapore, compressing a process that would normally take months into a matter of days. Here is a look at who is meeting with whom, and what they might be talking about. _____ • President Trump told Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in March 2017 that he should reverse his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Sessions refused, but the previously unreported confrontation is being investigated by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. "
"WASHINGTON — Riding in a motorcade in Lima, Peru, shortly after the 2016 election, President Barack Obama was struggling to understand Donald J. Trump’s victory. “What if we were wrong?” he asked aides riding with him in the armored presidential limousine. He had read a column asserting that liberals had forgotten how important identity was to people and had promoted an empty cosmopolitan globalism that made many feel left behind. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Mr. Obama said. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.” His aides reassured him that he still would have won had he been able to run for another term and that the next generation had more in common with him than with Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama, the first black man elected president, did not seem convinced. “Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” he said. In the weeks after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Obama went through multiple emotional stages, according to a new book by his longtime adviser Benjamin J. Rhodes. At times, the departing president took the long view, at other points, he flashed anger. He called Mr. Trump a “cartoon” figure who cared more about his crowd sizes than any particular policy. And he expressed rare self-doubt, wondering whether he had misjudged his own influence on American history. Set to be published next week by Random House, Mr. Rhodes’s memoir, “The World as It Is,” offers a peek into Mr. Obama’s tightly sealed inner sanctum from the perspective of one of the few people who saw him up close through all eight years of his presidency. Few moments shook Mr. Obama more than the decision by voters to replace him with a candidate who had questioned his very birth. Mr. Rhodes served as Mr. Obama’s deputy national security adviser through some of the most consequential points of his presidency, including decisions to authorize the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, send more troops to Afghanistan, pull most troops out of Iraq, restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, seal a nuclear agreement with Iran, intervene militarily in Libya and refuse to intervene militarily in Syria.

"Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, audibly choked up during Wednesday’s press briefing as she answered a student’s question about school shootings. The student, Benje Choucroun, 13, was at the White House covering a children’s fitness event for Time for Kids, but was called on as he sat among the White House press corps. He said his school recently had a lockdown drill. Reading from a sheet of paper, he said that one thing that affected students’ mental health was “the worry about the fact that we or our friends could get shot at school.” “Specifically,” the boy asked, “can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies?” Ms. Sanders, her voice breaking at times, responded: “I think that as a kid, and certainly as a parent, there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe. So I’m sorry that you feel that way.” She continued: “This administration takes it seriously, and the school safety commission that the president convened is meeting this week again, an official meeting, to discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools, and to make them feel safe and make their parents feel good about dropping them off.” President Trump has called for action after some high-profile school shootings, but little has come of it beyond the creation of the commission, which is overseen by Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. After a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killed 17 people in February, Mr. Trump said he would look at stricter background checks and raising the minimum age for buying assault weapons. He also suggested arming teachers, giving them a bonus to carry guns. Those proposals have gone nowhere. He later said on Twitter that there was “not much political support (to put it mildly)” on raising the minimum age. In the only tangible action, Attorney General Jeff Sessions introduced regulations in March to ban so-called bump stocks, a device used in last year’s massacre in Las Vegas. But the ban has not gone into effect and could still face legal challenges from gun rights groups. "
"It was an incredibly exciting time to be a writer on “Roseanne.” The revived ABC sitcom was the No. 1 new show in the country, delivering an audience that network television had not seen in years. The show was quickly renewed for another season, giving everyone a sense of accomplishment, not to mention job security. But for all the success, there was also a vague sense of foreboding. The writers’ social media accounts were flooded with negative comments. Articles posted online criticized jokes and plots. Their friends in the liberal enclave of Los Angeles would occasionally tsk-tsk that they worked on the show. And, of course, there was Roseanne Barr, the show’s star and co-creator, and her history of volatile public comments. “It was hard for us once we started airing and we started to see some of the stuff that came out,” said Bruce Rasmussen, an executive producer of the series. “It was just brutal: ‘How dare they give her a show? How dare they write for her?’ “It was a certain amount of pressure,” he continued. “You’re the No. 1 show, and people are coming after you on the web and you’re getting attacked by 50 percent of the press.” In the wake of ABC’s cancellation of “Roseanne” on Tuesday, only hours after Ms. Barr posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, those who worked for the network and the show were still trying to come to grips with how everything had collapsed so suddenly. "
"HOUSTON — As Dennis Rivera-Sarmiento sat in a detention center 80 miles away from his Texas home this past winter, clad in a blue inmate uniform, he could see his high school diploma slipping further from his reach. Graduation was in June, but a schoolyard scuffle with a girl who he said had called him a racial epithet had gotten him arrested by his high school’s police officer. Then a state law that required the Harris County Sheriff’s Office to cooperate with federal immigration officers flagged him for deportation, back to his native Honduras, from which he and his family had fled five years ago. The case of the “quiet kid who was good at soccer” hauled from high school to a deportation center turned Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento into a cause célèbre in Houston, a textbook case of what immigration advocacy groups fear could happen as schools tighten discipline in the wake of school shootings, the police ratchet up sweeps for gang members and local law enforcement draws closer to the federal immigration authorities. The school, the community and plenty of lawyers rallied to Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento’s side, and on Saturday, he will don a green graduation gown and cross the stage as part of the class of 2018 at Stephen F. Austin High School. But beyond that stage, his future is decidedly uncertain as he awaits an asylum hearing that will determine his future in the United States. “I actually don’t think this is real,” Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento, 19, said. “I never thought I’d be graduating. I thought I would be in Honduras right now.” "
"It was a long night of Twitter for Roseanne Barr. Hours after ABC canceled her reboot of “Roseanne” because of her racist tweet about a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, Ms. Barr returned to the platform and posted more than 100 times. She tweeted, retweeted, reply-tweeted and, in many cases, deleted tweets from her account, @therealroseanne, which has been active since March 2011 and has 774,000 followers. Ms. Barr’s overnight barrage comprised apologetic remarks, aggrieved statements, personal attacks, fond messages to her supporters and pointed references to the shadowy conspiracy theories that have long been a staple of her social media presence. The stream of tweets began hours after she declared, “I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter.” After two tweets apologizing again to the former presidential adviser, Valerie Jarrett, Ms. Barr addressed her supporters directly at 12:03 a.m. Eastern time, telling them not to defend her — even if she thought it was “sweet” of them to try. Losing her show, she wrote, was nothing compared with being labeled a racist over a single tweet. “That I regret even more,” she wrote. An hour earlier, in a tweet she later deleted, she apologized “to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs.” Not long before that, she retweeted a post from the account @LegendaryEnergy, which has more than 15,000 followers, that defended the post by Ms. Barr that had started the firestorm: a tweet likening Ms. Jarrett to the Muslim Brotherhood and “Planet of the Apes.” "
"WASHINGTON — Virginia’s Republican-controlled Senate voted on Wednesday to open Medicaid to an additional 400,000 low-income adults next year, making it all but certain that the state will join 32 others that have already expanded the public health insurance program under the Affordable Care Act. Republican lawmakers in the state had blocked Medicaid expansion for four straight years, but a number of them dropped their opposition after their party almost lost the House of Delegates in elections last fall and voters named health care as a top issue. The vote, on a budget bill that included the Medicaid expansion, came almost three months after the House approved a similar plan. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat also elected last fall, has been a vocal proponent of the expansion and can now claim a victory that his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, desperately wanted but never got. The House passed the Senate bill within hours; it will now go to Mr. Northam’s desk. The measure includes a requirement that many adult recipients who don’t have a disability either work or volunteer as a condition of receiving Medicaid — a provision that was crucial to getting enough Republicans on board. “This budget is the culmination of five years of effort to bring our taxpayer dollars home from Washington and expand Medicaid,” Mr. Northam, a pediatrician, said in a statement. “As a doctor, I’m so proud of the significant step we’ve taken together to help Virginians get quality, affordable health care.” The Affordable Care Act gave states the option to expand Medicaid starting in 2014, and required the federal government to pay no less than 90 percent of the cost. Opponents said that even 10 percent was unaffordable for most states, and that the federal government might renege on paying its share, especially if the health law were repealed. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Federal regulators unveiled a sweeping plan to soften the Volcker Rule, opening the door for big banks to resume trading activities that were restricted under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, above, said it would streamline “overly complex and inefficient requirements.” The changes would give big banks the freedom to engage in more complicated — and possibly riskier — trading. Consumer advocates and other financial watchdogs say that they would allow a return to the Wild West days on Wall Street. ____ 2. President Trump weighed in on the cancellation of “Roseanne” — sort of. Referencing an apology from the parent company of ABC, Mr. Trump noted that he hadn’t gotten his own “for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” "
"Of course ABC and its parent company Disney were right to cancel the sitcom “Roseanne” after its eponymous star, Roseanne Barr, wrote a racist tweet. There are necessary taboos and essential decencies in every morally healthy society. Writing that Obama administration aide Valerie Jarrett was the baby of “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes” violates these in the foulest of ways. This is not a First Amendment issue. Constitutional rights are what you’re entitled to in the public sphere, not as an employee of a private corporation. Barr’s speech has not been curtailed; she remains free to opine (and mostly free to tweet) to her heart’s content. She’s just not free to do so while getting $250,000 a show from an employer whose reputation she stained and whose values she traduced. This is not a “free speech” issue — using “free speech” in the broader, less legalistic sense of the term. The University of Chicago president, Robert Zimmer, has made the case that institutions like his, though not strictly subject to the First Amendment, should nonetheless encourage the free and vigorous exchange of ideas for the sake of fostering intellectual excellence. That’s right. But what Barr tweeted wasn’t an idea. It was a slur. This is not a “double standards” issue. With his trademark combination of puerile self-pity and fang-toothed nastiness, Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to denounce Disney’s chairman, Robert Iger, for not apologizing to him for the “HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” But he’s the ultimate public figure, whereas Jarrett is a private citizen subjected to unprovoked racial attack by an ABC employee. That the president fails or refuses to appreciate the distinction is the thousandth reminder of his unfitness for office. This is not a “one bad tweet” issue. In March, I argued that Kevin Williamson, the conservative writer briefly hired by The Atlantic, should be judged by the totality of his work, not by a vile tweet (and, as it later turned out, a discussion on a podcast) in which he seemed to suggest that women who get abortions should be hanged. Williamson insists his comments were misunderstood, but that’s another story. The relevant question here is: What’s the “totality” of Barr’s work, at least when it comes to political and racial questions? John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine, summed it up perfectly when he described Barr as “a boor,” a “notorious believer and propagator of conspiracy theories related to 9/11,” and, in all, “not merely a loose cannon but a MIRVed ICBM ready to go off in all directions at any time.” "
"The boos cascaded from the stands, wafting over Monument Park, turning a moment of between-inning indifference at Yankee Stadium into a visceral spirit cleansing. That it was directed toward a former mayor was no surprise; sports fans excel at heaping opprobrium on political leaders when they intrude into their temples. But that it occurred to Rudolph W. Giuliani, on the occasion of his 74th birthday on Memorial Day, in a stadium that has long been a safe space, was different — a reflection, perhaps, of how Mr. Giuliani and the city he once led have drifted apart. A brief video of the booing quickly made the rounds on social media, heartening many Democrats angry at Mr. Giuliani’s strenuous defense of President Trump on television. “I used to boo him 20 years ago,” said Ruben Diaz Jr., 45, the Bronx borough president. “But if there was one place in the whole world he was popular, it was inside Yankee Stadium. Boy have times changed.” "
"WASHINGTON — The former acting F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, wrote a confidential memo last spring recounting a conversation that offered significant behind-the-scenes details on the firing of Mr. McCabe’s predecessor, James B. Comey, according to several people familiar with the discussion. Mr. Comey’s firing is a central focus of the special counsel’s investigation into whether President Trump tried to obstruct the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Mr. McCabe has turned over his memo to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. In the document, whose contents have not been previously reported, Mr. McCabe described a conversation at the Justice Department with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, in the chaotic days last May after Mr. Comey’s abrupt firing. Mr. Rosenstein played a key role in the dismissal, writing a memo that rebuked Mr. Comey over his handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton. But in the meeting at the Justice Department, Mr. Rosenstein added a new detail: He said the president had originally asked him to reference Russia in his memo, the people familiar with the conversation said. Mr. Rosenstein did not elaborate on what Mr. Trump had wanted him to say. To Mr. McCabe, that seemed like possible evidence that Mr. Comey’s firing was actually related to the F.B.I.’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, and that Mr. Rosenstein helped provide a cover story by writing about the Clinton investigation. One person who was briefed on Mr. Rosenstein’s conversation with the president said Mr. Trump had simply wanted Mr. Rosenstein to mention that he was not personally under investigation in the Russia inquiry. Mr. Rosenstein said it was unnecessary and did not include such a reference. Mr. Trump ultimately said it himself when announcing the firing. "
"In an attempt to deter migrant families from crossing the border, the Trump administration has been separating children from their parents and sending them to different shelters or foster homes, where they may be kept apart for weeks or even months. This policy, which has affected approximately 700 children so far, violates basic human rights and horrifies any parent with enough imagination to put themselves in the place of these immigrants. As members of a team of researchers who have investigated the impact of separating children from their parents during early childhood, we were struck by another aspect of this news: In an effort to increase security, the Trump administration has hit upon a policy that we know is actually likely to increase delinquency and criminality among these children in the future. While trying to protect American citizens, the administration may be placing them in greater jeopardy. If we have learned nothing else in the past 50 years of research on child development, it is that children do best in families and that violating this norm has terrible effects. In a long-term study of children separated from their parents early in life and raised for periods without family members, we and our colleagues — Nathan Fox, Kathryn Humphreys, Katie McLaughlin and Charley Zeanah — found a profound impact on their cognitive ability, social function, mental health and brain development. In early 2001, in Bucharest, Romania, we began studying orphaned and abandoned infants ranging in age from 6 months to 30 months. Some of the children remained in the care of institutions for the majority of their lives, while others left institutional care early in life and were placed with loving families. We have followed these children since to observe their mental health and emotional well-being, their brain structure and function, and their cognitive ability. We found that children who remained in institutions had lower I.Q.s than their peers who were randomly assigned to family care. The I.Q. gap decreased as the children grew older, but it has not been erased by time. The same can be said for their “executive functions,” which include their ability to plan and to regulate their emotions and behavior. "
"— President Trump, speaking at the signing of “right to try” legislation on Wednesday The legislation that Mr.  Trump signed into law on Wednesday allows terminally ill patients to seek access to experimental medicine that is not yet fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Whether it will save “hundreds of thousands of lives” is a prediction that is, at best, unclear. But the effect of similar laws in some states has been muted. A program known as compassionate use, or expanded access, has been in place since the 1970s. It allows patients with a serious disease or condition to obtain experimental medicines; the Food and Drug Administration says it authorizes 99 percent of the requests for expanded access that it receives. The new national law — like similar laws in more than three dozen states — allows patients and doctors to ask drug companies directly for access to the experimental drugs, rather than wait for  approval by the agency. Yet these laws “do not ensure that manufacturers will provide the drug or that insurance companies will cover the cost,” according to a policy report from Rice University. Obtaining the medicines from manufacturers can be more cumbersome than going through the Food and Drug Administration’s existing program, the report found. Colorado enacted the first right-to-try law in 2014. Since then, “there have been no documented cases of anyone receiving access, because of a right-to-try law, to an experimental product that would not have been available via the F.D.A.’s expanded access program,” a 2017 study by researchers from New York University concluded. Alison Bateman-House, a professor of medical ethics and an author of the study, called it “extremely unlikely” that the national right-to-try law would directly save hundreds of thousands of lives, given that drug companies are using — and accustomed to — the existing  process. “It’s impossible to tell how many people will be helped by the federal right-to-try law,” said Christina Sandefur, the executive vice president of the Goldwater Institute, the conservative group that spearheaded the effort. But “if it saves one person, it’s worth it,” she said, adding, “For the patients who are turned away from clinical trials and who are unable to navigate the complex expanded access process, right to try will give them a last chance — and the right to hope.” While the law itself may have a minimal effect, Dr. Bateman-House said, the right-to-try movement and the attention that Mr. Trump has drawn to it are positive steps toward raising patients’ awareness for experimental treatment. She predicted that the number of patients asking for developing medicines will increase — just under the current expanded access program. "
"After news came from Kiev on Tuesday that a Russian journalist critical of Vladimir Putin had been shot dead, it did not take long for the Kremlin’s denial machinery to shift into high gear. Another case of Russophobia, cried government officials and their media acolytes, anticipating that Russia would be blamed. An attempt to mar the World Cup soccer tournament; a typical example of Ukraine’s “bloody crimes and total impunity.” The reality turned out to be a bit more complicated when the journalist, Arkady Babchenko, appeared at a news conference the next day very much alive, and Ukrainian security services announced that his “murder” had been a sting operation to foil a plot by Russian security services to kill him. Ukrainian authorities certainly must explain why they felt it necessary to compromise journalistic integrity to stage this bizarre episode; they have doubtless supplied fodder to conspiracy theorists and cynical denouncers of “fake news” everywhere. One thing is certain: The Kremlin will seize on this official deceit to show the lengths to which its enemies will go to tarnish Russia. That has been Russia’s reaction to all accusations of foul play, whether it’s the well-documented charges by the Netherlands, Australia and other nations that it was responsible for downing a Malaysian jetliner over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298; or the British accusation that Russia was most likely behind the poisoning of a double agent and his daughter in England; or the charge by American intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the presidential campaign. Each such accusation is met by a barrage of official denials on state television and mockery on social media. In the official version Russia is always the victim of a dastardly and demeaning Western campaign; it was the Ukrainians who shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 to make Russia look bad; it was the British who poisoned Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and when she gave an interview to Reuters, it was obvious she was coerced. This is not so different from the response of President Trump to the mounting evidence that aides and advisers to his campaign had numerous questionable contacts with Russian representatives seeking to aid his election. He claims it’s all a sinister plot by agents of the “deep state” or former President Barack Obama to plant “spies” to undercut his campaign. Such instinctive denials were a fixture of the Soviet Union, where the Communist Party treated any questioning of its infallibility as a crime. Speaking the truth was dangerous. Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s impassioned essay “Live Not by Lies” appeared the day before he was exiled in 1974; Mikhail Gorbachev’s most radical reform was “glasnost,” or openness. In Vladimir Putin’s Russia, bluster and lying have been restored to primacy. "
"We as a nation have crossed so many ugly lines recently, yet one new policy of President Trump’s particularly haunts me. I’m speaking of the administration’s tactic of seizing children from desperate refugees at the border. “I was given only five minutes to say goodbye,” a Salvadoran woman wrote in a declaration in an A.C.L.U. lawsuit against the government, after her 4- and 10-year-old sons were taken from her. “My babies started crying when they found out we were going to be separated.” “In tears myself, I asked my boys to be brave, and I promised we would be together soon. I begged the woman who took my children to keep them together so they could at least have each other.” This mother, who for her protection is identified only by her initials, J.I.L., said that while in El Salvador she was severely beaten in front of her family by a gang, and she then fled the country to save the lives of her children. Who among us would not do the same? J.I.L. noted that she had heard that her children might have been separated and sent to two different foster homes, and added: “I am scared for my little boys.” Is this really who we are? As a parent, as the son of a refugee myself, I find that in this case Trump’s policy has veered from merely abhorrent to truly evil. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is poised to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the European Union, and possibly on Canada and Mexico, this week when a temporary exemption expires as trade talks remain at an impasse, according to a person familiar with the White House discussions. The threat of tariffs was supposed to force trading partners into quickly agreeing to United States concessions, including limiting imports of steel and aluminum and other trade terms that favor American companies and workers. In addition to the metal tariffs, President Trump has threatened to impose levies on imported automobiles, the bulk of which comes from allies like Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union. The White House has tried to leverage the tariffs to get Canada and Mexico to agree to its demands on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and it has pressured Europe to make trade concessions on other fronts, including cutting the amount of metals the bloc exports to the United States. So far, the Trump administration’s aggressive approach appears to have only hardened the resolve among the United States’ closest allies to fight back against Mr. Trump’s demands. Discussions between the countries are continuing and Mr. Trump could ultimately decide not to impose tariffs on any of the trading partners. But with the exemption deadline quickly approaching and the countries still far apart on many issues, a resolution could be tough to pull off by Friday. "
"The toppling of Roseanne Barr — from her racist late-night tweet to the early-morning backlash and ABC’s axing of her highly rated show — took less than 12 hours. That is the equivalent of hyperspeed for businesses and brands that are accustomed to taking their time when it comes to high-stakes decisions about key employees who land in hot water. But the intensity and immediacy of the social media age have turned corporate crisis management into an exercise where minutes, and sometimes seconds, count. And the praise that ABC executives received this week for their swift response will most likely serve as an example to other businesses facing public relations disasters. “It’s the concept of the golden hour of crisis response,” said Kara Alaimo, who teaches public relations and reputation management at Hofstra University. “It’s a term borrowed from emergency medicine: Everyone knows if you get a heart attack victim to the hospital in the first hour, they’re more likely to survive.” Ms. Alaimo added: “If you respond quickly, you get to frame the narrative, rather than allowing other people to frame your actions and motivations for you. That is the key to surviving a crisis on social media.” Still, every public-relations fiasco is unique, a circumstantial stew of cultural context, financial consequence and the particular flavor of the offense. In some ways, experts said, ABC and its corporate parent, the Walt Disney Company, benefited from the sheer outrageousness of Ms. Barr’s remark, which depicted Valerie Jarrett, an African-American woman and one of President Barack Obama’s closest advisers, as the product of “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.” "

"On Tuesday, ABC canceled its “Roseanne” revival, the network’s first No. 1 show in 24 years, after its star Roseanne Barr referred to Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, as the offspring of the “Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes.” The decision prompted surprise, relief and schadenfreude from many on the left, who already regarded the sitcom — in which Barr’s character, like Barr herself, is a supporter of President Trump and his radical racist authoritarian ideology — as an alarming bellwether of Trumpism’s slide into normalcy. Meanwhile, the right-wing backlash is unfolding as scripted: the usual cries of censorship, the usual recriminations about liberal celebrities who once said something mean, the usual lamentations about politically correct overreach, the usual free-market fetishists suddenly oppressed by the marketplace of ideas. Barr attributed her gleeful antebellum-vintage racism to the sleep aid Ambien and played down her comment as a joke (yes, we know, a racist one). Trump — who himself referred to some immigrants as “animals” this month — predictably joined in, whining that Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, “never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” Right-wing Twitter (including Barr’s own feed) is now thick with similar sentiments: Here is Joy Behar saying something cutting about Trump. Here is Jimmy Kimmel. Here is Michelle Wolf. Why didn’t the outrage mob come for them? One important difference is that it is possible, or at least up for debate, for Trump’s decorum, health care plan, tax bill or hair to deserve mockery. It is not possible, and well beyond the realm of debate, for black people to deserve five centuries of racialized brutality and dehumanization. Chattel slavery in America ended 153 years ago. I am only 36 years old, and when my father was born, there were black Americans alive who remembered being the property of white people. Slavery is not our distant past; it is yesterday. Descendants of slaves (again, only a few generations removed) have never been compensated for the hundreds of years of unpaid forced labor upon which white Americans built generational wealth and economic stability. The culturally and legislatively enforced poverty, subjugation and mass incarceration of black people continue to this day, while white supremacist violence saturates our news media, whether it’s identified as such or not.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Italy’s political crisis, Ukraine’s fake assassination and Germany’s simmering culture war. Here’s the latest: • Italy is confronting a political crisis, one that could mean big trouble for the world economy. Our economics columnist lays out the stakes: Italy has the fourth-largest economy in Europe and one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere. In Rome, Italy’s populist parties continued their efforts to form a government. Meanwhile, next up to test Europe’s stability is Spain, where a corruption scandal has damaged the prime minister’s party and spurred calls for his ouster. _____ • President Trump told Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March 2017 that he should reverse his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Sessions refused, but the previously unreported confrontation is being investigated by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump reiterated that he wished he had chosen another attorney general instead of Mr. Sessions, above at the Justice Department in March. "

"Representative Diane Black, a Republican who is a candidate for Tennessee governor, drew criticism this week for saying that the “root” causes of gun violence included the “deterioration of family,” violent movies and widely available pornography. A spokesman for Ms. Black’s campaign said she was referring to factors that contribute to violence. “It’s no surprise that the liberal media would misconstrue the views of conservative Christians,” the spokesman, Chris Hartline, said in an email on Wednesday. “Diane, like many others, believes that the breakdown of family values and social structures is a contributing factor to violence. That’s clear if you actually listen to her words instead of reading clickbait headlines.” Ms. Black, a gun rights supporter who opposes firearm restrictions, made the comments in a meeting with local pastors last week, according to HuffPost, which obtained audio that was recorded at the gathering. “Why do we see kids being so violent?” she can be heard asking. “Because as a nurse I go back to root cause. And I think there’s a couple.” “I think it’s deterioration of family,” she added. “They don’t have that good support system,” which leads children “in the wrong direction.” Idle hands are the Devil’s workshop, Ms. Black said. She then brought up “violent movies” as being part of the problem, a claim that experts have disputed. "
"WASHINGTON — Kim Kardashian West met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, and the subject seemed an unlikely one for a glamorous celebrity and cosmetics mogul: prison reform. But the reason for Ms. Kardashian West’s interest is the case of Alice Johnson, a 63-year-old Tennessee woman who, according to the nonprofit project Can-Do, was sentenced in 1996 to life in prison on charges related to cocaine possession and money laundering. Brittany K. Barnett, a member of Ms. Johnson’s legal team, said Ms. Kardashian West and her lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, were scheduled to meet with a group of White House officials — including the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Their goal was to raise the issue of clemency for Ms. Johnson. They ended up meeting with not just the initial group, but with the president, too. “It was very general,” Ms. Barnett said of the meeting. “We just don’t know, but it seems like the meeting was positive, and it is in President Trump’s hands now as to what he decides to do.” The president posted on Twitter shortly afterward about what he called a “great meeting,” and he said that they had discussed “prison reform and sentencing.” "
"Two weeks after a student armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a revolver killed 10 people at a high school outside Houston, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Wednesday proposed spending more than $100 million to put more police and armed guards on school campuses and expand programs to identify students at risk of engaging in mass violence. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, also proposed stepping up security at schools by limiting the number of entrances and exits, and installing alarms specifically designated to warn of active shooters. “You have to know who is coming into the school, and you have to know who is leaving it,” Mr. Abbott said. But his school safety plan contained only modest changes to gun laws: He proposed requiring parents to keep firearms locked away from children under the age of 18, a tightening of current law which requires such controls for families with children younger than 17. He also proposed improvements to the system for reporting felony convictions and adjudications of mental illness, both of which trigger prohibitions on gun possession under federal law. And he asked state legislators to “consider the merits” of passing a so-called red flag law that would allow the police, family members or a school employee to petition a judge to temporarily take guns away from someone deemed a threat to themselves or others. Texas would become one of only about 10 states with red flag laws, if legislators were to pass such a law, though proposals for similar legislation are pending in more than a dozen other states. “I will never allow Second Amendment rights to be infringed, but I will always promote responsible gun ownership, which includes keeping guns safe and keeping them out of the hands of criminals,” Mr. Abbott said. He said his aim was not to expand regulations, but help schools accomplish what they already want to do — protect students. “They don’t need mandates from the state,” he said. “They need assistance from the state.” "
"WASHINGTON — Federal agents are struggling to stop opioid smugglers who are reaping vast profits, according to interviews and documents, as the number of Americans dying from drug overdoses continues to rise. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security say the drugs are shipped in such minute amounts that detecting them among cargo in a tractor-trailer is close to impossible. That the drugs increasingly are bought  online and shipped directly to buyers — either through the Postal Service or commercial couriers like FedEx and UPS — makes inspections all the more difficult. “The sheer logistical nature of trying to pick out which packages contain opioids makes it much more challenging,” said Robert E. Perez, an acting executive assistant commissioner at United States Customs and Border Protection, an arm of the department. “It’s unlike anything we’ve encountered.” China is the largest source of illegal fentanyl for American buyers, officials said, and buyers are increasingly paying with digital currencies for drugs that are shipped through other countries — often Mexico or Canada — to reduce the risk of the opioids being tracked and seized by customs officials. “When you’re dealing with very small, minute quantities, it’s kind of like death by a thousand cuts,” said Patrick J. Lechleitner, the special agent in charge of the Washington office of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “You used to have the tractor-trailer running up the interstate, with its contraband, that had to be met by someone and distributed,” Mr. Lechleitner said. “Now, you have an individual sitting somewhere in middle America ordering this thing, and it arrives as a parcel at their house.” "
"NEW YORK — Banks and energy companies surged Wednesday and smaller companies made huge gains as stocks got back almost all the ground they lost the day before. Investors reversed course as they hoped Italy would be able to avoid a new round of elections after all. Financial companies rallied as bond yields turned higher and energy companies rose along with U.S. crude oil, which busted out of a five-day losing streak. The shift came after Carlo Cottarelli, nominated to be Italy's next prime minister, said there were ""new possibilities"" to form a government. Stocks had plunged the previous day as investors expected gridlock to be resolved with new elections that could have turned into a yes-or-no referendum deciding whether Italy would continue to use the euro. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said the market often reacts irregularly to political events like the uncertainty in Italy or tensions between the U.S. and North Korea: stocks often fall fast and then recover in quick fashion. That process can sometimes repeat itself weeks or months later. ""If there's no follow-up news, they tend to come back near where they started,"" he said. ""I wouldn't count on it being done for the summer."" The S&P 500 index jumped 34.15 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,724.01.

"Before reading the article: Read the introductory paragraphs in today’s Article of the Day: Now consider: What is the purpose of this Times article? Then, before reading the rest of the article, if you have you been following these immigration-related news stories, explain what you think you understand about what is going on with immigrant children. Now, read the article, “Did the Trump Administration Separate Immigrant Children From Parents and Lose Them?,” and answer the following questions: 1. Who are the 1,475 unaccounted-for children who have been labeled “lost”? Why did they come to the United States? From where? In what way are they unaccounted-for? 2. What is the Trump administration’s policy on separating migrant children from their parents at the border? Is this a new policy? 3. How did these two stories — the 1,500 “lost” children and the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from families — get confused on social media? (You can look at this tweet as an example of this confusion.) 4. What will happen to undocumented immigrants — both adults and children — under the new “zero tolerance” policy, and why? Finally, tell us more about what you think: What do you think should be done with undocumented children — both children accompanied by adults and children arriving alone — who enter the United States either illegally or by presenting themselves at ports of entry seeking asylum? Why? Do you agree with the Trump administration that children — for example, 4-year-olds or 9-year olds — should be separated from their parents when they cross the border illegally? Do you think this “zero tolerance” policy is good public policy? Is it a fair and just government response to illegal immigration — as the attorney general said, “If you don’t like that, then don’t smuggle children over our border”? Or do you think the policy is ”not a response worthy of a great and humane nation,” and that it is “cruel” and heartless,” as critics stated in this article? Explain your answer.

"O
ne winter morning in a conventional suburb outside Albany, N.Y., Nancy Salzman, the 63-year-old president of a self-improvement company named Nxivm, sat on a mahogany-colored stool in her kitchen. Her tasteful home was surrounded by other Nxivm members’ modest townhouses or capacious stone mansions that seemed to spring up out of nowhere, like mushrooms, on the suburban streets. In Salzman’s den, a photo of her with her two adult daughters hung on a wall, the three of them wearing smiles as wide as ancient Greek masks of comedy; the same happy photo served as the wallpaper on Salzman’s laptop. A hairless Sphynx cat prowled the lovely buffet of croissants and fruit on her kitchen island. Salzman, an extremely fit woman wearing the type of thin athleisure sweatshirt that’s all the rage with the middle-aged bourgeoisie these days, turned her attention to a woman sitting at the island: Jacqueline, a 27-year-old psychology student with long dark hair, who told me that she hadn’t experienced anything as effective as Nxivm (pronounced “nexium,” like the heartburn medication). Like Scientology’s L. Ron Hubbard, whose 1950 handbook “Dianetics” was billed as the “modern science of mental health” and whose pseudoscientific methods were, in his view, world-changing, Keith Raniere, Nxivm’s 57-year-old founder, believed his organization could heal individuals and transform the world. The way Nxivm did this was through techniques, or “technology,” meant to rewire your emotional self. Salzman, who has training in neurolinguistic programming, which involves hypnosis and techniques of mirroring another individual to create deep rapport, was about to embark on a therapy session in which she would ask Jacqueline to cast her mind back to her childhood, as Nxivm sessions often do. Jacqueline had come to her with a phobia: She flips out when she gets on a plane. One time, she had to get off an airplane that had boarded because she became nervous, and when she wanted to get back on, the flight attendants wouldn’t let her. Salzman nodded. In a near whisper, she asked Jacqueline a stream of intimate questions not only about her fear of flying but also about her parents’ relationship. She ascertained that Jacqueline believed her mother was ill used by her father, who forced the family to move often, by air. “It was always gray around her,” Jacqueline said sadly, of her mother. “She had a horrible life.” But at the same time, she said, her upbringing made her feel as if she always needed a man to protect her. Listening to Salzman’s questions, it became clear that she was positing that these issues — Jacqueline’s fear of flying; her belief that her mother was forced into a terrible life by her father; and her inability to be an independent woman — were connected. We are controlling our own lives all the time, Salzman said. We are all in complete control. Jacqueline’s mom had been in control but had chosen to be a victim. And Jacqueline was in control and had chosen to be a victim, too. “Are you pretending to be a helpless woman?” Salzman said earlier. “That’s the way I receive attention, that’s kind of my thing,” Jacqueline said. “Women are allowed to be dependent on men,” Salzman explained. “A great part of being a woman is no matter how you screw up your life, you can always move back in with your dad. Every time you have chosen to stay dependent, you have made a decision not to be independent.” What if she became the person she relied on? "
"WASHINGTON — An American-backed ground offensive to wipe out the last pockets of Islamic State fighters in eastern Syria has been reignited over the past month in an attempt to beat back the militants’ ability to wage guerrilla attacks. The mission against the Islamic State has been invigorated by the return of top Kurdish commanders, a surge in French commandos, the arrival of Navy fighter jets and some secret sleuthing by Iraqi spies. But the campaign may have only little more than six months to hunt down the few hundred fighters — not enough time to extinguish a threat that is quickly moving underground. The new momentum remains imperiled by President Trump’s on-again, off-again threat to withdraw some 2,000 American troops in Syria, including hundreds of Special Operations advisers and commandos. A force of allied Kurds and Arabs in Syria’s east has served as the United States’ most effective battleground ally against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. But a spate of Turkish attacks last winter against other Kurds, in northwest Syria, prompted the Kurdish fighters to peel away from the American-led assault near the Iraqi border. Their absence allowed many of the remaining Islamic State militants to flee, regain scraps of territory and renew guerrilla attacks from hide-outs across the country. Trump administration officials said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and top American commanders now have been given at least six months to stamp out the Islamic State in Syria’s east. "
"The Wicked Witch of the West has been good to Joe Mantello. The caretaker of the green-complexioned Elphaba of Emerald City has a piece of the yellow brick road on the Great White Way. The director of the billion-dollar musical “Wicked,’’ who says he was once “desperate and unhirable,” can now afford to choose what he wants to work on. And what he has chosen has made him the hottest director on Broadway, with three shows going simultaneously, two on the same block of West 45th Street. Slender and soft-spoken, Mr. Mantello, at 55, has already won two Tonys for directing, for “Take Me Out” and “Assassins.” And he is nominated for another one at the June 10 ceremony, for helming the scorching revival of Edward Albee’s “Three Tall Women,” with Laurie Metcalf, Alison Pill and the glorious 82-year-old Glenda Jackson playing a role based on Mr. Albee’s adoptive mother, relishing what The New York Times called her “Queen Lear moment.” Also on 45th Street, at the Booth Theater, Mr. Mantello’s other revival has its official opening on Thursday: “The Boys in the Band,” Mart Crowley’s funny and devastating 1968 examination of gay shame in the era before AIDS at the dawn of Stonewall, produced by Ryan Murphy and David Stone, and starring Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer and Andrew Rannells of “Girls” and “Book of Mormon” fame. When Mr. Murphy first proposed the revival, Mr. Mantello worried that the play, bristling with gay self-loathing and mutual annihilation, was too campy and dated. But Mr. Murphy suggested that his friend view it in Albee-esque terms, and the director heard its similarities in tone with “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” “There’s a lot of booze downed during the evening, and they play games,” Mr. Mantello says, adding that he came around to the idea that they shouldn’t “just relegate ‘Boys in the Band’ to the ash heap because it’s embarrassing. I thought we should look at what internalized oppression does. And if you aren’t terrified that this administration is going to take your rights away and you think we can’t go back there, you’re wrong.” "
"SYRACUSE, N.Y. — As a first-time Democratic congressional candidate, Juanita Perez Williams would seem to check off many of her party’s most prized boxes: female, person of color, military veteran and, as the runner-up in last year’s mayoral race in Syracuse, local name recognition. Those attributes have not been lost on national party leaders, who were looking for a formidable candidate to challenge the Republican incumbent, John Katko, in the 24th Congressional District in Central New York, a key battleground race. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee not only successfully wooed Ms. Perez Williams to run, it also helped her collect signatures on petitions to get on the primary ballot, and it placed her on its coveted “red to blue” list, a nationwide roster of candidates who receive fund-raising and strategic support. Her candidacy, however, has not come without controversy: Well before Ms. Perez Williams officially kicked off her campaign last month, another Democrat, Dana Balter, was already the established choice of four Democratic county committees. The June 26 primary between Ms. Balter and Ms. Perez Williams illustrates the national Democrats’ sense of urgency in devoting attention and resources to races they deem winnable. But in the case of the 24th District, the party’s priorities do not always jibe with the interests of those closer to the scene. Indeed, the leaders of the local Democratic committees issued a joint statement that accused the D.C.C.C. of failing to take “into account the work happening at the grass roots this year,” adding that they stood behind Ms. Balter and against the Washington “meddling that has hampered far too many races thus far.” "
"Among Trump-supporting religious believers, the long odds he overcame to win the presidency are often interpreted as a providential sign: Only God could have put Donald Trump in the White House, which means he must be there for some high and holy purpose. The trouble with this theory is that it’s way too simplistic about what kind of surprises an interventionist deity might have in mind. Such a God might, for instance, offer political success as a temptation rather than a reward — or use an unexpected presidency not to save Americans but to chastise them. We’re a long way from any final judgment on God’s purposes in the Trump era. But so far the Trump presidency has clearly been a kind of apocalypse — not (yet) in the “world-historical calamity” sense of the word, but in the original Greek meaning: an unveiling, an uncovering, an exposure of truths that had heretofore been hidden. That exposure came first for the Republican Party’s establishment, who were revealed as something uncomfortably close to liberal caricature in their mix of weakness, cynicism and power worship. It came next for the technocrats and the data nerds of the Democratic Party, who were revealed as ineffectual, clueless and self-regarding in opposing Trump’s clown-car campaign. And then it came for a range of celebrated media men, from Harvey Weinstein to Matt Lauer, who found that in the backlash against Trump’s misogyny their own sins were suddenly exposed. But the unveiling has not been confined, as Trump’s providentialist supporters might like to imagine, to institutions and individuals that have arrayed themselves against him. It has come as well for figures whose style anticipated him (Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, that whole ménage) and for figures who have deliberately attached themselves to his populist revolt. The sins of Roy Moore were more exposed by the Trump era, and now likewise the racist paranoia of Roseanne Barr. And lately a similar moral exposure has come to precisely the sector of American Christianity where support for Donald Trump ran strongest — the denominational heart of conservative evangelicalism, the Southern Baptist Convention.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The country’s recent political convulsions have raised fears about the future of the euro, the common currency of the European Union, drawing uncertainty far beyond its borders. By effectively blocking two populist parties from forming a government, President Sergio Mattarella may have laid the groundwork for a new election that could amount to a referendum on the euro. We answered 10 questions about the turmoil in Italy. Markets dropped sharply on Tuesday (the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent). That suggests investors think the risk of something calamitous happening in Europe has risen, even if it’s still unlikely. Our senior economics correspondent explains. • A new  Italian election would be horrifically bad timing for the E.U., as several members are in a state of political flux, our chief diplomatic correspondent writes. • Last week, we included a quote from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said of the suspension of U.S. tariffs against Beijing, “We’re putting the trade war on hold.” That was then. On Tuesday, the White House announced that the U.S. would move ahead with its plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of imported Chinese goods. "

The public has two defenses against recklessness on Wall Street – regulations and the regulators themselves. Now, with the Trump administration’s rule loosening in full swing, the public can only hope that the men and women who oversee the big banks are up to their jobs. Federal regulators on Wednesday proposed a sweeping set of changes that would relax the Volcker rule, a major regulation introduced after the financial crisis of 2008 to stop taxpayer-protected banks from speculating for their own profit. The rule, which came into effect in 2015, was always going to create some headaches. Banks trade regularly to meet the demands of customers and to hedge their own risks. The Volcker rule allows that sort of trading, but regulators had to have ways of making sure a bank wasn’t speculating for its own gain under the guise of serving customers or hedging. To do that, the final rule included requirements that effectively forced banks to show that they were only doing the legitimate types of trading. Banks complained about the rule’s complexity, and regulators said it was hard to enforce. The changes proposed on Wednesday give the banks considerable new leeway. Here are three ways in which traders gain ground. • Currently, a bank’s short-term trading positions are at the outset presumed to be in violation of the rule, and banks must show that the positions were held to serve customers or hedge. The new Volcker rule presumes compliance. The balance of power will tip immediately to traders from regulators. "
"TOKYO — Ever since President Trump pulled out of planned talks with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, officials from both countries have been scrambling to salvage the summit meeting and keep it on track for June 12 in Singapore. A process that would normally take months is now being compressed into days, with meetings taking place between North Korean and American officials all over the world. Here is a rundown of who is meeting whom, and what they might be talking about. Kim Yong-chol, one of Kim Jong-un’s most trusted aides, arrived in New York on Wednesday for talks with Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state. The two had dinner together on Wednesday night as they worked on strengthening their personal relationship, a senior State Department official said. They face a monumental task: finding a path to denuclearization. Analysts believe that Mr. Pompeo will seek to clarify the North’s position on its nuclear program, which may have gotten muddled during Mr. Pompeo’s two visits to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-un. Kim Yong-chol was also at those meetings. “The gap they have to work on between them is a road map toward denuclearization,” said Ri Pyong Hwi, an associate professor at Korea University, a pro-Pyongyang institution in Tokyo. “How they narrow the gap is the point.” "
"When Pusha-T raps, it’s with the air of a stern father lecturing his children, who may or may not be listening. But it doesn’t matter which — the teaching is its own end. That’s been the case since his days rapping alongside his brother, Malice, as one-half of the Clipse; together, they were responsible for some of the most ferocious and meticulous drug-dealing-demimonde rapping the genre has ever seen. But Malice has become No Malice — he’s given himself to a higher power — and Pusha-T is left to till that poisoned soil on his own. He is 41 now, and committed to the work, making canvases that look similar from far away but up close reveal a fluency in pointillist detail. On “Daytona,” his fourth solo release — at seven songs totaling 22 minutes, it’s an EP masquerading as an album — he remains rigorous, declaiming with a severe voice salted with light gravel. His topic: Ethics. A code of conduct derived from a bygone era in rap. Every time Pusha-T mentions Ghostface Killah and Raekwon, or alludes to the Lox, or name-checks Akinyele, he prizes a kind of street formalism particular to the New York (and New-York-inspired) rap of the 1990s, which has now largely been relegated to the underground.

On “Hard Piano,” he’s sneering, and “The Games We Play” is staggeringly good: “Caviar facials remove the toxins/This ain’t for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters.” On “Come Back Baby,” he traces the path from illegal business to legal, from anonymity to fame back to anonymity: Pusha-T doesn’t hurry; he’s sniper patient. On songs like “If You Know You Know,” he sometimes raps so crisply and sparsely — “A rapper turned trapper can’t morph into us/But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff” — that he almost feels disconnected from the song’s rhythm. His syllables have hard edges, and rarely does he let feeling get in the way, though the one exception is “Santeria,” inspired by the murder of his road manager. On this song, you can almost hear the wetness in Pusha-T’s rhymes, his typical stoicism traded for something a little short of breath. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. One of the two political parties is running a midterm campaign based largely on identity politics and President Trump — but it’s not the Democratic Party. The two most common themes in television advertisements by Republican candidates so far in the midterm election are Trump and immigration, according to a fascinating USA Today analysis. The immigration ads often mimic Trump’s harsh tone, talking about “illegals” who steal American jobs and the need for “a darn wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border. Is it possible to be in favor of a tougher immigration policy without race-baiting? Absolutely. But there is no reason to believe that “illegals” are really one of the country’s biggest problems today. A candidate who turns immigrants into a nefarious symbol of America’s ills is using them as a symbol of otherness — much as Trump did, often with blatantly racist overtones, in his presidential campaign. “Republicans have aired more than 14,000 campaign ads touting a tough Trump-style immigration platform this year,” write USA Today’s Deirdre Shesgreen and Eliza Collins. They add: “The GOP focus on immigration is particularly striking, given that it was not among the top 10 issues Republicans spent their ad dollars on at this point in the 2014 midterms. In that cycle, GOP contenders attacked President Obama, bashing the Affordable Care Act and promising to rein in government spending.” "
"Everyone is sure someone is going to die in Wednesday night’s series finale of “The Americans” on FX. But who? Hundreds of readers sent in predictions for the ending. Their plots ranged from the simple — an-eye-for-an-eye justice — to the fittingly byzantine. From the bloodless to the hemorrhagic. Many viewers assume, based on a tiny clip in the previews for the finale, that the Jennings family is heading north, hoping to grab Henry and escape via Canada. Readers’ thoughts, edited and excerpted, appear below. In a “Waco-type siege” in New Hampshire “Stan is seriously wounded by Elizabeth. Philip wants to surrender. Elizabeth threatens to shoot him, and Paige shoots her mother.” — John, Florida “Elizabeth and Philip will do a Thelma and Louise and commit suicide together.” — Jim, New York “As much as I would like to see Philip and Elizabeth escape, it would be too unrealistic. You can’t do that much damage and kill so many people and then get away scot free. At least one of them should die and I think it should be Elizabeth.” — J-Tee, Manitoba “Philip, Elizabeth and Paige are killed in a car accident while speeding to New Hampshire to pick up Henry. Perhaps Philip crashes the car purposefully because he fears the F.B.I. is closing in; perhaps it’s raining and he simply loses control. We will never know.” — JKerwin, Los Angeles “I think it’s going to end the same way “The Spy Who Came in From the Cold” ended, unfortunately. They’re both going to die, one of them self-sacrificially.” — Martin Snapp, Oakland, Calif. "
"A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday ordered lawyers for Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime fixer, to complete within just over two weeks their review of a huge trove of documents and data that the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen last month and that prosecutors are eager to use in their continuing investigation of him. The judge, Kimba M. Wood, said that if the lawyers did not meet her June 15 deadline, she would allow the government to take control of the review, which is seeking to determine whether any of the seized paperwork or electronic files should be protected under the lawyer-client privilege. A court-appointed special master has been overseeing scrutiny of the materials with Mr. Cohen’s lawyers, but Judge Wood suggested in a hearing in United States District Court that the process was moving too slowly. “It is important for the court to balance the slow, deliberate needs of those who are asserting attorney-client privilege,” Judge Wood said, “with the need for an investigation to go forward.” On Tuesday, the special master, Barbara S. Jones, reported to the judge that more than one million items from three of Mr. Cohen’s cellphones would be turned over to the government on Wednesday after lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump determined that they contained no privileged information. About 300,000 additional files were turned over to prosecutors last week. Among the items not yet cleared for release, a prosecutor said in court on Wednesday, were the contents of two BlackBerry phones and of one of Mr. Cohen’s shredders. Boxes of documents, about a dozen cellphones, iPads and computers, and 19 hard drives and thumb drives were seized on April 9 when federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and hotel room.

"WASHINGTON — It was not the racist comment that made the president angry. It was the apology from ABC. Wading into a public outcry over remarks by the comedian Roseanne Barr, President Trump did not condemn the Twitter post about a black former aide to President Barack Obama that led to the swift cancellation of Ms. Barr’s ABC sitcom. Instead, he expressed his own grievances on Wednesday and Thursday with what the network’s on-air personalities have said about him, and insisted he was the one who deserved an apology. Specifically, the president called out Robert A. Iger, the chairman of Disney, the parent company of ABC, who had phoned the former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett, on Tuesday to apologize for Ms. Barr’s language. The president, referring to himself in the third person, complained on Twitter that Mr. Iger had “never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” His response was not a total surprise. Mr. Trump has reacted to other divisive events not by issuing statements of unity or moral clarity as other presidents might have done, but by finding equivalence or diverting attention. He declared last summer that there were “fine people” on both sides of a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., and when African-Americans raised the issue of police brutality last fall, he attacked the N.F.L. players who knelt during the national anthem in protest. While Mr. Trump did not specify the “horrible statements” that he attributed to the network, ABC is home to Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night host who is a notable critic of the president’s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and “The View,” whose panel of pundits like Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg has been a reliable thorn in Mr. Trump’s side. Later in the day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, followed up on the president’s tweet by furnishing a list of expanded gripes that members of the Trump administration have against those in the news media who have slighted the president or his supporters.

"STOCKTON, Calif. — This town in California’s Central Valley has long functioned as a display case for wrenching troubles afflicting American life: The housing bust that turned Stockton into an epicenter of a national foreclosure disaster and plunged the city into bankruptcy. The homeless people clustered in tents along the railroad tracks. Boarded-up storefronts on cracked sidewalks. Gang violence. Now, Stockton hopes to make itself an exhibition ground for elevated fortunes through a simple yet unorthodox experiment. It is readying plans to deliver $500 a month in donated cash to perhaps 100 local families, no strings attached. The trial could start as soon as the fall and continue for about two years. As the first American city to test so-called universal basic income, Stockton will watch what happens next. So will governments and social scientists around the world as they explore how to share the bounty of capitalism more broadly at a time of rising economic inequality. Will single mothers use their cash to pay for child care so they can attend college? Will people confronting choices between buying school supplies or paying their electric bills gain a measure of security? Will families add healthier food to their diets? Basic income is a term that gets thrown around loosely, but the gist is that the government distributes cash universally. As the logic runs, if everyone gets money — rich and poor, the employed and the jobless — it removes the stigma of traditional welfare schemes while ensuring sustenance for all. "
"After more than four months of spiraling political scandal, criminal charges and the threat of impeachment, Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri made a surprise announcement: He would resign his office by the end of the week. It was a sudden switch for a governor who for months defiantly rejected a chorus of calls to quit and who said he had done nothing illegal. On Wednesday, prosecutors in St. Louis said they would dismiss a felony charge against him as part of a deal reached if he resigned. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Greitens’s saga. As he defended himself in recent months, Mr. Greitens chose his words carefully. “Let’s call this what it is,” he said at a news conference last month. “A political witch hunt.” An ad last week, paid for by the governor’s political operation, also used language that sounded borrowed from Mr. Trump. “Don’t let the liberals get away with it,” the narrator urged. “Stand with Eric Greitens.” The ad also referred to “fake news” and a “liberal prosecutor funded by George Soros.” And for months, Mr. Greitens has refused to back down from accusations swirling around him: an extramarital affair and impropriety relating to his political campaign.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he wished he had chosen another lawyer to be his attorney general, instead of Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation early in the Trump administration. But Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said later that the president would not fire Mr. Sessions — at least not before the Russia inquiry has concluded. “There’s no doubt he’s complained about him; there’s no doubt he has some grievances,” Mr. Giuliani told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. “He’s not going to fire him before this is over.” He added, “Nor do I think he should,” an indication that the prospect has been discussed since he joined the president’s legal team a few weeks ago. Mr. Trump was responding on Twitter to a CBS interview with Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, who had said the president was justified in his frustration because Mr. Sessions did not tell Mr. Trump he planned to recuse himself. In the interview on Wednesday morning, Mr. Gowdy said, “There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!” "
"While living in Calgary, the headquarters of Canada’s oil and gas industry, I occasionally heard people in the business say their pipelines were cursed. The country was brimming with oil and gas, and yet battles over proposed pipelines had limited the ability of producers to get those resources to market. The story of the latest controversy, an expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, took a significant turn on Tuesday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government announced it would nationalize it. The government’s purchase of Trans Mountain from the Houston-based energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan for $4.5 billion in Canadian dollars underscores just how difficult it has become to build fossil fuel projects, at least in wealthy, democratic countries, long thought to pose fewer political and social risks than developing countries. The Trans Mountain project has turned this calculation on its head, mainly because of growing environmental opposition. Kinder Morgan’s chief executive, Steven Kean, seemed to foresee the sale when he said on April 18, “It’s become clear this particular investment may be untenable for a private party to undertake.” The Trans Mountain expansion will nearly triple the capacity of the existing pipeline that runs from the province of Alberta to the west coast of British Columbia. In early April, Kinder Morgan Canada suspended most work on the project, despite having spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it and receiving approvals from Canadian regulators. It cited grass-roots resistance and opposition from British Columbia’s provincial government as the primary reasons. In response, Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, vowed that her oil-rich province would work with Kinder Morgan “to establish a financial relationship that will eliminate investor risk.” Prime Minister Trudeau reaffirmed his government’s support for the pipeline and promised financial aid to make it happen. That ultimately led to the federal government’s decision to buy Trans Mountain and force the pipeline’s expansion. “Our government’s position is clear: It must be built and it will be built,” the finance minister, Bill Morneau, said on Tuesday.

"Sign up for California Today for the latest news on the June 5 primary and more here. Jess Phoenix has spent the past decade working as a geologist, traveling to every continent but Antarctica and climbing the slopes of erupting volcanoes. It’s a far cry from the staid halls of the United States Capitol, where she hopes to replace a Republican congressman who once  said that California had “embarked on a rash mission to curtail global warming.” Ms. Phoenix, 36, has specialized in the study of volcanoes since a stint in 2008 at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, where she found her field work on Mauna Loa and Kilauea so exhilarating that she changed her initial plans to conduct research on subduction zones and plate tectonics. Now, she is one of several Democrats looking to challenge Representative Steve Knight in California’s 25th District in November — and one of hundreds of scientists seeking public office this year, many of them motivated by opposition to the Trump administration’s environmental policies. She has received advice and resources  from 314 Action, a nonprofit group working to elect people with expertise in science and math fields. The group, named after the first three digits of the mathematical constant pi, said it had trained 1,500 prospective candidates in the past year and a half, including around 450 who are currently running for state or federal office. Joshua Morrow, the executive director, argued that scientists would bring to the government “a common-sense approach to problem solving,” as well as an instinct for collaboration and a tendency to follow where the facts lead. “If we’re going to really address issues like climate change and technology in a meaningful way,” Mr. Morrow said, “we have to have people with that experience elected.” Ms. Phoenix’s first test will come in the California primary on June 5. The top two vote-getters, regardless of party, will advance to the general election in November. The district includes Santa Clarita, Simi Valley and Lancaster. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The June 5 primary election here in California will be the first major test of a feverish effort by Democrats to fight President Trump’s agenda. Their aim is to flip a handful of Republican-held congressional districts in the Golden State as part of their broader goal to take control of the House of Representatives in November. But in the heavily agrarian San Joaquin Valley, where several Republican members of Congress are expected to pull off easy re-elections, the mood is decidedly less feverish. Many people in the area interviewed for a recent article about the primaries expressed surprise that an election was happening; there, the primaries themselves have included few candidates and baked-in expectations about who will win. But renewed trade-related tensions with China on Tuesday put a spotlight on how quickly political tides can shift. The unpredictability of the Trump administration’s policy with China has already worried farmers across the state, many of whom voted for Mr. Trump and grow staple products like almonds and pistachios that are targeted for tariffs. In 2016, the state exported $2 billion in agriculture products to China, which is the state’s third biggest foreign market for farm goods. "
"Big banks are getting a big reprieve from a postcrisis rule aimed at curbing risky behavior on Wall Street. Federal bank regulators on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping proposal to soften the Volcker Rule, a cornerstone of the 2010 law that was enacted after the financial crisis to rein in risky trading. The change would give Wall Street banks more freedom to make their own complex bets — activities that can be highly profitable but also leave them more vulnerable to losses. The rule, part of the broader Dodd-Frank law, was put in place to prevent banks from making unsafe bets with depositors’ money. It took five agencies three years to write it and has been criticized by Wall Street as too onerous and harmful to the proper functioning of financial markets. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve proposed easing several parts of the rule, and four other regulators are expected to soon follow suit, kicking off a public comment period that is expected to last 60 days. The loosening of the Volcker Rule is part of a coordinated effort underway in Washington to relax rules put into place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Big banks, emboldened by President Trump’s deregulatory agenda and a more favorable political climate in Washington, have begun pressing for changes to several postcrisis rules, including the Volcker Rule. Last week, Mr. Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill that will free thousands of small and medium-size banks from the Dodd-Frank law, and on May 21, he signed a law rescinding a consumer rule aimed at preventing discrimination by auto lenders. The Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently proposed easing limits on how much the largest banks can borrow and the Fed also proposed changes to the stress tests that banks must undergo each year to determine whether they can withstand an economic downturn. Mr. Trump’s acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, has also engaged in a rapid series of regulatory changes since November, including halting new investigations, freezing new hires and preventing the agency from collecting certain data from banks.

"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Magical Fantasy World” (column, May 25): David Brooks opines that we are being seduced into President Trump’s fantasy world “like puppets on his string” dominated by the “Trumpian soap opera.” He is misunderstanding, in my opinion, the reality of many Americans. As a psychoanalyst I hear many of my patients describe the feeling of living in a waking nightmare in a reality that is both terrifying and terrorizing because reality itself is under constant attack. This leads not to seduction but to hypervigilance in an effort to manage a constant feeling of threat. I have urged many of my patients to respect their need to be informed without compulsively monitoring the news in a failed effort to reassure themselves that they are safe. For many people some form of activism, an antidote to feeling paralyzed with fear and helplessness, is crucial. Many mental health experts have argued that Mr. Trump’s problem staying in reality impairs his ability to make decisions and raises questions as to his fitness to serve. We are witnessing a metaphorical train crash in slow motion. History will not be kind to those who blindly or knowingly joined our president for the ride. LARRY S. SANDBERG, NEW YORK The writer is a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical Center. "
"Every June, with the arrival of Pride Month, we take time to evaluate legislative actions, court decisions and public opinion shifts as measures of the state of L.G.B.T. rights. For me, an observer of politics and a numbers guy, these metrics are my stock in trade. But this year, I found perhaps the most significant indicator of the prevailing cultural vibe, to my surprise, in country music. One of the most popular songs on country radio in 2018 has been Luke Bryan’s “Most People Are Good.” The song faithfully serves up genre-typical lyrics like “I believe most mommas oughta qualify for sainthood” and “most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights” — but the chorus also contains a clear pro-L.G.B.T. declaration: “I believe you love who you love/Ain’t nothing you should ever be ashamed of.” And in case fans were tempted to interpret this lyric in other ways, Mr. Bryan’s music video features gay couples and same-gender parent family configurations among a diverse montage of “good” people. Mr. Bryan didn’t write the song — the title itself was born out of the country songwriter Josh Kear’s struggle to process the divisive 2016 presidential elections, and the song was ultimately a collaborative effort with David Frasier and Ed Hill — but he said he knew he wanted to record the song the first time he heard it. As he put it: “I think it’s a song that the songwriters wrote perfectly from A to Z; not one wasted lyric in that thing. Anytime you can find a song that does that, I think it’s something special.” Rather than generating protests or public outcry, this song has dominated country music radio since its debut in late 2017. It broke into the Top 10 in February, and it has remained at the top of the air wave charts, occupying the No. 1 slot for three weeks. It’s also notable that Mr. Bryan is no progressive crusader out to make a political statement. A Georgia native, he is as mainstream as it gets, with previous hits that include lyrics that would make many liberals cringe, such as “Country Girl (Shake It for Me)” on his album “Tailgates & Tanlines.” When asked about “Most People Are Good,” Mr. Bryan has simply replied, “It just seems like it’s the right song for people to hear with everything going on in our world today.” For Mr. Bryan, and for many country fans today, pro-L.G.B.T. lyrics exist comfortably within a new country worldview.

"Americans love to eat foreign food, and hate to read foreign books. That’s the perception in publishing circles, anyway, and if there are obvious exceptions — I’m looking at you, Paulo Coelho — it’s still the case that even adventurous readers in this country aren’t always sure where to start once they reach the border. We’re here to help. Three of this week’s recommended titles are European novels: “Mirror, Shoulder, Signal,” by the Danish writer Dorthe Nors, “All for Nothing,” by the German writer Walter Kempowski, and “Kudos,” the conclusion of an exceptional trilogy by the British writer Rachel Cusk. Staying in the realm of foreign affairs, you might pick up Ronan Farrow’s “War on Peace,” about the decline of the United States diplomatic corps. And for people in this country or elsewhere who prefer to read about America and its ways, we have books (fiction and non) about Appalachia and Southern California, capitalism, criminal justice and more. Gregory Cowles
Senior Editor, Books KUDOS, by Rachel Cusk. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) “Kudos” is the final book in Cusk’s trilogy of small, serious, flexible and emphatic novels that began with “Outline” in 2015 and continued last year with “Transit.” The thrust of the narrative, as in each of the previous books, is talk — stories from people Faye, a British writer, meets while she travels. “As trilogies of recent vintage go, these books,” our critic Dwight Garner writes, “strike me as a stark, modern, adamantine new skyscraper on the literary horizon.” Cusk “has that ability, unique to the great performers in every art form, to hold one rapt from the moment she appears.” THE MIRAGE FACTORY: Illusion, Imagination, and the Invention of Los Angeles, by Gary Krist. (Crown, $27.) In “The Mirage Factory,” Krist marshals his considerable storytelling skills to capture Los Angeles at a critical moment: the period between 1900 and 1930, when an agricultural town of 100,000 people became a burgeoning city of 1.2 million, replete with new industries, a new identity and, crucially, newfound water. He tells that story by directing our attention to three individuals: the engineer and water czar William Mulholland, the filmmaker D.W. Griffith and the Pentecostal evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. “Krist is a nimble scene-setter, and it’s the indelible details he offers that give ‘The Mirage Factory’ its mesmerizing pull,” our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. “You’ll finish it entertained, informed and satisfied, as well as ready for more.” MIRROR, SHOULDER, SIGNAL, by Dorthe Nors. Translated from the Danish by Misha Hoekstra. (Graywolf, $16.) Nors, the darkly comic and wily Danish writer, is at her most unassuming and ambitious in this novel, which was a finalist for the International Man Booker Prize in 2017. It tells the story of Sonja, a single, 40-something translator of gory crime novels reeling from a breakup while living alone in Copenhagen. Nors has an intense fascination with aging, and with women who have resisted domestication. “We’re locked in Sonja’s consciousness,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes, “but the novel never becomes claustrophobic. Opening it feels like opening a window — there’s a bracing freshness and chill to the writing, and the unforced ease of a song.” CALYPSO, by David Sedaris. (Little, Brown, $28.) In his new collection of comic personal essays, Sedaris — who is now 61 — grapples seriously with themes of family, mortality and illness. As always, his very essence seeps through the pages like an intoxicating cloud. “This entrancing collection of essays, and my fascination with its author,” our reviewer, Alan Cumming, writes, “sucked me into some nerdy netherworld where real life becomes weirder and funnier and darker and bleaker than, well, real life.” ALL FOR NOTHING, by Walter Kempowski. Translated by Anthea Bell. (New York Review Books, paper, $16.95.) Until recently, the plight of the nearly 750,000 Germans who fled East Prussia in the last days of World War II remained a taboo subject in fiction. Kempowski’s novel, a work of lyrical melancholy originally published in German in 2006, conjures a privileged East Prussian family who must decide whether to join the exodus. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim’s review calls it a “chamber motet that is finely blended,” well worth reading “as a literary response to a long-buried collective trauma.” "
"Mr. Trump and his aides have given a number of conflicting reasons — sometimes within hours of each other or even in the same interview — for why he fired Mr. Comey from his position as F.B.I. director on May 9, 2017. At the time, Mr. Comey was leading the investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had coordinated with Russian election meddling. Initially, the White House cited a recommendation from Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who criticized Mr. Comey’s handling of the conclusion of a separate investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified emails. On May 10, 2017, Mr. Trump informed Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting that he had fired Mr. Comey. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off,” Mr. Trump told the Russians, as The New York Times has reported. And in an NBC News interview that was broadcast on May 11, 2017, Mr. Trump said he had made up his mind to fire Mr. Comey — even before Mr. Rosenstein’s recommendation — at least partly because of the Russia investigation: However, in that same interview with the NBC News anchor Lester Holt, Mr. Trump also said Mr. Comey was fired because of his incompetence — a decision the president acknowledged could drag out the Russia investigation: A few months later, Mr. Trump again said he would have fired Mr. Comey regardless of Mr. Rosenstein’s recommendation. “Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn’t hurt to have the letter, O.K. But he gives me a very strong letter, and now he’s involved in the case,” the president said in a July 2017 interview with The Times.   "
"To the Editor: Re “A Racist Post, a TV Apology, a Trump Gripe” (front page, May 31): The most damaging, insidious and hateful words and actions by President Trump are not the meanspirited, divisive language used against his own government employees as well as the public. Instead, they have to do with race. Bigotry is ugly, morally reprehensible, destructive. Roseanne Barr’s comments are not necessarily the problem. Such ignorance and spite will always exist as a challenge to our diversity. No, the problem is the abdication by Mr. Trump, as the purported leader of our nation, of any rejection of such hostility. “Birtherism,” Charlottesville and this latest example of the unwillingness to condemn blatant racial prejudice threaten our becoming the inclusive, just and moral society toward which we have aspired since our founding. November can’t come soon enough to send a clear message that we will not tolerate intolerance. GINO GIRARDI, DOYLESTOWN, PA. To the Editor: The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, often claims that the president is working hard for the American people every day. But that’s hard to see when he repeatedly turns every issue on its head and makes it about Donald J. Trump. PATRICIA WELLER
EMMITSBURG, MD. To the Editor: Re “ ‘Roseanne’ Self-Destructs With a Racist Tweet” (front page, May 30): I welcomed the response of ABC executives in canceling “Roseanne.” Roseanne Barr — the person — deserved the punishment received for her racist comments. Even so, “Roseanne” — the show — did provide audiences with a front-row view of a conservative America that is often ignored, sometimes in this paper. Don’t get me wrong, the show itself had its faults. But as a biracial black woman with white family members who support President Trump, I relished the few nuanced glimpses I got of a conservative family that could almost be my own — a small reminder that more, probably, connects us than Mr. Trump divides us. I’m still not certain how to deal with my family or Trump supporters in general, but they have life’s stories to tell, too. I wonder if ABC could give us a show that highlights these conservative experiences without the racism, bigotry and homophobia that Ms. Barr embodied. But one question remains: Is that even possible? LEAH GOSE, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: ABC has missed a major opportunity for good with the inane and racist comment tweeted by Roseanne Barr. Instead of its understandable, yet kneejerk reaction to cancel the highly rated (and profitable) show, it could have addressed the racism that lingers in our country. The talented staff of the show could have created an episode that addressed this incident head on. Archie Bunker, the bigoted and lovable character in “All in the Family,” did this all the time. Unfortunately, we live in such a hypersensitive time that more name-calling and ugly tweets will be the way we handle this, on both sides of the political spectrum. RAND MOORHEAD

"Today, we take pity upon the supply chain managers, the financial planners, the logisticians and procurement chiefs at every American company that uses steel and aluminum in its products. They face a difficult few months trying to adapt their businesses to new tariffs on metals imported from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, which start at midnight Thursday. Some prices are likely to rise, and some business operations may even turn out to be noneconomical in this new trade policy landscape, and shutter entirely. It’s worth keeping some perspective on the direct, immediate damage from the tariffs and likely retaliation from trading partners. Prices for inputs like steel move around all the time, and businesses are generally pretty good at adapting.  Those supply chain managers and logisticians are good at their jobs. But there’s a longer-term danger for the American economy that’s a lot bigger than the 25 percent tax on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum. It is that the administration’s trade policy is displaying an erratic, improvised, us-against-the-world quality that is anathema to businesses that must make long-term decisions about how to deploy capital. In a market economy, businesses can thrive despite bad policies. Go to any rich country, and you’ll find certain tax and regulatory policies that seem bonkers to an outsider. Japan taxes imported American beef at high rates — 50 percent until recently. Most stores in Germany have to close on Sunday. Go to Sweden or South Korea or Canada and you can find rules that impede the free market, yet businesses do just fine. That’s because those policies may be inefficient, but they are stable in their inefficiency. German stores build into their business models the expectation that there will be no Sunday sales, and a beef importer in Japan builds the tariff into its prices. "

"There is a word, beloved by the Kremlin and all its representatives, that has yet to cross into an American lexicon that longs for such Russian transplants: provokatsiya. Literally: a provocation. Figuratively: a false-flag operation. The poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain? Provokatsiya! The shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine? Provokatsiya! The Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 presidential race? Provokatsiya, obviously. Before Wednesday, it was easy to deride Kremlin cries of provokatsiya as a cynical way of directing our gaze away from the facts and past them — onto the highly improbable and the flat-out conspiratorial. But after Wednesday, thanks to the machinations of the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, dismissing such claims became far more difficult. This time, the Russians turned out to be right. The story is straight out of a Bond film: On Tuesday, Mr. Babchenko, who had long irked the Kremlin with his critical coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, was shot in the back three times in his apartment while his wife was in the shower. He was living in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, where he had fled because he feared for his safety in Moscow. But Russian agents found him even there, and he died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. His wife, the police said, was in a state of shock. "
"Dinesh D’Souza, the best-selling author and documentarian who received a presidential pardon for a felony conviction of making illegal campaign contributions, has spent almost four decades in a cycle of provocation and controversy that has made him, at times, a hero of the right. His books and movies attacking liberal ideologies and politicians have had great commercial success, but he has promoted conspiracy theories and his work has been criticized as inaccurate and excessively incendiary, sometimes by other conservatives. President Trump pardoned him on Thursday, saying that Mr. D’Souza had been “treated very unfairly by our government,” echoing a claim the commentator has often made himself. [The president is also weighing commuting the sentence of Rod Blagojevich] Here’s a look at Mr. D’Souza’s past. In 2014, Mr. D’Souza was accused of using straw donors to donate $20,000 to a Republican Senate candidate in New York, exceeding the personal limit of $5,000. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a $30,000 fine and five years of probation, including eight months living under supervision in a “community confinement center” in San Diego. Prosecutors said he enlisted two people to donate $10,000 apiece on behalf of themselves and their spouses to Wendy E. Long, a friend from Dartmouth who lost in a landslide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat. He then reimbursed the donors in cash. "
"The world of illegal abortion today looks nothing like the way it did 45 years ago. When I first visited Chile, in 2008, it was one of a handful of countries in the world that banned abortion in all cases, without exception. Given that hundreds of women a year died from botched illegal abortions in the United States before Roe v. Wade, which legalized the procedure in 1973, I expected to find hospitals in Chile overflowing with dying women. Instead, I found that abortion drugs have dramatically altered the situation. I’ve spent the past decade studying abortions in Latin American countries where abortion is always, or almost always, illegal. Yet, abortion in these countries remains commonplace. It is vastly safer than it was in the past, thanks to a revolution that has replaced back alleys with blister packs ordered online. But this revolution has come with unexpected consequences — for the doctor-patient relationship and for law enforcement. Whether we’re marching with coat-hanger posters or passing laws that outlaw the procedure earlier and earlier, we fight over abortion in the United States as if we know what will happen if it’s banned. But as we inch closer to potentially allowing states to recriminalize the procedure — with laws that ban abortions after six weeks, as in Iowa, and even seek to effectively ban the use of abortion-inducing drugs — we would do well to look past our southern border to consider what happens when abortion actually is illegal. It’s not the outcome anyone is looking for. Abortifacient drugs have become so readily available in places like Chile and El Salvador that it has become impossible to enforce abortion bans. That was also the case in Ireland, where by some accounts, before last month’s legalization vote, at least two Irish women a day were self-administering abortions using pills. The most widely available abortion drug in Latin America, misoprostol, is commonly used to treat ulcers. Although less effective than the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol used in the United States, misoprostol taken in the first trimester causes an abortion in approximately 90 percent of cases. In Brazil, where abortion is all but banned, experts estimate there are about a million illegal abortions each year; around half of them are induced using abortion drugs. Efforts to restrict access to misoprostol will fail not simply because it costs pennies to make, but also because it saves lives. The World Health Organization lists misoprostol as an “essential medicine” for treating miscarriages, and the drug has been credited with reducing deaths from illegal abortions. But if abortion drugs have reduced the risk of death from illegal abortion, they have also generated new concerns: When abortion is a crime, the emergency room can become the scene of a criminal investigation, and doctors the detectives.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step toward dramatically weakening an Obama-era rule designed to cut pollution from vehicle tailpipes, setting the stage for a legal clash with California that could potentially split the nation’s auto market in two. The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday submitted its proposal to roll back climate change rules that required automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles to an average of more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. The rules, which would have significantly lowered the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, were opposed by automakers who said they were overly burdensome. However, the proposed Trump rule could lead to unintended and unwanted consequences for those same car companies. The Obama-era regulations would have forced automakers to make and sell far more electric and hybrid vehicles, but the new proposal could end up leading to two separate sets of fuel economy regulations within the United States, creating what automakers say would be an even greater regulatory burden. Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the E.P.A., confirmed on Thursday that the agency had sent its proposed regulatory rollback to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. Typically that is the final step before a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. The rules are then open for public comment before taking effect, during which the terms could still be modified. While the administration had been expected to take the steps laid out on Thursday, the proposal is significant because it amounts to an official declaration of its intent. Together with President Trump’s plans to undo a separate set of climate change regulations, on pollution from coal-fired power plants, “this represents the centerpiece of the administration’s gutting of the Obama-era domestic climate portfolio,” said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard University. "
"Six pages into SABRINA (Drawn and Quarterly, $27.95), Nick Drnaso’s new graphic novel, the title character’s sister reads out a clue from the crossword puzzle she’s working on. “Twelve letters,” she says. “We killed the Clutter family.” Sabrina knows the answer: “Dick and Perry” — the killers made famous by Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood.” On first read, it’s just an example of the conversational vérité that Drnaso excels at, the brief reunion between the two adult siblings at their mom’s house in Chicago. Four pages later, Sabrina heads out the door, the last time we see her alive. Not yet 30, Drnaso has topped his virtuoso 2016 debut, “Beverly,” which had a cheerful palette gleefully at odds with all that roiled beneath its speckless Midwestern skies: class friction and psychosexual urges, brain-draining sitcoms and kneejerk racism. (Nearly everyone in Drnasoland is white.) Some of the visual shocks in “Beverly” lodge in the head, like certain demonic glimpses from “The Shining” — but “Sabrina” goes deeper, risks more. It’s an unnerving mystery told by a rigorous moralist, a profoundly American nightmare set squarely in the first year of the Trump presidency. Politics is never mentioned, but the dread is everywhere: on the airwaves, at an open mic, in a kid’s activity book, and — most barbarically — online. The book centers on the uneasy bond between Calvin Wrobel, who works at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, and Teddy, Sabrina’s boyfriend of two years. Newly divorced, Calvin is unusually empathetic and selfless; he takes in Teddy, who arrives from Illinois completely numb after Sabrina’s disappearance. Out of touch since high school, Calvin nevertheless cares for his helpless charge, bringing him fast food and giving him the run of his comfortable, desolate house. At work, dressed in fatigues, Calvin periodically fills out Department of Defense mental health surveys, registering hours slept, drinks consumed and whether he’s entertained thoughts of suicide. He always answers in the negative. Then a videotape surfaces at a news outlet, with sickening confirmation of Sabrina’s fate. Naturally, the murderer’s name starts trending. An investigator tells Calvin they’re “desperately trying to keep this video from leaking onto the internet,” but its migration is inevitable. (“I need to see this,” one commenter writes.) In an unguarded moment, the upright Calvin hits download, but Drnaso doesn’t show what he sees, leaving the worst of it to the reader’s imagination. Teddy’s rage at the senseless loss and the virtual violation makes him vulnerable, unpredictably, to another obscenity: a false-flag narrative peddled by an “Infowars”-like show, relentlessly flowing from a radio as he clutches a pillow. “I have been targeted for voicing what amounts to perfectly legal and acceptable free speech,” the host insists. “If you ever see me being taken away in handcuffs, you’ll know what’s going on.” After conspiracy theorists, emboldened online, notice that the victim’s last boyfriend is cohabiting with a member of the military, Calvin gets threats from people who believe he’s an actor.

"To the Editor: In “The Donald of Silicon Valley” (column, May 26), about Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors, Bret Stephens somehow misses the whole point of electric cars: They are much cleaner than gasoline-powered cars. Carbon dioxide pollution from transportation is now the largest contributor to global warming in the United States, and electric cars are responsible for less than half the emissions of the average new gasoline car, according to detailed life cycle studies by the Union of Concerned Scientists and others. Electric cars and trucks are therefore an indispensable tool worldwide to prevent runaway climate change. Mr. Stephens compares Mr. Musk to President Trump, but to Mr. Musk’s credit, and unlike the president, Mr. Musk understands the dangers we face from global warming and is addressing the problem head on by building cars exciting enough to lure us away from the gasoline engine. Mr. Stephens rightly notes that some Tesla models are too expensive for the average family. But now that Mr. Musk has popularized the idea of electric vehicles, many automakers are jumping in and building excellent, affordable cars that drive well over 200 miles on a charge and can save the average driver about $800 a year in fuel costs. I should know; I own one. KEN KIMMELL, CAMBRIDGE, MASS. The writer is president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. To the Editor: I was surprised to see Bret Stephens so fervently miss the point behind Elon Musk’s cult status. It is, of course, that dreamers and their passions inspire all of us. America once encouraged people like Mr. Musk, but today’s risk takers are few and far between. Despite Mr. Stephens’s assessment, Tesla makes really fine automobiles, and Space X is a pretty good rocket company. We need more people like Mr. Musk. They don’t need to be perfect, because we all benefit when they just dream big and try. ROBERT MIX, SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. "
"WASHINGTON — The top Republican on the Senate Education Committee effectively killed on Thursday all hope for a highly anticipated overhaul this year of the law governing the nation’s 4,000 colleges and universities, paving the way for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to wield her deregulatory power. The committee chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said at a New York Times education conference in New York that the Senate would not produce promised higher education legislation this year, and blamed Democrats for the delay. “The Democrats won’t do it,” he said, adding, “They want to wait until next year to see if they’re in better shape politically, but I keep telling them, ‘I can take notes and do to you what you did to me, even if I’m in the minority.’” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the committee’s ranking Democrat, has said repeatedly that her party is not the problem. Ms. Murray, a spokeswoman said, “has made it clear that she wants to reauthorize the Higher Education Act as soon as possible to address the rising costs of college, increase access to underrepresented students, hold schools accountable for student success, and ensure every student is safe and free from discrimination on campus.” "
"Samantha Bee apologized on Thursday for having used a vulgar epithet to describe Ivanka Trump on her TBS show, saying she had “crossed a line.” TBS also issued an apology, but took no disciplinary action against the late night host. Ms. Bee’s insult of the president’s elder daughter on Wednesday’s episode of “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” included a crude reference for the female anatomy — and caused a furor made more intense because the remark came just a day after ABC swiftly canceled “Roseanne” over a racist tweet by the show’s star, Roseanne Barr. The different consequences for the two politically minded entertainers — Ms. Barr is an outspoken supporter of the president, while Ms. Bee is a full-throated opponent of the Trump administration — provided conservatives with a fresh opportunity to accuse the media industry of having a liberal bias. Hours before Ms. Bee and the cable network issued their apologies, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called the host’s remarks “vile and vicious.” “The collective silence by the left and its media allies is appalling,” Ms. Sanders said. “Her disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast, and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network.” Friday morning, it became clear that Ms. Bee’s apology was not good enough for President Trump. He asked in a tweet why TBS has not fired “no talent Samantha Bee.” "
"ROME — After 88 days of impasses and negotiations, two Italian populist parties with a history of antagonism toward the European Union received approval Thursday night to create a government that has already unsettled the Continent’s political order. Only days ago, President Sergio Mattarella of Italy rejected a populist government over concerns about a proposed finance minister who had helped write a guide for withdrawing Italy from the euro, Europe’s single currency. The political chaos and sudden uncertainty about the euro helped send global financial markets reeling. On Thursday, the populists reshuffled, keeping the same prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and other top players, but moving the objectionable finance minister to a less critical post. That was apparently enough to satisfy the president, who preferred an elected government to a caretaker alternative he had in reserve. The populist parties constituting the new government won the most votes in a March 4 election, promising a sweeping crackdown on the illegal immigration that helped fuel their ascent. But the president’s assent was not enough to allay concerns about the actual agenda of the populists once they enter power, even though they now claim a sudden conversion to full faith in the euro. “The populist and right-wing government has a program that’s dangerous for the country and the events of recent days confirm our longstanding concerns,” said Maurizio Martina, a leader of the Democratic Party, which will now leave government for the opposition. “Their acts so far have been a mix of extremism, anti-Europism and iniquity.” "

Here’s what you need to know. • More countries are readying trade retaliation against the U.S. U.S. tariffs go into effect on metals from the European Union, Canada and Mexico today, and some have already hit back. Combined with similar measures being prepared by China, Russia and Turkey, the impact of the penalties on American goods could be severe. (Australia appears to expect that its own exemption from the U.S. tariffs will hold.) Ahead of a weekend visit to Beijing by the U.S. commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, China said it would cut tariffs sharply on July 1 for an array of imported goods, few of which are American.

"CHICAGO — Rod R. Blagojevich, whose criminal sentence President Trump has said he may commute, became a household name when he was arrested 10 years ago on an explosive accusation: Prosecutors said he had tried to sell or trade to the highest bidder the Senate seat that Barack Obama was vacating to become the president. Mr. Blagojevich’s expletive-filled remarks about his role in choosing a new senator — caught on government recordings of phone calls — became punch lines for late-night television. “I’ve got this thing, and it’s golden,” he was memorably quoted as saying, using profanities. “And I’m just not giving it up for nothing. I’m not going to do it. And I can always use it. I can parachute me there.” In the years since, Mr. Blagojevich’s name has faded some. (So, court appearances show, has his trademark pouf of black hair.) Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was not only the former governor of Illinois and a former member of Congress, but also an undeniably flamboyant character. He was an Elvis Presley fan who was also known for eloquent recitations of anecdotes from leaders he admired, like Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan; a figure who protested his innocence at every chance, including on reality television and radio shows and in a book he wrote; and an isolated governor who was said to keep a hairbrush nearby at all times. About a month after Mr. Obama was elected president in 2008, Mr. Blagojevich, the sitting governor of Illinois, was arrested early one morning at his Chicago home. The accusations were stunning: Prosecutors said Mr. Blagojevich (pronounced bluh-GOY-uh-vich, though plenty of people, even in Illinois, still just call him “Blago”) had not only tried to crassly benefit from making an appointment to Mr. Obama’s vacant Senate seat, but also sought millions of dollars from people who had state business in all sorts of other scenarios. Federal prosecutors said the conduct was so abysmal that it “would make Lincoln roll over in his grave.” "
"BEIJING — Forget Google versus Facebook. Forget Uber versus Lyft. Forget Amazon versus … well, everybody. The technology world’s most bruising battle for supremacy is taking place in China. And it could point to Big Tech’s future everywhere else, too. Tencent Holdings and the Alibaba Group are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor. The two titans long ago branched out from their core businesses — games and social media for Tencent, e-commerce for Alibaba — to duke it out in ever more realms of Chinese life. They have competed in messaging, microblogging and delivering takeout. They go head-to-head in video streaming and cloud computing. Today, their fiercest fight is over digital money kept on smartphones. Mobile payments have transformed the Chinese economy. Both giants, plus Ant Financial, an Alibaba sister firm, are spending big to gobble up pieces of the action. China’s internet powerhouses stand at the forefront of the nation’s galloping high-tech progress — a surge that has been brought into sharp focus by the Trump administration’s efforts to counter it. On one hand, the standoff over the Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE has exposed, to many in China, the degree to which the country still lags in core technologies such as microchips. "
"On Wednesday, Illinois became the 37th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. You probably have questions. Technically, yes. Congress, which overwhelmingly approved the Equal Rights Amendment on March 22, 1972, set a seven-year deadline for three-quarters of the states to ratify it. The deadline was later extended to 1982 but that deadline passed with only 35 states on board. They needed 38. More about that in a moment. But first … The proposed amendment has three sections but the first is the main clause: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” In 1972, supporters believed the amendment would invalidate widespread discrimination, including laws that restricted a woman’s right to buy or sell property and employers’ policies that denied unemployment compensation to pregnant workers. It started with Alice Paul, a pioneering women’s rights activist in the United States who relentlessly fought for equal rights and helped lead the battle for women’s suffrage. She was even forcibly fed in jail after she went on a hunger strike. "
"SHANGHAI — China announced Thursday evening that it would cut tariffs sharply on July 1 for an eclectic array of imported goods, the latest in a series of moves by Beijing to dismantle steep trade barriers at a time of rising frictions with the United States. The tariff cuts came less than two days before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is due in Beijing for wide-ranging talks aimed at addressing American frustrations with China’s $375 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States. But the categories the Chinese Finance Ministry selected for tariff cuts cover few American goods, and appeared to be targeted at China’s goal of developing sophisticated industries rather than low-value mass manufacturing. The moves came as China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies, continued their wide-ranging economic and diplomatic sparring. The countries have alternated between attacking each other over trade issues and working together on efforts to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons. At times, President Trump has praised his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at other times he has swiftly criticized Beijing for its trade practices, sometimes in quick succession. In its latest action, China is making a modest peace offering, without really giving up much. Some of the 1,449 categories of goods slated for tariff cuts involve food products from other countries, like fish, olives and grilled seaweed. Other categories include low-value manufactured goods like handbags and certain inexpensive garments, typically made in factories that have already been shifting from China to lower-wage competitors like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Vietnam. Chinese workers’ wages have soared over the past 15 years, and Beijing is engaged in a broad effort to steer the economy toward high-wage industries like semiconductors and away from factories making garments and handbags. “The goods seeing cuts are not relevant to trade with the U.S.,” said Derek Scissors, a trade specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. “For China, it fits the goal of moving up the value chain — heavy subsidies for semiconductors and now less protection for textiles and consumer appliances.” "
"The European Court of Human Rights censured Lithuania and Romania on Thursday for their complicity in the C.I.A.’s torture program, saying the two European nations had hosted secret prisons where the C.I.A. held and interrogated terrorism suspects after the Sept. 11 attacks. The twin rulings by the court in Strasbourg, France, centered on two men — Abu Zubaydah, a stateless man of Palestinian heritage, and Abd al-Rahim Husseyn Muhammad al-Nashiri, a Saudi citizen of Yemeni descent — who since 2006 have been held at the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Using similar language, the court rejected Lithuania’s and Romania’s arguments that insufficient evidence existed to prove that the two detainees had been held on their soil or that their governments knew about the matter. The authorities in each country, the court ruled, “knew of the nature and purposes of the C.I.A.’s activities on its territory” at the time; assisted by agreeing to host prisons and helping with rendition flights to transport detainees; and knew that “by enabling the C.I.A. to detain terrorist suspects on its territory, it was exposing them to a serious risk of treatment contrary to” the European Convention on Human Rights. The court ordered Lithuania to pay Abu Zubaydah, also known as Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, about $152,000 in damages and costs. It also ordered Romania to pay about $118,000 to Mr. Nashiri. But it is not clear whether or how those funds will be paid; the same court delivered a similar ruling against Poland on behalf of the two men in 2015, but a lawyer for Abu Zubaydah said on Thursday that Poland had not paid the roughly $262,000 in court-ordered reparations from that ruling. The cases shed light on the murky and once-hidden world of the C.I.A.’s rendition, detention and interrogation program. The agency shuttled captives suspected of major terrorist acts between secret overseas prisons called black sites and tortured them with tactics like waterboarding, prolonged sleep deprivation, forced nudity, confinement in cramped boxes and shackling into painful stress positions.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would impose steep tariffs on metals imported from its closest allies, provoking retaliation against American businesses and consumers and further straining diplomatic ties tested by the president’s combative approach. The European Union, Canada and Mexico, which will face 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, quickly denounced the action and drew up lists of tit-for-tat measures, many aimed at parts of the United States where President Trump enjoys his strongest political support. The move follows months of uncertainty as the Trump administration dangled potential exemptions for allies in return for concessions on other fronts. In moving forward with tariffs on national security grounds, the administration now faces a crucial test of whether its aggressive strategy will extract promises from trading partners or end up backfiring on the United States economy. The tariffs “have already had major, positive effects on steel and aluminum workers and jobs and will continue to do so long into the future,” White House officials said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump administration’s actions underscore its commitment to good-faith negotiations with our allies to enhance our national security while supporting American workers.” By keeping trading partners guessing, the president has sought to create leverage in trade negotiations, including in talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. But in the process, he has sowed an atmosphere of chaos among allies as well as manufacturers uncertain about the ultimate impact on their vast supply chains. The latest twist in the trade drama does little to alleviate the confusion among business owners and foreign leaders. Although the Trump administration signaled a tougher stance with the tariffs, it also left open the possibility for continued negotiations with affected countries. "

"The price of oil was in free fall and a youthful population restive. So the government of Saudi Arabia turned in recent years to the parent company of the political data firm Cambridge Analytica for help, according to Western consultants who worked in the kingdom, company executives and a review of public documents. The work by Cambridge’s parent, a secretive defense and intelligence contractor called SCL Group, presaged the tumultuous changes that are reshaping the kingdom. The company, now mired in scandals related to its corporate practices and the use of Facebook user data, conducted a detailed population study. It provided a psychological road map of the kingdom’s citizenry and its sentiment toward the royal family, even testing potential reform steps as they charted a path forward to preserve stability. The consultants and executives spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were bound by nondisclosure agreements. One proposal tested by the company was lifting a 35-year ban on cinemas in the kingdom, an action that was subsequently taken in December. Another was allowing women to drive, a move that was made last September. Under King Salman, who came to power in January 2015, the Saudis have turned to an array of consultants as crashing oil prices laid bare the kingdom’s lack of economic diversification. Some consultants, such as McKinsey & Company and the Boston Consulting Group, carried blue chip pedigrees, while SCL, founded in 1993 as Strategic Communication Laboratories, was known for its clandestine work. The company has recently burst into the public eye amid revelations that it employed seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections. And its Cambridge Analytica unit, which worked for President Trump’s campaign, collapsed amid allegations of misusing Facebook data. At least one Cambridge Analytica employee worked on the parent company’s Saudi project, according to the employee’s profile on LinkedIn. "

s soon as I made eye contact with the smiling woman in the Doctors Without Borders T-shirt on a busy Sydney street, I knew I’d be asked for money or a signature. And I knew I’d say no. “I’m a foreign correspondent for The New York Times,” I told her. “I can’t really help because at some point, somewhere, there’s a good chance I may cover what you do.” I always feel bad trying to explain journalistic detachment in such moments, and I often get looks of confusion in response.

"TAIPEI, Taiwan — On June 12, in a leafy, middle-class neighborhood in Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, the unofficial, Cold War-era relationship between this island and the United States is getting a major upgrade. That is when the American Institute in Taiwan, the United States’ embassy here in all but name, will hold a ceremony to formally unveil a $250 million office complex that resembles a university research center, just with guarded gates and blast walls. Built into a lush hillside, it will be a visible boost to American ties with Taiwan at a time when the number of official foreign diplomatic missions here continues to dwindle. The sprawling new facility, which sits on a 16-acre site, will give far more visibility, and aesthetic appeal, to the understated American diplomatic presence here, which is currently spread across multiple offices in Taipei. Its main office is a small, drab 1950s-era former military building hidden behind 10-foot walls. The institute, which is commonly known by its English acronym, A.I.T., is getting a face-lift at a moment when the relationship between Washington and Taipei — long kept low-key to avoid angering Beijing — has been elevated to levels not seen in decades. That is due in part to the administration of President Trump, who took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, after he was elected, and has since given prominent jobs to people known here as “friends of Taiwan,” including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. In March, Mr. Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which allows more high-level visits between Taiwan and the United States. There has been speculation here that Mr. Bolton may come, which would make him one of the highest-ranking American officials to visit Taiwan since the United States withdrew diplomatic recognition in 1979.

"Over the weekend, you may have seen a horrifying story: Almost 1,500 migrant children were missing, and feared to be in the hands of human traffickers. The Trump administration lost track of the children, the story went, after separating them from their parents at the border. The news spread across liberal social media — with the hashtag #Wherearethechildren trending on Twitter — as people demanded immediate action. But it wasn’t true, or at least not the way that many thought. The narrative had combined parts of two real events and wound up with a horror story that was at least partly a myth. The fact that so many Americans readily believed this myth offers a lesson in how partisan polarization colors people’s views on a gut emotional level without many even realizing it. As other articles have explained, the missing children and the Trump administration’s separation of families who are apprehended at the border are two different matters. The Trump administration does in fact have a new policy of prosecuting all undocumented border crossers, which involves separating parents from their children. But the 1,475 children whom the Department of Health and Human Services recently reported it cannot locate are not among those taken from their parents. These “missing” children had actually come to the United States without their parents, been picked up by the Border Patrol and then released to the custody of a parent or guardian. "
"After shutting down schools and shaking up politics in six states, teachers are looking to the ballot box in their campaign for better pay and increased school funding. And their demands are meeting with widespread public support. A survey conducted in early May for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that nearly three in four adults — 71 percent — considered teacher pay too low, while just 6 percent felt it was too high. And two-thirds said they supported increasing the salaries of public-school teachers even if it meant raising taxes. Backing for teachers cut across demographic, regional and partisan lines. Even a majority of Republicans — 56 percent — said they would favor raising taxes to increase teachers’ pay. Recent surveys from NPR and The Associated Press produced similar findings. The teacher walkouts began in deep-red states such as West Virginia and Oklahoma, where teacher pay has tended to be lower than in other states, and spread quickly to Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina, racking up a list of concessions from conservative lawmakers. The movement has the potential to influence congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative races, and could catch fire in additional states when the new school year begins. The issue was prominent in recent weeks in a competitive Republican primary in the Idaho governor’s race; the winner, Lt. Gov. Brad Little, pledged to increase education funding and was endorsed by the Idaho Education Association, an affiliate of the national teachers’ union. And it resonated with Idaho residents like Rondell Nebeker, a self-described conservative Republican who said he believes in limited government and supports President Trump. Idaho has some of the lowest teacher pay and per-student education funding in the country, according to federal data, and Mr. Nebeker, 61, said he worried that the state was losing educators as a result.

"Andrew Garfield, a Tony Award nominee for playing the defiant Prior Walter in the Broadway revival of “Angels in America,” was 9 years old in 1993, when Stephen Spinella won the first of his two Tonys in the role. As it happens, Mr. Spinella is again tackling the furious, fantastical poetry of Tony Kushner’s two-part, seven-hour play, this time as the bilious lawyer Roy Cohn at Berkeley Repertory Theater. The New York Times asked the actors, who have never met, to correspond by email during a week’s worth of shows. They wrote before, after and sometimes in between performances of “Millennium Approaches” and “Perestroika.” Below are edited excerpts from their exchange, which included insights on how to understand the character of Prior, a man with AIDS who accompanies an angel to heaven, and how to maintain the stamina to play him. Good morning, Andrew, so nice to meet you! Three hours behind you here in Berkeley and just up after a two-show day yesterday, legs still covered with alcohol-based makeup, feeling like I was hit by a truck. Two more shows today. We’ve been doing five-show weekends for five weeks now. Brutal. Four-and-a-half to five hours for each show, with prep, makes a 25-hour weekend toiling in the theater. Another two shows and it’s the French workweek! "
"BOSTON — On commencement day at Northern Michigan University, some students protested the speaker, Gov. Rick Snyder, and his handling of the water crisis in Flint. While some students outside the event carried signs against him, students inside the hall simply — and silently — turned their backs on him as he spoke. Protests at college commencements are almost a rite of spring, and this graduation season is no different. Some of the demonstrations this year have shapeshifted into actions more subdued than those of just a few years ago. Some are small events within larger ceremonies. And silence as a protest tactic is being used to make a point without ruffling too many feathers. At Northern Michigan, the university’s president, Fritz Erickson, appeared pleased with the outcome. In a statement, he said he appreciated that the governor, a Republican, still came, despite advance word that he would be met by protests. He said he was proud that the students had been respectful. At Tufts University, about 150 students — of 3,700 graduates — silently protested their speaker, turning their backs on Ellen Kullman, the former chief executive of DuPont. Grim-faced, they also held paper signs that chastised the chemical company’s environmental record, saying it had “dumped carcinogenic chemicals into people’s water supplies repeatedly.” And at Howard University, the commencement speaker, Chadwick Boseman, star of “Black Panther,” lauded students who had taken over the administration building earlier in the year over grievances. Mr. Boseman also praised the administration for its willingness to make changes. "
"WASHINGTON — Senator Bernie Sanders seemed nervous. In just two hours, he would conduct a live-streamed town hall event on the Iran nuclear deal, and he still hadn’t nailed his opening. “Did you mention to somebody doing a history of U.S.-Iranian relations?” he asked aides who had gathered in his Senate office to help him prepare. “What do you think about starting with that?” Then he wanted to say something about Saudi Arabia. Then Israel. In another room, staff members rushed to finalize last-minute details. “We convert into a small production company,” one aide joked. The town hall meeting in mid-May came off seamlessly, before a modest live audience at the Capitol Visitor Center. Mr. Sanders scripted the evening’s event, interviewed panelists and directed the conversation. There were no nettlesome questions from television or newspaper reporters. And over the next two weeks the real target audience — online viewers — would show up in droves, with some 800,000 people watching it. The event provided a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the grass-roots efforts Mr. Sanders has become known for, as his team revved up its campaign engine: A week later, Mr. Sanders would announce his bid for re-election to the Senate. The democratic socialist from Vermont is also widely believed to be considering another run for president in 2020. But the Iran discussion also reflected the kind of direct-to-voter messaging strategy that has become increasingly common among politicians — both as a way to shape information about their goals and to avoid difficult questions from the news media, particularly in the midst of scandal or controversy. From Washington to Texas to California, politicians are road-testing their political messaging strategies, searching for the best way to reach voters in ways that often bypass the traditional media gatekeepers.

"WASHINGTON — For more than a year, President Trump has struggled to control the United States’ law enforcement apparatus, frustrated that it remains at least partly out of his grasp. But he is increasingly turning to a tool that allows him to push back against a justice system he calls unfair. In a burst of action and words, Mr. Trump demonstrated Thursday that, in some instances, he still has the last word. He pardoned Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative commentator convicted of campaign finance violations, and he said he may extend clemency to former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois and Martha Stewart, the lifestyle mogul. As he has for all of his acts of clemency since taking office, Mr. Trump bypassed the traditional system for granting pardons and disregarded more than 10,000 languishing applications to focus instead on prominent public figures whose cases resonated with him given his own grievances with investigators. Some critics said he may even be signaling associates — like one of his personal lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, who is under investigation for possibly violating federal campaign finance laws — to stay strong and not help prosecutors. The pardon for Mr. D’Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to making illegal campaign contributions, was a victory for one of the president’s most vocal bases of support, the conservative news media. Mr. D’Souza has argued that he was singled out for prosecution by President Barack Obama’s administration because of his conservative politics, an argument that mirrors Mr. Trump’s assertions that his predecessor targeted him, too. Mr. Trump attributed his decision to absolve Mr. D’Souza and his interest in the other two cases to indignation over selective or excessive justice. Mr. D’Souza, he said, “was very unfairly treated.” He described the 14-year sentence imposed on Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat convicted on corruption charges, as “really unfair.” He said Ms. Stewart, who spent five months in prison for lying to investigators in a stock case, “was harshly and unfairly treated.” The president’s intervention in those cases came as he rails against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. over various investigations into his campaign, his personal lawyer and his own actions that may have been aimed at obstructing the inquiry of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Last week, he effectively ordered the Justice Department to investigate his investigators and reveal confidential information about the case to Republican allies in Congress. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The U.S., already locked in a contentious dispute with China, will begin imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, the European Union and Mexico at midnight. The measure could provoke retaliation against American businesses. • Separately, federal regulators have proposed softening the so-called Volcker Rule, which was imposed after the global financial crisis and intended to prevent banks from making risky bets with depositors’ money. They said it was too complicated to enforce. • In the social media age, every minute in corporate crisis management counts. The praise the network received after swiftly axing its hit sitcom over a racist tweet could inspire other businesses facing public relations disasters. Our reporter spoke with communications experts about some of the lessons. We also looked at the pressures facing the writers and other staff members on “Roseanne.” Although they were heartened by the show’s success, Roseanne Barr’s often divisive posts on Twitter were a growing distraction. “She would tweet stuff, then apologize and get off Twitter, and then it would get better,” an executive producer said. “And then it would blow up again.” • President Trump addressed the dispute on Wednesday, saying that he, too, deserved an apology from ABC. The network had apologized to Valerie Jarrett, the subject of the tweet that got Ms. Barr’s show canceled. • The shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado nearly 20 years ago has inspired young gunmen across America, according to researchers.

"Democratic voters, especially young, white liberals, have been moving sharply in a progressive direction, not only on issues of race, but across the board — on the economy, on immigration and on the environment. Zach Goldberg, a doctoral candidate in political science at Georgia State University, has been tracking ideological trends among liberal, moderate and conservative whites, using survey data collected by American National Election Studies. The accompanying chart measures support for higher immigration levels from 1992 to 2016. White moderates and conservatives, including Republicans and independents, showed relatively little change over those 24 years. Among white liberals, though, support for increased immigration grew from a low of 4 percent in 1996 to 38 percent in 2016. Goldberg broke down the data by age groups and found that the driving force was young, white liberals aged 18 to 24. In an email, Goldberg wrote: In other words, he continued, In further support of his argument, Goldberg produced the following graphic from ANES surveys: In our email exchange, Goldberg argued that Trump’s election produced what he calls “moral panic” among liberals: The Pew Research Center has documented some of the most striking shifts in a liberal direction among Democratic voters. For an October 2017 report, Pew asked respondents to choose between two statements: First, “immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents,” and second, “immigrants burden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care.” "
"If you’ve been on the internet in the past few days, it was impossible to avoid the articles and social media posts assailing the Trump administration for failing to keep track of 1,500 immigrant children who arrived at the United States border alone. Many well-intentioned people flooded the web with their outrage: How could the Trump administration release these children so quickly that it’s losing track of them? In fact, the problem is just the opposite. The administration is not releasing them fast enough. What has happened is that many people have confused the 1,500 children whom the government has not kept track of with children cruelly separated from their families at the border — a definite but different problem. That mistake and the resulting calls for greater control and surveillance of immigrant children could unwittingly fuel the president’s true agenda: to repeal crucial legal protections for children in immigration custody, to slow their release and to deport thousands of children who have come seeking refuge from violence and persecution. A bit of background: The agency responsible for housing immigrant children and reuniting them with sponsors is the Office of Refugee Resettlement. A nationwide consent decree signed in 1997 and a law passed by Congress in 2008 both accord children in O.R.R. custody special legal protections, including the right to be promptly released and to be placed with a safe adult sponsor. The Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to repeal both protections. Two weeks ago, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security told the Senate that these protections “place our communities at risk” and should be terminated or amended. And the flurry of news over the weekend has only made the situation worse. Mr. Trump and administration officials are using the misplaced public outrage as a pretext to call again for the repeal of the law protecting children. So far, these protections remain on the books, but the administration is already actively undermining them. Within his first few hours on the job in March 2017, Scott Lloyd, O.R.R.’s director, imposed a new policy requiring that he personally approve the release of any immigrant child who has needed heightened supervision while in custody. (Heightened supervision can result from genuine behavioral problems or trumped-up gang allegations.) As a result, over 740 children in O.R.R. custody in the past year have been unable to get out unless Mr. Lloyd — a Trump appointee with no background in child welfare — approves it. In New York, dozens of affected children have now been detained on average for eight months, and some for over a year — even though many seek release to a parent in the United States. Our organization, the New York Civil Liberties Union, sued to stop the practice, and a federal court in Manhattan will hear argument on that case on June 7. "
"WASHINGTON — Rebecca Slaughter’s recent Monday morning started out in a pretty typical way for a working mother of a newborn. She woke at 2 a.m. to feed, burp and change the diaper on her then-7-week-old daughter, Pippa. She repeated the routine three hours later. By 6:30 a.m., Ms. Slaughter checked her email and schedule while fixing breakfast for her two older children, ages 3 and 5. Her commute started at 8, driving her Honda minivan from her home in Bethesda, Md., a Washington suburb, while hooked up to a hands-free electric breast pump. It was when she arrived at the office about a half-hour later that her day took an unusual turn. She checked into the neoclassical Federal Trade Commission Building in the nation’s capital, with Pippa in tow, as one of the country’s top business regulators — and the first to do the job with a baby in the office.

What does the confusion reveal about President Trump’s approach to immigration? On today’s episode: • Caitlin Dickerson, a national immigration reporter for The New York Times. Background reading: • An official with the Department of Health and Human Services said that the agency had not been able to contact 1,475 migrant children it had placed with sponsors in the United States. The children had entered the country as unaccompanied minors; many were fleeing violence in Central America. • The Trump administration says it separates immigrant families only when necessary to protect the child. But the government’s own figures show this has happened in more than 700 cases. • The number of children who were unaccounted for was conflated with the number of children who been separated from their guardians in a public outcry that gave rise to hashtags like #WhereAreTheChildren.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Puerto Rico. When President Trump traveled to Puerto Rico last October after Hurricane Maria, he touted the storm’s low death toll as proof that his administration had done its job well. “Every death is a horror,” he said. “But if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina … what is your death count, as of this moment? 17?” He was very wrong. The true death toll could exceed 4,600, according to a study published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine that appears to be the most rigorous count yet. Many of the victims likely died from delayed medical care, which is something that a competent government response could have avoided. Puerto Rico’s fatality count is now more than twice as high as the Katrina count that Trump called a “real catastrophe.” It’s easy to overlook Puerto Rico with everything else going on — the latest news about Trump’s apparent efforts to obstruct justice, his continuing criticism of his own attorney general and so on. But I urge you to not forget Puerto Rico. Here is a selection of commentary on the new study: “There are life-and-death consequences to putting someone like Donald Trump in command of the federal government,” Slate’s Jamelle Bouie writes. “The profound failure of leadership and management that Trump’s critics feared has actually happened, and we are just now learning the scale of that disaster.” “If we had a responsible Congress that took oversight seriously there would be a top-to-bottom review” of the administration’s response, writes The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin. “But don’t hold your breath.” On Twitter, Refinery29’s Andrea González-Ramírez has compiled a list of the dead and invites others to add their loved ones’ names. “Most of these deaths were preventable,” she writes.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) In the national consciousness, Stockton has had a run of bad associations. It suffered as an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis, and was a prime exhibit of how a city can plunge into bankruptcy. Now Stockton is becoming a laboratory for an idea capturing attention worldwide as a potential means of making life more economically secure for all. It is readying plans to begin a trial of so-called Universal Basic Income, handing out cash grants to several hundred local families, no strings attached. Finland has tested the idea. Trials have been underway in Oakland and in Canada. But Stockton is set to become the first American city to embrace the idea from City Hall itself. That a city in California has made itself a venue for the idea seems no accident. The state has long tried fresh approaches to governance. Ahead of the state’s political primaries on Tuesday, much of the conversation has centered on concerns about economic inequality. The project in Stockton is the product of a partnership between the city’s history-making, social-media savvy mayor, Michael Tubbs, and a philanthropic foundation headed by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Silicon Valley has taken a shine to basic income as a way to soften the effects of its creations — a potential army of robots poised to capture jobs from humans. But Stockton wants to demonstrate a different aspect of basic income’s appeal: its potential to alleviate the troubles of the working poor. "
"President Trump is expected to receive a letter from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, hand-delivered by his envoy, on Friday afternoon, as the president and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, voice optimism about efforts to reinstate a canceled summit meeting with Mr. Kim. But on Thursday, Mr. Kim also welcomed a top Russian official to Pyongyang, offering a reminder that competing powers could still buffet the White House’s effort to salvage the meeting. Mr. Pompeo, who met over two days with a senior emissary of Mr. Kim in New York, said on Thursday that he was “confident we are moving in the right direction.” It would be “nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste,” Mr. Pompeo said after two and a half hours of discussions with Kim Yong-chol, the former North Korean intelligence chief and top nuclear arms negotiator. “If these talks are successful, they will truly be historic.” The diplomacy is expected to continue on Friday in Washington. Still, as the pace of diplomacy accelerated in the United States, Kim Jong-un was conducting his own outreach to a major American adversary at home. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov became the first senior Russian official to meet with the young North Korean leader, extending an invitation from President Vladimir V. Putin for Mr. Kim to visit Moscow. Mr. Lavrov called for the lifting of sanctions on North Korea — the centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s strategy for drawing the North to the bargaining table — and endorsed moves toward reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula.

"WELD COUNTY, Colo. — A new oil rig will rise behind a middle school in this sprawling county in the coming months, its slender tower bearing an announcement: fracking is back. After a downturn that began in 2015, oil and gas production is booming again, and new projects are sprouting along American freeways and padding government budgets, cheered by state legislatures, the fossil fuel industry and the Trump administration. But this growth is also spurring a return of the turmoil that accompanied the last boom, pitting neighbor against neighbor and communities against companies in a fight over which projects should be allowed to pierce the land. In few places is that tension more evident than along Colorado’s Front Range, where a fracking boom is colliding with a population explosion. Drilling applications in the state have risen 70 percent in just a year, while the area north of Denver is expected to double in population by 2050. In Weld County — the center of the state’s oil and gas activity and home to more than 23,000 active wells — that tension has converged at a school called Bella Romero Academy. Just behind the school, workers are laying the foundation for a 24-well project that will pull oil and gas from the earth as students race across the playground. "
"President Trump is putting forward a nominee who is virulently anti-immigrant to be assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, a job I used to hold in the Obama administration. The nomination, announced last week, is only the latest move by the administration to chip away at our standing as the world’s top backer of humanitarian efforts. The new nominee, Ronald Mortensen, has made his positions on immigration issues clear as a fellow of the Center for Immigration Studies. For example, he has insisted that most of the Dreamers — undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children — have committed felonies. But his likely hostility to the mission of the bureau is not unique: the administration has named several immigration hard-liners to key posts. Rather, Mr. Mortensen’s nomination needs to be understood as part of a campaign to change America’s long tradition of welcoming refugees and immigrants and offering sanctuary to the persecuted. President Trump’s anti-Muslim travel ban, announced shortly after his inauguration, was the first salvo in this campaign. Even with courts overturning various versions of the ban, the White House has succeeded in slashing the number of refugees admitted to the United States to the lowest level in years — from 85,000 in the last full year of the Obama administration to as few as 20,000 projected for this year. The network of faith-based and secular charities around the United States that support refugee families to create new lives is disintegrating. With so few refugees being admitted, the State Department has announced plans to no longer fund some of these groups. The result is that fewer cities will be involved in the resettlement programs, the staff and volunteers who help refugees will disperse, and we will lose part of a highly successful public-private partnership. Lost, too, will be the proven economic and cultural benefits additional refugees would bring and the chance for a fresh start they desperately need. While refugee aid delivered overseas through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees remains at robust levels, this is primarily because of bipartisan support in Congress. Other United Nations agencies, however, have been cut off. The White House stopped funding the United Nations Population Fund, saying it was involved in forced abortions and sterilizations, an assertion it denies. The agency plays an essential role in seeing to the reproductive health of displaced women and improving survival rates for mothers and babies, and in 2016, I celebrated when the 5,000th baby was born alive and healthy in its clinic in the Zaatri refugee camp in Jordan. The agency now reports there are 64,000 pregnant Rohingya in the squalor of refugee camps in Bangladesh who need help to deliver their babies safely. The Trump administration also cut its funding of the United Nations agency that runs schools and provides health care to Palestinian refugees by more than 80 percent after Palestinians and United Nations member states criticized the decision to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The reduction has resulted in what a United Nations representative has called an “unprecedented financial crisis.” Left unclear is how punishing the poorest Palestinians helps an already tense situation.

"Racist comments don’t hurt my feelings. Not at all. However, I find that people assume that they are hurtful, both the persons spewing them and those empathic about the perceived pain. But I register no such pain. I’m from the Toni Morrison school of morality on the subject of race. As she once told Charlie Rose: “I always knew that I had the high ground, all my life. I always thought those people who said I couldn’t come in the drugstore, and I had to sit in this funny place, and I couldn’t go in the park — —” Rose interjects: “You felt morally superior to them from Day 1.” Morrison continued: “I did. And I thought they knew that I knew that they were inferior to me, morally. I always thought that, and my parents always thought that.” You see, racism is a moral corruption built on an intellectual fallacy and exists as a construction invented for the very purpose of violence. So, when people demonstrate that they subscribe to theories of racism, they have shown their hand, and I am immediately roused by the euphoric understanding that they are compromised, diminished and assailable. Instead of reducing me, their racism reduces them. That is the ironic, poetic justice of it. Of course, one only has to think about it for a moment to find the enormous hole in the logic that racism morally weakens the object of the sickness rather than the possessor of the sickness. Although it doesn’t hurt my feelings, it does enrage me when racists are granted power in society to allow their idiocy to have a negative impact on other people, whether that be culturally, psychologically and spiritually, or materially and physically.

"Last year, I predicted the government’s case to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would most likely be the antitrust case of the decade. That may prove to be an understatement. Since then, a pipeline has filled with megadeals awaiting the case’s outcome, which the judge presiding over the fight has said will come in less than two weeks. Rarely has Wall Street awaited a court ruling with such bated breath. Comcast, which earlier bid for the bulk of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets but lost out to Disney, is readying a new bid to disrupt that deal. Verizon approached CBS about a deal last year, one reason CBS is trying to avoid a merger with Viacom. (Verizon executives have cast doubt on such a deal.) T-Mobile has been so emboldened as to bid for Sprint, after having the government block such a proposal just four years ago. Gene Kimmelman, former general counsel for the Justice Department’s antitrust division and chief executive of Public Knowledge, an advocate for an open internet, predicted that if AT&T wins, “the floodgates could really open up.” “You’ve already got Comcast,” he added. “Verizon and Charter Communications won’t be far behind.” Many on Wall Street seem to have decided that an AT&T victory is all but a sure thing. In one sign of growing investor confidence that the deal would go through, Time Warner shares have been inching higher this year, currently trading above $93, after cratering last fall when the government filed its lawsuit. It’s not hard to see why investors expect the companies to prevail. Court challenges to so-called vertical mergers like this one — Time Warner supplies content to AT&T — are less likely to succeed than those against mergers of direct competitors. That is because they don’t reduce the number of competitors. Until now, the government hadn’t litigated a vertical merger case in decades. The government’s post-trial legal brief was conspicuously short on precedents, because there aren’t many. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s use of his constitutional power to pardon criminals is proving to be as idiosyncratic as other aspects of his presidency. On Thursday, he pardoned Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative author convicted of making illegal campaign contributions, and he said he was considering commuting the sentence of former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, a Democrat, and pardoning Martha Stewart, the lifestyle guru. He has also pardoned I. Lewis Libby Jr., a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, and Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff. The Constitution gives presidents what appears to be unlimited authority to grant pardons. He “shall have the power,” Article II says, “to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” The pardon power extends only to federal crimes. Otherwise, presidents are free to use it as they see fit. As the Supreme Court put it in an 1866 decision involving a former Confederate senator, Ex Parte Garland, the power “is unlimited.” “It extends,” the court said, “to every offense known to the law.” In a tweet last year, Mr. Trump indicated that he had studied the matter. “All agree the U.S. president has the complete power to pardon,” he wrote. No. Other presidents have relied on recommendations from the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney. The office has an elaborate and lengthy process for considering pardon applications. It generally requires a five-year waiting period, the office’s application instructions say, “to afford the petitioner a reasonable period of time in which to demonstrate an ability to lead a responsible, productive and law-abiding life.” "
