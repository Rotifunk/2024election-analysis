"Iran’s central banker was fired on Wednesday in the first senior shake-up since the United States abandoned the nuclear agreement nearly three months ago and restored sanctions, moves that worsened an already weak Iranian economy. The dismissed official, Valiollah Seif, governor of the central bank for five years, had been widely assailed for what critics called his mismanagement of Iran’s monetary policy, which contributed to a steep drop in the value of the country’s rial currency. Some also faulted Mr. Seif for failing to foresee that the Trump administration would withdraw from the nuclear agreement, which had eased economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear work. President Trump’s decision, announced in May, accelerated a capital flight from Iran that hastened the rial’s decline, unnerving Iranians who saw it as a warning of economic calamity. Mr. Seif may have been further impaired by the Trump administration’s decision, after reimposing sanctions, to blacklist him for what it called his role in money transfers to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization that the United States regards as a terrorist group. The blacklisting made it difficult for international bankers to deal with Mr. Seif without risking American penalties. His departure, announced in Iran’s state-run media, made Mr. Seif the first top official in President Hassan Rouhani’s government to fall since the nuclear agreement began to unravel. Analysts expect more dismissals because of the tough new economic reality facing the nation of 80 million, where inflation and unemployment are on the rise. "
"This Thursday the Trump administration faces a deadline handed down earlier this summer by a United States District Court judge: reunite the children separated from their parents at the border by federal law enforcement. There’s no way the White House will pull it off. Reports indicate that hundreds of parents will not be seeing their children because the government can’t locate the parents or has already deported them. This entire catastrophe isn’t just the result of a deliberately cruel and incompetently implemented policy, though it is certainly that. These sundered families are the latest casualty of “zero tolerance” — a misguided mind-set that bludgeons the people it targets, no matter how vulnerable. For a generation, American policymakers have been addicted to zero tolerance as a response to all social ills: crime, drugs, sexual violations — even misbehaving schoolchildren. Start with crime. In the 1980s and 1990s, federal and state governments went on a criminal justice binge, vastly expanding our criminal codes, especially in the “wars” against crime and drugs and deploying zero-tolerance policing. The result is that some 70 million Americans have a criminal record — a number equal to Americans with a college degree, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. We remain the nation that “incarcerates a larger share of its population than any other,” according to a recent Pew Research Center report. This despite the fact that crime in the United States is at a modern low. But zero tolerance wasn’t just part of the criminal justice system. Under federal mandate, it became entrenched in schools. Among those caught was a 14-year-old girl in Ohio who, in 1996, gave a Midol tablet to a friend for her menstrual cramps. Administrators at her public junior high school found out, and the girl who supplied the Midol was suspended as a drug dealer.   She was black, and the family brought a suit claiming racial discrimination. They ultimately won, but those who have tracked the implementation and consequences of zero-tolerance policies have documented how black and brown people are disproportionately punished by them. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — Qualcomm called off its $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after Chinese regulators did not rule on the transaction amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The company had already cautioned that the deal was likely to be scrapped, assuming no last-minute approval by Chinese authorities came by a midnight deadline. Both NXP and Qualcomm formally announced the termination on Thursday. NXP said it would receive a $2 billion termination fee from Qualcomm as a result, while Qualcomm said it would buy back up to $30 billion of its stock. The transaction failed after a series of trade moves by the Trump administration, including tariffs on numerous Chinese goods, and retaliatory measures from China. Trade experts had said China appeared to be withholding approval of the Qualcomm deal to gain negotiating leverage. Eight other jurisdictions, including the United States, had already approved Qualcomm’s purchase of the Dutch chip maker. China was the exception, dragging the review process out to more than 20 months. The developments followed actions by President Trump to aid Qualcomm earlier this year. In March, he blocked a $117 billion hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm by a rival chip maker, Broadcom, after a federal committee said an acquisition would reduce research spending on wireless technology essential to national security.

"WASHINGTON — The United States and the European Union stepped back from the brink of a trade war on Wednesday, after President Trump said the Europeans agreed to work toward lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and to buy billions of dollars of American soybeans and natural gas. The surprise announcement, made by Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, defused, for the moment, a trade battle that began with Mr. Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum exports and threatened to escalate to automobiles. “We’re starting the negotiation right now, but we know very much where it’s going,” Mr. Trump said, standing next to Mr. Juncker at a hastily scheduled appearance in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Juncker said, “I had the intention to make a deal today, and we have made a deal today.” The two sides, he said, had agreed to hold off on further tariffs, and work toward dropping the existing ones on steel and aluminum, while they tried to work out a deal to eliminate tariffs, nontariff barriers and subsidies on industrial goods, excluding autos. It was hard to say, given Mr. Trump’s bluster and unpredictable negotiating style, if the agreement was a genuine truce or merely a lull in a conflict that could flare up again. Twice, Mr. Trump’s aides have negotiated potential deals with China, only to have him reject them and impose further tariffs. Cutting these trade barriers to zero would be an extraordinarily complex political challenge on both sides of the Atlantic. And Mr. Trump stepped back from punitive tariff threats for some relatively minor European concessions: the purchase of soybeans to make up for a steep falloff of buying by China, and the promise to purchase liquefied natural gas once the United States builds more export terminals, which are far away. For weeks, the president has portrayed the European Union as fleecing America with unfair trade, but he put away his saber as farm state Republicans were begging for relief. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — For nearly two years, Facebook has appeared bulletproof despite a series of scandals about the misuse of its giant social network. But the Silicon Valley company’s streak ended on Wednesday when it said that the accumulation of issues was starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business — and that the costs are set to continue playing out for months. Facebook reported on Wednesday that growth in digital advertising sales and in the number of its users had decelerated in the second quarter. The company’s leaders, including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, added that the trajectory was not likely to improve anytime soon, especially as Facebook spends to improve the privacy and security of users. Facebook has grappled with months of scrutiny over Russian misuse of the platform in the 2016 American presidential campaign and the harvesting of its users’ data through the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The results were among the first signs that the issues had pierced the company’s image and would have a lasting effect on its moneymaking machine. In response, Facebook’s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading, erasing more than $120 billion in market value in less than two hours. If those losses hold up through regular trading on Thursday, the one-day stock decline will be the biggest in Facebook’s history. “This is a fork-in-the-road situation for Facebook,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, a marketing research firm. He said the challenges included regaining public trust as well as increasing the number of people joining Facebook and the time they spent on the platform. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The trade war with the European Union appears to be off, at least for now. At a surprise news conference, President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they would work toward lowering tariffs and other trade barriers. Details of the agreement were scant but hinted at collaboration against Chinese trade practices. At the same time, a very different story was unfurling. The release of a secret recording Tuesday night by Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, has unraveled some of the false statements the president has used as a shield against tough questions and embarrassing stories. _____ 2. The news from Washington took some other interesting twists, in a fairly compressed time frame. While President Trump was announcing a trade truce with the E.U., Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed President Trump’s case that, despite his conciliatory appearance last week with Vladimir Putin, Mr. Trump was being tough on Russia.

"The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees will cut more than 260 jobs and curtail mental health services and mobile health clinics, it announced on Wednesday, the first reduction since the United States suspended tens of millions of dollars in funding this year. “These cuts are unprecedented in their scope and depth and their consequences are likely to be dramatic, widespread and unpredictable,” Christopher Gunness, the agency’s spokesman, said in an email. The cuts are the first outcome of a significant American reduction in contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or Unrwa. The Trump administration has provided about $60 million this year. That reflects a drop of more than 80 percent from the $360 million the United States contributed in 2017. Historically, the United States has been one of the biggest donors to Unrwa, which provides food, education, health services and employment to many Palestinians classified as refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The agency said its food assistance program would remain in place until the end of the year, but Mr. Gunness said he feared that agency-run schools would not open on time, in August, because of funding shortages. “We may have over half a million kids on the streets of the Middle East — more than half of them in Gaza — rather than in U.N. schools,” he said. “Whose interests does that serve?” The job cuts are spread out between the West Bank and Gaza. The agency said it would not renew the contracts of 154 workers in the West Bank and 113 in Gaza. In addition, 584 other workers will shift to part-time jobs. Trump administration officials have said any restoration of aid will be partly dependent on what they consider improvements in the agency’s efficiency and accountability. They also said other countries should share more of the financial burden. Critics of the funding cut have asserted that the United States was retaliating against Palestinians for their angry responses to its decisions favoring Israel in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian dispute, notably the recognition in December of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Pierre Krähenbühl, the commissioner general of Unrwa, said in a June interview with The New York Times that the funding cut had put the agency in its worst financial situation since its creation in 1949, a year after Israel was founded, and could disrupt vital services. In response to the cuts, the agency initiated a fund-raising campaign that collected $238 million between March and June. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A secret Trump recording, violence at Pakistan’s polls and a flag fracas for Australia. Here’s what you need to know: • A betrayal or “a new path”? President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, released a secret recording in which Mr. Trump appears to have direct knowledge about hush money paid to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Here’s how the audio clip has unraveled a web of false statements by Mr. Trump and his aides. Mr. Trump reacted at once: “What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad!” But Mr. Cohen’s lawyer said that his client is “on a new path — it’s a reset button to tell the truth and to let the chips fall where they may.” Separately, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Mr. Trump before Congress, saying he had “proof” that the president is willing to confront Moscow for its interference in American elections and misbehavior around the world. The White House, meanwhile, said a planned follow-up meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia will be postponed until after the investigation of the special counsel is concluded. _____ "
"Beware of oil companies bearing gifts. Recently, the lobbyists and former Senators Trent Lott and John Breaux, backed by companies like Exxon Mobil and Shell, have been campaigning for a federal tax on carbon dioxide emissions. This would increase energy costs, but all revenue from the tax would be returned to the public. A family of four might receive a $2,000 check from the government every year. And we would all have an incentive to reduce our use of carbon-based fossil fuels in favor of clean energy. Most environmentalists, including us, desperately want a meaningful tax on carbon. But several of the people involved in this proposal have shown little previous interest in climate change. The oil industry had few better friends than Mr. Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, and Mr. Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, when they were in office. So what is going on here? Well, Mr. Lott and Mr. Breaux aren’t simply proposing a tax, but a deal: a carbon tax in exchange for two other things. First, they want “an outright repeal of the Clean Power Plan,” which allows the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions and which the Trump administration is moving to cancel. Second — and most consequentially — they want to give fossil fuel companies immunity from lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for damage they have done to the climate. As their proposal puts it, “Robust carbon taxes would also make possible an end to federal and state tort liability for emitters.” Not coincidentally at all, 14 local and county governments and the State of Rhode Island filed such lawsuits in the last year, trying to make big oil companies pay their fair share for climate adaptations — the fortifications against the consequences, for instance, of rising seas, extreme weather and prolonged droughts. (The Rockefeller Family Fund has funded organizations that support the goals of these lawsuits.) Making the polluter pay is a bedrock environmental principle and a matter of simple justice. If the companies most responsible for climate change can escape liability, then ordinary citizens will have to shoulder the burden of adapting to the changing climate, which over the next few decades will cost this country trillions of dollars. What Big Oil really fears, much more than a modest price on carbon, and what it is trying to escape through the proposed deal, is having to pay for its own actions. Climate science has made major advancements recently and can now demonstrate quite precisely the extent to which human-caused climate change is responsible for extreme weather. Peer-reviewed science can also show what percentage of greenhouse gas pollution any particular company has emitted since the Industrial Revolution. "
"Sean Spicer has written a book. And to promote it in interview after interview, he seems willing to relive his darkest moments as White House press secretary. A National Public Radio host grilled him last week about President Trump’s inauguration crowd, yet again. A BBC anchor told him Monday that he had “corrupted discourse for the entire world.” Fox News was gentler, asking his mother what it was like to raise “this amazing child.” (“Oh come on,” she replied, with a laugh.) “Some interviews are obviously more enjoyable than others,” Mr. Spicer told The New York Times in a phone interview on Wednesday. The confrontational BBC interview in particular has been shared with relish by his critics online, with some journalists calling the exchange “brutal” and “savage.” Emily Maitlis, the BBC anchor of “Newsnight,” grilled Mr. Spicer on his infamous first briefing, in which he falsely said that Mr. Trump’s swearing-in a day earlier had drawn the “largest audience to ever witness an inauguration.” Ms. Maitlis called the news conference the start of a “corrosive culture” in the United States and beyond and said Mr. Spicer had corrupted the political conversation “by going along with these lies.” "
"Facts don’t matter to millions of Americans anymore. That is just the truth. Republicans bewitched by Donald Trump have devalued the import of truth. It is a sad truth and a dangerous one. What is the operational framework of a society when the truth ceases to be accepted as true? There may be precedents in other countries, but one would be hard pressed to find a precedent here. It is becoming cliché now to say that we are in uncharted territory with Trump and his regime, but that is precisely where we are. There is tremendous possibility for peril, but luckily for Trump and the country, we have so far avoided all-out catastrophe. There is no guarantee that our lucky streak will be extended. Every day there is no catastrophe, every day yet another never-before-seen, outrageous scandal emerges from this administration and Trump is not destroyed by it, it strengthens him and numbs us and steels his supporters. The more he lies without paying a price for it, the more he weakens the power of the truth to defend right and condemn wrong. And he expands his latitude to lie more. "
"WASHINGTON — By the end of the night, Austin Juersivich, an 18-year-old attending a conservative leadership conference for high schoolers, had nearly lost his voice. That didn’t stop him from beaming. “That tells you how much I liked it,” Mr. Juersivich, of Akron, Ohio, said with a raspy voice on Tuesday. The four-day gathering, organized by Turning Point USA for about 700 high-school-age conservatives from across the country, is being marketed as a leadership conference that gives teenagers the tools needed to network, organize and campaign while hearing from a who’s who of politics and the news media. “They’re teaching us about how to handle politics and how to live in a world where some things aren’t good to say in public and how to deal with backlash on that,” said Genna Montalbano, a rising junior from Houston. But an elegant dinner Tuesday night at Trump International Hotel featuring Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Donald Trump Jr. and Turning Point USA’s 24-year-old founder, Charlie Kirk, revealed that more than anything, this week is a chance for the teenagers to reject the stereotype that their generation is exclusively liberal and to finally be themselves, “Make America Great Again” hats and all. “You are the only real rebels left in this country,” Mr. Trump said, to thunderous applause. For some, the conference is an opportunity to swap stories about the struggle to express their conservative opinions at school. Jarrett Wiggonton, an 18-year-old from Virginia, said that at a recent pep rally, his and his friends’ Trump signs and paraphernalia were confiscated by teachers. "
"Mr. Pompeo is exaggerating the Trump administration’s support for the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. While the administration “gets credit for compliance, clearly it was Congress pushing the administration’s hand” to pass the law, said Alina Polyakova, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution. The law, which was enacted in August, imposed new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. It also upheld earlier sanctions that President Barack Obama had enacted through executive orders and it limited President Trump’s ability to lift sanctions against Russia. The legislation passed with overwhelming support — a veto-proof majority vote of 98 to 2 in the Senate and 419 to 3 in the House. Mr. Pompeo is right that Mr. Trump eventually signed the law. But the president did so reluctantly after the White House pushed to weaken the bill. Even as he signed it into law, Mr. Trump called the bill “seriously flawed” and said that it “included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.” As the law requires, the administration imposed economic sanctions in March on individuals and organizations linked to Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.  In April, American sanctions were issued against some of Russia’s richest men and top government officials. More sanctions were imposed in June on individuals and organizations accused of directly supporting efforts to carry out cyberattacks in the United States and in Ukraine as well as on digital infrastructure around the world.

"Lanny J. Davis’s client list, like his quintessentially Washington career as an all-purpose lawyer, lobbyist, crisis consultant and television-talker, is lengthy, international — and more than occasionally contradictory. Mr. Davis has represented Harvey Weinstein and Penn State, a Ukrainian oligarch with links to President Trump’s indicted former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an Ivory Coast strongman whom Mr. Davis today insists he was trying to help dislodge as part of a secret arrangement with the State Department. Now, Mr. Davis — best known as a high-profile spinner for Bill and Hillary Clinton, first in the White House and then on any cable news network that would have him — has set off on perhaps his least likely partnership: He is defending Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, who released a recording this week of a conversation that suggests Mr. Trump knew about hush money payments to a former Playboy model. It was Mr. Davis who went on CNN on Tuesday evening to tell the world about their gambit. “Don’t believe me, I’m a Democrat,” Mr. Davis said, addressing “red America” as he stared into the camera. “Believe your own ears.” That strategy, those who know Mr. Davis say, is “classic Lanny,” for better or worse, a sort of valedictory turn for an avatar of the capital’s forever-booming image-buffing industry. His book’s subtitle, lifted from his time as Mr. Clinton’s special counsel and as a self-described crisis guru, advises: “Tell it early, tell it all, tell it yourself.” For Mr. Cohen, this has translated to an aggressive defense in the news media — as much reputational management as legal wrangling — responding in kind to Mr. Trump and his team where other lawyers might be inclined to lie low, with federal prosecutors watching closely. "
"The White House barred a CNN journalist from attending a public appearance by President Trump in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, an apparent act of retaliation that drew immediate rebuke from news organizations and signaled the latest escalation of Mr. Trump’s hostilities toward the news media. Kaitlan Collins, a White House correspondent for CNN, said she was called into the West Wing and chastised by administration officials for what they deemed “inappropriate” questions that she had asked of Mr. Trump during an Oval Office photo opportunity earlier in the day. The officials — Bill Shine, the newly appointed deputy chief of staff, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary — then informed Ms. Collins that they would not allow her to attend Mr. Trump’s public remarks with the president of the European Commission, an event that was otherwise open to the media. “They did not like the questions I asked President Trump about the news of the day,” Ms. Collins said. It is standard practice for reporters to ask questions of Mr. Trump at the end of photo ops, where the president often engages at length even as his aides try to shuffle the reporters from the scene. On Wednesday, Ms. Collins — who attended as a pool reporter, representing the major television networks — asked Mr. Trump several times if he had concerns about the loyalty of his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, whom the president had tweeted about on Wednesday morning. "
"WASHINGTON — A group of House Republicans escalated their feud with the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, on Wednesday, introducing articles of impeachment in a long-shot bid to oust the official overseeing the special counsel inquiry into Russian election interference. The move was seen as much as a political maneuver as an act of congressional oversight. The group of 11, led by Representatives Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio, would need the support of a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to convict Mr. Rosenstein. The resolution they filed does not require the entire House to vote before Congress adjourns for its summer recess on Friday. But it could provide President Trump with more ammunition to attack Mr. Rosenstein, who has been in Mr. Trump’s cross hairs since he appointed the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to investigate Russia’s plot to manipulate the 2016 presidential election and whether any Trump associates were complicit. Republican lawmakers have been sparring with Mr. Rosenstein for months. They accuse the Justice Department of being less than forthcoming with documents related to several of its most sensitive investigations, including the Russia inquiry. “It’s time to find a new deputy attorney general who is serious about accountability and transparency,” Mr. Meadows said in a statement on Wednesday.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s confrontation with China is beginning to ripple through American academic and research institutions, as a crackdown on visas for certain Chinese citizens has left the higher education community wondering how it will adapt to the administration’s effort to stop intellectual property theft and slow China’s push for technological supremacy. Educators and academic groups fear that the additional scrutiny could hinder scientific innovation, alienate talented applicants or intensify aggressions toward Chinese scientists already in the country. Academics are already wrestling with the increased attention. At an aerospace conference in Georgia last month, Ella Atkins, a University of Michigan professor, recalled a colleague approaching her with a dilemma. The colleague, an assistant professor at another university, had recently led and submitted a research proposal for a federal grant. But he worried that because he was Chinese, the judges would be biased against his team. “He said, ‘I need to figure out how to take myself off as the P.I., the principal investigator, if that’s going to compromise our project’s chances of being accepted,’” Ms. Atkins said, declining to name the academic for fear of jeopardizing his proposal. The professor, she added, was even considering withdrawing from the project completely to avoid holding back his co-researchers. It is a sentiment that some, such as Representative Judy Chu, Democrat of California, believe underscores a tone of racism behind the policy change. The restrictions, she said, equate to targeting “an entire ethnic group of people for suspicion that they’re spies for China.” "
"The Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, no stranger to speaking his mind and creating controversy, on Wednesday added fuel to an already confusing and rancorous debate about how the N.F.L. plans to handle players who demonstrate during the playing of the national anthem this season. At the opening of the Cowboys’ training camp in Oxnard, Calif., Jones said that all his team’s players would be required to stand on the field for the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” They would not be able to stay in the team’s locker room, something allowed under the league’s revised policy on the anthem. “Our policy is you stand during the anthem, toe the line,” Jones told reporters. Jones added that President Trump’s tweets criticizing the league’s handling of the players who protest had been “problematic” for the N.F.L. Jones’s comments came as the league and N.F.L. Players Association continue to discuss how to revise the anthem policy yet again. A number of players have chosen to kneel or raise a fist during the playing of the anthem, to draw attention to racism and police brutality. In May, the owners unilaterally said that players would be obligated to stand on the field for the national anthem but would have the option of staying indoors. The league reserved the right to fine teams whose players protest on the field during the anthem, while the teams, in turn, can penalize those players. Previously, players were obligated to be on the field during the anthem, but only encouraged, not forced, to stand while the song was being played. "
"An American pastor held on espionage charges in Turkey, the focus of an intensive campaign by top United States officials seeking his freedom, was moved from jail to house arrest on Wednesday because of health concerns. Andrew Brunson, a 50-year-old evangelical pastor from North Carolina, has been held for more than a year and a half in a case that has aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and the United States, longtime allies. He is one of 20 Americans who were charged after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016. President Trump spoke to Mr. Erdogan by phone about the case, and posted a message on Twitter last week urging the Turkish leader to “do something” to free the pastor. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also took to Twitter to say that while the United States welcomed the “long overdue news that Pastor Brunson has been moved from prison to house arrest,” the measure was “not enough.” “We have seen no credible evidence against Mr. Brunson, and call on Turkish authorities to resolve his case immediately in a transparent and fair manner,” Mr. Pompeo wrote. Just last week, a court in Turkey’s western Izmir Province upheld an earlier decision to place Mr. Brunson in jail while he awaited the continuation of a trial on charges of terrorism and espionage. His lawyer appealed the decision, citing unspecified concerns over Mr. Brunson’s health, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. "
"The economy may be humming, but for American car companies, the year is looking less bright. All of Detroit’s Big 3 automakers issued downward revisions on Wednesday in their financial forecasts for the year, with each highlighting rising commodities costs that stem in part from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The adjustments, made as the companies announced their second-quarter earnings, sent their shares down sharply. Ford Motor recorded the worst showing of the three, as net income fell by nearly half to $1.1 billion from the same period ago. Aside from higher materials costs, Ford is struggling in Europe, South America and especially China, where it has spent heavily in recent years to expand but made just $3 million in the quarter and has watched its sales fall. “The deterioration in this important global market has been swift,” Jim Farley, Ford executive vice president and president of global markets, said in a conference call. He said Ford’s joint ventures in China suffered from uncompetitive costs, weak dealer networks and a shortage of sport-utility vehicles in its model line. Ford is now “taking urgent action,” although its troubles will linger, he said. Casting a further cloud over the company was news it was postponing a daylong meeting with analysts scheduled for September, when Ford was supposed to detail the turnaround plan of its chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett was hired in May 2017 to reinvigorate Ford, but the lack of details on Ford’s plans have frustrated some analysts. “The postponement of the capital markets day is a pretty big deal, Jim,” Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley said on the call. In an unusually blunt question, he then wondered about Mr. Hackett’s future with Ford. “Will you be the one delivering the message or will someone else be doing it?” Mr. Jonas asked. After replying at some length about the progress he felt the company had made, Mr. Hackett concluded by saying: “And hell, yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we’re going and what we want to get done. So I think there should be zero question about that.” "
"WASHINGTON — The White House said on Wednesday that President Trump wants to delay a planned follow-up meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia until after the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is concluded — which the White House predicted would be next year. “The president believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over, so we’ve agreed that it will be after the first of the year,” Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said in a statement. Last week, Mr. Trump unexpectedly said he would invite Mr. Putin to Washington in the fall — a move that some interpreted as a show of defiance by Mr. Trump after a storm of criticism over his meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland. Mr. Trump directed Mr. Bolton to deliver the invitation. But the Kremlin had not yet accepted the invitation, raising questions about whether Mr. Putin was interested. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Moscow, Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, acknowledged receiving the invitation but declined to say whether Mr. Putin would visit Washington this year. Mr. Ushakov said that the leaders had not discussed the future meeting while in Helsinki, but that Mr. Bolton had later conveyed the invitation to Russian officials. Mr. Ushakov said Russian and American officials had reached “an understanding that a meeting must take place,” but that “practical aspects will be discussed later.” He said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would, in any case, have an opportunity to meet at a Group of 20 gathering in November in Argentina, and that “maybe there will be other international events which Trump and Putin will take part in.” "

mran Mohammad survived on Manus Island through sheer discipline. He got up every morning at dawn to run, cooked for large groups at night and in between he wrote a 1,200-page autobiography, by hand, in English. But the experience of Australia’s offshore detention center — where he was held despite his status as a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar — also nearly broke him. When I first met him in Manus, he whispered in public spaces, his eyes ever-darting, as if trying to hide from threats unseen. When we said goodbye, I remember thinking: If this guy ever gets out, he’s going to succeed wildly, or he’s going to be crushed by modern life. Now he is in the United States — and I’m still not sure which way he’s heading. We met in New York last week. He’d been resettled in Chicago a few weeks earlier, and he was traveling with another Rohingya refugee from Manus and an Australian couple from Queensland who flew to the United States to see them after years of long-distance support. As a foursome, they were a case study in hope and trauma. Imran looked physically stronger.

President Trump’s tariffs have provoked retaliatory levies on American pork, beef, soybeans and sorghum. It’s only a “short-term solution,” according to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. It still faces criticism. Farmers would rather sell goods than receive handouts. And if the World Trade Organization decides it’s an unfair subsidy, it could open the way to yet more retaliation. Then, as the editorial board of the NYT argues, there are the other candidates for trade aid: Elsewhere in trade: Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, will offer Mr. Trump ideas for easing tensions today (it could be a sticky meeting). Many U.S. manufacturers are taking tariffs in their stride (Apple may become an exception). The trade war could dampen Chinese enthusiasm for U.S. oil. And here’s how to spot if tariffs damage the economy. The Main Street Investors Coalition says it represents retail investors with no voice in corporate America. But it’s trying to reduce the influence of pension funds and large 401(k) plans, where most little guys keep their money. Andrew examined the organization, and found it had nothing to do with mom-and-pop investors: Empowering individual investors might sound noble. But this coalition knows full well that individual investors rarely mount proxy contests, so its plans would probably leave boards and managers more secure. From Starbucks’ racial bias training to the Dick’s assault weapon ban, chief executives have been taking stands on social issues for several years.

"So the Ivanka Trump brand is over: kaput, shutting down, soon to be no more. Really? Don’t be silly. The Ivanka Trump brand is alive and well and working in the West Wing as a special adviser to President Trump. It’s the Ivanka Trump fashion line that is closing, as announced on Tuesday by the first daughter. The one was only ever a shadow expression of the other — or rather, a homage of sorts to what she liked to wear. Which was exactly the problem. The company was based on the premise that there was a group of women who would want to buy, with hard dollars and cents, the image Ms. Trump herself was selling to the world. The one she disseminated so relentlessly via guest appearances on her father’s television show and stories in Vogue and books and on her own Instagram page: Herself as the glassy blond embodiment of the woman who had it all — a big job, family, a perfect blow out, time to exercise. The promise for sale was that you could try this image on with the ease of slipping on a power sheath dress. It’s the promise of every celebrity- or personality-driven fashion line. It’s why Uniqlo was willing to pay so much for Roger Federer to become a brand ambassador; why Coach wanted to team up with Selena Gomez. Why so many actors and athletes now see their next career step as clothing, and why so many are willing to back them in that move. It’s not about aesthetic vision or achievement. Certainly, Ms. Trump’s clothing and accessories, polished and derivative as they were, weren’t changing anyone’s ideas about the ways fabric related to the body or the possibilities of form. The brand equity and value lies with the fame and myth of the personal brand, not the fashion brand. There’s a reason, after all, Ms. Trump did not name her line Gilded Futures, or some other such vague, kitschy title. And there’s a lesson in the last year and a half of this line for anyone who is tempted to conflate life and a shell-pink car coat. L'État, as Louis XIV said, c’est moi. The brand was her. The idea that she could dissociate herself from that sales pitch by “stepping back” from the company when she went to Washington was always patently silly. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Many Americans pay close to $100 a month for smartphone service. And this pricetag isn’t some natural reflection of the service’s value. In many other countries, smartphone plans cost much less. The economists Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago and Mara Faccio of Purdue estimate that Americans pay $50 billion per year more than they would if they instead were paying European prices — for the same quality service. That translates into about an additional $30 per month for every American household. Zingales discusses this research in a Times op-ed and argues — correctly, I believe — that it highlights the problem with antitrust policy in the United States. We have allowed companies to grow too large, to the point that many of them have outsize power. They can raise prices, as they are doing in the cellphone market, as well as hold down wages and unduly influence government policy. Europe has taken antitrust more seriously and fought back against corporate gigantism. The recent fine against Google, for its behavior in the smartphone market, is just one example. “The United States invented antitrust and for decades has been the pioneer in its enforcement. Not anymore,” Zingales writes. “A recent paper shows that in the last two decades, enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) California has staked out a leadership role in harnessing alternative energy. But solar arrays and wind turbines are intermittent electricity sources: They don’t always produce power when it’s needed, and at times they generate so much that California must give some away to its neighbors. So the state has been looking at ways to better manage all the carbon-free energy that officials have required power companies to create. One undertaking is particularly ambitious: a $3 billion plan by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to turn Hoover Dam into a giant battery, soaking up some of that solar and wind energy for later use. “Our challenge is: How do we get to 100 percent green?” Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said. “Storage helps. There’s no bigger battery in our system than Hoover Dam.” [Read more about the plan, including video, photos and an interactive look at how the project would expand the dam’s mission.] The proposal is the latest in a growing pool of ideas that California is grappling with to curb carbon emissions and combat climate change. As one of his last efforts before leaving office, Gov. Jerry Brown has set out to expand the state’s electric grid operator into a regional manager for most, if not all, of the West. A bill before the Assembly would expand the California Independent System Operator into a regional authority that utilities in other states could join. "
"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.
__________ Starbucks conducted racial bias training. Dick’s is no longer selling assault weapons. Patagonia is suing the president. In each case, a chief executive took a stand — a growing trend in corporate America. This kind of “C.E.O. activism,” which thrusts companies into politics, has been on the rise for a few years now. But recently it seems that hardly a week goes by without a senior executive inserting themselves into a contentious debate over social issues. Many Americans have noticed the trend. The public relations firm Weber Shandwick has released its third annual report on the trend, and DealBook got an early look at the study. The results underline the degree to which — whether companies like it or not — this appears to be the new normal. Here are some of the takeaways from the survey of more than 1,000 Americans: ■ People are increasingly aware of C.E.O. activism. More than a third view it favorably. ■ Nearly half of respondents believe C.E.O. activism can influence government policy. Democrats and Republicans agree that it can make an impact. ■ Less than 40 percent of respondents believe C.E.O.s “have a responsibility” to speak out. About two-thirds of Republicans said C.E.O.s should “stick to business.” ■ The top issues people want C.E.O.s to address? Training, equal pay and sexual harassment. Bottom of the list: gun control, nationalism, marijuana legalization and abortion. In a predictable effort to avoid ruffling feathers, the Weber study doesn’t call out many specific examples of activism. It doesn’t touch on Delta’s tussle with the National Rifle Association after the Parkland, Fla., shooting. There is no mention of the unraveling of the presidential advisory councils last year, when dozens of top C.E.O.s turned their backs on President Trump over his response to the Charlottesville, Va. white nationalist rally. Actually, the word “Trump” is conspicuously absent from the report. Nonetheless, the study serves as a reminder that business and politics are more entangled than ever before. “While most C.E.O.s are not accustomed to participating in the political arena,” writes Andy Polansky, the C.E.O. of Weber, “they and their companies need to be prepared to navigate these uncharted waters, whether they remain silent or not.” "
"Jason Spencer, the Georgia Republican lawmaker who was fooled into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet on the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen’s television series, intends to resign effective July 31. The decision was announced early Wednesday in an email from the office of David Ralston, the Georgia House speaker. It was the first real-world consequence of Mr. Cohen’s Showtime series, “Who Is America?” The show has pranked a long list of sitting and former lawmakers, including the former Vice President Dick Cheney; Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California; and the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The episode featuring Mr. Spencer aired on Sunday, and he initially resisted calls to resign, even from within his own party. Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, said in a post on Twitter on Monday that “the actions and language used by Jason Spencer are appalling and offensive.” Mr. Spencer lost his primary in the spring in his bid for a fifth term and initially said he would serve out his final five months, but the drum beat became too loud. [Sacha Baron Cohen is duping Republicans. Is he the James O’Keefe of the left?] By the time the speaker’s office announced the resignation, a fierce bipartisan effort to cast Mr. Spencer out of office had taken shape. It was clear that he would face sustained public and private pressure, and black lawmakers had planned a state Capitol news conference for Wednesday morning to demand that Mr. Spencer step aside. State Senator Lester Jackson, a Democrat from Savannah and the chairman of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, had vowed that he and other colleagues could not “continue to tolerate the well-documented and outright bigotry and reprehensible conduct” by Mr. Spencer. But Mr. Spencer faced some of the most intense condemnation from his own party, whose leaders, despite being focused on the final days of a contested primary runoff for governor, sensed deep political risk in a fast-growing state.

"OSTERSUND, Sweden — A Swedish student activist stopped the deportation of an Afghan man this week by refusing to take her seat on a packed Turkish Airlines flight, and her dramatic video of the tense standoff has gone viral. The student, Elin Ersson, initially bought a ticket because she believed that a 26-year-old man from Afghanistan was being deported to Kabul from Landvetter Airport in Gothenburg via Istanbul. When she got on the plane, the 26-year-old was not there, but an Afghan deportee in his 50s was with the Swedish authorities. Ms. Ersson, 21, live-streamed the standoff on the flight late Monday on Facebook, and footage of the 14-minute video shows her in tears, at times being confronted by crew members and angry passengers. But she also garnered some support. “I’m not going to sit down until this person is off the plane,” she says in the video, “because he is most likely to get killed if he is on this plane when it goes up.” As Ms. Ersson narrates the video — which had 2.7 million views as of Wednesday afternoon — a male voice with an English accent can be heard calling her “frightening” and telling her to think of the children on the flight. “I am doing what I can to save a person’s life,” she responds. “As long as a person is standing up, the pilot cannot take off. All I want to do is stop the deportation, and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal, and I have not committed a crime.” "
"Reba McEntire, Cher, Philip Glass and Wayne Shorter will receive this year’s Kennedy Center Honors, the annual Washington distinction for artists who have made extraordinary contributions to culture. And in a first for the 41-year history of the awards, which have always gone to individuals, the Broadway musical “Hamilton” will receive a special honor. “I believe that this is a work that has transformed how we think about using art to talk about who we are as a society,” Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, said in an interview. Though typically a nonpartisan event, and one of the highlights of the Washington social calendar, the Kennedy Center honors presentation has not escaped the politicization of entertainment since the 2016 election. Last year, with a couple of the honorees, including the television producer Norman Lear, expressing discomfort with the president, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, withdrew from attending, “to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction,” marking just the fourth time a president missed the event. It is still unclear if the Trumps will attend this year; the White House referred questions to Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump, who said it was too early to say. At least two of the honorees have criticized Mr. Trump, as has Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton.” A representative for Cher, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has compared the president to Hitler, did not return a request for comment. But in a statement through the Kennedy Center, she said, “When I was very young, I saw ‘Dumbo’ and ‘Cinderella’ and knew then what I wanted to be and the path my life would take and here I am! I am very grateful to the Kennedy Center.” "
"CHICAGO — For nearly five decades, the Title X family planning program has provided much needed funding for reproductive health care for millions of uninsured and underinsured people, covering basic services from cancer screenings to contraception to treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Now, the Trump administration is proposing a so-called domestic gag rule that would strictly limit how clinics that get this funding can refer patients for safe, legal abortions. Under the proposal, clinics will face a choice: either adhere to unacceptable restrictions on how they practice medicine or be cut off from funding that allows them to provide for millions of patients. As a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, I can attest that this proposal is bad medicine; as a medical ethicist, I can also affirm it is an assault on both the patient-provider relationship and the autonomy of patients and health care providers. The consequences of the proposed rule, which is open for public comment through July 31, go beyond abortion access: It would greatly restrict patient access to effective and necessary services, from contraception to preventive care. The rule demands physical and financial separation requirements between areas that use Title X funding and those that use nonfederal funds to provide abortion services — separate physical spaces, accounting records, health records, phone numbers and more — demands that seem intended to make it impossible for clinics to operate effectively. The proposed rule is clearly an attack on Planned Parenthood, which cares for over 40 percent of Title X patients. But it also violates a more fundamental tenet of medical care: that providers be able to counsel patients about their medical options free from external interference by politically motivated rules that aren’t based on evidence. For several years, I worked at a Title X-funded clinic on the West Side of Chicago, caring primarily for patients who lacked insurance. I saw firsthand what it meant for people to have access to both preventive care and providers who were able to counsel them effectively — and what it meant when they didn’t.   I remember one patient in particular.  She was in her late 30s, and uninsured. She came to our clinic with an unintended pregnancy. She had been told, inaccurately,  that because of a medical condition, no method of hormonal birth control was safe, so she relied on condoms alone; in other words, she had received the sort of misinformation that Title X-funded clinics can help to combat.

"The police have made an arrest in connection with the destruction of President Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this week by a man with a pickax. A suspect, who has been identified as Austin Clay, 24, was arrested on Wednesday and released early Thursday morning, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff Department’s online records. He had been held on bail of $20,000 on a charge of felony vandalism, Officer Ray Brown, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said. It is not clear who posted bail for Mr. Clay. James Otis, 54, who attempted to remove Mr. Trump’s star by smashing it with a pickax and sledgehammer in October 2016, said he had rushed to Mr. Clay’s aid but missed his mark — by the time he had arrived to help, Mr. Clay had already been released. The administrator of a GoFundMe page billed as raising money for the bail did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Clay’s next court date will be Aug. 15. “He’s a young kid,” Mr. Otis said by phone. “I’m sure he was very angry about something Trump had done. I wanted to help him because I had been in his footsteps a few years earlier. He’s got a lot to deal with.” Mr. Otis said he plans to help Mr. Clay find a lawyer or help out in any way that he can. Mr. Otis pleaded no contest to felony vandalism in February 2017. He agreed to pay $4,400 for the damage, and was sentenced to three years’ probation and 20 days of community service. "
"WASHINGTON — Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, told skeptical senators on Wednesday that the Trump administration has taken a truckload of punitive actions against Moscow as “proof” it is tough on Russia as the White House walked back an invitation for President Vladimir V. Putin to visit Washington this fall. Yet during a combative three-hour Senate hearing, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly declined to provide specifics about a one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Mr. Putin last week in Helsinki, Finland — including the possibility of relaxing sanctions on Moscow, military cooperation in Syria or the future of Crimea. Mr. Pompeo angrily dismissed questions about the deep gulf between the administration’s tough policies on Russia and Mr. Trump’s own warm statements about Mr. Putin. “You somehow disconnect the administration’s activities from the president’s actions,” Mr. Pompeo told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “They’re one and the same.” And for the first time, Mr. Pompeo acknowledged that North Korea is continuing to produce nuclear fuel for its weapons program, even as the administration claims progress toward the goal of denuclearization. “Yes, they continue to produce fissile material,” he told the committee, using the term for nuclear material that can be used in a bomb.

"This year’s Venice Film Festival will include new movies by Paul Greengrass, Alfonso Cuarón and the Coen Brothers, the festival announced at a news conference on Thursday. The 75th edition of the event opens on Aug. 29 and runs through Sept. 8. Damien Chazelle’s “First Man” — his first feature since the Oscar-winning “La La Land” — will open the festival. It stars Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong, and tells the story of the astronaut’s race to become the first person to walk on the moon. Other highly anticipated films in the lineup include “The Sisters Brothers,” a comedy Western starring Joaquin Phoenix and Jake Gyllenhaal; Rick Alverson’s “The Mountain,” starring Jeff Goldblum as a doctor who performs lobotomies; and the British director Mike Leigh’s “Peterloo,” about a notorious massacre of political protesters in 19th-century England. Those films are among 20 that will compete for the Golden Lion prize for best film. They will appear alongside television series, documentaries and a host of other movies that are not competing for that main prize. "
"WASHINGTON — Just before Election Day, when The Wall Street Journal uncovered a secret deal by The National Enquirer to buy the silence of a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Donald J. Trump, his campaign issued a flat denial. “We have no knowledge of any of this,” Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the newspaper. She said the claim of an affair was “totally untrue.” Then last week, when The New York Times revealed the existence of a recorded conversation about the very payment Mr. Trump denied knowing about, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, described the recording as “exculpatory” — suggesting it would actually help Mr. Trump if it became public. Finally, the tape has become public. And it revealed the statements by Ms. Hicks and Mr. Giuliani to be false. The recording, which was broadcast by CNN late Tuesday night, shows Mr. Trump was directly involved in talks about whether to pay The Enquirer for the rights to the woman’s story. The recording, and the repeated statements it contradicts, is a stark example of how Mr. Trump and his aides have used falsehoods as a shield against tough questions and unflattering coverage. Building upon his repeated cry of “fake news,” he told supporters this week not to believe the news. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening,” the president added. "
"WASHINGTON — Melania Trump has freedom over her own remote control. Though the standard operating procedure on Air Force One now requires televisions on board to be tuned to Fox, the president’s preferred channel, Mrs. Trump ultimately has freedom over what she watches, the East Wing said Wednesday. The statement was delivered in response to a report in The New York Times describing the president’s displeasure over Mrs. Trump’s television being tuned to CNN on the first couple’s recent European trip. In a statement sent to CNN, the first lady’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said that it was “kind of silly” to ask what the first lady watches on TV, then added, in parenthesis, “any channel she wants.” The statement is consistent with one message the East Wing has tried to drive home on behalf of Mrs. Trump over the past year and a half. She has repeatedly directed her aides to declare that she operates independently of her husband. Examples abound. The separate events held on her trip through Europe with Mr. Trump earlier this month? “Mrs. Trump looks at her role independently,” Ms. Grisham said of activities that included visiting children and playing lawn bowls in London with the prime minister’s husband. The events the first lady held throughout the spring in her efforts to end bullying, despite being told to focus on something less controversial given her husband’s pugilistic tendencies? “Of course she knows there is going to be criticism, but she is an independent woman,” Ms. Grisham told reporters. The concern over the first lady’s health after a weeklong hospital stay and weeks out of the public eye? “Mrs. Trump has always been a strong and independent woman who puts her family, and certainly her health, above all else, and that won’t change over a rabid press corps,” Ms. Grisham said in June. And what about that jacket, inscribed with “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” that Mrs. Trump wore on the way to visit children held in detention centers near the United States border? “No one tells the first lady what to do,” Ms. Grisham said. “Our office has nothing to do with what clothing choices she makes and this situation was no different.” As far as the first lady’s channel-changing independence goes, Mrs. Trump and her office stay abreast of coverage of the White House, particularly anything about the East Wing. And she has said in the past that she prefers fictional TV dramas. She is a fan of the show “Empire,” and enjoys the Shonda Rhimes-created drama “How to Get Away With Murder.” She does not enjoy reality TV. On Wednesday, Ms. Grisham did not answer a question from The New York Times asking if Mrs. Trump agreed with her husband that his supporters should not believe what they hear in the news. "
"WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposed on Wednesday to curtail Obama administration loan forgiveness rules for students defrauded by for-profit colleges, requiring that student borrowers show they have fallen into hopeless financial straits or prove that their colleges knowingly deceived them. The DeVos proposal, set to go in force a year from now, would replace Obama-era policies that sought to ease access to loan forgiveness for students who were left saddled with debt after two for-profit college chains, Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, imploded in 2015 and 2016. The schools were found to have misled their students with false advertisements and misleading claims for years. Afterward, the Obama administration forgave hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans and began rewriting regulations to crack down on predatory institutions and bolster borrowers’ ability to seek debt relief from the federal government. But higher education institutions, including historically black colleges and universities and for-profit educators, maintained the new rules were far too broad and subjected them to frivolous claims that carried significant financial risks. In June 2017, just one month before the Obama rules were to take effect, Ms. DeVos announced that she would block and rewrite them. Now the Trump administration is proposing new rules that would require borrowers to prove that they have fallen into deep financial distress to file a claim for debt relief, or to prove that the higher education institutions they attended had intentionally misled them. The department would also require that relief applicants divulge personal information that could have impacted their job prospects beyond their college experiences, including drug test results, health concerns and performance evaluations. The proposal would establish a federal standard for what constitutes “misrepresentation” on the part of institutions, requiring that claims show “reckless disregard” through false or deceptive claims. It would also impose penalties on institutions that show signs of poor financial health, such as a high number of loan defaults or court judgments. "
"WASHINGTON — A lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by maintaining a financial interest in his company’s Washington hotel cleared a critical hurdle on Wednesday when a federal judge allowed the case to move forward. In the first judicial opinion to define how the meaning of the Constitution’s anticorruption clauses should apply to a president, Judge Peter J. Messitte of the United States District Court in Greenbelt, Md., said the framers’ language should be broadly construed as an effort to protect against influence-peddling by state and foreign governments. He ruled that the lawsuit should proceed to the evidence-gathering stage, which could clear the way for an examination of financial records that the president has consistently refused to disclose. The Justice Department is expected to forestall that by seeking an emergency stay and appealing the ruling. The two constitutional clauses at issue restrict a president’s ability to accept financial benefits or “emoluments” from domestic or foreign governments, other than his official salary. No federal judge before has ever interpreted what those bans mean for the president. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland, say that Mr. Trump is violating those bans by accepting profits from the Trump International Hotel, a five-star hotel just blocks from the White House that is frequented by foreign and state officials. The judge earlier ruled that the local jurisdictions had standing to sue because the Trump hotel arguably siphons off business from their convention centers or hotels. Mr. Trump has resisted efforts to force him to provide more details about his personal finances, and in particular has refused to release his tax returns. Questions about Mr. Trump’s possible business dealings in Russia or with Russians have come up in connection with the inquiry being conducted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. "
"For a business that concerns itself with fit and figure flattery, it has taken the fashion industry an unusually — some might say, unforgivably — long time to recognize the obvious fact that we are not all the same size. Worse, labels that did address those who are size 14 and over were relegated to a category all their own, as if they were not part of mainstream fashion. Now, however, a handful of pioneering companies are changing that pattern with inclusive sizing that covers both ends of the spectrum. Best of all, these labels don’t make a big show of it. They simply make cool clothes in a variety of sizes. Introduced in 2015, Universal Standard’s mission was simple: Make shopping as fun, and accessible, for a size 26 as it is for a size 6. The founders, Alexandra Waldman and Polina Veksler, thought that approach was sorely missing, even as the industry grapples with the fact that 67 percent of women in the United States wear a size 14 or above. “A lot of brands still think the solution to the problem is to launch a plus-size category,” Ms. Waldman said. “That is not the answer. We need to stop segregating women into two groups because the truth of the matter is that it’s not so much a size thing, but a style thing.” Ms. Waldman noted that the clothes being designed for women in double-digit sizes do not have the level of design or quality of smaller sizes. “It’s mostly a semi-disposable, hodgepodge of fast fashion,” she said. Universal Standard aims to bring the same attention to style, fit and fabric as any other contemporary label — an aspirational aesthetic that’s size accessible. It’s no wonder the label caught the attention of J. Crew, which collaborated on a summer capsule collection that’s as sophisticated as it is wearable. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Promises $12 Billion in Aid to Prop Up Farms” (front page, July 25): America’s hard-working agricultural producers deserve guaranteed access to markets, not government handouts. If President Trump believes  that his tariffs are the right move, he should be strong enough to persuade farmers of their wisdom or weather the political consequences, as opposed to buying them off with taxpayer money. Nic Arp
Iowa City To the Editor: Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, calls President Trump’s promise of $12 billion to America’s farmers “gold crutches,” a political payoff to limit the pain from Mr. Trump’s trade war.  A better analogy comes from your article on the taped conversation between the president and Michael Cohen about hush money for the Playboy model Karen McDougal (“Cohen Releases Tape of Trump, Adding to Feud,” front page, July 25). The president’s M.O. is consistent. In both cases, he turns to financial payments to try to get out of trouble and minimize personal damage. In Ms. McDougal’s case, we don’t know who fronted the hush money. In the case of the farmers, we do: It will come from you and me in order to buy a key Trump constituency’s silence, loyalty and votes. Richard Kazis

"Fewer than 50 pages into Beth Macy’s “Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company That Addicted America,” one of the many opioid users she talks to — this one a mother in Virginia — explains how her addiction started in the early 2000s, after routine gallbladder surgery. “The doctor didn’t force me to take them,” she said of OxyContin and Percocet, two powerful painkillers she was instructed to take concurrently. But her doctor, she assumed, was a “high-standard person, someone you’re supposed to trust and believe in.” If you want a glimpse into how the opioid crisis began, the woman’s words are a good place to start. She was aware of her own choice in the matter, but her physician instructed her to double up on highly addictive narcotics. An expert, someone supposed to know better, had betrayed her trust. Books like “Pain Killer,” by Barry Meier, a reporter for The New York Times, and “Dreamland,” by the journalist Sam Quinones, have covered the opioid crisis in detail, but they appeared before the 2016 election, when the places in the country most affected by the epidemic went for Trump. With “Dopesick,” her third book after “Factory Man” and “Truevine,” Macy has waded into a public health morass that has also become a political minefield. Commentators on the left have pointed out the gaping discrepancy between the sympathy extended to today’s opioid users, who are mainly white, and the brutal, racist handling of the war on crack. “Dopesick” touches on these political developments, but its emphasis lies elsewhere. Macy’s strengths as a reporter are on full display when she talks to people, gaining the trust of chastened users, grieving families, exhausted medical workers and even a convicted heroin dealer, whose scheduled two-hour interview with the author ended up stretching to more than six hours. Macy captures an Appalachian landscape in a state of emergency and in the grip of disillusionment, but there’s little here that’s new. Indeed, that’s part of her point — not enough has changed. Like Quinones and Meier, she traces the beginning of the current epidemic to 1996, when Purdue Pharma released OxyContin with the claim (preposterous in hindsight) that its new pills would be less addictive than other opioids on the market. Yes, OxyContin contained more medication than the others, but its time-release formula (the “contin” was pharma-speak for “continuous”) would frustrate an impatient addict looking for a quick high.

"Workers may finally be getting a bigger piece of the economic pie — at least in Europe. Just don’t ask why, or whether it will last. In the decade since the financial crisis, much of the global economy has recovered and is back on stable footing. Companies are reporting record profits, unemployment levels are plummeting and overall global growth is back on track. Wages in most developed countries, however, have barely budged. The economic puzzle has ramifications for global political as well as financial stability. Resentment among middle- and lower-class workers, and the feeling they were not getting a fair share of economic growth, helped elect Donald J. Trump and contributed to the rise of right-wing parties in parts of Europe. “This is one of the big economic questions of our time,” said Ángel Talavera, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London. Europe may offer an exception to that trend. Wages in the eurozone are rising again after years of stagnation, a welcome development not only for working people but also for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. The central bank has been pulling out all the stops to push inflation back toward a level considered healthy for growth. But wage increases are effectively a prerequisite for sustained inflation, and, until recently, the bank had been frustrated by the failure of eurozone citizens’ paychecks to rise along with strong economic growth.

"My fellow Americans: It is my honor today to announce the formation of a new political party, which I am calling “the Republican Party.” You can be forgiven for thinking, Wait, don’t we already have one of those? But please. Under Donald Trump, the Republican Party, at least as we once understood it, has become a fantastical entity, a creature not wholly unlike the Abominable Snowman, or the Chupacabra, or the mythical Squonk of central Pennsylvania, the imaginary creature that spends its days deep in the forest, weeping in despair at its own hideousness. “There is no Republican Party,” said John Boehner, a former Republican speaker of the House, back in April. “There’s a Trump Party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.” While the Republican Party naps, the thing that has arisen in its place bears an eerie resemblance to another party in American history, one that we thought was gone for good. But more about that in a moment. In the meantime, I’d like to present the platform of my new Republican Party. It consists of things formerly believed by, you know, the Republican Party. "
"Good morning on this stillrainy Wednesday. Among the ways to get around this city — rickshaw, subway, scooter, ferry — we now have one more option: dockless bikes. Over the last week or so, more than 300 free-standing bikes were rolled out in the Rockaways, and more are on their way this weekend. The bikes are part of the city’s dockless bike-share pilot — think Citi Bike without the parking spot — and they will be installed in the Bronx, southern Brooklyn and Staten Island in the coming months. Using the bikes is a breeze. We spent the day yesterday testing them out at the beach. When we stepped out of the Beach 90th Street subway station at Rockaway Beach, we found one of the bikes waiting for us. There appeared to be one on every nearby block — parked in front of bakeries, playgrounds and up and down the boardwalk. To ride, we downloaded separate apps from Pace and Lime (the two operators), signed up for accounts, flipped up kickstands and off we went. The bikes are much the same, but Pace bikes require that you lock them to a designated bike rack or pole, while Lime bikes must be left in designated zones. Both Pace and Lime’s bikes cost $1 every 30 minutes. If you want to try them out, we suggest this weekend when Lime will be adding 100 pedal-assist bikes to its fleet. (Legislation allowing them in the city goes into effect on Saturday.) The bikes make pedaling easier and allow riders to travel faster and farther with less energy. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump abruptly announced on Thursday that the United States would impose “large sanctions” on Turkey for detaining an American pastor accused of aiding a failed coup attempt there in 2016, escalating a bitter dispute among the two NATO allies. Mr. Trump’s declaration on Twitter appeared to be more of a muscular threat than an official statement of policy; the administration made no announcement of specific punitive measures against the Turkish government, and the White House declined to provide any details about the steps it was ready to take. It came one day after Andrew Brunson, 50, an evangelical pastor who has been imprisoned in Turkey for 21 months, was moved from jail to house arrest because of health concerns. Mr. Brunson is one of 20 Americans charged after the failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. His case has elevated tensions between the United States and Turkey even as Mr. Trump has sought warmer relations with Mr. Erdogan. On Thursday, Mr. Trump ratcheted up the pressure for Mr. Brunson’s immediate release, telling Mr. Erdogan in a private phone call that the pastor’s continued imprisonment was unacceptable, according to a White House official who described the conversation on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly. And the president vowed on Twitter to impose substantial sanctions on Turkey for Mr. Brunson’s detention. "
"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday gave the green light to a lawsuit seeking to block the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying plaintiffs had made a plausible case that the move was a deliberate attempt by the White House to discriminate against immigrants. The ruling, by United States District Judge Jesse M. Furman in Manhattan, set the stage for a trial this fall that is expected to delve into how and why the Trump administration decided in March to add a question to the next census about citizenship status. The plaintiffs, which include state and local governments and advocacy groups, claim that asking residents to verify their citizenship would “fatally undermine” the accuracy of the head count because both legal and undocumented immigrants would refuse to fill out the form. A reduced count in areas with large immigrant populations could reduce Democratic representation when new state and congressional districts are drawn in 2021, and skew the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and other spending. Judge Furman rejected a claim that Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who made the decision to add the question to the census form, lacked the authority to do so. But the judge said the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ross’s actions, including his shifting explanation of what he did and why, raised questions about his true intent. Mr. Ross originally said he acted at the request of the Justice Department, which he said needed better citizenship data to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But he later admitted — and Commerce Department documents confirmed — that he had discussed the citizenship question with administration officials from almost the beginning of his tenure in the department, and that he or his aides had asked the Justice Department to request that the question be added.

"It didn’t take long last week for President Trump to blast America’s latest economic foe, the European Union, for imposing a $5.1 billion antitrust fine on Google’s parent company. “I told you so!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Calling Google one of “our great companies,” he asserted that the European Union “has truly taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!” Let’s put aside the fact that Google controls more than 90 percent of the internet search market in most of the union’s member states, according to the European Commission (compared with just 63.5 percent of the market in the United States). That makes it hard to argue that the Europeans have somehow “taken advantage” of Google. But on the merits of the antitrust case, Mr. Trump has a point. It’s hard to find any antitrust expert, European or American, who has endorsed the logic or outcome of the ruling by the European Commission. The commission, which is the union’s executive arm and oversees its competition policy and antitrust law, found that Google had run afoul of those regulations in several respects. But the heart of the decision involved Google’s insistence that mobile phone manufacturers that use its Android operating system and want to preinstall the Google Play app store must also install a suite of Google apps, including the company’s search engine, its Chrome browser and its mapping, calendar and photo programs.

"WASHINGTON — Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a powerful hard-line conservative who has been embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal from his days as a college wrestling coach, announced on Thursday that he will run to succeed Paul D. Ryan as House speaker. Mr. Jordan’s bid is sure to roil the already shaky succession of power that Mr. Ryan set in motion when he announced that he would retire at the end of the year. Publicly, Republican leaders have backed the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California. Privately, some Republicans have said Mr. McCarthy would not be able to unite the fractious party, and the No. 3 Republican in the House, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, is waiting in the wings. Now comes the divisive figure of Mr. Jordan, who has the backing of the small but important House Freedom Caucus, which he founded, and outside conservative groups that have been pushing him to run. He has divided Republicans repeatedly with his aggressive tactics, most recently this week by filing articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. Mr. Ryan responded Thursday by saying he would not back the action, and the House left for its monthlong August recess without taking it up. “I don’t think we should be cavalier with this process or with this term,” the speaker told reporters. “I don’t think that this rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.” But in some sense, the political damage to Republicans was done. Looking for a foil ahead of the midterm elections, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, latched on, suggesting that conservatives had moved to impeach Mr. Rosenstein merely to divert attention from the former college wrestlers who have accused Mr. Jordan of knowing about sexual misconduct at Ohio State University and doing nothing.

"To the Editor: Re “Pompeo Defends President as Being Harsh With Russia” (news article, July 26): Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is no wallflower. He’s a West Point graduate, at the top of his class, and I remember his grilling then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her 11 hours of testimony on the Benghazi hearings when he was a representative. His questions were withering, but Mrs. Clinton held her own and then some. So I expected Mr. Pompeo to be a bulldog in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But I also expected a fierce pushback from the senators on that committee. These men and women are our elected representatives, and I expect them to react to stonewalling by breaking through that wall — although I do applaud Senator Bob Corker for his principled stand as committee chairman. Mr. Pompeo’s performance was pompous and sarcastic. He was incredibly disrespectful to duly elected officials, and he was among their ranks at one time! He referred to backing up a truck with documents to prove Donald Trump’s zeal in holding Russia accountable. The only truck I want backing up is a moving van to the White House door. Len DiSesa

"To the Editor: Re “The Truth About ‘Trump Country,’” by Sarah Smarsh (Op-Ed, July 20): People’s use of the convenient “Trump country” label to describe the states that voted for the president not only lacks nuance, but is also a subliminal tool of differentiation and condescension that only exacerbates the growing urban and rural divide that plagues America. This term is wielded to write off these places as just aberrations from what supposedly smart and sane politics would yield. It contributes to the sentiment on the left that these people in rural areas who voted for a perceived huckster and demagogue are a lost cause, that now that these people cast their lot with this man, it is beyond conceivable to engage with them, understand them and empathize with them. This notion is pervasive, but for Democrats to take back the Midwest and make inroads in the South, it must be expunged. Tyler Coady
Nashville To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh misses the mark in blaming the media for its alleged one-dimensional portrait of the working class. “Elites” are fully aware that people of color actually make up a good bit of the working class. That Trump supporters do not all rant about race or immigration does not absolve them of attaching themselves to a demagogue who does, to say nothing of the misogyny, disrespect for veterans and public servants, willful ignorance of world affairs and other disgraces. It is time to stop blaming “liberals” for the ascent of Donald Trump. His supporters (and enablers) got us into this mess and continue to abide his venality. As Ms. Smarsh acknowledges, not all Trump voters — even in the heartland — fit the working-class stereotype. Many of them are well educated, gainfully employed, Chardonnay-drinking professionals with summer homes and are set for life. In a word, elites. Helene Kopal
Katonah, N.Y. To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh notes a rise in populism, not just on America’s right wing, but the socialist left wing as well. As a psychologist I am privileged to hear people’s uncensored opinions about the world in the context of their lives. Almost everyone I speak to believes he or she is being victimized by “big business” or “big government,” depending on which cable news stations they watch. The problem is not with business or government itself, but how “big” institutions tend to objectify people. As these institutions continue to grow in influence, over Trump country and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez country, so will populism on both sides grow. John G. Cottone
Stony Brook, N.Y. To the Editor: Sarah Smarsh is caught in the very trap she accuses “the college-educated white liberals” of being in. She seems to assume that the white liberal elite is monolithic and thinks that working-class folks wield bats and belittle women. Her whole premise is off. The college-educated folks in this country are as varied across the board as those with just a high school degree. Her specious argument is unhelpful to the healthy discussion this country desperately needs to have about its future. Margaret A. Lambert

"MUMBAI, India — Last year, the Trump administration blocked a Chinese company from buying an Ohio-based aluminum maker, Aleris, citing concerns about national security. Will President Trump and his advisers feel differently about an Indian company purchasing Aleris instead? On Thursday, one of India’s biggest industrial conglomerates, the Aditya Birla Group, announced that its aluminum and copper subsidiary had struck a deal to buy Aleris for $2.6 billion, including the assumption of existing debt. The transaction would make the Birla subsidiary, called Hindalco, the second-largest aluminum producer in the world by volume, after China Hongqiao Group. Under federal rules, the deal requires approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a secretive panel of government officials that advises the president on whether to stop acquisitions of American companies by foreigners. In recent years, the panel, known as Cfius, has been particularly skeptical of Chinese companies seeking to buy American businesses in important industries like computer chips and financial services.

"To the Editor: In “A Case Against Marijuana,” by David Leonhardt (Opinion Today newsletter, July 20), we’re told that more marijuana research is needed. Here’s all the research you need: Marijuana use in America has been widespread for over 50 years. If there were any alarming social or health effects, we’d know by now. There’s no justification for America’s draconian marijuana laws.

"The Commerce Department recently asked for public comments on the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. When the deadline for submissions hit, more than 2,000 individuals, businesses and organizations had had their say. The vast majority were opposed to the tariffs. Following are edited excerpts from some of those comments. During the Great Recession of 2007-2009, Honda did not lay off any of its full-time permanent associates in the U.S., and we have continued to increase our employment numbers since then. If the concern is that imports are damaging the national economy, Section 232 [of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962] is not the right tool to address the problem. There is an arsenal of weapons in U.S. trade law that enable the government to address economic risk. Actions can be brought for dumping, countervailing duties, patent infringement and safeguard protections, to name a few. VWGoA [Volkswagen Group of America] does not see how continuing imports of automobiles and automotive parts at current levels could impair U.S. national security. This proposition — supported by no U.S. motor vehicle manufacturer — is implausible. VWGoA’s plant has created 12,400 full-time jobs in Tennessee and helped attract 17 supplier companies to the Chattanooga area. These supplier companies in turn have invested over $275 million in Tennessee and, in so doing, created an additional 1,100 jobs. VWGoA’s manufacturing operations likewise have increased local and state tax revenues by $53.5 million annually. "

Here’s what you need to know: • “We’re going to run Pakistan in a way it’s never been run before.” Imran Khan, a former cricket star and fierce critic of the U.S., addressed the nation after early election results showed his party decisively ahead, and put him on the cusp of becoming prime minister of the nuclear-armed nation. Mr. Khan vowed to fight corruption, improve relations with China and seek “mutually beneficial” ties with the U.S. He said he would create a just welfare state, as the Prophet Muhammad did centuries ago. Above, an election rally in Karachi this week. The extent of Pakistan’s poverty, he said, would keep him from ever living in the prime minister’s mansion. “I would be embarrassed,” he said. Friends and foes alike describe Mr. Khan as relentless, charming and highly unpredictable. Yet his links to the powerful Pakistani military have drawn concern: Rights groups said the army and intelligence officers pressured, threatened and blackmailed rival politicians. _____ "
"Frank Bruni, a Times Op-Ed columnist, hosted an online conversation with two prominent Democrats: Representative Tim Ryan, a congressman from Ohio; and Jane Harman, the director and president of the Wilson Center and a former congresswoman from California. They discussed the challenges and opportunities that the 2018 midterms pose for Democrats. Frank Bruni: The week began with a few polls that show that Democrats have an advantage of over 10 percentage points when voters are asked if they theoretically prefer to vote for a Democrat or a Republican in a House race. Is a blue wave on the way? Jane Harman: I’ve seen lots of waves crest a week before the election. Democrats need to have a strong, positive message. Bruni: And are you hearing such a message, or is the party still fumbling around for it? Harman: Democrats announced a strong economic message (“a better deal”) early in the year, but it hasn’t gotten much traction. Sadly, most of the rhetoric is focused on how bad the Republican leadership is in Congress and the enormous number of mixed messages by the administration. Bruni: Few congressional primary-race victors have received as much attention, and generated as much big-picture debate, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What does and what doesn’t she say about the Democratic Party right now and about its best course to win the House? Tim Ryan: As someone who at 29 years old took on two sitting Democratic members of Congress to get to Congress, I’m always inspired by the energy of the insurgent-type campaigns. We have many inspiring candidates, mostly women, running all over the country. To help end the corruption of the current political system. "
"Michael Lewis has spent his career excavating subjects that seem, at first glance, almost aggressively boring: esoteric areas like sabermetrics, heuristics, mortgage-backed securities and credit-default swaps, algorithmic trading based on high-frequency financial data, sovereign debt. No matter how arcane the material, he invariably finds some fascinating narrative thread to suck readers in. His latest work, about government bureaucracy, is no exception. “The Fifth Risk,” which W.W. Norton will publish in October, paints a dire picture of the chaos and mismanagement in the departments of Energy, Agriculture and Commerce during the transition from President Barack Obama to President Trump. Within these seemingly dull, benign bureaucratic systems, Mr. Lewis encountered devoted public servants struggling with understaffed and neglected agencies while confronting potentially catastrophic risks. In the Department of Energy, which oversees international nuclear risk, understaffing means there might not be enough inspectors to track down black market uranium. Proposed cuts within the Department of Agriculture could dilute critical anti-poverty programs like school lunches and food stamps. “I was shocked by the richness of the material,” Mr. Lewis said. “Buried in the middle of this is a civics lesson, for myself as much as anyone else.” The book began last year as a series of dispatches for Vanity Fair, where Mr. Lewis was a contributing writer for a decade. (He has since left the magazine and shifted his longform journalism to Audible, the audiobook producer and retailer). Mr. Lewis went to Washington to report on how different departments were adapting under the Trump administration. His dreary-sounding assignment was to study the material that had been prepared for political appointees coming in to head the departments under the new administration. (Agriculture employees, for example, had prepared a 13-volume overview of its programs that spanned 2,300 pages). He found it riveting. In another section, which will be released as an audio original by Audible next week, Mr. Lewis writes about the Department of Commerce, and efforts by AccuWeather chief executive Barry Myers, who has been nominated to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to privatize weather forecasting. [ Read more about how Mr. Lewis and other best-selling authors who are writing audio originals ] Although he’s covered political campaigns, writing about the inner workings of government was a first for Mr. Lewis, who is best known for narrative page-turners like “Moneyball” and “The Big Short.” He says he approached it the same way he’s infiltrated other seemingly impenetrable institutions. “It’s not that different from writing about Wall Street, these big, gray institutions that are suddenly interesting,” he said. “From a literary point of view, Trump has electrified the material by the threat of neglect and mismanagement on a scale that we haven’t seen before.” "

What she found instead were recommendations for drugstore supplements like ginseng and ... tofu. I was surprised, but I shouldn’t have been.

"When President Trump accused Twitter of “shadow banning” Republicans in a tweet on Thursday morning, it was the latest salvo in a long-running debate over whether social media platforms suppress conservative users because of their political views. The president’s tweet came a day after a widely circulated article published by Vice News said that Twitter was shadow banning “prominent Republicans.” But many in the tech world said the Vice story — which was shared by prominent conservatives on Twitter, including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy; James O’Keefe; and Donald Trump Jr.  — was based on a misunderstanding of the concept of shadow banning that could make an already tense debate more acrimonious. So, what is going on here? What is shadow banning? Was Twitter actually doing it? Why is the president involved? We’ve got you covered. When a person is shadow banned, their posts on a platform are rendered essentially invisible to everyone but themselves. Their experience using a site may not change — they feel like they are still posting normally — but other people cannot see the material they produce, said Monica Stephens, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studies social media. “Shadow banning is when you are algorithmically being kind of shut down, and that often has to do with, particularly, the content that you are posting,” Ms. Stephens said. “Maybe it doesn’t violate the terms of service, but they make it so other people can’t see that content.” "
"WASHINGTON — When he ran against Donald J.

Then came President Vladimir V.

Suddenly, in the mind of the junior senator from Kentucky, Mr. Trump has soared from lower than that speck of dirt to high enough for Mount Rushmore. “The hatred for the president is so intense that partisans would rather risk war than give diplomacy a chance,” Mr. Paul fumed on the Senate floor last week in a long defense of Mr. Trump’s Helsinki meeting. “This is crazy.” As the lonely Senate voice extolling Mr. Trump’s diplomatic acumen, Mr. Paul has become the commander in chief’s wingman. He has nabbed broad visibility for views once deemed fringe, and coveted White House access: “Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it!” the president tweeted. It was the senator’s idea to suspend the security clearances of Mr. Trump’s political enemies, an idea embraced at the lectern by the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — Growing up here in the 1970s, Kyungah Ham would occasionally find propaganda leaflets sent from North Korea via helium balloons. Like her classmates, Ms. Ham turned in the leaflets at school, where she was given a reward for doing a small part in South Korea’s simmering ideological war with its neighbor. In 2008, when Ms. Ham found another North Korean leaflet — this one under the gate of her parents’ home — it felt like an alien object, blown in from a different planet. By then, she was a multimedia artist who had come to distrust much of the history she’d been taught, and she knew that South Koreans were sending leaflets of their own over the border. That got her wondering: Could she communicate directly with people who, through a geopolitical tragedy now 65 years old, she is forbidden to contact? It was the birth of what might be the art world’s most extraordinary, ongoing collaboration. For a decade, Ms. Ham has been producing designs on her computer that are printed and smuggled into North Korea through intermediaries based in Russia or China. Then a group of anonymous artisans, whom she has never met or spoken to, are paid to convert them into embroideries, using exquisitely fine stitching. With bribes and subterfuge, the works are smuggled back out. Ultimately, they are shown and sold at galleries and exhibitions.

"In his first inaugural address in 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio invoked the names of legendary reformers, from Fiorello La Guardia to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and said that in their honor and spirit, he would “commit to a new progressive direction in New York.” The anticipation for many of Mr. de Blasio’s supporters was particularly keen because it built on the sense that his predecessor, Michael R.

"A powerful commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps escalated the invective duel with President Trump on Thursday, calling his threat against Iran’s president “cabaret-style rhetoric” in remarks that political analysts called worrisome. The commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who wields enormous influence in Iran, may emerge as its future leader and is considered a terrorist mastermind by the United States. He said that Mr. Trump should pick a fight directly with him and not Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. In a Twitter message on Sunday posted in all-capital letters, Mr. Trump warned Mr. Rouhani that he would suffer “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before” if he threatened the United States. Top aides to Mr. Rouhani dismissed Mr. Trump’s warning, apparently viewing it as an attempt by the American president to replicate his strategy of threats against another adversary, North Korea. But General Suleimani’s public challenge to Mr. Trump appeared to signal that the Iranian hierarchy felt obliged to send a more assertive reply. "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump called a truce with the European Union over trade, the general outlines of his plan sounded familiar. It echoed of earlier negotiations — the ones started under President Barack Obama and shelved by Mr. Trump last year. Mr. Trump, in many ways, is taking credit for solving a crisis of his own making. After taking office, he criticized the deals of his predecessor and cut off trade talks with the European Union. He raised the stakes by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, prompting retaliatory measures by the European Union. Then he stoked the tensions by calling Europe a “foe.” Now, Mr. Trump, in hashing out an agreement on Wednesday with president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, is declaring victory. He said the two sides would work to lower tariffs and other trade barriers. They would reduce bureaucratic roadblocks to industrial goods flowing across the Atlantic, while ending conflicting regulations for drugs and chemicals. The United States was pursuing much the same under Mr. Obama through a deal called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. And the collapse of the deal still smarts for large segments of American and European business who had fervently hoped to create a trans-Atlantic version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The European Union has repeatedly told the Trump administration that it would be happy to revive trade talks. “Most of the deal is stuff we were already on the verge of agreeing on in the T.T.I.P. negotiations, before that deal got deep-sixed after Trump’s election,” said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents exporters. “But at least the President is talking about more open trade instead of how great tariffs are.” Both European and American officials resisted comparisons to previous negotiations. But it was not immediately clear what would set the new talks apart from those carried out by the Obama administration, beyond their more limited scope. Unlike with the previous round of negotiations, European officials said that the agricultural sector would be excluded from a deal with the Trump administration. "
"We live in the age of extinction, a quiet catastrophe that surely ranks as one of the great ecological and moral crises of our time. The best tool for saving America’s imperiled animals and plants is the Endangered Species Act, first passed by Congress in 1973. But you wouldn’t know it from what’s been happening recently in the nation’s capital. Last week, the Trump administration proposed major changes to the law. Although some offered welcome clarifications and efficiencies, others would strike at the core of the law that now protects more than 2,000 threatened and endangered species, from the largest animal on the planet, the blue whale, to the Florida perforate cladonia, a two-inch lichen found only in the state. Among the most worrisome is a proposal that would allow cost considerations to influence whether a species qualifies for protection or should be left to its fate. Decisions are now based on the best available science, and references to economic impacts are prohibited. Introducing cost criteria would circumvent the science that keeps the listing process honest. The plan also would give the administration the discretion to  scale back protections for some species listed as threatened in future determinations. The administration’s proposal joins legislative efforts to retool the law. In examining them, we should ask two questions: Will these changes increase populations of endangered species, or at least slow their decline? And will they advance cooperation and reduce conflicts between the federal government and states, industries and landowners? Almost none of these recent proposals pass this test. Several weeks ago, Senator John Barrasso, a Republican of Wyoming, introduced perhaps the most comprehensive proposal in over a decade to retool the law. His bill promotes the longstanding desire of many, mostly Western, states to claim control over endangered species management. If it were to become law, the bill would hurt efforts to save many species. "

Women clamored for Chanel products (or inexpensive imitations of them) not just for their sleek looks, but because those products seemed to grant entry into the designer’s enviable world. By turning her initials into a logo — those famous interlocking C’s — Chanel crystallized her marketable identity into a recognizable badge of prestige. Chanel invented a business model that fashion companies still use, wherein success depends as much on a glamorous life narrative as on particular garments. Within this model, which I call “immersive dreamscapes,” customers buy not just products but also aspirational identities. By acquiring merchandise bearing logos or signatures, they label themselves with the desired identity. Not coincidentally, Chanel’s movement peaked in influence between the two world wars, precisely as fascism became a pan-European force. Like luxury-logo fashion, fascism enticed followers with an alluring narrative about an exclusive world  (the myth of the superior Aryans)  and a logo  (the swastika)  betokening membership in that world. Chanel traveled in fascist circles and invented her double-C insignia in 1921, just one year after the Nazis adopted the swastika, which they treated like a fashion label, stamping it on jewelry, clothing, even lingerie, in addition to military uniforms. To be clear, wearing Chanel does not make one a Nazi. But the joint rise of her brand and fascism came about because both tapped into and manipulated certain all-too-human, paradoxical yearnings, particularly resonant at the time: to belong to a select elite and to lose oneself in a crowd, to conform. Chanel was deeply in dialogue with her era’s politics; as is Ivanka Trump. We can trace the descent of “dreamscape” businesses from Chanel, to Ralph Lauren (Bronx-born Ralph Lifshitz, peddling a dream world of polo-playing WASP privilege), through Tory Burch, directly to Ms. Trump, whose brand, which she announced this week was shutting down, employs both her full signature and an initial insignia, although her logo feels rather unmemorable. (Her “IT” motif bears a curious resemblance to back-to-back C’s.) "
"Prepare to be excited about a blockbuster economic report on Friday morning — but not too excited. Preliminary data from the Commerce Department is expected to show that United States gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in April through June. Some economists think growth may have topped 5 percent — a figure reached only once in the eight years of the Obama administration as the economy recovered from the recession. While he said he didn’t know the actual number, President Trump didn’t wait to herald the rosy news. At an event in Iowa on Thursday, he said he was expecting a very strong result, noting predictions that ran to 5 percent or higher. “It could be very close,” he said. “Could even happen.” “We’ll take anything with a four in front,” he added. [Update: On Friday the government said that the economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate last quarter.] Even a number starting with a four, though, will almost certainly be misleading. Several one-time factors — including a surge in exports tied, at least in part, to Mr. Trump’s trade policies — probably combined to pump up growth in the second quarter. Those effects won’t last, and economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Pretty much no one outside the White House thinks a growth rate of 4 percent is sustainable in the long term. Still, recent data does suggest that the pace of growth has picked up this year. Some economists think full-year growth in gross domestic product could hit 3 percent in 2018 for the first time since 2005. “The bottom line is that the economy is doing better,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton.

"SAN FRANCISCO — The finger-pointing over the scuttled $44 billion transaction between the chip makers Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors has begun. Richard Clemmer, chief executive of NXP, had some harsh words on Thursday for officials in China over the deal’s collapse amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The acquisition was terminated after it failed to secure regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before a deadline set by the companies at midnight Eastern time on Wednesday. In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Clemmer said Chinese authorities gave no explanation for withholding approval for the transaction. He said that there were no government requirements or regulations that the deal did not meet, adding that Qualcomm and NXP had both agreed to undisclosed concessions to address antitrust concerns raised by Chinese authorities. “For the issues they raised, remedies were provided and they agreed on those remedies,” Mr. Clemmer said of Chinese officials. “There was no clear explanation of why they wouldn’t approve it.” Mr. Clemmer and NXP had tried for nearly two years to get the deal done. In 2016, Qualcomm and NXP had struck an agreement to combine. But the transaction could not be completed until it had obtained regulatory approval from nine jurisdictions. Eight of those, including the United States, had approved the deal; China had been the lone holdout. The situation was complicated by the Trump administration’s recent trade moves, including placing tariffs on numerous Chinese goods. Trade experts said Chinese authorities appeared to be withholding approval of the Qualcomm and NXP deal to gain negotiating leverage in retaliation. "
"A federal judge in Oregon issued a ruling this week in favor of transgender students, saying that forcing them to use restrooms that correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth would violate civil rights law. In a 56-page opinion released Tuesday, Judge Marco A. Hernández of Federal District Court in Portland said that transgender students should be allowed to use bathrooms that match the gender they identify with. The ruling upheld the policy of a school district in Dallas, Ore., that allowed a male transgender student to use the boys’ restrooms, showers and locker rooms. The judge dismissed claims by some students and parents saying that other male students experienced “embarrassment, humiliation, anxiety, intimidation, fear, apprehension and stress produced by using the restroom with students of the opposite sex.” Judge Hernández wrote in his opinion, “Forcing transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity would undoubtedly harm those students and prevent them from equally accessing educational opportunities and resources.” An evolving battle over transgender rights is taking place across the country, and it has been waged most prominently over access to school bathrooms. In 2016, North Carolina legislators ignited a nationwide controversy when they passed a law requiring people in publicly owned buildings to use the restroom that corresponded with the gender they were assigned at birth.

"As an economist who shares President Trump’s belief that we should be cutting taxes and shrinking government, I might be expected to be enthralled by his policies. But that is not the sentiment I and many other libertarians feel when it comes to his decision to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum and a host of other products made overseas, particularly in China. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said they had reached an agreement to step back from a trade war and to discuss ways to lower tariffs and other trade barriers, and possibly increase European imports of American soybeans. But the outcome of those talks is far from certain, and trade tensions between the United States and China remain very high. What is driving the president’s apparent eagerness to impose tariffs is a simple and wrongheaded idea that plays to a large part of his base: A trade war will spur job growth in America. He is trying to use tariffs to give a leg up to American industries against countries that manufacture the same products that we do — whether steel, aluminum or cars — but more efficiently. And who could be against that if it creates more jobs? In reality, however, creating jobs alone does not make for a strong economy. What we really want is to increase production. And to achieve that, we need to allocate labor as efficiently as possible. One way to do that is to ensure that if other countries can make certain goods more efficiently than we can, we trade with them for these items, rather than manufacture them ourselves. The result is cheaper goods, which is to our advantage. But tariffs do nothing to improve this efficient allocation of labor. They also do not increase or decrease employment. They just shift jobs around, and almost always in a manner that hurts the economy. As an illustration, assume Mr. Trump is the governor of New York. He is devoted to making the Empire State “great again.” Right now, both New Yorkers and Iowans raise pigs — but Iowa produces far more than New York. So Governor Trump sets up a protective tariff against the importation of Iowa-raised pork. Will this make New York great again? "
"On Feb. 12, 1946, Tech. Sgt. Isaac Woodard Jr. boarded a bus in Georgia to return home to his wife in South Carolina after completing service in New Guinea and the Philippines. During the ride, Woodard, who was black, asked the bus driver if he would have time to “take a piss” at the next stop. The driver, objecting to Woodard’s language, said, “Boy, go on back and sit down and keep quiet and don’t be talking out so loud.” Fresh from serving his country in wartime, the soldier shot back: “Goddamn it, talk to me like I’m talking to you. I’m a man just like you.” An hour later during a scheduled stop in Batesburg, S.C., the incensed bus driver called over local law-enforcement officers, telling them that the soldier’s foul mouth offended a white female passenger. The police confronted Woodard and dragged him out of sight of the other passengers to unleash a barrage of baton strikes and punches to the face that ruptured his eyeballs. Still in uniform, he was taken to jail and held overnight. The next morning, his eyesight now permanently gone, the police gave him a hot towel and some eye drops and left him at the nearest veterans’ hospital. Woodard survived war overseas only to be blinded by the war at home. Civil rights leaders met with President Harry Truman seven months later to encourage him to end lynch-mob violence against black Americans. After hearing stories of a black veteran and his wife who were executed in a hail of bullets in Georgia, another mutilated with a meat cleaver and blowtorch in Louisiana and the violent blinding of Woodard, Truman’s face fell pale. He rose from his chair and exclaimed: “My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that! We’ve got to do something!” The next day Truman informed his attorney general that policy was needed to prevent lynchings and, in December, Truman created the President’s Committee on Civil Rights to look into racial violence and civil rights. A year later, the committee published its report proposing a number of reforms, including the abolishment of poll taxes, anti-lynching legislation and exempting members of the armed forces from segregation within the military and in society at-large. Though anti-lynching legislation died in Congress and the poll tax was deemed a constitutional issue, Truman could act on the desegregation of the armed forces on his own. July 26 marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9981, Truman’s landmark directive to desegregate the United States military — and the signature achievement of his nascent civil rights program. He declared it was his administration’s policy that “there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.” Truman took this action despite significant resistance from defense leadership. Kenneth Royall, then secretary of the Army, argued that the Army shouldn’t be used as an “instrument of social evolution.” The Marine Corps commandant, Clifton Cates, complained that “the problem of segregation is not the responsibility of the Armed Forces but is a problem of the nation,” and that it was dangerous to use the military to change the nation’s racial politics. Overruling the Pentagon, Truman employed the military in a racial-desegregation social experiment in hopes of improving the American one. His use of executive powers signaled a commitment to a more inclusive version of the United States. Fast forward to today, and President Donald Trump is also using the military to practice his version of racial politics. The last several months have seen the Trump administration come under fire for its policies allowing the deportation of undocumented veterans under certain circumstances, undocumented family members of active-duty military personnel and the discharge of immigrants serving in the military hoping to earn citizenship. Trump has deployed the National Guard to the nation’s southern border in response to crossings by asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, proclaiming, “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military.” He has even proposed using the military’s budget to pay for the wall. And after facing significant backlash for his zero-tolerance immigration policy that separated migrant children from their parents, he signed an executive order to stop the practice and directed immigrant families be interned on military bases instead. Though some of these actions are not unique to Trump, they cannot be divorced from his rhetoric on immigrants of color throughout his campaign and presidency. The approaches by Truman and Trump are representative of a larger truth: If you want to know what a president believes, examine his use of the military. This is not just a question of national security and international relations; it’s reflected in domestic issues like race relations, gender equality and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Often to the chagrin of defense leaders, presidents have used the military to test-run preferred social policies because congressional approval isn’t required, making implementation easier. The decision to use the military to advocate for social policy never occurs in a vacuum and is rarely the result of personal politics alone. The military is an effective vehicle within the commander in chief’s direct authority that can help make the case to the country and demonstrate responsiveness to specific constituencies. "
"July 26 marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9981, President Harry Truman’s directive to desegregate the United States military. To commemorate the milestone, Theodore Johnson compares Truman’s strategic use of the military to make the country more inclusive to President Trump’s politics that equate immigrations with national security and has stoked racial tensions on a national scale. Both approaches demonstrate that the military is an effective vehicle for pushing broader social policies and influencing the mood of the United States. "
"The filmmaker Michael Moore’s movie “Fahrenheit 11/9,” about the presidency of Donald Trump, is scheduled to open in September. His nonfiction show, “Michael Moore TV Nation,” will have its premiere on TBS in October. But first there’s the 14th annual Traverse City Film Festival in Michigan, from July 31 to Aug. 5. Mr. Moore founded the festival and movies, and honorees have his imprint. For the 2016 festival, all of the selections from the United States were directed by women. (“I just wanted to make the statement that 2 to 4 percent of the films made by Hollywood are made by women,” he said. “That’s just wrong.”) In 2017, the festival showcased work by filmmakers from countries affected by the Trump administration’s travel ban. The documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple won a “Mid-Life Achievement” award in 2014; this year, Jane Fonda will receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. (Mr. Moore won an Academy Award for best documentary feature  in 2003 for “Bowling for Columbine.”) Many of the films are shown at the State Theater and the theater Bijou by the Bay, both renovated under Mr. Moore’s direction and run by the festival. Both show first-run features and the State offers 25-cent morning movies (classics like “The Band Wagon” and  “Anatomy of a Murder”). The popcorn recipe is Mr. Moore’s. He lives within walking distance of the theaters and seems to be everywhere during the festival (I was in the audience one summer for a late-night showing of “The Shining,” for which his introduction was both scholarly and hilarious.) Here, edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Moore. What inspired you to renovate the State movie theater and start a film festival in Traverse City? My family had vacationed up there every summer; we’d rent a cabin somewhere, and then we decided to build a cabin and live there full time. I had been there for about three years and was constantly going by this boarded-up movie theater. They had kept it climate-controlled, they had patched the roof. There was no leaking, there was no mold; it was in pretty decent shape for a 100-year old theater. I said this thing shouldn’t be closed, this should be open. "
"A heavily funded Democratic group will spend tens of millions of dollars to mobilize voters in the Republican-leaning states where control of the Senate is likely to be decided this November, stepping in to fill a void left by years of decay in Democratic infrastructure at the state and local level. Senate Majority PAC, the principal “super PAC” supporting Democratic efforts to capture the chamber, intends to steer at least $20 million into the voter-mobilization campaign ahead of the midterm elections, officials with the group confirmed. The program, which follows a similar — successful — Democratic effort in Alabama last year, underscores the degree to which outside groups that can take massive donations have supplanted the traditional role of political parties. The initiative by Senate Majority PAC — which will run through an affiliated nonprofit group, Majority Forward — will span more than a dozen states where Senate seats are at stake. But it is to focus on four states above all: Missouri and Indiana, where endangered Democrats are seeking re-election, and Arizona and Tennessee, where strong Democratic challengers are running for open seats currently held by Republicans. Those four races are among the country’s most competitive. And for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of them, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states. Republicans currently hold the Senate by a slim majority, with 51 seats, but Democrats are largely on defense this year because so many of their senators in red states are running for new terms. Paul Dunn, a strategist for Senate Majority PAC, said that in those four states, Democrats need both to drive up turnout among left-leaning voters and to make inroads in more conservative communities.

"About 700 teenage conservatives visited the nation’s capital this week for a four-day leadership conference organized by Turning Point USA, a group founded in 2012 to promote activism skills among high school and college students and help young conservatives network with leaders in the movement. Many of the biggest names in the Trump administration and conservative activist circles, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions (who echoed the crowd’s chants of “lock her up” during his speech to the conference on Tuesday), former White House spokesman Sean Spicer, Donald Trump Jr. and billionaire Mark Cuban, led sessions at the conference about battling liberal college bias, opposing big government, protecting the Second Amendment and promoting free markets. We sat down with a few attendees to hear what it’s like for them to be red in schools they say are overwhelmingly blue. The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity. Daniel Jakob, 15, is a high school student from Tenafly, N.J. Why are you here? The mainstream media makes it seem like the left is winning, but being here and seeing all these conservatives, it lets me know I’m not the only young conservative here. It’s nice to be with a group of people I can relate to while at the same time contributing to the cause to further endorse conservatism. What does “conservative” mean to you? I’m a conservative because I believe the government should be fair and that the Constitution shall not be infringed. Where I live in North New Jersey, to get a license for a gun is really difficult. Without a gun in your house, you’re vulnerable, and not just from terrorists or criminals but also from the government, because the whole point of the Constitution is to protect us from the government. Things like gun control that the left are trying to implement, that’s what they’re trying to take away, the right to protect ourselves. Are your classmates also conservative, or are you an outlier? A majority of kids in my high school are liberal. I do know a few conservative kids. All my teachers are very liberal. Whenever I’m in a class and I share my political opinion, I’m basically the bigot, that’s what I’m called. In my literature class we were reading “1984,” and my teacher compared “1984” to President Trump’s America, and when I refuted that, the class just shut me down. "
"Ken Kurson is a confidant of Rudolph W. Giuliani. He is a onetime speechwriter for Donald J. Trump. And he is a close friend of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, who appointed Mr. Kurson to run his weekly newspaper, The New York Observer. This spring, those relationships appeared to yield a prestigious offer from the Trump White House: a seat on the board of the National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal body that doles out millions of dollars a year in grants to cultural institutions. First, Mr. Kurson had to undergo a government background check. As part of that process, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned about allegations that he had harassed a New York doctor in 2015, according to Mount Sinai Hospital, where the doctor worked. In late spring, the F.B.I. interviewed Mount Sinai doctors and others about the alleged harassment, according to several people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss a delicate situation. The female doctor had become so worried that Mount Sinai arranged for someone to accompany her to and from the hospital for at least a few days, two of the people said. “In November 2015, Mount Sinai began an investigation into allegations of harassment made by two of our doctors against Ken Kurson,” the hospital said in a statement. “We also took measures to protect our staff and the alleged harassment ceased shortly thereafter. We are cooperating with the F.B.I. on their current background check of Mr. Kurson.” Mr. Kurson said in an interview last week that he withdrew from consideration for the government post around early June, citing the amount of paperwork involved in the vetting process.

"On a hazy day in early February, some of the most powerful men in India’s government gathered at Chhatrasal Stadium in New Delhi, an arena famous for its boisterous wrestling bouts. The men had come for a different kind of spectacle — a biographical film epic, whose initial episodes (out of 57 total) would be shown for the first time that evening. At the center of a makeshift stage, surrounded by smiling politicians and cabinet members, was the person whose life was being celebrated: a slender figure in saffron robes with a long, dark beard, his chest-length hair tied in a bun. He needed no introduction. This was Baba Ramdev, one of the most famous men in India. Ramdev took the microphone and introduced the phalanx of several hundred Hindu religious students, known as brahmacharis, sitting in neat rows on the field. Everyone repeat after me: “Bharat mata ki jai!” he shouted. The crowd raised their arms and pumped their fists as they chanted the words — “India my motherland is great” — that have become a defining slogan of the Hindu nationalist movement. One by one, the dignitaries rose to recount Ramdev’s extraordinary career: how he brought physical fitness to the Indian middle class with his mass yoga camps and television empire; how he built his medicine-and-consumer-goods company, Patanjali Ayurved, into a multibillion-dollar colossus. “Swamiji has changed the direction of the world, the thinking of the world,” one speaker shouted, referring to Ramdev with an affectionate honorific. “That is how great he is. Swamiji has changed India, which was going toward the West — its dress and food and culture — and has changed its direction to yoga!” At last silence fell, and the 50-foot screen flickered to life. For the next hour, India’s political elite watched in humble silence as Ramdev’s life unfolded, from his birth in a remote rural village to his early days as a lissome yogi (the remaining episodes had been condensed into trailer form). As a film, it was a shambolic melodrama that seemed to treat Ramdev almost as a divine messenger. But as an expression of the Indian public’s feelings, it wasn’t far off the mark. Ramdev has been compared to Billy Graham, the Southern Baptist firebrand who advised several American presidents and energized the Christian right. The parallel makes some sense: Ramdev has been a prominent voice on the Hindu right, and his tacit endorsement during the landmark 2014 campaign helped bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power. He appeared alongside Modi on several occasions, singing the leader’s praises and urging Indians to turn out for him. Ramdev has called Modi “a close friend,” and the prime minister publicly lauds Patanjali’s array of ayurvedic products — medicines, cosmetics and foodstuffs. Although Modi campaigned heavily on promises to reform India’s economy and fight corruption, there were frequent dog whistles to the Hindu nationalist base, some of them coordinated with Ramdev. A month before Modi’s landslide victory, a trust controlled by Ramdev released a video in which senior leaders of Modi’s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (B.J.P.), including the current ministers of foreign affairs, internal security, finance and transportation, appeared alongside him with a signed document setting out nine pledges. These included the protection of cows — animals held sacred in Hinduism — and a broad call for Hindu nationalist reforms of the government, the courts, cultural institutions and education. After Modi won, Ramdev claimed to have “prepared the ground for the big political changes that occurred.” "
"At the Rally to Restore Sanity in 2010, Jon Stewart delivered a funny political speech to a crowd of his fans on the mall in Washington, D.C. He praised reasonableness, compromise and the virtue of working together with our opponents. Insanity however proved resilient. Last month, he told an audience that it was an error to mistake cultural power for real power, adding: “I, being a part of that machine and mechanism, do feel oddly culpable.” For Mr. Stewart, who more than anyone elevated the political stature of the late-night talk show, to make such a concession is jarring. But it fits the mood right now, one defined not by the army of his television successors but by the Australian stand-up Hannah Gadsby. Her ferocious special “Nanette” tapped into a growing cultural anxiety about the limits of comedy. She skewered the nature of jokes, arguing that because they inevitably lead to incomplete stories, they evade difficult truths. [Hannah Gadsby on the toll of performing “Nanette.”] The media gravitated to her bracingly categorical argument. Slate announced that “Nanette” was evidence that comedy was “broken,” and a Vulture review concluded from her argument that jokes “can’t really challenge or change anything — and are therefore more conservative than progressive.” Such critiques are just as common in the conservative media. Reviewing Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, “Who Is America?,” a critic for The Federalist lamented, “Comedy is supposed to connect us as humans. Now it’s tearing us apart.” When did comedy become the worst medicine? It is a relatively new development. Until recently, comedy had been rapidly expanding, increasingly co-opting areas of our culture previously dominated by sober voices. One of the most memorable responses to the Sept. 11 attacks was David Letterman’s emotional on-air speech processing his grief, which set a precedent for talk-show hosts offering healing words after national tragedies. Corporations and business schools now regularly hire troupes like Second City to teach them how the principles of improv can help their bottom line. But the role of comedy has particularly moved into the political sphere. Before he left the series in 2015, Mr. Stewart’s “Daily Show” was a trusted news source for many young people, frequently earning him comparisons to Walter Cronkite, and political analysis with funny quips became part of the nightly ritual of comedy. When Sarah Silverman spoke alongside then-Senator Al Franken at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the fact that a onetime comedian and a current one were playing roles at the highest level of presidential politics didn’t even seem notable.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The U.S.-E.U. trade war halts, scientists discover water on Mars and a new exhibition showcases Gala Dalí’s life. Here’s the latest: • The U.S. trade war with the E.U. appears to be off, at least for now. At a surprise news conference, President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, above left, said they would work toward lowering tariffs and other trade barriers, temporarily defusing a battle that began with Mr. Trump’s tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports. Given Mr. Trump’s unpredictable negotiating style, it was not clear whether the agreement was a genuine truce or merely a lull in a conflict that could flare again. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s tariffs may be starting to hurt the Big 3 automakers in Detroit, all of whom revised their financial forecasts downward, sending their shares down sharply. _____ "
"KNOXVILLE, Iowa — Today President Trump is visiting Dubuque, Iowa, where every year at harvest time, millions of tons of grain come via rail and truck to be loaded onto barges on the Mississippi River and shipped to Mexico, China and much of the rest of the world. Harvest puts coin into the hands of farmers, and they and their communities — indeed all of America — profit. Not this year. The president is here to trumpet a $12 billion plan to aid American farmers. Why do they need aid? For Iowans, it’s because 33 percent of our economy is tied, directly or indirectly, to agriculture, and Mr. Trump recklessly opened trade wars that will hit “Trump country” — rural America — hardest and that have already brought an avalanche of losses. Indeed, the impact of his tariffs will probably be felt by family farms and the area for generations. So perhaps visiting Dubuque is the least he could do. The cost of being shut out of overseas markets for soybeans, beef, pork, chicken and more will be in the billions. Once those markets are gone, they will be difficult to recover. Commodity prices continue to drop, and good weather suggests an excellent crop is in the making, which will drive prices further down. Brazil is ready to step in with increased soybean production, and China has already shifted its purchasing power there. But the fallout will not just be tallied in statistics. In farm country, U.S.A., the Trump tariffs have poured gas on what has been a slow-burning conflagration. Rural America is about to undergo a major demographic shift. President Trump didn’t start it, but he has accelerated a crisis that might have taken a generation or two to play out. Now it might take only a few years. "
"Nov. 4, 2020 In the end, a bitterly fought election came down to the old political aphorism, popularized during Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 run against George H.W. Bush: “It’s the economy, stupid.” This time, however, it was the Republican incumbent, not his Democratic challenger, who benefited from that truism. Donald J. Trump has been decisively re-elected as president of the United States, winning every state he carried in 2016 and adding Nevada, even as he once again failed, albeit narrowly, to gain a majority of the popular vote. Extraordinary turnout in California, New York, Illinois and other Democratic bastions could not compensate for the president’s abiding popularity in the states that still decide who gets to live in the White House: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Yet, unlike 2016, last night’s outcome came neither as a political upset nor as a global shock. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have consistently polled ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and her running mate, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, since July. The New York Times correctly predicted the outcome of the race in every state, another marked change from 2016. In exit poll interviews, Mr. Trump’s supporters frequently cited the state of the economy to explain their vote. “What part of Dow 30,000 do the liberals not understand?” Kevin O’Reilly of Manchester, N.H., told The Times. Senators Warren and Brown never seemed to find a compelling answer to that question, despite an economy that continues to struggle with painfully slow wage growth, spiraling budget deficits and multiplying trade wars that have hurt businesses as diverse as Ohio soybean farmers and California chipmakers.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump welcomed “a new phase in the relationship between the United States and the European Union” on Wednesday, after reaching an agreement to hold off on imposing further tariffs and to work toward dropping existing ones on steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the Rose Garden with the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. (Not in attendance: A CNN reporter who was barred for what the White House deemed “inappropriate” questions.) The U.S. has already imposed billions of dollars in tariffs on European products for what the Trump administration has labeled unfair trade practices, raising costs for American companies and consumers. • Separately, the federal budget deficit is growing much faster than economists had predicted, in part because the amount of corporate taxes collected by the federal government has fallen after the tax overhaul.

"Corporate earnings are the strongest they have been in years. Headline numbers suggest the economy is doing pretty well under President Trump. The stock market, however, is starting to signal that the good times might not last for many. On the surface, stocks look to be performing well. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is up more than 6 percent this year, and it is close to getting back to the historic high it hit earlier this year. A deeper look, however, suggests there is increasing concern among stock investors. A small group of the largest technology companies has driven much of the recent rally. The stocks of other types of companies have not performed nearly as well, in part because of worries that Mr. Trump’s tariffs will harm corporate profits. The stock market is not a perfect predictor of the future, but the lackluster performance of a large part of it may portend a difficult period for many companies in which they pull back on their businesses and perhaps shed jobs in the process. The trade talks announced on Wednesday between the United States and the European Union could prevent an escalation of the fight between the two trading partners. Some investors have been betting that Mr. Trump’s bellicose stance was a bargaining tactic. Stocks jumped after news of the talks was reported. But a joint statement from the United States and the European Union merely laid out their intentions to talk and did not provide many details. Failure to make progress in negotiations with the European Union and continued tensions with China could dampen investors’ spirits. "
"Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. That in the face of this onslaught Republicans now control the White House, both branches of Congress, both legislative branches in 32 states and the Supreme Court is a testament to the continuing electoral liabilities of the Democratic Party and the vulnerable spots of the liberal agenda. Nearly half the country’s voters support a president who embraces upwardly redistributive policies that many of them do not benefit from. Why? Because on race, religion, abortion, LGBTQ rights and immigration, President Trump — unlike previous Republican presidents — has given his voters exactly what they want. This is patently true in the case of immigration. As The Washington Post reported in June, “The Trump administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants, slashed refugee programs, criminalized unauthorized border crossings” and secured a ban on travelers from six majority-Muslim nations. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. "
"Good Thursday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) The latest earnings report suggests its scandals are finally starting to hurt. Growth in users and advertising has slowed, and the company doesn’t expect its figures to improve quickly, especially as it spends more on privacy and security. Facebook’s stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading. That wiped $120 billion off the company’s market value — and $17 billion off Mark Zuckerberg’s. The earnings conference call was dramatic, too, Barron’s reports. Particularly when one of the analysts on the line — Ross Sandler of Barclays — translated a forecast of revenue growth declining “by high-single-digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially” into a drop to “around 20 percent by the fourth quarter of this year.” Daniel Ives of GBH Insights counsels calm: Shira Ovide at Bloomberg Opinion doesn’t agree: Nor does Dan Gallagher at Heard on the Street: Elsewhere in technology: Facebook faces more Senate questioning in September over foreign interference, the WSJ reports, alongside Google and Twitter. And the NYT’s Farhad Manjoo predicts a rough ride as these companies start to take greater responsibility for content. ____________________________ Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Amie Tsang and Prashant S. Rao in London. ____________________________ President Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said after a meeting yesterday that they would work toward lowering tariffs and other barriers. The Europeans also agreed to buy more American soybeans and natural gas. "
"When President Trump met with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, at the White House, the two said they were entering a new phase in their relationship. Crucial to that will be natural gas. Demand for natural gas — a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil — is rising worldwide, and the United States is a growing supplier of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G. The European Union, meanwhile, wants to diversify its energy supply, which remains somewhat dependent on Russia, with which it has a difficult relationship. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the 28-nation European Union would be “a massive buyer of L.N.G.,” before adding, “We have plenty of it.” Any such shift won’t happen overnight, though. In simple terms: Europe’s consumption of natural gas is increasing, and its domestic production is falling. Its imports have risen rapidly in recent years, and will most likely increase further in the future. “The question is: Where will these increased imports come from?” said Marco Alverà, chief executive of SNAM, an Italian natural gas infrastructure company. Many of the region’s power plants are switching from being fired by coal, which has high levels of carbon emissions, to running on gas, which is significantly better for the environment (though not entirely clean).

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Millions of people from across the world visit Yosemite National Park each year for an opportunity to take in the sweeping vistas at one of America’s most treasured natural preserves. But hundreds of visitors were ordered to evacuate the park Wednesday as firefighters struggled to contain the encroaching 38,000-acre Ferguson Fire, which has roared for nearly two weeks and remains just 25 percent contained. Dry conditions have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the flames. “The conditions are incredibly strenuous, and we’re seeing triple-digit temperatures in places,” said Dan McKeague, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. “Some sections are extremely remote. Access is limited because there aren’t a ton of existing roads.” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A., said that long-term drying caused by rising global temperatures has exacerbated the risk of wildfires in the western United States. “Over decades there has been a trend toward less moisture in the soil and forest, and that is affecting how dry the vegetation is becoming in summer,” he said. Mr. Swain said the drought several years ago and resulting bark beetle infestations in forests have combined with rising temperatures to create difficult conditions for containing wildfires. Scott Gediman, a park ranger and spokesman for the National Park Service, said the last major closing because of fire at Yosemite was in 1990 during the A-rock Fire. A flood in 1997 closed the park for about two and a half months, he said, and since then there have been partial closings every so often. "
"LAHORE, Pakistan — Imran Khan, a charismatic cricket star who has fiercely criticized American counterterrorism policy in a region plagued by extremism, appeared poised on Thursday to become Pakistan’s next prime minister. After preliminary results showed his party decisively ahead in an election that critics say was deeply marred, Mr. Khan addressed the nation on television, outlining what he would do as prime minister. He said he would fight corruption at the highest levels, improve relations with China, seek a “mutually beneficial” relationship with the United States and create a just welfare state along the lines of what the Prophet Muhammad did centuries ago. “We’re going to run Pakistan in a way it’s never been run before,” he said. He also said he would never live in the prime minister’s mansion. In a country of so many poor people, he said, “I would be embarrassed” to stay in such a house. For years, Mr. Khan had tried but failed to take the reins of this nuclear-armed Islamic republic, which has struggled with poverty, economic stagnation and instability and which is increasingly torn between its two biggest allies: China and the United States. But this time around, he found a powerful ally in Pakistan’s military. In recent months, army and intelligence officers pressured, threatened and blackmailed politicians from rival parties, human rights groups have said, steadily thinning out Mr. Khan’s competition. "
"BRUSSELS — When he arrived in the Oval Office for negotiations over their growing trade war, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, brought a small gift for President Trump, a renowned admirer of military commanders. It was a photograph of the cemetery in Luxembourg where Gen. George S. Patton is buried. Mr. Juncker, a wily, if often maligned, former prime minister of tiny Luxembourg, added an inscription, alluding to the shared sacrifice of Americans and Europeans during World War II. “Dear Donald,’’ it read. “Let us remember our common history.” Mr. Juncker left the Oval Office on Wednesday with a deal — or at least a truce — that for the moment has defused the Trump administration’s growing trade war with Brussels, while bringing relief across Europe, especially in Germany. Yet if Europe’s political and business leaders are cautiously optimistic that an economic crisis has been averted, they are also wary, given their history with Mr. Trump in the 18 months since he has taken office. Even as Mr. Trump cast the meeting on Wednesday as a great success, and offered gratitude to Mr. Juncker, the question is whether the deal represents a meaningful improvement in the severely strained trans-Atlantic alliance, or is simply another example of the unpredictable approach of a president who has spent months mocking and undermining European leaders — even describing the European bloc as a “foe.” “The question is, how much do you give in to a bully?” asked Maria Demertzis, the deputy director of Bruegel, an economic research institute in Brussels. “This could just be perfunctory, and if it just stops extra tariffs, that’s fine. But you can’t really depend on Trump. His understanding of global trade is bilateral balance, which is as good as arbitrary, given global supply chains. And it depends on what side of the bed he wakes up on tomorrow.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The first Michael Cohen-Donald Trump tape is a bit of a black box. It’s not clear exactly what either one is saying or what they mean. We now know that President Trump and his aides have repeatedly lied about the efforts to cover up an alleged affair he had with a former Playboy model. Almost everything else — including whether the tape creates new legal problems for Trump — is unknown at this point. For anyone trying to follow this story, I’d offer one overarching tip: You should put zero weight on the claims made by Trump and his team, including Rudy Giuliani. They have shown that they’re willing to lie whenever it suits their cause. Giuliani’s earlier description of the Cohen-Trump tape — from just six days ago — now appears laughably inaccurate. I am not saying that Trump and Giuliani are always lying. When the truth helps them, they speak it. But the mere fact that they make a claim shouldn’t alter anyone’s judgment about its likely veracity. Related, from The Washington Post: “The government has seized more than 100 recordings that Cohen made of his conversations with people discussing matters that could relate to Trump and his businesses and with Trump himself talking.” Georgia. The Cook Political Report yesterday upgraded the chances of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia. The Republican, Brian Kemp, is still favored, Jennifer Duffy of The Cook Political Report writes, but only modestly, because he’s an extreme candidate who may turn off swing voters. One statistic in Duffy’s piece captures why Kemp remains favored. Abrams generated enormous excitement in the primary. She’s an appealing candidate — the first female African-American gubernatorial nominee in any state — with an uplifting message. When I watched her victory speech on primary night, I thought I might be witnessing a new national star. And yet for all the excitement about Abrams, turnout in the Republican primary was still higher than in the Democratic primary. In fact, more Republicans voted in this week’s runoff — won by Kemp — than Democrats voted in the original primary. There are simply more Republican than Democratic voters in Georgia. Yes, Abrams can significantly improve her chances by turning out even more progressives — especially younger and nonwhite voters — in the general election. But she almost certainly needs to win over some traditional Republican voters too. The extreme nature of Kemp’s campaign should help. So should her populist message. It’s a fascinating race. “Wait a second, you might be thinking, Hillary Clinton lost Georgia by only 5 percentage points in 2016. And Georgia has been getting bluer. Is Abrams’s climb really that steep? Yes, it is,” Perry Bacon Jr. wrote for FiveThirtyEight earlier this year. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

"The former cricket great Imran Khan is on the verge of becoming prime minister of Pakistan. Innumerable jocks have turned into politicians around the world, starting from the high school quarterback who is elected class president. But the confluence of all-time great athlete and head of government represented by Khan is rare. If you don’t follow the sport, you might not know that Khan was not merely a garden-variety professional athlete, but was probably the greatest cricketer ever from Pakistan, a country where cricket is by far the dominant sport. He is also one of the sport’s best ever all-rounders, players who can both bat and bowl well. Now on the cusp of the top office in the land, he is looking for a rarely achieved double. Among those who have served in high office around the world are Lasse Viren (four track gold medals, Finland parliament), Sebastian Coe (two track gold medals, M.P., now Lord Coe), Vitali Klitschko (heavyweight champion, mayor of Kiev), Manny Pacquiao (multiple boxing championships, Philippines senate), Romário (World Cup Golden Ball, Brazil senator), and Ilie Nastase (tennis star, Romanian senate). But none of them were presidents or prime ministers. The closest to achieving what Khan is poised to achieve may be George Weah, a productive striker who was the winner of soccer’s highest award, the Ballon d’Or, in 1995, playing for A.C. Milan. Last year, he was elected president of Liberia. He and Khan sit at the top of the pile for now. At least until LeBron James, Usain Bolt or Roger Federer takes a shot at high office. In the United States, you could almost fill a Congress with former pro athletes who have served: Their numbers have included the A.F.L. quarterback Jack Kemp, who was also a vice-presidential nominee. He was joined as a legislator by the baseball Hall of Famer Jim Bunning; the basketball superstar Bill Bradley; the decathlete Bob Mathias; football stars Steve Largent, J.C. Watts, Jon Runyan and Heath Shuler; Tom McMillen of the N.B.A.; and the sprinter Ralph Metcalfe, among many others. "
"On Wednesday, a federal district court made history. Judge Peter J. Messitte of Maryland allowed a lawsuit to move forward against President Trump, alleging that he is violating the Constitution by continuing to do business with foreign and domestic governments. In doing so, he became the first federal judge ever to rule on the meaning of the word “emolument” in the Constitution. Coverage of the lawsuit, which was brought by two of us (with the third, Mr. Eisen, among the co-counsels), has sometimes cast doubt on the usefulness of the Emoluments Clauses, which we have argued forbid presidents from using their office to “profit, gain or advantage.” Critics have noted how rarely they have been deployed. That’s why Judge Messitte’s ruling is so important: It opens a path to enforcement of the ethics regime that the framers developed as a bulwark against corruption in the highest office in the land. The decision could not be more timely. As our suit makes clear, the head of the executive branch of our government is more embroiled in commercial activities, from his hotel near the White House to business deals half a world away, than any president in American history. The Foreign Emoluments Clause — specifically, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution — declares that “no Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” The Domestic Emoluments Clause — Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 — states that “The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.” By ruling that the word “emolument” in these clauses means “profit,” “gain” or “advantage” in essentially any form from a foreign or domestic government, Judge Messitte has correctly found a way to enforce the framers’ anti-corruption mechanism. The framers understood the potential corrosive influence of commercial profit in the executive and wrote the Constitution “against a background of profound concern” regarding “possible foreign influence upon the president (and, to be sure, upon other federal officials),” as Judge Messitte noted. They designed the Emoluments Clauses as a prophylactic measure to prevent actual corruption and the specter of corruption — where a foreign power (or a domestic government) buys favorable policy decisions by engaging with the head of the executive branch commercially, outside the normal avenues of state.

"GRANITE CITY, Ill. — President Trump came to a newly revived steel mill here on Thursday to take credit for jobs created by American tariffs against China and other steel exporters. But his triumphal message was muddied by the woes of Midwestern soybean farmers, who have been caught in the crossfire of Mr. Trump’s multifront trade war. “To see an old big monster plant like this reopening, that is a great honor,” he declared to a raucous crowd, clad in a mix of hard hats and “Make America Great Again” baseball caps. “The days of plundering American jobs and wealth — those days are over.” “I could be one of you,” the president added. “I’d be happy if I was, because you’re opening up plants all over the country.” Mr. Trump introduced his daughter Ivanka, who congratulated the workers at the plant, where the owner, United States Steel Corporation, has begun firing up the second of two blast furnaces after a long shutdown. Then, she thanked her father for “enabling it to happen.” At the Granite City Works on Thursday, Donald J. Trump was the only thing bigger than U.S. Steel. With his obligatory attacks on the news media, his leisurely digressions into his 2016 election victory, his professions of affection for strongmen like Kim Jong-un of North Korea, and the thumping classic-rock soundtrack, Mr. Trump could have been at one of his political rallies. Still, the president’s trip to the Midwest on Thursday, which included a stop in Iowa, also cast a light on farmers, whose soybean exports dried up after China struck back over the tariffs. While praising President Xi Jinping as a friend and a “great guy,” he said China was punishing farmers so it could continue its longstanding practice of stealing technology from American companies.

"The federal government reported Thursday that it would meet a court-ordered deadline to reunite the last “eligible” migrant families separated at the Southwest border, but hundreds of children remained in federal custody as a result of a contentious immigration policy that has drawn international condemnation. Officials with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency reunited 1,442 of the last group of children with their families and said they expected to complete all “eligible” reunifications by midnight Thursday, Pacific time. “By the court deadline this evening, we are on track to reunite all eligible parents within ICE custody,” said Chris Meekins, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services. But in a day that saw government officials and community volunteers scrambling to bring families together, multiple reports of failed reunifications raised questions about whether the deadline had in fact been met. Further confusing the issue was a change in the way the government tallied its progress, with the latest report counting children rather than parents, a reversal from prior reports. “The data is dynamic,” a government official said of the discrepancy in a conference call with reporters. Even if Thursday’s deadline was met, the government’s work to address the effects of the family separation policy was far from over. The parents who were deemed eligible for reunification represent only about a third of all those who were separated from their children after crossing the border, a practice that began last summer and escalated in May.

"Delays in China that led Qualcomm to call off its acquisition of a rival microchip maker had nothing to do with escalating trade tensions with the United States, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Thursday. Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors first announced their $44 billion union nearly two years ago. Qualcomm is based in San Diego and NXP in the Netherlands, but both do significant business in China, which is why its antimonopoly authorities had say over whether the deal would go through. But as frictions between the United States and China intensified this year, Beijing’s prolonged antitrust review came to be seen as a form of leverage over the negotiations. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods this month, and Beijing immediately retaliated with levies of its own. Chinese regulators never formally rejected the deal, which had been approved by eight other jurisdictions, including the United States. But Beijing dragged its review out to more than 20 months. Speaking Thursday at a news conference after Qualcomm said it was expecting to walk away from the deal, Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, denied the link to trade, according to a transcript posted on the ministry’s website. Qualcomm and NXP formally announced the cancellation later on Thursday. “As of what I know, the case is about antimonopoly law enforcement,” Mr. Gao said, referring reporters to the State Administration for Market Regulation, which has official oversight of antitrust matters. The market regulator has not commented on the matter recently. "
