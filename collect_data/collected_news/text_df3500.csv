"“The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” PRESIDENT TRUMP, in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly. "
"The United Nations isn’t the venue one would expect for threatening war. Yet that’s what President Trump did in his first address to the General Assembly. Mr. Trump’s performance had echoes of President George W. Bush’s infamous “axis of evil” demonizing of Iran, North Korea and Iraq in 2002. This time, Iraq was spared, having disappeared from Mr. Trump’s enemies list. Iran came across as “reckless,” savage and not to be trusted despite an Obama-era agreement to halt Iran’s nuclear weapons program. North Korea was even more clearly in the president’s cross hairs. He warned that he would “totally destroy North Korea” to defend the United States and its allies, and he again disparaged North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man.” He said Mr. Kim was on a “suicide mission for himself and for his regime.” In all this fury, before a world body whose main purpose is the peaceful resolution of disputes, there was hardly a hint of compromise or interest in negotiations. It’s a telling contrast to President Barack Obama’s approach to many of the same problems in the same setting in 2009. Mr. Obama warned the General Assembly that “North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope” and must be “held accountable” if “they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability.” But he also said he respected “their rights as members of the community of nations” and was “committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations.” Like Mr. Obama, other presidents have used this setting to talk sternly to adversaries and exhort the world body to do more to confront international challenges. Mr. Trump’s dark tone and focus seemed a significant deviation, not least his relentlessly bellicose approach to North Korea. “No one,” he said, “has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.” Iran fared little better under Mr. Trump’s withering assessment. “It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime, one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room,” he said of the Shiite-led government in Tehran. He called the 2015 Iran nuclear deal “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into” and gave a clear signal that he means to back out of it, despite strong evidence that Iran is complying with the terms.

"In the midst of the general abnormality of Donald Trump’s presidency, the speedy and frictionless rehabilitation of Sean Spicer in recent days was curiously predictable. In the past week, the once-disgraced White House press secretary has made a sudden and jolly re-emergence: an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” a fellowship at Harvard and, at the Emmy Awards, a self-parody of his demonstrably false claim that Trump’s inaugural crowds were bigger than Barack Obama’s. “This will be the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period — both in person and around the world,” Spicer insisted in a perfect sendup of his most famous lie. Laughter ensued. Nicely played, Spicey: The first thing they teach in flack school is that self-deprecation is key to any image rehab. And so is the earnest concession of remorse, which Spicer dispatched a few hours later, after the after-parties (when asked by The Times this week if he regretted criticizing reporters who accurately reported the inaugural crowd size, he replied, “Of course I do, absolutely”), pivoting away from the defiance shtick he previously served up to Trump’s base (“I have no regrets,” Spicer told Sean Hannity after quitting his job in July). You could, of course, make yourself dizzy with the quadruple back flip of parody, self-parody, self-self-parody and meta-parody at work here. Is this an instance of the New Normal Trump merging with the Old Normal Swamp to form an even more breathtaking Mega-Swamp? Regardless, Spicer’s breezy rematriculation into polite society has had a scripted quality to it — as has the immediate backlash from the left, journalists and various unamused sectors of Twitter railing against the “normalizing” forces of Kimmel, Harvard and all those Spicey-swarming selfie-seekers at the Emmys. Nonetheless, Spicer’s trajectory is more nuanced than some of the more burlesque examples of Trump-derived celebrity (to wit: Anthony Scaramucci, who, Buzzfeed reported over the weekend, might be considering a run for president. Because of course the Mooch might run for president). Spicer held the White House’s so-called podium job — a high-pressure duty that carries a certain gravitas and profile, especially after President Bill Clinton’s spokesman Mike McCurry began allowing cameras into the daily White House briefings (a decision he later said he regretted). The explosion of cable-news coverage, and with it the advent of partisan celebrity and remaking of politics as entertainment, has pretty much guaranteed lucrative post-White House employment for podium alumni. There are talking-head slots, book contracts and paid speaking gigs — provided, that is, that the press secretaries stay on the job for a respectable period of time and don’t embarrass themselves too badly. That’s where Spicer has become a special case. Even when he held the job, speculation abounded about what might await him when he tried to “monetize his public service,” Swampese for cashing out. Would the same rules apply to someone who broke so many tacit rules? Would someone who did so many things deemed beyond the pale enjoy a seamless return to the pale? And would the same rich pastry tray of potential next acts be laid out for a guy who was caught in so many lies, who once asserted out of nowhere that Hitler never used chemical weapons, who was serially humiliated by his boss and subjected to an evisceration for the ages by Melissa McCarthy on “Saturday Night Live”? But Spicer, for all his professional sins, achieved something far more pertinent to the current environment: In the space of barely half a year, he became the most famous White House press secretary in history, hands down. After a while, the celebrity itself becomes the thing. Spicer’s embattled narrative became its own subplot in the greater Trump reality show. How long could he last? How much could he take? How low would he go? People tuned in to watch his briefings in record numbers. "
"WASHINGTON — Eleven governors, including five Republicans and a pivotal Alaskan independent, urged the Senate on Tuesday to reject a last-ditch push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. But Republican leaders pressed toward a showdown vote. And they choked off separate bipartisan efforts to shore up health insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act, hoping to give Republican senators no alternative but to vote for repeal. The latest repeal bill, drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, would undo much of the Affordable Care Act and send tens of billions of federal dollars to the states with vast discretion over how to spend the money. This is the choice for America, Mr. Graham said on Tuesday: “Socialism or federalism when it comes to your health care.” Yet some governors, the supposed beneficiaries of that federalism, were decidedly cool to the proposal. New Hampshire’s Republican governor, Chris Sununu, had criticized the proposal on Monday. But it was the opposition of Alaska’s governor, Bill Walker, that might prove most important. He increased pressure on Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, to cast what could be a deciding vote to kill the repeal effort, just as she voted against the last repeal bill in July. Republican leaders appeared determined to thwart any alternative ahead of a possible showdown vote next week. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, announced Tuesday that he and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, would not come forward with the “limited, bipartisan plan to stabilize 2018 premiums” in the individual health insurance market that they had been working toward.

"Jeffrey Mezger, the chief executive of KB Home, one of the country’s largest homebuilders, was captured on audio Saturday night yelling at his neighbor, the comedian Kathy Griffin, using a series of sexist and homophobic slurs. The string of crude comments prompted an immediate backlash against Mr. Mezger, whose company is the sixth-largest publicly traded homebuilder in the country, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Criticism quickly followed the publication of Mr. Mezger’s recorded rant on Tuesday. Suze Orman, the former CNBC host, expressed disgust at the idea of buying a property from KB Home. “You really want to buy a home from this man?” she wrote on Twitter. “Beyond Disgusting!” The episode was apparently the culmination of a series of disputes involving Mr. Mezger, Ms. Griffin and Ms. Griffin’s boyfriend, Randy Bick, who are neighbors in an exclusive gated community in the upscale Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles. The couple called the police on Saturday night to complain of noise coming from Mr. Mezger’s backyard, according to HuffPost, which published the recording. Mr. Mezger’s tirade, which was recorded by security cameras at Ms. Griffin’s home, began once officers arrived. "
"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, abandoning a key fiscal doctrine, agreed on Tuesday to move forward on a budget that would add to the federal deficit in order to pave the way for a $1.5 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years. The Republican lawmakers, under mounting pressure to score a legislative win on taxes, say a tax cut of this magnitude will stimulate economic growth enough to offset any deficit impact. Yet critics say a deficit-financed tax cut is at odds with longstanding Republican calls for fiscal discipline, including that tax cuts not add to the ballooning federal deficit. The federal debt topped $20 trillion earlier this month and is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who considers himself a strict deficit hawk, said he remains deeply concerned about enacting tax cuts that add to the deficit. But he suggested that Republicans may not solely rely on traditional estimates of a bill’s costs. Republicans have recently voiced concern that some estimates, including those from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office, undervalue the effect of economic growth. In announcing the agreement, Mr. Corker insisted that he was not casting away his concern about the debt. “My support will be contingent on a final package that generates significant economic growth and does not worsen, but hopefully improves our fiscal situation,” Mr. Corker said of the tax plan.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump made a bellicose debut speech at the U.N. General Assembly, threatening to “totally destroy” North Korea and referring to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man.” He called the Iran nuclear deal “an embarrassment,” promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East and said the U.S. was prepared to confront Venezuela’s authoritarian government. Here’s the video. Not in attendance this year: Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto leader, who has been widely condemned for her failure to speak up for the Rohingya people. _____ "
"For more than a decade, the Clinton Global Initiative was the star-studded marquee attraction during the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, a place where heads of state, celebrities, billionaire philanthropists and business people mingled, made deals and gave away millions, sometimes billions, of dollars. But after Bill and Hillary Clinton announced the end of their signature conference during last year’s presidential campaign, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and billionaire, has stepped unto the breach. On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg will host a reorganized and rebranded Bloomberg Global Business Forum at the Plaza Hotel, drawing a high-powered crowd and speakers from Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, to President Emmanuel Macron of France. In a symbolic passing of the guard, Mr. Clinton will be the first speaker on the day’s agenda almost exactly a year after he urged attendees “you have to keep this alive” in a farewell address at the last Clinton Global Initiative. “He doesn’t just happen to be the first speaker,” said Kevin Sheekey, one of Mr. Bloomberg’s top advisers and a key organizer of the event. “There is a bit of a handoff.” A generational baton-passing this is not. Mr. Clinton is 71. Mr. Bloomberg is 75. But the event will still represent a marked shift. The festivities around the Clinton Global Initiative, which ran from 2005 through 2016, were fueled by the star power of one past president and a potential future one. The Clintons raised millions to underwrite the event, sometimes stirring accusations of pay-to-play along the way. Mr. Bloomberg is paying for the forum himself through his philanthropy. "
"Joyce Matz, a publicist who tenaciously represented civic groups seeking to preserve New York City landmarks like St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church, Lever House and the Town Hall, and to fend off developers like Donald J. Trump, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92. The cause was a stroke, her daughter Suzanne said. Ms. Matz, whose passion for architecture began decades ago with a magazine article she read about the precarious condition of Venice, devoted herself to preservationist causes big and small. Less than two years ago, she was pushing her walker over jagged East Harlem sidewalks as she accompanied a reporter on a tour of Our Lady Queen of Angels Roman Catholic Church on East 113th Street, which the Archdiocese of New York had closed in 2007 and which she was still seeking to spare from demolition. Its fate remains uncertain. In the 1980s, Ms. Matz was chairwoman of the landmarks committee of Community Board 5, which encompasses much of Midtown Manhattan. But she exercised even more influence as a spokeswoman for coalitions, often led by others, to prevent the demolition of a favorite building that had historic value or provided affordable housing, and to wring an extra amenity for a neighborhood from property owners who sought approval for a proposed office building or residential development. “Witty and charming, plus an indefatigable fighter for neighborhoods, Joyce knew everyone,” Andrew Scott Dolkart, a professor of historic preservation at Columbia University, wrote in an email, “and used her knowledge and connections to fight for what she believed.” Jennifer Raab, a former chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and now the president of Hunter College, called Ms. Matz “a persistent watchdog with a laser focus on New York City’s architectural gems.” "
"The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience. Last week, our Theater section ran a review headlined “A Play With a Crude Name and a Powerfully Dark View.” The play, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, is a Critic’s Pick.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “If the righteous many don’t confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph.” In a bellicose speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, referred to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man,” denounced the Iran nuclear agreement and promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East. He thanked Russia and China for supporting recent U.N. sanctions on North Korea, but also indirectly criticized them, calling it “an outrage” that “some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world.” Here are the highlights of the opening day of speeches. Leaders from Japan and Myanmar speak today; South Korea, Russia, China and Indonesia tomorrow; Australia on Friday; and the Philippines and Singapore on Saturday. _____ "
"Last September, Patrik Hermansson, a 25-year-old graduate student from Sweden, went undercover in the world of the extreme right. Posing as a student writing a thesis about the suppression of right-wing speech, he traveled from London to New York to Charlottesville, Va. — and into the heart of a dangerous movement that is experiencing a profound rejuvenation. Mr. Hermansson, who was sent undercover by the British anti-racist watchdog group Hope Not Hate, spent months insinuating himself into the alt-right, using his Swedish nationality (many neo-Nazis are obsessed with Sweden because of its “Nordic” heritage) as a way in. It wasn’t always easy. “You want to punch them in the face,” he told me of the people he met undercover. “You want to scream and do whatever — leave. But you can’t do any of those things. You have to sit and smile.” What he learned while undercover is one part of a shocking, comprehensive new report from Hope Not Hate that sheds light on the strange landscape of the alt-right, the much discussed, little understood and largely anonymous far-right movement that exists mostly online and that has come to national attention in part because of its support for Donald Trump. As a result of the growing influence of the far-right social-media ecosystem, once-moribund hate groups in both the United States and Europe — groups that mostly existed long before “alt-right” entered the vernacular — are enjoying a striking uptick in recruitment. This latest wave of potential members is young — teenage and 20-something men (they’re mostly men) appear to be exhibiting interest in far-right ideas in numbers that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. These young men are being radicalized largely through the work of a popular group of new far-right internet personalities whose videos, blog posts and tweets have been consistently nudging the boundaries of acceptable conversation to the right — one of the explicit goals of racist extremists everywhere. And while “globalist” may be one of the alt-right’s favorite slurs, Hope Not Hate conclusively shows that the alt-right is itself now a global movement with regular interaction among far-right figures from Scotland to Sweden to Seattle.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to prop up the American economy after the 2008 financial crisis, is finally ready to take away the crutches. The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will gradually reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of United States Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, a move that would amount to a vote of confidence that the economy’s slow-but-steady growth is likely to continue. The Fed, concerned about the reaction in financial markets, has tried to eliminate any suspense by publishing a detailed schedule and promising to move very slowly. But just as the Fed’s bond purchases after the 2008 crisis were unprecedented, the retreat will again take the reserve banking system into uncharted territory. No one can be certain what will happen. “What the Fed is going to do this week will not surprise anyone,” said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities. “And the models predict a slow and smooth adjustment. But there is always a risk of more volatility.” Two large and related questions also remain unanswered. The Fed has not said how large it would like its balance sheet to be, so there is no finish line for the retreat. Also, there is a good chance the Fed’s current leadership will not complete the journey. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, ends a four-year term in early February, and President Trump has not announced whether he plans to nominate her for a second term. The Fed responded to the crisis that began a decade ago by cutting its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero, and by vacuuming up huge quantities of bonds. Both measures were designed to revive economic activity by reducing borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to car loans. "
"Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan, has been far from silent since being ousted from his job in March. He is writing a book, regularly muses on politics and legal matters to his 438,000 followers on Twitter, and just started a podcast. (First episode: “That Time President Trump Fired Me.”) Now the media-savvy former federal prosecutor is leaping into a new realm: cable news. CNN has signed Mr. Bharara as a senior legal analyst, meaning he will be a frequent presence on the network’s programming, the network said on Wednesday. The arrangement allows Mr. Bharara — already a fixture in political and media circles in New York — to expand his audience into millions of living rooms. And CNN will offer a national forum for Mr. Bharara’s at-times blistering critiques of the Trump administration on a network that — the president’s criticism of it notwithstanding — is regarded as less partisan than cable competitors like Fox News and MSNBC. Rumors that Mr. Bharara may be considering a political career have also persisted, and his decision to take a role at CNN is likely to reignite speculation about his plans. He is not the only Trump critic whom CNN is adding to its lineup: Walter M. Shaub Jr., who resigned as director of the Office of Government Ethics in July and has called the Trump administration’s approach to ethics “close to a laughingstock,” is also joining as a contributor, the network said. The appointments were first reported by Politico. Mr. Bharara is no stranger to television, and his appearances in recent months seemed intended to showcase his versatility on the air. In June, he sat with George Stephanopoulos to offer a sober assessment of the Trump administration for ABC’s Sunday morning show “This Week.” Later in the month, he appeared on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” for an extended segment with the show’s wisecracking correspondent Hasan Minhaj.

"Karen Leibowitz and Anthony Myint opened the Perennial in San Francisco last year with a clear mission in mind: Run an environmentally friendly restaurant with a minimal carbon footprint, and inspire other restaurateurs to do the same. As President Trump has questioned the existence of climate change, Ms. Leibowitz and Mr. Myint have emerged as activists, at the forefront of a growing movement of chefs who not only recognize and measure the impact of their industry on the planet, but also look for new ways to undo the damage. Mr. Myint and Ms. Leibowitz, who are married, have been immersed for the last few years in the research that directs every decision at the restaurant, like choosing the kitchen’s energy-efficient equipment and its raw ingredients, many of which are grown in ways that can regenerate the soil. Mr. Myint has filled in when needed as a line cook, but he will take over the kitchen at the end of September when the chef, Chris Kiyuna, leaves. Mr. Kiyuna said he plans to take a short break from the industry. Beginning on Oct. 1, Mr. Myint will share the role of chef with Michael Andreatta, who cooked at Commonwealth, a restaurant co-owned by Mr. Myint that donates a portion of its monthly revenue to local nonprofits. The Perennial will continue to promote sustainability through composting and using perennial grains and grass-fed beef. But the menu will change. "

"WASHINGTON — Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, spent tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars to fly on private jets to attend routine public events instead of taking cheaper commercial airliners because he has an “incredibly demanding schedule,” his spokeswoman said Wednesday. Mr. Price, a physician and former Republican congressman from Georgia, chartered five work-related flights last week alone. In all, the private flights cost the federal government as much as $60,000, according to a report by Politico, citing internal department documents. The secretary has advocated cost-cutting at his agency while acting as a top Trump administration surrogate for urging the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. His predecessors often traveled by commercial flights or on trains, at a fraction of the cost. Mr. Price’s travels included a flight to a Maine resort, for a health care conference, and a short day trip to the Philadelphia area that would typically cost under $500 by rail or commercial airliner. “With an incredibly demanding schedule full of 13-plus-hour days, every effort is being made to maximize Secretary Price’s ability to travel outside of Washington to meet with the American people,” the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, Charmaine Yoest, wrote in a statement emailed to reporters. “The travel department continues to check every possible source for travel needs, including commercial, but commercial travel is not always feasible,” she wrote. Mr. Price’s travel was reviewed by legal counsel and was approved to accommodate his tight schedule, she added. Democrats pointed out that previous secretaries flew on commercial airlines, even while dealing with grueling travel schedules, including to generate public support for passage of the Affordable Care Act under the Obama administration, or adoption of prescription drug benefits under former President George W. Bush. Several Democrats called for the Health and Human Services Department’s inspector general to investigate Mr. Price’s actions. In a letter on Wednesday to the inspector general, Daniel R. Levinson, five senior Democrats in the House and Senate noted that federal regulations generally allow travel on government aircraft — and chartered flights — only when it is “the most cost-effective mode” of transportation available. That was not the case with Mr. Price’s flights, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said separately. “There were regular, scheduled flights to these locations at the times he was traveling,” said Mr. Blumenthal, a former state attorney general. “His predecessors flew commercial, and he certainly seems no busier than they were, and certainly no more deserving of special treatment.” “I think these practices are potentially improper and perhaps illegal and should be investigated by the inspector general,” Mr. Blumenthal said.

"If, as a public official, your best solution to a complicated problem is to build a wall, the odds are pretty good you’ll eventually smack into one. A wall was the thousand-mile backdrop to Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. But as we’ve seen over the past few weeks, with the president declaring and then undeclaring his intention to end the DACA program, the realities of immigration reform are complicated. They correspond little to the anxieties of the public imagination. Realities seldom do. DACA protects roughly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children and have lived here continuously since June 15, 2007. Were they to be deported, many would go back to countries they have never really known as home. Ernesto and Raúl Flores, the identical-twin protagonists of Lauren Markham’s “The Far Away Brothers: Two Young Migrants and the Making of an American Life,” are not covered by DACA. They arrived in this country too late, in 2013. Technically, they did have a home to go back to, because their parents still lived in El Salvador. But danger had driven the boys away. Their town, like all of El Salvador, was bursting with gangs. They were so desperate to escape that they made the journey to the United States on their own. (Markham has changed their names to protect them.) “In the Northern Triangle — Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — a ‘better life,’ for many, means a life where they are not afraid of being killed,” Markham explains. In 2013, 93 percent of unaccompanied minors in the United States — or “unaccompanied alien children,” in the chilly parlance of the law — came from those three countries. “The Far Away Brothers” is impeccably timed, intimately reported and beautifully expressed. Markham brings people and places to rumbling life; she has that rare ability to recreate elusive, subjective experiences — whether they’re scenes she never witnessed or her characters’ interior psychological states — without taking undue liberties. In many ways, her book is reminiscent of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc’s “Random Family.” It’s about teenagers who raise themselves. They pine for support. They’re traumatized in ways they can barely articulate. "
"UNITED NATIONS — President Trump’s bombastic attacks on Iran over the nuclear deal may have created an unanticipated outcome: sympathy for the Iranian government. Disarmament advocates and other critics of Mr. Trump’s approach to Iran say that while his threats to renounce the accord may sit well with conservative allies, they also risk damaging the credibility of the United States. Some say the contrast between Mr. Trump’s belligerent-sounding General Assembly speech on Tuesday, and the more measured address by President Hassan Rouhani of Iran on Wednesday, had helped give Iran an unexpected edge: the image of reasonableness in the face of an adversary’s angry ranting. “The bombast makes Trump look like a predator, circling,” said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington who has followed the ups and downs of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement. “That creates sympathy for Iran among the international community,” Mr. Kupchan said. “It’s especially dangerous because Iran is very skilled at playing the victim, aggrieved by foreign powers for decades.” Mr. Trump, he said, “is playing against a pro here in dealing with it.” The International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear-monitoring arm of the United Nations, has repeatedly found Iran in compliance with the agreement, which eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for its verifiable guarantees of peaceful nuclear work.

"WASHINGTON — Nearly all of President Trump’s top national security officials have been the target of his ire, whether it was privately dressing down his attorney general, publicly disagreeing with his top diplomat or musing about exiling his national security adviser to Afghanistan. But not Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Eight months into the job, Mr. Mattis has exhibited a political deftness that has eluded other members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet. None has managed to steer a path so different from the president’s without incurring his wrath and while deflecting attention over apparent or genuine splits. Where Mr. Trump threatened in a bombastic United Nations speech on Tuesday to “destroy” North Korea, Mr. Mattis emphasized that the issue should be resolved “through diplomatic means.” On Mr. Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military, Mr. Mattis has said little publicly but put the question on ice by announcing a monthslong study of it. And one day after his boss brandished the word “sovereignty” in that United Nations address, Mr. Mattis spoke repeatedly of the need for the United States to consult its partners. “Nations with allies thrive, and those without allies decline — it’s that simple,” Mr. Mattis told airmen assembled before him at a conference outside Washington on Wednesday. “We must be willing to do more than to listen to our allies. We must be willing to be persuaded by them.” He added, pointedly, “Not all the good ideas come from the nation with the most aircraft carriers.” All of this has earned him not so much as a stray tweet from the president.

"Before the Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn pledged to spend $10 billion and create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin, the company made a similar promise in Brazil. At a news conference in Brazil, Foxconn officials unveiled plans to invest billions of dollars and build one of the world’s biggest manufacturing hubs in the state of São Paulo. The government had high expectations that the project would yield 100,000 jobs. Six years later, Brazil is still waiting for most of those jobs to materialize. “The area where Foxconn said it would build a plant is totally abandoned,” said Guilherme Gazzola, the mayor of Itu, one of the cities that hoped to benefit from the project. “They haven’t even expressed an interest in meeting us.” Foxconn’s experience in Brazil and other parts of the world illustrates how difficult it has been for it to replicate its enormously successful Chinese manufacturing model elsewhere. In China, Foxconn has built vast factories backed by large government subsidies. Its operations — assembling iPhones for Apple, Kindles for Amazon and PlayStations for Sony — employ legions of young assembly-line workers who often toil 60 hours a week for about $2.50 an hour. Labor protests in China are rare, or quashed swiftly. "
"Pakistan’s new leader, stung by President Trump’s threat to crack down on his country for harboring terrorists, insisted on Wednesday that Pakistani military forces had uprooted all the sanctuaries used by Islamic extremists along its rugged frontier with Afghanistan. “We have regained control of the area,” the prime minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, said in an interview with The New York Times. “There are no sanctuaries anymore. There are none at all. I can categorically state that.” The prime minister’s blanket denial of Pakistan’s role as a safe haven could augur a turbulent period in its relations with the United States. The success of Mr. Trump’s new strategy for Afghanistan depends on Pakistan playing a more constructive role by depriving militants of the ability to plot and carry out attacks from across the Pakistani border. “This is a new context,” said President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, in a separate interview with The Times. “It provides a new context for Pakistan to seize the opportunity for engagement.” If the Pakistanis did not do more, he said, “there will be consequences.” But Mr. Abbasi’s claim, during his first visit to the United Nations General Assembly, suggested a familiar chasm between how Pakistani and American officials view Pakistan’s responsibility for destabilizing Afghanistan. He also denied that Pakistan possesses tactical nuclear weapons — a statement that runs counter to American intelligence assessments. In the closing days of the Obama administration, the United States negotiated with Mr. Abbasi’s predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, to try to persuade Pakistan not to deploy these weapons, which American officials said are designed for use on the battlefield against an invading Indian army, and were therefore more at risk of falling into the wrong hands.

"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Read the latest with Thursday’s live updates on Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria, the most powerful storm to make a direct hit on Puerto Rico in almost a century, ravaged the island on Wednesday, knocking out all electricity, deluging towns with flashfloods and mudslides and compounding the already considerable pain of residents here. Less than two weeks ago, Hurricane Irma dealt the island a glancing blow, killing at least three people and leaving nearly 70 percent of households without power. This storm, which made landfall at 6 a.m. as a Category 4 hurricane, took out the island’s entire power grid, and only added to the woes of a commonwealth that has been groaning under the weight of an extended debt and bankruptcy crisis. Beyond the immediate damage from winds up to 155 miles per hour, continuous rain flooded coastal communities as well as neighborhoods in the central, mountainous areas of the island, which is full of rivers and streams. One person was reported dead, though the power failure has largely cut off communication with some of the worst-hit areas. Residents woke Wednesday to the clamor of strengthening wind gusts, with the memory of Hurricane Irma still fresh. By afternoon, the whole island had lost electricity. “There has been nothing like this,” said Ramón Lopez, a military veteran who was holding back tears outside his neighborhood in Guaynabo, on the northern coast near San Juan, the capital. “It was the fury. It didn’t stop.” "
"WASHINGTON — The health insurance industry, after cautiously watching Republican health care efforts for months, came out forcefully on Wednesday against the Senate’s latest bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, suggesting that its state-by-state block grants could create health care chaos in the short term and a Balkanized, uncertain insurance market. In the face of the industry opposition, Senate Republican leaders nevertheless said they would push for a showdown vote next week on the legislation, drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. That puts Republican senators in a squeeze, especially those whose states would lose money under a complicated formula in the bill. Generally, it would shift federal funds away from states that have been successful in expanding coverage to states where Republican leaders refused to expand Medicaid or encourage enrollment. Republican senators from Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Ohio and West Virginia will all have to decide whether to heed the pleas of consumers who like the current health law — or yield to the will of Republican leaders, donors and voters who demand an end to the Affordable Care Act. That has put the spotlight not only on the three Republicans who killed the repeal drive in July — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine — but also on those who have been reluctantly supportive, such as Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Rob Portman of Ohio. Senate Republicans are already under pressure from 11 governors — including five fellow Republicans and a pivotal Alaskan independent — who this week urged the Senate to reject the last-ditch repeal effort.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump made a bellicose debut speech at the United Nations, threatening to “totally destroy” North Korea and referring to its dictator, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man.” He called the Iran nuclear deal “an embarrassment,” promised to “crush the loser terrorists” in the Middle East and said the U.S. was prepared to confront Venezuela’s authoritarian government. (Here’s the video.) Our White House correspondent noted a dissonance between Mr. Trump’s vision of renewed sovereignty of the nation state and his threats to act aggressively against some countries. _____ "

"President Trump is seeking to revisit the nuclear agreement with Iran to toughen its provisions rather than scrap it right away as he has threatened, enlisting allies to pressure Tehran to return to the negotiating table, administration officials said Wednesday. Mr. Trump, who denounced the agreement in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly this week as an “embarrassment to the United States,” wants to expand on it by extending its time frame and imposing new limits on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles. Although European officials strongly back the current deal, some signaled openness to negotiating a separate follow-up agreement. The maneuvering suggested a possible path forward for Mr. Trump short of abandoning the accord, but it remains uncertain whether he can reach consensus with the European allies, much less with Russia and China, the deal’s other patrons. Iran on Wednesday ruled out revisiting the agreement as President Hassan Rouhani declared it a “closed issue” and warned that if the United States pulled out, Iran might resume uranium enrichment. “We see today the Americans are seeking an excuse to break this agreement,” Mr. Rouhani said at a news conference after his own speech to the General Assembly. For that reason, he said, negotiating with “an American government that tramples on a legal agreement would be a waste of time.” The accord, reached in 2015, required Iran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Under United States law, Mr. Trump has until Oct. 15 to certify whether Iran is complying and the deal remains vital to America’s national security. While he has done so twice since taking office, he has signaled that he will refuse to do so again. That by itself would not abrogate the deal, but would give Congress 60 days to reimpose sanctions on Iran, an action that would mean an end to the agreement, at least for the United States. Mr. Trump may see decertification, or the threat of it, as leverage to press Iran and the other powers to restart talks. He could offer to certify for another 90 days if other parties agreed to explore new negotiations. "
"When Penny Mae Cormani died in Utah, her family sang Mormon hymns — “Be Still My Soul” — and lowered her small coffin into the earth. The latest victim of a drug epidemic that is now taking 60,000 lives a year, Penny was just 1. Increasingly, parents and the police are encountering toddlers and young children unconscious or dead after consuming an adult’s opioids. At the children’s hospital in Dayton, Ohio, accidental ingestions have more than doubled, to some 200 intoxications a year, with tiny bodies found laced by drugs like fentanyl. In Milwaukee, eight children have died of opioid poisoning since late 2015, all from legal substances like methadone and oxycodone. In Salt Lake City, one emergency doctor recently revived four overdosing toddlers in a night, a phenomenon she called both new and alarming. “It’s a cancer,” said Mauria Leydsman, Penny’s grandmother, of the nation’s opioid problem, “with tendrils that are going everywhere.” While these deaths represent a small fraction of the epidemic’s toll, they are an indication of how deeply the American addiction crisis has cut. And communities from Appalachia to the Rocky Mountains and beyond are feeling its effects at all ages. In August, in the latest sign of the direness of the situation, President Trump said he would declare the opioid crisis a national emergency, a move that could allow cities and states to access federal disaster relief funds.

"President Trump is now fully engaged in two nuclear confrontations, one with Iran over a nuclear accord he finds an “embarrassment” and the other with North Korea that is forcing the Pentagon to contemplate for the first time in decades what a resumption of the Korean War might look like. The dynamics of those cases are entirely different, but they are also oddly interdependent. If Mr. Trump makes good on his threat to pull out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, how will he then convince the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that America will honor the commitment to integrate North Korea into the world community if only it disarms — the demand Mr. Trump made from the podium of the United Nations. The fiercest defenders of the Iran deal argue that Mr. Trump’s team has not thought about how his threats to Tehran resonate 4,000 miles away in Pyongyang, especially since Iran has held up its end of the agreement. “If the president pulls back on the Iran deal, given Iranian compliance” with its terms, said Wendy R. Sherman, the chief negotiator of the accord, “it will make diplomacy on North Korea almost impossible because U.S. credibility will be shot.” Presumably, the United States would have to make some concessions to North Korea in return for limits on its nuclear program. But why negotiate with the United States if this president or the next one can just throw out any agreement? Mr. Trump’s aides see the problem and in an entirely different way. The lesson that the North Koreans would take away from the Iran deal, they say, is that the United States can be rolled. The Iran deal is not a permanent solution to the Iranian nuclear problem, they argue, but just a temporary fix. After 15 years, many of the limits on the production of nuclear material will be lifted, even if inspection requirements remain. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The San Francisco Bay Area is often trotted out as the worst example of the state’s housing crisis — understandably. By national standards, rents and home prices there are astronomical. But the pain in California is widespread. According to a new poll from U.C. Berkeley, a majority of residents in every major region of the state — including the Central Valley and other parts of Northern California — have considered moving as a result of housing pressures. “It’s spread across the state pretty evenly,” said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies Poll. The survey was based on interviews with 1,200 California voters in August and September. All told, roughly 56 percent of California respondents in the poll said rising housing costs had led them to consider moving. In the Central Valley, the figure was 52 percent, equivalent to the Bay Area. "
"BERLIN — Compared with Donald Trump’s victory, the Brexit vote or even Marine Le Pen’s presidential bid in France, the results of Germany’s Sept. 24 election will be reassuringly boring. Chancellor Angela Merkel looks poised to continue her 12-year tenure. In the latest polls, her center-right Christian Democratic Union party leads with some 36 percent of the vote — far ahead of its closest challenger, the Social Democrats. The biggest shock is likely to be when Alternative for Germany becomes the first ultranationalist party to enter Germany’s Parliament since the 1950s. This is troubling enough. Alternative for Germany is a party of racists, climate-change deniers and demagogues who believe that Germany should stop atoning for its Nazi past. Its politicians have used slogans like “Germany for the Germans”; one of the party’s posters says: “Burqas? We like bikinis!” With the party getting 8 percent to 12 percent support in polls, the German far right appears far more contained than its counterparts in neighboring Austria, Poland and France. However, to see the full threat of the far right in this election one must look beyond the poll numbers. Germany’s entire political landscape has shifted rightward. Since its founding in 2013, Alternative for Germany has managed to enter 13 of 16 state parliaments. Every major party has lost votes to it. In the state election of Baden-Württemberg in 2016, for example, Alternative for Germany took 190,000 votes from the Christian Democrats, while in Saxony-Anhalt 10 percent of its support came from the left-wing party Die Linke (the Left). Even as Germany has seen a sizable drop in voter turnout in recent decades, the far-right party has managed to mobilize a huge number of previous nonvoters. In an attempt to contain the party, the government and leading opposition parties have appealed to anti-immigrant sentiment, allowing Alternative for Germany’s ideology to insidiously shape German politics and media. This swing was on full display in a televised debate earlier this month when Ms. Merkel faced Martin Schultz, who leads the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, in a televised debate. More than a third of the discussion was dedicated to immigration — more specifically to the problems with it. "
"“You are a member of the K.K.K.,” the fifth-grade homework assignment read. “Why do you think your treatment of African-Americans is justified?” The work sheet, given on Thursday as part of a lesson on the Reconstruction period, caused an outcry after one student’s uncle, Tremain Cooper, posted a photo of the assignment on Facebook. “This is my little 10-year-old nephew’s homework assignment today,” he wrote. “He’s home crying right now.” Mr. Cooper identified the teacher as Kerri Roberts of Oak Pointe Elementary School in Irmo, S.C., a suburb of Columbia, and added, “How can she ask a 5th grader to justify the actions of the KKK???” Reached by phone, Ms. Roberts’s husband said she was unavailable and was “not going to comment on anything.” "
"SYDNEY, Australia — The first group of refugees from Australia’s offshore detention centers is expected to leave for the United States “in the coming weeks,” Australia’s prime minister announced Wednesday. In a video shared on social media, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull thanked President Trump for honoring a deal reached by the Obama administration, which Mr. Trump had criticized, in which the United States agreed to accept hundreds of refugees from the centers, one on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and one on Nauru, an island nation to the east. “Around 50 refugees from P.N.G. and Nauru will be accepted in this first group, and they’ll be notified in coming days,” Mr. Turnbull said on Wednesday. “Vetting and processing by the United States will continue, and further decisions by U.S. authorities in respect of others are expected in due course.” An official with the State Department confirmed that 54 approved refugees would be notified in the coming days and travel to the United States in the coming weeks. Little is known about the group, but the official said that the refugees were similar in makeup to other groups that country admits for resettlement. Asylum seekers who tried to reach Australia by boat were sent to the detention centers while their refugee claims were considered. Many have been waiting for years, often in harsh conditions. Australia has been harshly criticized for its offshore detention program, which has cost its government billions of dollars. The Australian government has committed to closing the Manus detention center by Oct. 31, after Papua New Guinea’s Supreme Court found it to be unlawful, but it has said that its Nauru center would remain open indefinitely. The United Nations has repeatedly condemned Australia’s detention program, labeling it “dire and untenable.” "
"SEOUL, South Korea — When President Moon Jae-in of South Korea sits down with President Trump and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in New York on Thursday, he will be meeting two of his strongest allies in pressuring North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. But Mr. Moon will also find himself a bit of the odd man out. As the three leaders prepared for their trilateral summit meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting this week, the White House has struck an increasingly bellicose tone toward North Korea. Mr. Trump, addressing the General Assembly on Tuesday, said the United States would “totally destroy North Korea” if necessary. On Wednesday, Mr. Abe defended the Trump administration’s approach, telling the General Assembly that for North Korea, “dialogue was the best means of deceiving us and buying time.” Like Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe, Mr. Moon strongly advocates imposing sanctions and pressure on North Korea. But unlike them, he has repeatedly and categorically ruled out military action. “President Moon appears isolated from the other two,” said Lee Won-deog, an expert on Korean-Japan relations at Kookmin University in Seoul. “There is a suspicion that Prime Minister Abe is using his close personal chemistry with President Trump to help shape the American leader’s views on South Korea.” During his presidential campaign, Mr. Moon promised to seek dialogue with North Korea, insisting that sanctions alone would not persuade it to give up its nuclear missile program.

"Updated, 9:27 a.m. Good morning on this watery Wednesday. Hurricane Jose weakened to a tropical storm this morning, but it could still bring rain during the morning commute and whip up strong winds during the day. New York City was spared a direct hit by Jose, but the storm flooded areas from New Jersey to Long Island. With more extreme weather events predicted for New York City and the surrounding area, flood insurance might be on your mind. We spoke to Emily Rogan, the chief operating officer for United Policyholders, an advocacy group that helps disaster survivors navigate the insurance claim process, about the basics of buying a flood insurance policy. Who needs flood insurance? Homeowners who live in high-risk areas with federally backed mortgages are required to buy flood insurance. For renters in high-risk areas, or if you know your apartment has flooded in the past, you should consider buying insurance, Ms. Rogan said. (One exception: Apartments below street level are almost never covered by flood insurance for renters.) For homeowners and renters who live outside the high-risk areas, it can be a low-cost expense. You can see if your home is in a flood zone and get an insurance estimate here. "

"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Read the latest with Thursday’s live updates on Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria battered Puerto Rico with a one-two punch of high winds and driving rain before beginning its deliberate march toward the Dominican Republic. Early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said the storm had regained “major hurricane status,” upgrading it to Category 3. The center said at 2 a.m. that Maria’s maximum sustained winds had risen to almost 115 miles per hour, and that the storm could get stronger still over the next day or so. It was expected to pass offshore of the Dominican Republic’s northeastern coast early Thursday, before moving near the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday night and Friday. Maria had weakened to Category 2 after taking “quite a hit” from the high mountains of Puerto Rico, where at least one death had been reported. Officials expected the strong winds and storm surge flooding in Puerto Rico to subside by early Thursday, and they canceled its hurricane warning. Heavy rain, however, was expected to continue. In the meantime, the countries already battered by Maria were scrambling on Wednesday to recover. And weather officials said “catastrophic” flash flooding was still occurring on Puerto Rico as of 8 p.m. Wednesday. Electricity was knocked out across all of the island, a spokeswoman for the Puerto Rico State Agency for Emergency and Disaster Management said, and officials said it could take months to fully restore power. The authorities warned weary residents not to let down their guard, because flash flooding and mudslides could prove more deadly than the initial winds from the storm. "

Four months ago, Senator Bill Cassidy went on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and expressed his commitment to a health care bill that would cover all infants, regardless of their ability to pay. Mr. Cassidy called this “the Jimmy Kimmel test.” Now he is leading the effort to pass a bill that does not seem to meet this standard. Mr. Kimmel spent a full seven minutes excoriating Mr. Cassidy, of Louisiana, accusing him of going back on his word. Mr. Kimmel ended by asking Mr. Cassidy to stop referring to the Jimmy Kimmel test, unless he addressed certain key points that Mr. Cassidy had emphasized in his own public statements: coverage for all, no discrimination against patients based on pre-existing conditions, lower premiums and a ban on lifetime coverage caps. Late-night hosts reacted to President Trump’s aggressive speech at the United Nations with a mix of bafflement and amusement. Trevor Noah pointed out the section of Mr. Trump’s speech in which he encouraged the governments of United Nations countries to look after their own interests before those of the rest of the world. “If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations,” Mr. Trump had said.

"President Trump had international affairs on his mind Tuesday morning. In his speech before the United Nations, he threatened to “totally destroy North Korea.” He lambasted the Iran nuclear deal. And he proclaimed that parts of the world “are going to hell.” But by late Tuesday night, Mr. Trump was focused on other things. He pulled out his iPhone to deliver a 139-character tweet for world consumption: “I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night — the worst ever,” Mr. Trump began. It was really only a matter of time before the president chimed in on the Emmy Awards. Politics dominated the event on Sunday night — both in the types of shows that won and the topic of the host Stephen Colbert’s opening monologue and the winners’ speeches. Mr. Trump has expressed his displeasure with Emmys in years past, calling them rigged and dishonest. And the first minutes of Sunday’s broadcast seemed almost designed to goad the president to respond. Mr. Colbert noted that Mr. Trump was once part of Hollywood. “And we all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump,” Mr. Colbert said in his monologue. “Because he was nominated multiple times for ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ but he never won. Why didn’t you give him an Emmy? I tell you this. If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn’t have run for president. So in a way this is all your fault.” Mr. Colbert added soon after: “What really matters to Donald Trump is ratings. You’ve got to have the big numbers. And I certainly hope we achieved that tonight.” And then in the first surprise of the night, Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, rolled onto the stage behind a lectern like the one immortalized by Melissa McCarthy in her portrayal of him on “Saturday Night Live.” “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” said Mr. Spicer, mocking his similar pronouncement in January about the crowd size at Mr. Trump’s presidential inauguration. It turned out that Mr. Spicer was wrong on both occasions. The Emmys on Sunday were watched by 11.4 million people, according to Nielsen data — about the same as last year, which was the lowest ever. Mr. Trump never won an Emmy for his reality television show, but he got close on Sunday. The actor Alec Baldwin won for his impersonation of the president on “Saturday Night Live.” “I suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,” Mr. Baldwin said. "
"To the Editor: Re “Heralding ‘America First’ in Combative U.N. Speech, Trump Airs List of Threats” (front page, Sept. 20): President Trump’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday was self-centered and dangerous for world peace. Under the cover of some beautiful oratory, it was an open attempt to drift the United Nations from the broader avenues of global values to the dark alleys of nationalism. It was heartbreaking to see that our president not only expressed his narrow views but also encouraged others to follow his path. He mentioned the sufferings of Americans caused by the recent hurricanes but did not bother to express any sympathy to the people of Mexico, India, Nepal and Bangladesh who have been facing death and destruction by nature on a much larger scale. There is a lesson for the proponents of “All Lives Matter” in this. He damaged the credibility of the United States government by threatening to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal. How will leaders of the world trust us if they think that every new president will break international agreements? President Trump failed to realize that he was on the global stage addressing the whole world and not appeasing his base in Arizona or Ohio. NASEEM KHAN, LELAND, N.C. To the Editor: Are we Americans suffering from battered nation or Stockholm syndrome? Have we become so inured to the boorish, bombastic blather (with apologies to William Safire), the outright lies and the utter foolishness emanating from President Trump that we shrug off his “crush the loser terrorists” and “Rocket Man” (North Korea’s leader) speech before the United Nations? Oh, that wasn’t too bad, we say, almost relieved; he’s been much worse. We’re like hostages looking for a glimmer of hope.

"Anthony D. Weiner, the disgraced former Democratic congressman, has asked not to serve any prison time for his conviction in a sexting case. But his request for probation was “simply inadequate,” federal prosecutors said on Wednesday, adding that “his crime deserves time in prison.” In a sentencing memo, the government asked a judge to give Mr. Weiner, 53, a prison term of 21 to 27 months in a case that enmeshed him in an F.B.I. investigation of Hillary Clinton last year before the presidential election. Mr. Weiner, who is to be sentenced on Monday, could receive up to 10 years in prison on one count of transferring obscene material to a minor, a 15-year-old girl with whom he exchanged lewd texts over several months in early 2016. In asking for leniency, Mr. Weiner’s lawyers argued that although his conduct was inexcusable, he had been remorseful and made “remarkable progress” in therapy over the past year. But the office of Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a memorandum to Judge Denise L. Cote that although Mr. Weiner’s “self-destructive path from United States congressman to felon is indisputably sad, his crime is serious and his demonstrated need for deterrence is real.” In Mr. Weiner’s plea agreement, prosecutors had said a sentence within the range of 21 to 27 months would be “fair and appropriate.” "
"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has asked the White House for documents about some of President Trump’s most scrutinized actions since taking office, including the firing of his national security adviser and F.B.I. director, according to White House officials. Mr. Mueller is also interested in an Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump had with Russian officials in which he said the dismissal of the F.B.I. director had relieved “great pressure” on him. The document requests provide the most details to date about the breadth of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, and show that several aspects of his inquiry are focused squarely on Mr. Trump’s behavior in the White House. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s office sent a document to the White House that detailed 13 areas in which investigators are seeking information. Since then, administration lawyers have been scouring White House emails and asking officials whether they have other documents or notes that may pertain to Mr. Mueller’s requests. One of the requests is about a meeting Mr. Trump had in May with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, was fired. That day, Mr. Trump met with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak, along with other Russian officials. The New York Times reported that in the meeting Mr. Trump had said that firing Mr. Comey relieved “great pressure” on him. "
"The latest Republican stab at overhauling the Affordable Care Act manages to be both more timid and more sweeping than previous efforts to replace Obamacare. Known as Graham-Cassidy, it was written by a quartet of Republican senators led by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. In the timid sense, the proposal would keep much more of Obamacare’s taxes and spending in place than previous Republican plans this year. Yet Graham-Cassidy makes more sweeping changes by turning money currently used on insurance subsidies and the Medicaid expansion into block grants to states. This change would give states more flexibility to design their own health care systems. The prospects for Graham-Cassidy remain in doubt, but the battle over whether states or the federal government should have more control over health care policy will remain no matter what happens in the coming weeks. There is a strong case for a system that takes a less Washington-centric approach to health care and turns more decisions over to the states. Commentators often bemoan how divided the nation is, pointing to our bitter elections and the toxic nature of political discourse. But the current level of partisan and regional polarization is a natural consequence of a political system that cedes so much power to the federal government. When distant lawmakers and unelected bureaucrats are in a position to make decisions that have enormous implications for the entire nation, the stakes of any decision become much higher. This is especially true when it comes to health care policy, which has the most personal and life-altering effects on individuals and their families. A more flexible system would give states latitude to pursue health care programs that are a better fit for their populations’ ideological sensibilities. And there are practical reasons to think of health care as a state-based issue: Every one has its own demographics, health challenges and other unique characteristics. For instance, median household income is much higher in New Hampshire than in Arkansas; heart disease and obesity are much bigger problems in Mississippi than in Colorado; the opioid epidemic is much worse in West Virginia than in Nebraska. Relatively sparsely populated areas struggle with the closings of rural hospitals, leaving large geographic areas underserved, while urban areas have a high concentration of large hospitals, many of which struggle with overcrowding.

"BEIJING — On the morning he disappeared, the activist Lee Ming-cheh crossed from Macau into mainland China to meet with democracy advocates. It was 177 days later when he reappeared in public, standing in the dock of a courtroom in central China last week, confessing to a conspiracy to subvert the Communist Party by circulating criticism on social media. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Lee’s detainment remain murky, but what has made the case stand out from the many that the Chinese government brings against its critics is that Mr. Lee is not a citizen of China, but rather of Taiwan, the self-governing island over which Beijing claims sovereignty. The proceedings against Mr. Lee, who is expected to be sentenced as soon as this week, punctuated what critics have warned are China’s brazen efforts to extend the reach of its security forces to stifle what it perceives as threats to its power emanating from overseas. In recent months alone, China has sought the extradition of ethnic Uighur students studying overseas in Egypt and carried out the cinematic seizure of a billionaire from a Hong Kong hotel in violation of an agreement that allows the former British colony to run its own affairs. The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, now appears to be a material witness in another politically tinged investigation against the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda. China abruptly surfaced charges of rape against yet another billionaire, Guo Wengui, after he sought political asylum in the United States, where he has been making sensational accusations about the Communist Party’s leadership. Mr. Guo’s case could become a major test for the Trump administration’s relations with Beijing at a time of tensions over North Korea and trade. "
"WASHINGTON — As President Trump’s voter integrity commission looks under rocks for possible voter malfeasance, its members might want to examine a presidential nominee awaiting confirmation by the Senate Finance Committee. Documents indicate that Jeffrey Gerrish, the president’s pick to be a deputy United States Trade Representative, moved from Virginia to Maryland last year, but opted in November to vote in the more competitive state of Virginia than his bright blue new home. The Senate Finance Committee, which has been considering Mr. Gerrish’s nomination, was briefed on the matter on Tuesday, including the fact that Mr. Gerrish had almost certainly voted illegally, according to three Democratic congressional aides familiar with the briefing. Public records back up that notion. Given Mr. Trump’s intense focus on alleged widespread voter fraud in last year’s election — the president has claimed that millions of people voted illegally, without evidence — Democrats are likely to pounce on the misstep to try to sink Mr. Gerrish’s nomination. Julia Lawless, a spokeswoman for the committee’s chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said she could not comment on Mr. Gerrish’s voting history, but that the committee would continue to examine his record. “Mr. Gerrish is continuing to undergo the same bipartisan vetting process that every nominee before the Senate Finance Committee does,” Ms. Lawless said. “Given that this process is still underway, we are unable to discuss specific details in his file.” "
"Just days before President Trump was scheduled to make his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly, the former secretary general, Kofi Annan, described the world as a “messy place” where people’s disaffection with their governments had influenced recent elections and would now lead to “divisions at the U.N.” In the recent past, he said, world leaders “worked with each other” and realized that cross-border cooperation was the only way to solve crises. “But today, we have lots of little men in high places, and they don’t always seem to understand the risks we are all in.” “All that we need is one miscalculation,” he cautioned, “and all bets are off.” Mr. Annan made his remarks during a question-and-answer session at the Presidential Palace in Athens. The session was part of the Athens Democracy Forum, which was convened by The New York Times for the fifth year. The forum, which gathers world leaders to discuss international affairs, was endorsed by United Nations Secretary General António Guterres. Mr. Annan, who was secretary general from 1997 to 2005, recalled the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989. “Suddenly, with the end of the Cold War, the U.N. could do what it was set up to do, without one country vetoing the other,” he said. “Today, we seem to be back to where we were in ’89.” The effectiveness of global institutions became a subject of debate following two decisive votes in 2016. One was Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union 43 years after joining what was then known as the European Economic Community. The other was the election of President Trump, who in December described the United Nations as “just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.” He has been critical of the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for being costly and ineffective. "
"WASHINGTON — When Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, introduced Chuck Schumer to members of her caucus this month, she warmed up the room with a well-worn joke about her Senate counterpart: “You know they say the most dangerous place in Washington is between Chuck and a camera.” Mr. Schumer’s love of the spotlight aside, it has been behind the scenes where “Chuck and Nancy,” as President Trump calls them, have forged what may be the most surprisingly potent partnership in Mr. Trump’s Washington. In a city where they hold no formal reins of power, the two are helping to set the agenda on Capitol Hill. They cut a fiscal deal with Mr. Trump, then reached a tentative agreement to protect young immigrants in the country illegally from deportation. Now they face a tougher test: Killing the latest Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and persuading the mercurial president to work with them to shore up shaky health insurance markets. “This is really a stinkeroo,” Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday, referring to the repeal measure drafted by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. “I hope that when this is defeated, and hopefully that will be soon, the president will agree to going forward in a bipartisan way.” It will not be easy. Mr. Trump is pressing Congress to adopt the health care legislation, which would cut deeply into Medicaid and dismantle the programs and prescriptions of the Affordable Care Act. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Rescuers in Mexico searched desperately for a second day for survivors of a powerful earthquake that toppled dozens of buildings in the capital alone. The death toll of more than 200 is expected to rise. An army of volunteers is helping in the relief effort. At least 30 children were crushed in one school. “I can’t bear this, I can’t,” wept a man at the site. Here’s a map of the damage and pictures of the destruction. We also explain why two huge earthquakes hit Mexico just 12 days apart. _____ "
"WASHINGTON — In the months since President Trump declared that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate deal, 14 state governors have vowed to continue upholding the agreement and press ahead with policies to fight global warming. But a key question has always lingered: How much can these states really do on climate by themselves, without help from the federal government? Now some numbers are emerging. On Wednesday, three governors in the United States Climate Alliance — Jerry Brown of California, Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, and Jay Inslee of Washington — unveiled a new study by the research firm Rhodium Group that said the 14 alliance states were on pace to meet their share of the Obama administration’s pledge under the Paris accord, thanks in part to local mandates on renewable energy and electric vehicles. “Together, we are a political and economic force, and we will drive the change that needs to happen nationwide,” Mr. Brown said at a news conference in New York, held as world leaders were gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. President Barack Obama had pledged that United States greenhouse gas emissions would fall 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. While President Trump has disavowed this goal, the new analysis found that collective emissions in the 14 alliance states are on pace to drop 24 to 29 percent, based on policies already on the books.

"WASHINGTON — Last month, Facebook and Google came out forcefully against a bill that would hold companies accountable for hosting sex trafficking on their websites. They said that while they worked hard to combat sex trafficking, changing the law “jeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet” that have been crucial to innovation for decades. By this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds. The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country’s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election. The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service. “There is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill. "
"WASHINGTON — Paul J. Manafort, the former campaign chairman for President Trump who is at the center of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, is working for allies of the leader of Iraq’s Kurdish region to help administer and promote a referendum on Kurdish independence from Iraq. The United States opposes the referendum, but Mr. Manafort has carved out a long and lucrative career advising foreign clients whose interests have occasionally diverged from American foreign policy. And he has continued soliciting international business even as his past international work has become a focus of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump and his associates, including possible collusion between them to influence the presidential election. In fact, the work for the Kurdish group appears to have been initiated this summer around the time that federal authorities working for Mr. Mueller raided Mr. Manafort’s home in Virginia and informed him that they planned to indict him. While the Kurdish referendum, scheduled for Monday, would not immediately trigger independence, the American government and the international community have expressed serious concerns about it. They fear that, if it passes overwhelmingly, as expected, it could further destabilize Iraq, damage the coalition fighting the Islamic State, and potentially spark violence in disputed areas. In a statement on Wednesday, the State Department urged Kurdish leaders “to accept the alternative, which is a serious and sustained dialogue with the central government, facilitated by the United States and United Nations, and other partners.” The Iraqi Kurdish leader, Massoud Barzani, and his allies, who are the driving force behind the referendum, hope it will put their semiautonomous oil-rich region on a path toward full independence, which they contend is their right. Independence could also allow the Kurdistan Regional Government, for which Mr. Barzani serves as president, to have uncontested control over its lucrative oil exports. "
"Leaders from around the world have descended on New York for United Nations meetings, fancy parties, ringing speeches about helping the poor — and a big dose of hypocrisy. And — finally! — this is one area where President Trump has shown global leadership. If there were an award for United Nations chutzpah, the competition would be tough, but the medal might go to Trump for warning that if necessary, “we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” There were gasps in the hall: A forum for peace was used to threaten to annihilate a nation of 25 million people. There also was Trump’s praise for American humanitarian aid to Yemen. Patting oneself on the back is often oafish, but in this case it was also offensive. Yemen needs aid because the U.S. is helping Saudi Arabia starve and bomb Yemeni civilians, creating what the U.N. says is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. In other words, we are helping to create the very disaster that we’re boasting about alleviating. It was also sad to see Trump repeatedly plug “sovereignty,” which tends to be the favored word of governments like Russia (even as it invades Ukraine and interferes in the U.S. election) and China (as it supports corrupt autocrats from Zimbabwe to Myanmar). Speaking of Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi skipped the U.N. meeting, after being feted last year, because it’s awkward to be a Nobel Peace Prize winner who defends a brutal campaign of murder, rape and pillage. Many Muslim leaders in attendance, like Recep Tayyip Erdogan, did highlight the plight of the Rohingya suffering an ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. If only they were as interested in their own political prisoners! Meanwhile, world leaders usually ignore places that don’t fit their narratives. Everybody pretty much shrugged at South Sudan and Burundi, both teetering on the edge of genocide; at Congo, where we’re headed for civil strife as the president attempts to cling to power; and at the “four famines”: in Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan. To Trump’s credit, he expressed concern Wednesday about South Sudan and Congo and said he would dispatch U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to the region to see what can be done; let’s hope his administration provides desperately needed leadership. "
"WASHINGTON — As the two negotiators who initiated the secret talks that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, we are intimately familiar with the deal’s strengths, its inevitable imperfections and the wider challenge posed by Iran. In an ideal world, we would have erased Iran’s knowledge of the nuclear fuel cycle, eliminated its missile arsenal, stopped its dangerous use of proxies across the region, and transformed it into a less disruptive regional power. But we don’t live in an ideal world. Diplomacy requires difficult compromises. And the nuclear deal achieved the best of the available alternatives. It cuts off Iran’s pathways to a bomb, sharply constrains its nuclear program for a long time, and provides for unprecedentedly strict monitoring and verification. Diplomacy avoided another war in the Middle East and averted the kind of crisis we now face with North Korea. But today, after two years of repeated affirmations of Iran’s compliance by our intelligence community and the International Atomic Energy Agency, American policy is at a fork in the road. The smart way to proceed would be to keep the world’s powers united and the burden of proof on Iran. That means working with partners on relentless enforcement; enhancing sanctions that punish Iran’s non-nuclear misbehavior, including its missile program and sponsorship of terrorism; working closely with Arab partners to deter Iran’s meddling in their internal affairs; and making plain our concerns with Iran’s domestic human rights abuses. It means using the diplomatic channel we opened with Iran, after 35 years without such contact, to avoid inadvertent escalation. And it means making it clear that after some restrictions in the deal expire, the United States and the world will still not allow Iran to advance its nuclear program in threatening ways. Then there’s the foolish way — which the Trump administration seems perpetually tempted to pursue. President Trump has already declared his hostility to the agreement. On Wednesday, he said he had reached a decision about the future of the deal, without saying what it was. "
"Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee violated their supposedly sacrosanct principles of fiscal hawkishness this week, by saying that it would be just fine with them to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years in order to cut taxes. They justify this hypocrisy by asserting what has been disproved time and again — that tax cuts spur the economy and compensate for any lost revenue. In fact, these cuts could hurt the very people they purport to help — small-business owners, middle-class professionals and working-class Americans. While even initial details of the tax plan are not expected before next week, deep corporate tax cuts have been a Republican priority for some time. Much of the discussion of that has revolved around the top rate, now 35 percent. President Trump has called for lowering it to 15 percent, while his economic aides and House Republicans favor a top rate around 25 percent. But the rate cut on corporate profits is only part of the plan. A centerpiece of proposals made in the past by Mr. Trump and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, has been to tax so-called pass-through income at the same rate as corporate profits. Currently, such income passes through businesses — including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships — onto the owners’ personal income tax returns, where it is taxed at rates of up to 39.6 percent. Instead, the Republicans would tax it at the new corporate rate of 15 or 25 percent. "

"EDEN, Utah — One morning last month a group of roughly 60 people, including doctors, C.E.O.s and internet entrepreneurs, gathered under a big white dome to hear the mission statement of their host, a 45-year-old man named Jamie Wheal. As he paced back and forth in front of an altar bearing shiny Buddha heads, Mr. Wheal talked about the perils of information overload in our content-rich era. “A literate person in the European Middle Ages,” he said, “consumed the same amount of content in their entire lives as we do reading a single edition of the Sunday New York Times.” Sinewy and tanned from a life of outdoor pursuits, Mr. Wheal was offering attendees the chance to “upgrade” their nervous systems to meet this incontrovertible information overload. How? With “flow.” But what is flow? First popularized decades ago by the Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow is an elusive state cultivated by artists, athletes and others, that of being so absorbed in what they’re doing that they lose track of time and thought, finding themselves guided rather by instinct and intuition. It has also been referred to as the Zone — not to be confused with the diet of the same name — or just “being in the moment.” And for those who have experienced it, there is no denying its magic. Dr. Csikszentmihalyi, who turns 83 this month, is a deeply philosophical academic formerly of the University of Chicago (now at Claremont Graduate University) and still publishing. In 2004 he gave a Ted Talk that has been viewed over four million times. "
"Donald Trump’s visit to the United Nations has resurrected the question of whether we’d be better off with Mike Pence. We haven’t mulled that one for a while. Lately, Trump’s stupendous instability has actually been looking like a plus. There he was, telling Democrats that he didn’t want to cut taxes on the rich. Trying to find a way to save the Dreamers, having apparently forgotten that he was the one who put them all in jeopardy of deportation. If Pence were president we wouldn’t be able to live in hopes of the next flip-flop. The Republican Congress would be marching through its agenda behind a committed conservative who, you may remember, forced so many Planned Parenthood clinics to close when he was governor of Indiana that it triggered an H.I.V. epidemic. Better insane than sorry. Then came the U.N. speech, and the reminder that the one big plus on Pence’s scorecard is that he seems less likely to get the planet blown up. You’ve heard about the big moment, when the president threatened to “totally destroy North Korea,” adding, “Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.” Trump, who has a history of giving opponents insulting nicknames, loves calling Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, “Rocket Man.” Nikki Haley, our U.N. ambassador, argued that the president’s speech was a diplomatic win because “every other international community” has now started calling Kim “Rocket Man,” too.

"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s foreign minister likened President Trump to a “dog barking,” ridiculing the American leader for threatening to “totally destroy” his country if it persists in its nuclear and missile threats. “Back home, we have a saying: The dog barks, but the caravan continues,” Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho told reporters in New York on Wednesday when he was asked about Mr. Trump’s comment. “If he thought he could scare us with the noise of a dog barking, well, he should be daydreaming.” Mr. Ri arrived in New York on Wednesday to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where Mr. Trump gave a speech on Tuesday in which he called North Korea a “band of criminals” and its leader, Kim Jong-un, a “Rocket Man” on “a suicide mission.” “The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,” Mr. Trump said. When asked about Mr. Trump’s Rocket Man comment, Mr. Ri said: “I am sorry for his aides.” Mr. Ri was scheduled to speak at the General Assembly on Friday. Other than Mr. Ri’s remarks, there has been no reaction from the North Korean government or Mr. Kim. But on Thursday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported that Mr. Kim had been visiting orchards. "
"In the latest installment of our video series that goes inside the private working worlds of designers, the consultant Hervé Pierre, the former creative director of Carolina Herrera who as the designer of Melania Trump’s inaugural gown shot to fame in January, reveals how he ended up as the first lady’s stylist, where he shops and whether he will start his own label. This interview has been edited and condensed. Where are we? In my apartment, which is also where I work. I live in Madison Square Park in New York, on 26th Street. I’ve been in this apartment for a bit over 10 years now. When I moved to New York from Paris to work for Oscar de la Renta, I was 29 years old and lived in Greenwich Village, and I wanted to create an environment that reminded me of the French world I had left. I brought the moldings and panels with me when I moved here. I didn’t have a very specific plan for how to decorate. It’s like when you go to the flea market looking for a teapot and come back with a frame. Where do you actually work? In this little corner in my bedroom. It has a great view because I see the Flatiron building, and it puts me in a good mood to sketch. What was the most important thing you learned before you went out on your own? When you work with a woman, it’s not about the clothes. It’s about the way a person is living: the way she eats, the way she organizes, her flowers. Now I ask a question every time I put an idea on paper: Where is this woman going? If you don’t have a purpose, it’s just an idea on paper and the dress means nothing. Can you give me an example? Years ago, when I was at Balmain in Paris, we were doing a dress for the queen of Jordan, I think. She didn’t want her left arm to move, because she just needed to do “How do you do, how do you do” with her right hand. And she didn’t need to sit either. It was a little strange, but O.K. You have to respect the lifestyle of the customer you’re dressing. You left Carolina Herrera last year after 15 years. How did you feel? I was a little scared in the beginning because when you work in a big environment, you are protected in a way. I was on one side of the gate, the golden gate, and suddenly I was in the wild. But a big corporate environment can be difficult, specifically with the number of collections. I was a bit burned out. If you don’t travel, if you have 200 samples to make in the next three months, when do you get inspired? How does it work for your own sanity? "
"Read the latest on Hurricane Maria with Friday’s live updates. Puerto Rico remained in the throes of chaos and devastation Thursday as the remnants of Hurricane Maria continued to dump rain on the island — up to three feet in some areas. Flash flood warnings persisted, according to the National Hurricane Center, with “catastrophic” flooding “especially in areas of mountainous terrain.” The strikingly powerful storm had rendered an estimated 3.4 million people without power, and with the territory’s energy grid all but destroyed, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló predicted a long period of recovery. Anxious relatives in the mainland United States and elsewhere took to social media in an effort to find news of their loved ones. Late Thursday, the mayor of Toa Baja, a town in northern Puerto Rico, told The New York Times that eight people had drowned there after flooding. That brought to at least 10 the number who have died in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria, a toll that is expected to climb. Puerto Rico faces numerous obstacles as it begins to emerge from the storm: the weight of an extended debt and bankruptcy crisis; a recovery process begun after Irma, which killed at least three people and left nearly 70 percent of households without power; the difficulty of getting to an island far from the mainland; and the strain on relief efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other groups already spread thin in the wake of several recent storms. “Irma gave us a break, but Maria destroyed us,” said Edwin Serrano, a construction worker in Old San Juan.

"In a matter of weeks, President Trump has twice struck deals with Democrats in Congress that have left many of his supporters flummoxed. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, warned him on Twitter that if the media reports were true, his “base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair.” He added, “No promise is credible.” But the informal DACA agreement with Democrats is unlikely to be the move that splinters his re-election coalition. Partnering with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on this immigration issue may make him look more like a Democrat, but DACA is broadly popular, and according to data on opinions of leaders in both parties, it also brings him a lot closer to most Republican elites. In 2014, long before Mr. Trump emerged as a candidate, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, an independent, nonpartisan research group, conducted two parallel surveys. One was done among regular Americans, and the other was conducted among foreign policy leaders in government, think tanks, news media, academia and similar groups. The surveys reveal two patterns that are relevant both to Mr. Trump’s rise in the Republican Party and his recent willingness to work with Democrats. The main conclusion from the Chicago Council data is simple: On many issues, including illegal immigration, globalization and trade, Republicans in the population are more conservative than Republican elites. Republican voters were roughly 40 points more likely than Republican elites to believe that controlling illegal immigration should be a top priority of American foreign policy (61 percent to 20 percent). They were less likely to support the resettlement of Syrian refuges to the United States (27 percent to 71 percent). And they were more likely to believe that immigrants and refuges entering the United States are a critical threat to the nation (55 percent to 16 percent). Similar differences exist on issues of trade, globalization and Social Security. "
"Farmers planted a new kind of seed on 25 million acres of soybean and cotton fields this year. Developed by Monsanto, the seeds, genetically modified to be resistant to a weed killer called dicamba, are one of the biggest product releases in the company’s history. But the seeds and the weed killer have turned some farmers — often customers of Monsanto, which sells both — against the company and alarmed regulators. Farmers who have not bought the expensive new seeds, which started to appear last year, are joining lawsuits, claiming that their crops have been damaged by dicamba that drifted onto their farms. Arkansas announced a 120-day ban of the weed killer this summer, and it is considering barring its use next year after mid-April. Missouri briefly barred its sale in July. And the Environmental Protection Agency, not known for its aggressiveness under President Trump, is weighing its own action. “I’m a fan of Monsanto. I’ve bought a lot of their products,” said Brad Williams, a Missouri farmer. “I can’t wrap my mind around the fact that there would be some kind of evil nefarious plot to put a defective product out there intentionally.” Yet he has been dismayed both by damage to his soybean crops, which were within a wide area of farmland harmed by dicamba, and by the impact even to trees on his property. Leaves, he said, were “so deformed you couldn’t even really identify the differences between them.” The dispute comes as American agriculture sits at a crossroads. Genetically modified crops were introduced in the mid-1990s. They made it possible to spray weed killers — chiefly Monsanto’s Roundup — on plants after they emerged from the ground, ridding fields of weeds while leaving crops undamaged. "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — The police chief of a volatile Afghanistan district was killed by a roadside bomb on Thursday, officials said, just two weeks after taking over for his predecessor, who was killed in the same manner. It was the third such killing of a security chief in the district — Jaghatu, in southeastern Afghanistan — in about a month, underscoring the continuing high casualties Afghan forces are suffering in defending against a resurgent Taliban. Their predecessor was killed in a Taliban ambush. Although Afghan security forces have denied the Taliban major victories in recent months, bloody local skirmishes continue, and military officials say the country’s forces are engaged in fighting in 20 of the country’s 34 provinces. The government does not release official casualty tallies of its forces, but senior officials say this year’s figures have matched, and at times exceeded, the record numbers for 2016, when about 6,300 members of Afghan forces were killed and close to 12,500 were wounded. The Jaghatu District police chief, Mera Jan Jafari, was killed by a roadside bomb while traveling to the Mohmand Pass area to set up a checkpoint, said Mohammed Arif Noori, a spokesman for the governor of Ghazni Province, where Jaghatu is located. “This is a concern for us, and we will investigate what is the reason that Taliban can easily kill a commander,” Mr. Noori said. “We have heard that some people help the Taliban, but that isn’t proved yet.” "
"Last week, a Silicon Valley startup called Bodega instigated an internet meltdown after a Fast Company profile made the company’s intentions clear. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you,” said Paul McDonald, a co-founder, who used to work at Google. The outrage made moral sense. “Bodega” is name that’s asking for trouble, especially with people who frequent them. The outrage is also easy. Where’s the upset over the effect other, bigger companies – like Amazon, whose latest major acquisition, Whole Foods, has slashed prices – might actually have on bodegas?

"I watch as Dame Judi Dench eats her chilled corn soup with saffron and sips Champagne. At 82, she is just as elegant as you would imagine, with silver hair, ice-blue eyes and crisp diction. She’s 5-foot-1, but her reputation is towering. Ms. Dench is one of the greatest British actresses — a star alum of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Sally Bowles in the London production of “Cabaret” and an Oscar winner for her eight-minute turn as Queen Elizabeth I in “Shakespeare in Love.” She died in James Bond’s arms, as the murdered spymaster M. And she has portrayed so many queens on stage and screen that when she plays a duchess, it seems like a demotion. So what to talk about with this regal creature? Well, what else? Lingerie, tattoos, rap music, younger men, sex and her hobby of embroidering cushions with raunchy sayings. This dame, as it turns out, is full of mischief. Ms. Dench got an Oscar nomination 20 years ago for playing Victoria in “Mrs. Brown,” the saga of how the queen grew close to a younger man, a servant who doted on her after her beloved Albert died, outraging her household. Now she is back in Oscar contention for “Victoria & Abdul,” the saga of how the queen grew close to another younger man, also a servant who doted on her after the other one died, again outraging her household.

"To the Editor: “In Africa, a Glimpse of Hope for Beating H.I.V.,” by Tina Rosenberg (Fixes column, nytimes.com, Sept. 19), rightly notes that President Trump’s proposed budget cuts to global health assistance would have subverted gains to end the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic. Though Mr. Trump’s proposal to reduce funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, by $1 billion was rejected by both the House and the Senate appropriations committees, the administration’s version of the global gag rule — which is a dramatic expansion of previous iterations — remains in effect. Research by Fordham University shows that the global gag rule drastically curtailed community-based H.I.V. testing and condom distribution programs. This is why President George W. Bush explicitly exempted Pepfar funding from the policy. Mr. Trump’s decision to include Pepfar and expand the global gag rule’s reach underscores this administration’s gross incompetence when it comes to global health. Now is not the time to stymie efforts to control the spread of an epidemic that knows no borders. Legislation like the Global HER Act is a critical step to making sure that progress toward ending AIDS is not reversed.

"To the Editor: Re “Democrats Irk G.O.P. With a Vow to Resist Tax Provisions for Rich” (news article, Sept. 13): Among the many recent head-spinning statements issued from the Trump administration regarding tax reform, a comment by Gary Cohn, the chief White House economic adviser, about the estate tax stands out for its cavalier insensitivity. “Only morons pay the estate tax,” Mr. Cohn is quoted as having told a group of Senate Democrats this year. If this reflects Mr. Cohn’s sentiment and that of the Trump administration in general, what message does it send to the public? That such taxpayers are mentally deficient fools? I personally know a number of people who have willingly paid this tax, and I can assure Mr. Cohn and others that they are neither suckers nor morons, but have done so with a far larger sense of social responsibility and of the common good than most members of our current administration demonstrate.

"When Jimmy Kimmel dropped the humor and began a relentless campaign against the latest effort from Senate Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, it was — at the very least — an uncommon moment for him. While Mr. Kimmel often discusses politics on his show, it is not his main focus and he has rarely — if ever — taken such a serious tone to advocate for or against a single piece of legislation. In the Trump era, late-night hosts speaking out against President Trump are common. Leaving out the jokes, however, is not. There have been other instances since the advent of late-night television where comedians have substituted political seriousness for punch lines — or combined the two. While these are rare, they can often create powerful moments of television. Or, when comics get involved directly in politics, sometimes it can flop. Just ask Bill Maher. Here are some examples from over the years. No late-night host has fought as vigorously or passionately for a piece of legislation as Jon Stewart, the former host of “The Daily Show,” did on behalf of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The bill was to provide health care for emergency medical workers who were sickened in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It was passed in 2011, partially because of Mr. Stewart’s relentless lobbying. "
"WASHINGTON — Under growing pressure from Congress and the public to reveal more about the spread of covert Russian propaganda on Facebook, the company said on Thursday that it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to congressional committees investigating the Kremlin’s influence operation during the 2016 presidential campaign. “I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said during an appearance on Facebook Live, the company’s video service. He added that he did not want anyone “to use our tools to undermine democracy.” “That’s not what we stand for,” he said. The announcement that Facebook would share the ads with the Senate and House intelligence committees came after the social network spent two weeks on the defensive. The company faced calls for greater transparency about 470 Russia-linked accounts — in which fictional people posed as American activists — which were taken down after they had promoted inflammatory messages on divisive issues. Facebook had previously angered congressional staff by showing only a sample of the ads, some of which attacked Hillary Clinton or praised Donald J. Trump. Facebook’s admission on Sept. 6 that Russian agents covertly bought ads on the site during last year’s campaign has brought intense scrutiny on the social network and on Twitter, entangling both companies in the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Both companies have turned over detailed data to Mr. Mueller. The disclosure of the ads also raised the possibility of future regulation of political advertising on social media platforms. This week, congressional Democrats asked the Federal Election Commission to advise on ways to prevent illicit foreign influence on American elections via social media, including possible new laws or regulations. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, denied on Friday that Russia had been involved in any way. The Kremlin, he said, does not even know how to put advertisements on Facebook, adding, “We have never done it, and the Russian side has never been involved in this.” "

"If there’s a better angel of President Trump’s nature, a doubtful proposition, then President Emmanuel Macron of France is determined to summon it through a mixture of Gallic logic and alpha-male charm. In a wide-ranging conversation in English with a handful of journalists in New York, Macron said that with the Paris climate accord as with the Iran nuclear agreement, “What I want to convince him is that the solution is not to break what we have.” Trump has said he’ll withdraw from the Paris deal unless it can be renegotiated, but no concrete steps have been taken for the United States to quit. The president has also been implacably hostile to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, although it has slashed Iran’s enrichment program under strict international monitoring and stopped the country well short of North Korea’s nuclear-weapon status. Trump keeps hinting he’ll tear up what he’s called “the worst deal ever.” Macron, who described his relationship with Trump as “extremely direct,” said he wants to show the president “that he puts himself in deadlock because on these different issues, what’s his alternative? He doesn’t have any. On climate, even on Iran, there is no alternative. So we have to rebuild some multilateralism where your president finds his place.” That’s a tough assignment in that Trump has not yet met a multilateral organization he doesn’t disparage, embraces an America-first ideology, and loves the idea of “sovereignty” so much he referred to it more than 20 times in his United Nations speech this week. But Macron, who upended France’s political landscape in the space of a year, is not one to be daunted by near impossible challenges. Descending from the Jupiter-like heights that have marked the early months of his presidency (an attempt to reignite French pride through the Gaullist majesty of his office), Macron was frank and chatty as he outlined his ideas to cajole Trump from self-defeating rage toward productive reason — a thankless task in which the French upstart should have the world’s full backing. With Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at odds, and the initial American-British love fest fraying over wild Trump outbursts, Macron is probably the last best hope for America’s allies to restrain the apocalyptic side of Trump’s nature. There’s chemistry in the relationship. Of course, if he fails, the risk for the French president is that he will be seen as Trump’s lackey. "
"To the Editor: Re “Tough Talk but Little Action on Opioid Epidemic” (news article, Sept. 11): It’s tragic that the Trump administration continues to stall on seriously addressing our nationwide opioid epidemic. More than 20 million Americans and their families living with an addiction need treatment and recovery support services now. Public policy pathways already exist. In addition to the recent interim report from the White House Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, we have the dozens of realistic recommendations in the 2016 Surgeon General’s Report, “Facing Addiction in America.” Both reports document evidence-based strategies for reducing and reversing this epidemic. You cite statements from Trump administration officials that they are trying to decide how to proceed. An immediate action they could take would be to fully fund and fast-track the funds for the 21st Century Cures Act. This would provide vital funds for halfway houses and recovery residences that enable people in recovery to maintain the behaviors and knowledge they learned in treatment. DON MATHIS, HAVRE DE GRACE, MD. The writer is president of Addiction Connections Resource. To the Editor: Four years ago in Baltimore, applicants for methadone maintenance, the “gold standard” of opioid dependency treatment, were offered an alternative to being returned to the streets to continue their deadly illicit drug use while awaiting entry to one of the oversubscribed “comprehensive” programs: They could receive “interim” treatment with medication only. The results, published in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, were essentially the same as those of patients entering comprehensive service programs directly. This outcome paralleled the one two decades earlier at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, reported in The American Journal of Public Health: “Interim methadone maintenance can reduce heroin use among those awaiting entry into comprehensive treatment.” "
"Jimmy Kimmel, the talk show host who has become the unlikely face of opposition to Senate Republicans’ latest health care push, insisted he had done his homework. Mr. Kimmel spent a second straight night arguing against the proposal on Wednesday. Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a co-sponsor of the bill, responded by telling news outlets that “Jimmy doesn’t understand.” Earlier this year, the men seemed to be on the same page. Mr. Cassidy had appeared amicably on the program in May after Mr. Kimmel told an emotional story about his infant son’s heart condition. In an appearance a week earlier on CNN, Mr. Cassidy had coined the “Jimmy Kimmel test” when he was asked about insurance companies capping their payouts to customers. “As you present that, I ask: Does it pass the Jimmy Kimmel test?” he said. “Would a child born with a congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in that first year of life? I want it to pass the Jimmy Kimmel test.” But in recent days, Mr. Kimmel argued that the bill Mr. Cassidy had co-sponsored fell short. A review of the factual statements in Mr. Kimmel’s Wednesday night monologue suggests he has a strong grasp on the proposal, though there are nits to pick. The Congressional Budget Office has not provided a score of the bill yet, but three groups have recently released estimates. Mr. Kimmel cited the highest of the three, which comes from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Avalere Health, a Washington-based consulting firm, estimated the states would lose $215 billion federal funding through 2026. The Kaiser Family Foundation released a lower figure Thursday morning: $160 billion. "
"LONDON — Brash headlines. Hyper-opinionated columnists. Celebrity mania. Unabashed appeals to those who feel excluded. Sound familiar? These themes perfectly reflect the media climate of our time, but they also define the portrait of a young Rupert Murdoch in James Graham’s “Ink,” which is at the Duke of York’s Theater in the West End, after a successful run at the Almeida Theater. Directed by Rupert Goold and starring Bertie Carvel and Richard Coyle, “Ink” chronicles the 1969 takeover of the moribund Sun newspaper by Rupert Murdoch, then a rising Australian media mogul. Together with Larry Lamb, who he hired as the editor, Mr. Murdoch proceeded to reinvent the mass-market tabloid and to change the media and politics here in a way that still resounds today. (The Sun, still going strong, is one of the tabloids thought to have strongly influenced Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.) How much could Mr. Murdoch, who is a close friend of Donald Trump, and who controls the Fox News Channel, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, have foreseen the consequences of those early decisions? What motivated him? What does it mean for “Ink” to be seen in Britain now? Mr. Graham, the author of several recently successful plays (“This House,” “Privacy”), and Mr. Carvel, best-known for playing the villainous Miss Trunchbull in “Matilda,” sat down a few days before the West End premiere to discuss these questions and more. This is an edited version of the conversation. What made you want to write a play about the rise of the tabloids? Was it prompted by the polemics around Brexit? JAMES GRAHAM I began writing it at the beginning of 2016, but even before Brexit and Trump’s election, I was interested in the way our news discourse was changing online and through social media. The more aggressive populist language of journalism there made me think about the aggressive populist tone that started with The Sun. "
"For decades, Republicans have dreamed of taking some of the vast sums the federal government spends on health care entitlements and handing the money over to states to use as they saw best. Now, in an 11th-hour effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the party has come up with a way to repackage the funding for the law it loathes into a trillion-dollar pot of state grants. The plan is at the core of the bill that Senate Republican leaders have vowed to bring to a vote next week. It was initially seen as a long-shot effort by Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. But for all its ad hoc, last-minute feel, it has evolved into the most far-reaching repeal proposal of all. It dismantles the Medicaid expansion and the system of subsidies to help people afford insurance. It gives the states the right to waive many of the consumer protections under President Obama’s landmark health law. And it removes the guaranteed safety net that has insured the country’s poorest citizens for more than half a century. “This is by far the most radical of any of the Republican health care bills that have been debated this year,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. “And the reason for that is that this would be the biggest devolution of federal money and responsibility to the states for anything, ever.” The White House and Senate leaders are now in an intensive final push to repeal the Affordable Care Act by September 30. After that, under Senate rules, they will need 60 votes, which they acknowledge is an impossibility. Senator Graham said in a statement on Thursday that the legislation was gaining “momentum and support” because it would send “money and power back to the states, and closer to patients, to deliver quality health care.” "
"Iran’s foreign minister rejected on Thursday any new negotiation with the United States over extending the length or conditions of the 2015 nuclear accord, saying that Iran would talk about changing the accord only if every concession it made — including giving up nuclear fuel — were reconsidered. In an interview, the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that would mean Iran would retake possession of the stockpile of nuclear fuel it shipped to Russia when the accord took effect. “Are you prepared to return to us 10 tons of enriched uranium?,” Mr. Zarif said of the relinquished stockpile — one of Iran’s biggest concessions — about 98 percent of the country’s nuclear fuel holdings. Under the agreement, Iran retains an amount of enriched uranium too small to make a single atomic weapon. Mr. Zarif, who was educated in the United States, spoke with reporters, columnists and editorial writers for The New York Times, a day after he conferred privately with counterparts from the six countries that negotiated the deal with Iran — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York. It was the first time Mr. Zarif had met with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who has said the United States wants to “revisit” what he described as flaws in the accord even as he acknowledged Iran is abiding by its terms. "

"WASHINGTON — Five years ago, Paul Manafort arranged for a prominent New York-based law firm to draft a report that was used by allies of his client, Viktor Yanukovych, the Russia-aligned president of Ukraine, to justify the jailing of a political rival. And now the report is coming back to haunt it. The Justice Department, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation, recently asked the firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, for information and documents related to its work on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych’s government, which crumbled after he fled to Russia under pressure. The request comes at a time when Mr. Manafort, his work for Mr. Yanukovych’s party and for Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the handling of payments for that work have become focal points in the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and connections between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates. It’s unclear if the Justice Department’s request to Skadden, as the firm is known, is part of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. But the interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants. Mr. Manafort played a central role in the effort to shield Mr. Yanukovych from international condemnation, according to consultants involved in the effort. He devised the strategy and recruited lobbyists, lawyers and public relations consultants from across the political spectrum, but left the day-to-day implementation of the campaign to others. Skadden’s report was one element of that strategy. Its conclusions provided a counterpoint to international critics who said that Mr. Yanukovych’s government had prosecuted and convicted the former Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, on corruption charges in 2011 for political reasons and without sufficient evidence. "
"When the Trump administration unveils new details of its tax plan, promised for next week, one group of taxpayers will be under the microscope: the rich. That’s because they take advantage of so many tax breaks that few, if any, pay the top rate of 39.6 percent. Eliminating at least some of those breaks would make it possible to reduce tax rates for the highest earners (and everyone else) while raising the same or even more in total revenue. Doing so would reduce rates while broadening the base, and simplify the tax code while making it fairer — goals that nearly all economists from across the political spectrum say they support. The administration, too, seems to have embraced such an approach. “The rich will not be gaining at all,” President Trump said last week. So who are the rich? Based on comprehensive data now available from the Internal Revenue Service, it’s possible to pinpoint who pays what based on their percentile of adjusted gross income. The top 1 percent seems a fair representation of the rich. This group — about 1.4 million taxpayers — reported adjusted gross incomes of over $466,000 in 2014, the most recent year for which the data is available. The top 1 percent paid a total of $542.6 billion in federal tax, or an astounding 39.5 percent of the total income tax. If you want to take a more expansive view of rich, the top 10 percent (who earn upward of $133,000) pay 71 percent of the total tax. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump widened U.S. sanctions against trade with North Korea and presented a united front against its nuclear program with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “The brutal North Korean regime does not respect its own citizens or the sovereignty of other nations,” Mr. Trump said at their lunch, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. He also hailed a “very bold move” by China’s central bank to limit dealings with North Korea. The North’s foreign minister compared Mr. Trump’s warnings at the U.N. this week to “the noise of a dog barking.” Australia has its turn today at the U.N podium, and India, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia address the assembly on Saturday.

"The case of a  baker in Colorado who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple has been added to the Supreme Court’s docket for this fall, but thousands of New York Times readers have already weighed in on the debate, which centered on the protections of free speech. The baker, Jack Phillips, said that supplying the cake to the couple, David Mullins and Charlie Craig, would violate his Christian faith and his right to express himself. The couple says that freedom of speech does not give Mr. Phillips the right to discriminate against same-sex couples. The article received over 4,500 comments on nytimes.com and The New York Times’s Facebook post. Here is a selection of responses, which have been edited for length and clarity. I’m gay myself but in this situation, I’m actually finding myself siding more with the baker than the gay couple. The baker stated that he would create other types of cakes for gay people or any people — just not wedding cakes. It clarifies he’s not broadly discriminating against gay people. I think the politics of nondiscrimination have gone too far and are being too often used now to bully people. Yes, in an ideal world, this baker would have his eyes opened and would not allow religion to narrow him in this way. But I think we are going too far with the state trying to force people to be completely without prejudice. — Oakbranch, California Let’s be real about this. The baker is not being asked to do anything that violates his religion, unless his religion prohibits the baking, decorating and selling of cakes. What the baker is doing is attempting to impose his religious beliefs on others. This is simple intolerance, and he is breaking the law which prohibits discrimination. Any sane judiciary would see this and make short work of it. — Robert Anderson, Ellicott City, Md. "
"STREAMPUNKS
YouTube and the Rebels Remaking Media
By Robert Kyncl with Maany Peyvan
272 pp. Harper Business. $29.99 It’s not easy to write a relevant book about internet culture. By the time it hits the press, the online story has already changed. The narrative has outpaced the publishing schedule for “Streampunks: YouTube and the Rebels Remaking Media,” a book about YouTube video makers written by the company’s chief business officer, Robert Kyncl (with assistance from the Google speechwriter Maany Peyvan). Kyncl’s account is suffused with Obama-age technocratic optimism, but we’re in the Trump era now. Many of the “rebels” disrupting the mainstream media these days aren’t exactly humming Kumbaya. “Streampunks” tells the story of a multicultural cast of video creators who have outsmarted the media’s white, male gatekeepers to build the next wave of television, enlightening and empowering viewers with their intimate, straight-to-the-camera dispatches. When Kyncl writes that YouTube “can show you the breadth of humanity that you may not see outside your window every day,” he is actually referring to a narrow swath of human testimonies — ones that teach viewers to embrace their nerdiness; or help them understand the experiences of people with physical disabilities; or bring together L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers; or advocate for women’s empowerment in the Middle East. He writes brightly of YouTube “broadening society’s horizons” and creating a “global media melting pot.” But YouTube can just as easily connect lonely racists as it does isolated queer kids, or accelerate regressive values as quickly as progressive ones. It’s now more obvious than ever that YouTube, like other social networks, has been leveraged by a network of overwhelmingly white, male far-right nativists and chauvinists who use its innovative communication tools to spread messages of terror and domination. In a choice typical of the book’s scope, Kyncl writes glowingly about Vice Media’s chief executive and co-founder Shane Smith, and his mission to remake television news for internet natives ; many of Vice’s raw, on-the-ground videos were hosted on YouTube before they graduated to HBO. Kyncl mentions that Smith started Vice with a Canadian friend named Gavin McInnes, but doesn’t note where McInnes ended up: He’s been making online news videos, too, for far-right sites, and he’s used his media perch to spearhead a crew of “pro-Western” men he calls the Proud Boys.

"On a sunny September morning in the Bronx, Vincent and Robert Gardino were out searching for the dead. Strolling among the tombstones in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, the brothers were not the least bit morbid, excitedly trading stories and barbs. “Come over here!” Vincent shouted, his voice bouncing off the monuments. “I want to show you someone.” Below him was the grave of Vito Marcantonio, a protégé of Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. Marcantonio died of a heart attack in 1954 after walking up the City Hall subway steps while collecting signatures for a Congressional run. “He was a lefty during the McCarthy era,” Vincent said. “When he died, Cardinal Spellman prohibited him from having a Catholic funeral.” Finding the graves of the famous and not so famous — like Marcantonio, once well known but now obscure — was always the Gardinos’ hobby. Part treasure hunt, part Who’s Who in America, it has now become their part-time job. The Gardinos are developing a television show for PBS called “Grave Trippers,” visiting cemeteries not just in New York but all over the country. Like Click and Clack of “Car Talk,” the Gardino brothers have an easy rapport. Instead of engines, their topic is the life fully lived but sometimes forgotten. At Woodlawn, they visited LaGuardia himself, but also his first wife, Thea, who died of tuberculosis, and their baby, Fioretta. “They died within months of one another in 1921,” said Vincent, touching the tombstone, covered in a green copper plate with a haunting etching of a mother reaching her arms out to an approaching toddler.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. After Jimmy Kimmel excoriated Senator Bill Cassidy on Tuesday for proposing a health care bill that would leave many children with caps on their insurance coverage, he was met with a strong backlash from conservative politicians and pundits. Mr. Kimmel didn’t back down on Wednesday, leading “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” with a fierce response. Mr. Kimmel singled out one Fox News personality in particular for a dressing-down: Brian Kilmeade, who lamented on Wednesday that “Hollywood elites like comedian Jimmy Kimmel” were “pushing their politics on the rest of the country.” Mr. Kimmel said he’d met Mr. Kilmeade, whom he described as behaving “like a little boy meeting Batman.” On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah took issue with the way the media is covering Mr. Cassidy’s health care proposal. He reminded viewers that when Republicans tried to pass a health care bill earlier this summer, it was called a “last-ditch” effort — and that the same language is being used now. Stephen Colbert suggested some more metaphorical language. President Trump misspoke at the United Nations on Wednesday when addressing a conference of African leaders. The hosts were ready to roast.

"After months of clashes with the security forces, street demonstrations in Venezuela have calmed down, but the economic and political crisis is far from over. The fraudulently elected National Assembly is drafting a new Constitution that will subordinate the judicial system and legislative bodies to the executive branch. The result will be a new dictatorship in Latin America — the first in decades. Having grabbed virtually total power to govern at will, President Nicolás Maduro has wasted no time in jailing political opponents, resorting to torture and repression against students, and silencing the remaining critical news media outlets. Despite a humanitarian disaster leading his country’s citizens to lose on average up to 10 percent of their weight, to be told to eat pet rabbits and to flee abroad by the hundreds of thousands, Hugo Chávez’s successor refuses to step down. Other countries in the region and the internal opposition must intensify their efforts to find a way out of the chaos. Talks in the Dominican Republic between officials from Mr. Maduro’s government and its opponents will not succeed by themselves. On Monday, President Trump hosted a dinner for the presidents of Brazil, Colombia and Panama and the vice president of Argentina at which they agreed to continue working together to resolve Venezuela’s problems. They might achieve something, but only if another country is brought into the equation: Cuba. Given Mr. Trump’s animosity toward the Cuban regime in his United Nations speech on Tuesday, when he said Washington will not lift sanctions on Havana until it makes reforms, it may seem an unlikely partnership. But both countries have real incentives to work together: Only the Cubans can ease Mr. Maduro and his henchmen from power, and only United States’ investment, tourism, trade and good will can allow Cuba to solve its serious economic problems. If Raúl Castro joins in, a deal could be struck, now or when the crisis takes another bad turn. Mr. Maduro refuses to step down. While the government has scheduled regional elections for mid-October, Mr. Maduro is unwilling to call a presidential election next year, because he knows he will lose. International pressure on Venezuela has increased. Latin American countries have made powerful statements against the regime, and the United States has imposed sanctions; the European Union may soon impose economic and visa sanctions. "
"LOS ANGELES — I guess there’s a God. During one of the meanest passages in American national politics within living memory, we’re getting a huge, historically corrective, morale-raising cultural event, one that lasts four months and hits on many of the major social topics of the day: racism, sexism, aggressive nationalism. True, the hugeness of the thing is a problem, and the contents are uneven. But it’s a gift, worth a trip to puzzle over and savor. And if the timing is right, that’s semi-accidental. The event, called “Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA,” is the latest of three successive multi-venue extravaganzas in and around this city, spaced several years apart, and bankrolled by the Getty Foundation. The first was an overview of art in Southern California from 1945 to 1980; the second was devoted to architecture and design. The current edition is more tightly focused: on the long, mutually formative cultural exchange between Latin America and the Los Angeles region, considered through exhibitions at some 70 institutions, large and small. The theme is inherently loaded. Latin American art has had shamefully little museum attention in a county that is, statistically, nearly 40 percent Spanish-speaking. So “LA/LA” is definitely a catch-up gesture. And when research began on the project several years ago, few participants could have anticipated the anti-immigrant, and specifically anti-Mexican sentiment of the next administration, summed up by the recent suspension of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by President Trump and in the persistently circulated “Build the Wall” meme of the election campaign. One “LA/LA” exhibition, “The U.S.-Mexico Border: Place, Imagination, and Possibility,” at the Craft and Folk Art Museum, directly addresses the subject of a fraught boundary. Some of the work in the show is too soft and cute, but a few pieces obviously mean business. In a 1978 print by Rupert Garcia (reprinted in 2011), three thick strands of barbed wire silhouetted against a red ground frame the words “Cesen Deportación.” A 1988 poster by David Avalos, Louis Hock and Elizabeth Sisco combines a triptych of images of brown-skinned hands cleaning a dinner plate, and others handcuffed, with the words: “Welcome to America’s Finest Tourist Plantation.” "
"Google once owned a phone maker. It didn’t work out. Now it’s trying a different approach. The technology giant agreed to pay $1.1 billion to hire smartphone engineers from the struggling Taiwanese manufacturer HTC. Why? To double down on producing its own hardware. Google has been especially focused on its Pixel line of premium smartphones, some of which are made by HTC and have gotten good reviews. From The New York Times’s Daisuke Wakabayashi: Here’s the take of Ars Technica’s Ron Amadeo, one of the top smartphone reviewers around: The Deal Makers • On Google’s side: Lazard and the law firms Cleary Gottlieb and Lee & Li • On HTC’s team: Evercore and the law firms Gibson Dunn and Tsar & Tsai Flashback Google was in hardware once before: It paid $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2010. It sold that business to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion three years later. Some analysts were relieved when Google sold off Motorola Mobility, according to The Times: (DealBook’s Michael J. de la Merced argued at the time of the Lenovo deal that Google didn’t lose as much money as the headline figures suggest.) Standard & Poor’s move, which cut China’s sovereign rating to A+ from AA-, was its first reduction in the rating since 1999. The outlook on China was changed to stable from negative. "
"AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Wetex Kang, a Malay-Chinese immigrant beekeeper, may be the first Asian candidate to represent the Maori Party of New Zealand, but at times he sounds more like a certain American president. “I think we can make this country great again,” he said last month while driving through the electoral district of Botany in Auckland. That phrasing is intentional — Mr. Kang says he admires President Trump’s brash ability to grab attention. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Kang is a political newcomer who at times says exactly what he is thinking. And Mr. Kang calls himself a “semi-self-made millionaire” who believes the country should be run like a business. But when it comes to policy, his vision of national greatness sounds decidedly different: “I’m standing for a true voice for immigrants. I stand for bridging the inequality in this country, and helping the tangata whenua realize their true potential,” Mr. Kang, 44, said, using the Maori word for the original inhabitants of New Zealand. For the Maori Party, Mr. Kang’s candidacy for a seat in the House of Representatives, which will be put to a vote on Saturday, is an attempt to see if the party can attract the support of a group outside New Zealand’s mostly white political establishment: the Chinese community. Mr. Kang is campaigning on a platform that promises to address concerns over racial discrimination and tightening immigration policies. And backed by a famous but controversial activist in the Maori nationalism movement, Tame Iti, Mr. Kang’s campaign could be the beginning of a partnership between some of the country’s oldest and newest ethnic communities. While that alliance may sound unusual, Marama Fox, a co-leader of the Maori Party, which was formed in 2004 to represent indigenous interests, said that its endorsement of Mr. Kang made sense because of a widely shared genealogy.

First, health care: Here’s a giveway about how bad the new Senate health care bill is: Bill Cassidy, one of its authors, keeps trying to sell it by telling untruths. “The relatively new phenomenon of just ‘up is down’ lying about your bill’s impacts is jarring,” says Loren Adler of the USC-Brookings-Schaeffer Initiative on Health Policy. Most egregiously, Cassidy is claiming that the bill would not ultimately deprive sick people of health insurance. That’s false, as NPR calmly explained when Cassidy said otherwise. In fact, the bill — known as Graham-Cassidy — would free states to remove insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Without those protections, insurers could price such people out of the market. If you get cancer (or even have a family history of it) or your child is born with a birth defect — among many, many other health issues — you could find yourself unable to buy insurance. Without insurance, you could be denied crucial treatments. In a tangible way, Graham-Cassidy would harm millions of Americans. "
"LARCHMONT, N.Y. — After the presidential election in November, residents here staged an impromptu vigil. Nine days after the inauguration, more met at a local church to form a grass-roots political action group. Postcard-writing events were organized; another one, a “No Democrat Left Behind” postcard party, will be held later this month at The Voracious Reader, a children’s bookstore. In this picture-book village on Long Island Sound, where owners of the generously proportioned Tudors and Dutch Colonials have long been overwhelmingly Democratic, a sense of political immediacy has clearly taken hold. But whether this energy filters down to local races remains to be seen. In November, voters in Westchester County will choose a county executive. Dismayed by Washington and the direction of the Republican Party, many Democrats say they are ready for change. And yet, even in a county where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1, only two Democratic county executives have led Westchester since the 1930s. The story is the same in Nassau County, where Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans and yet the Democratic hopeful for county executive, Laura Curran, is also seeking to become the third Democrat to hold that position in 80 years. With Election Day less than two months away, and both county executive posts up for grabs, Democrats are hoping to capitalize on the growing antagonism to President Trump among progressive voters. “I’ve gotten active politically in just the past year — this is new for me,” said Farah Kathwari, a mother of two from Larchmont, who founded the liberal group #OurFlag after Mr. Trump’s election. “But I think everything starts locally and works its way up. Donald Trump is not president in a vacuum.” "
"By now, President Trump’s sense of humor has been pretty well discussed. Either he doesn’t have one, or it’s subtle — like a group of especially awkward 12-year-old boys yucking it up in the cafeteria. A minute on Google produces an encyclopedia of moments when we have been assured Trump was “only joking.” Some prime examples include Sean Spicer saying Trump was joshing when he urged the Kremlin to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails during the campaign. Then there was the painful moment when his spokesperson, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “I believe he was making a joke,” after Trump suggested that police officers slam prisoners’ heads into the door jambs of their cars. Happily, Hope Hicks, Trump’s communications aide, put all our doubts to rest when she gave The Washington Post a formal statement saying that the president “is brilliant with a great sense of humor.” The “joking” dodge, of course, falls into the category of language tics that actually mean the opposite (“Did you actually pay someone for that haircut? Only kidding!” or “With all due respect, I think your ideas are terrible.”) It’s also worth pointing out that the wacky sense of fun among Trump and his supporters is selective. When Kellyanne Conway fulminated about a “nut job” spreading “vile” ideas that could “easily inflame lunatics who wish to bring harm,” she was talking about Johnny Depp’s very bad assassination joke, but not Trump retweeting a GIF showing him hitting Hillary Clinton in the back with a golf ball.

"President Trump ordered a widening of American sanctions on North Korea on Thursday to further choke off its trade with the outside world, in what some experts described as perhaps the most sweeping set of punitive economic measures enacted by the United States in many years. A new executive order signed by Mr. Trump aimed to cut North Korea out of the international banking system while targeting its major industries and shipping. The move suggested that for now, at least, the president was still committed to applying economic pressure rather than military action, despite his vow this week to “totally destroy North Korea” if the United States were forced to defend itself or its allies. “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and nuclear development is a grave threat to peace and security in our world, and it is unacceptable that others financially support this criminal, rogue regime,” Mr. Trump said as he hosted President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan for lunch in New York. “The brutal North Korean regime does not respect its own citizens or the sovereignty of other nations.” The action came amid news reports that China’s central bank had instructed the country’s banks not to do new business with North Korea and to wind down old loans, in keeping with United Nations sanctions. As North Korea’s dominant economic partner, China holds the most sway with Pyongyang, but it remained unclear if its latest action would be enforced enough to have any real impact. For all of the headline-grabbing pugnacity of Mr. Trump’s United Nations speech earlier this week, in which he mocked North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man” on a “suicide mission,” the president made it clear on Thursday that he was still open to negotiations. Asked by a reporter whether dialogue was still possible, he said, “Why not?” Mr. Kim, however, signaled no such openness. In a statement, he denounced Mr. Trump as a “rogue and gangster fond of playing with fire” and said that rather than deter him, Mr. Trump’s speech had convinced him that “the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last.” He vowed retribution: “I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.” "
"Jeffrey Mezger, chief executive of the homebuilder KB Home, will take a 25 percent cut to his year-end bonus as a result of his sexist and homophobic outburst against his neighbor, the comedian Kathy Griffin, the company said Thursday. Any similar incidents in the future, the company also said, would result in Mr. Mezger’s dismissal. Mr. Mezger was recorded on Saturday by security cameras at Ms. Griffin’s home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles shouting profanities and derogatory comments at Ms. Griffin and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, after they had called the police to complain about noise from Mr. Mezger’s backyard. The audio recording, published by HuffPost, provoked an immediate backlash on social media. KB Home, one of the largest homebuilders in the country, said that its board decided to reduce Mr. Mezger’s bonus, which he would receive at the end of its 2017 fiscal year in November. The value of the bonus, which KB Home called an annual cash incentive payment, is unclear. Last year, Mr. Mezger earned nearly $9 million in total compensation, making him the fifth-highest-paid chief executive among publicly traded homebuilding companies in the United States, according to Builder magazine. The board also said that it had told Mr. Mezger “if in the future there is any similar incident, he will be dismissed.” In a statement, the board said that Mr. Mezger has been a “very effective” executive and a “great leader” who has “always conducted himself in a professional manner.” “Mr. Mezger has the full and complete confidence of the board,” the statement said. “However, Mr. Mezger’s recent behavior in his personal dealings with a neighbor is unacceptable and a negative reflection on KB Home.” Engaging in problematic activity has forced several chief executives from their jobs. ■ Brian J. Dunn of Best Buy had a relationship with an employee (2012) ■ Matt Harrigan of PacketSled ranted on social media on election night about killing President-elect Trump (2016) ■ Scott Thompson of Yahoo was found to have padded his résumé (2012) ■ Kenneth Melani of Highmark got into a fight with the husband of his then-girlfriend, who was also an employee (2012) ■ Brendan Eich of Mozilla donated $1,000 in support of a ballot measure to ban same-sex marriage, causing outrage in Silicon Valley (2014) ■ Klaus Kleinfeld of Arconic wrote to a hedge fund manager without the board’s knowledge (2017). Mr. Mezger’s outburst stemmed from a strained relationship with Ms. Griffin and Mr. Bick, who live in the same upscale gated community. In the audio Mr. Mezger referred to Ms. Griffin using a crude reference to the female anatomy and a disparaging term for lesbians. He also mocked her shaved head, which was a gesture of support for her sister Joyce, who died of cancer last week. Soon after the audio was published, the former CNBC host Suze Orman called Mr. Mezger’s actions “disgraceful.” “You really want to buy a home from this man? Beyond disgusting,” Ms. Orman wrote on Twitter. "
