"LONDON — A British man accused of killing a worshiper and injuring several others when he rammed a van into a congregation of Muslims leaving a London mosque last year had been in contact with far-right groups before the attack, prosecutors said at his trial on Tuesday. The BBC reported that the man, Darren Osborne, 48, had received a Twitter message from Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, a group that recently gained notoriety after President Trump recirculated unverified anti-Muslim videos it had posted online. Ms. Fransen was arrested in December on charges related to hate crimes. Mr. Osborne, whom his former partner described as a “loner,” had also received an email from an account linked to the English Defence League, an extremist group that opposes what it claims to be the spread of Islam and Shariah law in Britain. Officials say that Mr. Osborne plowed into a group of worshipers leaving the Finsbury Park Mosque in North London on June 19 during Ramadan, the holiest month in the Muslim calendar. One man was killed and at least 10 people were injured. It was among a spate of terrorist attacks that shook Britain. A month earlier, a homemade bomb had exploded at an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena, killing 22 people, many of them children, and injuring more than 500 others. The man identified as the bomber, Salman Abedi, had links to the Islamic State. And in June, attacks on London Bridge and at Borough Market, also inspired by the Islamic State, killed eight people. The BBC quoted prosecutors in Mr. Osborne’s trial as saying that he had looked to the Britain First leaders Paul Golding and Ms. Fransen, as well as Tommy Robinson, a founder of the English Defence League, after the London Bridge attack.

"We purveyors of commentary tend to find multitudes in the teeniest speck and mirrors of the zeitgeist wherever we turn. I grant you that. But grant me this: America really is about to get the pathetic Super Bowl that it deserves. I don’t think that I can even food-bribe myself into watching. There aren’t enough Buffalo wings in the world. On account of a wearyingly familiar come-from-behind victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, the New England Patriots will be playing, and that’s about as surprising as sesame seeds on a bun. The Patriots perfectly embody our income-inequality era and the tax reform that President Trump recently signed. Their good fortune begets more good fortune. They shamelessly hoard glory. And there’s frequently a whiff of cheating in their success. Shockingly, they’re Trump’s team. This makes no geographic sense: The ZIP codes of his primary castles recommend allegiance to the New York Giants, the New York Jets or maybe the Miami Dolphins. But those National Football League franchises have reliable losing streaks, and Trump won’t suffer that. Also, when he looks at the Patriots’ glamour-puss quarterback, Tom Brady, he sees a younger, less quizzically coifed version of himself, complete with a foreign-born model for a wife. Trust me on this. He just squints extra hard, sucks in his gut and begs Melania to answer to “Gisele” for a while. So he roots for the Patriots. Perversely, they root for him. Well, some of them do. Brady has been his occasional golfing partner and sort of endorsed him for president by imagining aloud that with Trump in the Oval Office, there might be “a putting green on the White House lawn.” We’ve gone from a chicken in every pot to this.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was questioned last week as part of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, into Russian meddling in the election. That’s a first for a member of President Trump’s cabinet. Mr. Sessions, above center, is a key witness to two of the major issues Mr. Mueller is investigating: the campaign’s possible ties to the Russians and whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation. And we learned that James Comey, the former head of the F.B.I., was also interviewed by Mr. Mueller’s office last year. They discussed his memos detailing his interactions with Mr. Trump. ____ "
"President Trump’s pledge during the presidential campaign to help manufacturing workers by reducing imports from China and other countries sounded half-baked. His administration’s decision on Monday to impose import tariffs on solar energy cells and panels and on washing machines makes clear just how difficult it will be to deliver on that promise. The move will most likely raise the price of solar panels and washing machines in coming years and yet may not even lead to many more jobs. That outcome might sound paradoxical, but analysts say it’s due to changes underway in both industries well before Mr. Trump took office. Tariffs will not be high enough to create new manufacturing jobs because the cost of production in countries like Malaysia and South Korea will remain significantly lower than in the United States. Also, American factories would probably be highly automated and require far fewer workers. Meanwhile, the higher tariffs — and thus higher prices — for solar cells and panels will reduce demand from residential customers, businesses and utilities. That will hurt American businesses that install panels and produce equipment used in solar systems. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that the tariffs could cost that industry 23,000 jobs. Whirlpool, which sells more washing machines in the United States than any other company, says that the Trump administration’s decision, which will apply tariffs to imports from most countries, will lead to the creation of 200 jobs at a factory in Ohio, in anticipation of increased sales. But foreign appliance manufacturers like Samsung and LG have already built or are building factories for washing machines in the United States. So any advantage Whirlpool might enjoy could fade away as a new Samsung factory in South Carolina and an LG factory under construction in Tennessee begin churning out machines, creating more competition. The Trump administration imposed the tariffs in response to complaints by domestic manufacturers — Suniva and SolarWorld in the solar case and Whirlpool in the washing machine case — that competition from a surge of imports had hurt their businesses. The tariffs on solar products last four years starting at 30 percent, falling to 15 percent in the fourth year. Each year, the first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells imported into the country will be exempt from the tariffs. The washing machine tariffs last three years and start at 20 percent on the first 1.2 million units and 50 percent for the rest, declining to 16 percent and 40 percent in the third year. "
"WASHINGTON — Under fire for using taxpayer money to settle a sexual misconduct complaint from a former aide, Representative Patrick Meehan, Republican of Pennsylvania, said Tuesday that the woman “specifically invited” his intimate communications, and that he was emotionally wounded when she filed a complaint against him. Mr. Meehan denied crossing the line into impropriety, but said in an interview that when the woman told him last year that she had started a relationship with someone outside the office, he “didn’t respond to it as well as I would like to have.” He said he believed his attempt to make amends — a handwritten letter in which he called her “a complete partner to me” — was meant to be a sign of respect. “That I would find later that that was not something that she was comfortable with, really hurts me,” Mr. Meehan said. “This was a person who specifically invited communication with me so that she would be able to have the ability to be there for me.” The New York Times reported that Mr. Meehan, 62, a married father of three, had entered into a confidential agreement to settle the complaint brought by the aide, who is decades his junior. She left the office after filing a complaint alleging that Mr. Meehan became hostile after she rebuffed his romantic overtures, sources familiar with the situation told The Times. On Monday, the House Ethics Committee announced that it had started an investigation into the aide’s accusations and the possibility that Mr. Meehan had “misused official resources” by using funds from his congressional office to settle her complaint.

"As America’s most prominent evangelical, Vice President Mike Pence has courted conservative Christians on behalf of President Trump and borne witness to Mr. Trump as a true “believer,” though some remain skeptical. When Mr. Pence announced his first trip to the Middle East, he initially hoped to draw attention to the persecution of Christians in the region, as well as nudge Israelis and Palestinians toward peace. Things didn’t go as planned. Mr. Pence wrapped up the trip to Israel, Egypt and Jordan on Tuesday, having been rebuffed by top Christian leaders in those countries in protest over Mr. Trump’s decision last month to break with decades of American policy — and recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. It’s still mysterious just how Mr. Trump believes he has advanced the cause of peace, or fortified America’s standing in the world, with that decision. Its costs in terms of American isolation, on the other hand, were evident throughout the trip. Mr. Pence also didn’t meet with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who flew instead to Brussels to ask European leaders for protection from Mr. Trump’s bad decisions. Neither did Mr. Pence sit down with other Palestinian leaders, any Israeli-Arab citizens, or Israeli opposition members. During Mr. Pence’s stops in Amman and Cairo, King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt criticized the Jerusalem decision (although secret tapes reported by The Times suggest the Egyptians acquiesced in Mr. Trump’s choice). One place Mr. Pence did strike an enthusiastic chord was in Parliament in Israel, where a hard-line government is largely hostile to a two-state solution. Members interrupted him with standing ovations. His address was replete with biblical references to Jewish ties to the Holy Land. He referred to God’s promise to the Jews that “he would gather and bring you back to the land which your fathers possessed” and to “the Jewish people’s unbreakable bond to” Jerusalem. "
"WASHINGTON — The bipartisan group of senators who intervened to help end the government shutdown now faces an even more formidable task: freeing the Senate — and perhaps Washington — from its dysfunctional rut. In sidestepping Senate leaders of both parties, members of the group have taken it upon themselves to not only quickly resolve an immigration dispute that has long defied answers, but also prove that the Senate’s frozen legislative gears can still turn. “Part of our biggest challenge is letting the Senate be the Senate,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and one of about two dozen lawmakers who came together to pressure Republican and Democratic leaders to abandon the shutdown. It is a pragmatic group of centrists from both parties — a mix of red-state Democrats like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota; independent-minded conservative Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; a possible presidential prospect in Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota; and a past vice-presidential nominee in Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. It has senior Republican committee leaders such as Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, fellow Tennesseans, as well as a brand new member of the Senate in Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama. Mr. Alexander identified a common thread tying them together in their drive for an immigration answer. “There is a pent-up demand by accomplished senators who want to act like senators,” he said. With a few more Democrats than Republicans among its members and a goal of bringing more from each side into the mix, the group intends to show that it can produce critical mass behind new immigration legislation as well as demonstrate the power of bipartisanship. "
"WASHINGTON — Senate negotiators found themselves back at Square 1 on immigration on Tuesday, as the Senate Democratic leader withdrew the biggest gesture he had made to strike a deal: an offer to fully fund President Trump’s proposed wall at the Mexican border. “The wall offer’s off the table,” the leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, told reporters at the Capitol a day after senators overcame an impasse to end a three-day government shutdown. Mr. Schumer’s decision to renege, made on Sunday but revealed publicly on Tuesday, marked another turn in the fluid debate over how to shield from deportation hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. As part of a deal to end the shutdown, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, promised what he called a “fair and open” immigration debate on the Senate floor. But just when that debate will happen, and what legislation will serve as its starting point, was unclear on Tuesday. Several bipartisan groups were meeting to try to address the fate of the young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, but the withdrawal of Mr. Schumer’s offer brought a fresh round of partisan recriminations that could threaten those nascent talks. “If he wants a solution, that’s a step backward,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.

"WASHINGTON — It is easy to see why President Trump is fond of Mike Pompeo, the director of the C.I.A. Mr. Pompeo proudly plays up his conservative credentials, and he rarely passes up a chance to talk tough — except when it comes to Mr. Trump, of course. In Mr. Pompeo’s telling, the president is a sophisticated consumer of intelligence, and under his leadership, the C.I.A. is being reshaped into a leaner, more flexible organization whose officers have been freed to focus on stealing secrets, eliminating the United States’ enemies and giving Mr. Trump the delicate information he needs to confront the challenges facing the country. “I have seen 25-year intelligence professionals receive briefings,” Mr. Pompeo said on Tuesday. “I will tell you that President Trump is the kind of recipient of our information at the same level as they are.” In a pair of public appearances this week, Mr. Pompeo, 54, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, marked his first year as C.I.A. director — a span that has, by most accounts, been outwardly smoother than many would have guessed. The concerns at the outset were widespread. Mr. Pompeo’s reputation as a partisan bulldog was hardly the typical profile for a role that is intended to be apolitical. And Mr. Trump spent the weeks before taking office attacking the agency, mocking the assessment that Russia meddled in the presidential election and once comparing intelligence officials to Nazis. On his first full day as president, Mr. Trump stood in front of the agency’s memorial wall, which honors officers killed in the line of duty, and bragged about inflated crowd sizes at his inauguration. Yet since then, Mr. Trump has largely spared the C.I.A. the kind of political attacks that he has leveled against the Justice Department and the F.B.I., both of which he has painted as being staffed by disloyal partisans out to undermine his presidency. Some of Mr. Trump’s silence can be credited to Mr. Pompeo, who appears to be pulling off a political balancing act: He has won over officials at America’s premier spy agency, many of whom were deeply offended by Mr. Trump’s attacks, while persuading the president of the C.I.A.’s value and its loyalty.

"Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, will become the first United States senator to give birth while in that office when she delivers her second child this spring, she announced on Tuesday. Ms. Duckworth, who gave birth to her daughter Abigail in November 2014 while serving in the House of Representatives, is already one of only 10 women who have given birth while serving in Congress. Her Senate colleague Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, gave birth to a son during her tenure as a United States representative. “Bryan and I are thrilled that our family is getting a little bit bigger, and Abigail is ecstatic to welcome her baby sister home this spring,” Ms. Duckworth said in a statement that referred to her husband and daughter. “We are all so grateful for the love and support of our friends and family, and I want to thank the wonderful staff at both Northwestern Medicine and GW for everything they’ve done to help us in our decades-long journey to complete our family.” Ms. Duckworth, 49, told The Chicago Sun-Times in an article published on Tuesday that she and her husband tried various fertilization methods before Abigail was conceived through a form of in vitro fertilization. She said she decided to run for the Senate while on maternity leave. "

"The years immediately following the 2008 financial crisis were a golden age of inflation derp, at various levels. There were the Glenn Beck/Ron Paul frothing-at-the-mouth Austrian types predicting hyperinflation just around the corner. But there were also the seemingly respectable monetary “experts,” from Alan Greenspan to Allan Meltzer to John Taylor, who kept predicting high inflation from deficits and/or quantitative easing. It’s not hard to see why they were predicting inflation: there was a huge increase in the monetary base (currency plus bank reserves), which you would expect to cause a lot of inflation – unless, that is, you understood that the game changes when interest rates are near zero, and had studied the experience of Japan. Of course, quite a few economists did understand all that: Ben Bernanke, Olivier Blanchard, and yours truly, among others. And we correctly predicted that the massive rise in the monetary base would have no discernible effect on inflation: OK, so some economists got it wrong. That happens to everyone, unless you’re too cowardly to make any testable predictions at all. But what you’re supposed to do when things don’t play out as you predicted is (a) acknowledge the mistake (b) try to understand what went wrong (c) revise your framework in an attempt to avoid making the same mistake again. I think I can fairly claim to have followed these rules. What’s striking about the economists who predicted runaway inflation in 2009-2011 is that as far as I can tell none of them has even gotten to step (a), acknowledging their mistake. They kept saying the same wrong thing year after year (which is what makes it derp), and even those who eventually stopped saying the same thing never admitted past mistakes. Thus when Bloomberg tried, four years later, to track down economists who signed the infamous open letter to Ben Bernanke insisting that quantitative easing would “debase the dollar,” it couldn’t find a single person to admit that the original warning was wrong.

"After violent protests recently exploded across Iran, President Trump vowed to differentiate himself from President Barack Obama by openly tweeting his support for the demonstrators. It had no effect, though. One reason is that Trump could never send the really killer tweets — the ones that might have gone viral across Iran and rattled the regime. What would those have said? Something like: @realDonaldTrump “America stands with Iranian demonstrators!!! Why are so many from the countryside??? Because Iranian Revolutionary Guards mismanaged Iran’s water supply for decades. Stole all the water for their companies, cronies, pistachio farms and stupid dams!!! And now climate change and droughts are making it all worse, forcing Iranians off their land. Unfair!! Sad!!” The Iran protests were clearly fed by many streams — The Times told a harrowing tale last weekend of how corruption and Ponzi schemes at banks owned by Iran’s clerical regime and its allies had defrauded thousands of savers, and brought some into the streets. But environmental corruption was also a cause of anger. The Islamic regime and the Revolutionary Guards had ripped off the country’s natural wealth the same way they’d ripped off savers’ wealth. And now climate change is amplifying many of the worst impacts. That’s not something an American president who thinks climate change is a hoax can tweet about — but it is a key reason the street demonstrations were particularly intense in regions hard hit by a whirlwind of drought, extreme weather events and reckless water use practices imposed by Iran’s clerical rulers. “When people lose their lands they lose everything, and that means they aren’t scared of anything,” explained Nikahang Kowsar, an Iranian exile geologist, and son of a watershed scientist, who grew up in southern Iran. “The water crisis is real and killing the country today. We are getting less precipitation, and the population is rising. There’s bad agricultural policies and bad water governance. It is like a time bomb.” Officials predict that millions of Iranians could be forced to flee their country before the end of the century. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump asked the man he was considering as temporary F.B.I. director how he had voted in the 2016 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The question was directed to Andrew G. McCabe, the bureau’s deputy director. Mr. Trump abruptly fired the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, in May, and at the time, the president openly discussed the need for any successor to be “loyal,” according to an adviser to the president. The week that Mr. Comey was fired, Mr. McCabe met with Mr. Trump a handful of times, a person familiar with the meetings said. It was at one of those meetings that Mr. Trump asked Mr. McCabe whom he had voted for, another person familiar with the encounters said. Mr. McCabe said he had not voted. The exchange was first reported by The Washington Post. The question was unusually and overtly political for an interview related to a position in the Justice Department, which is supposed to maintain its independence from politics. At their final meeting, Mr. Trump offered Mr. McCabe the job and told him he planned to give him the role of acting director. The president also said that he planned to make an appearance that week at F.B.I. Headquarters to bolster morale. Mr. McCabe told Mr. Trump that it would be a risky move after firing a well-respected director, so the president scuttled the trip, citing scheduling conflicts. For weeks, Mr. Trump and his allies have focused their ire on Mr. McCabe. Mr. McCabe’s wife was a candidate for Virginia State Senate in 2015, and she received donations from the “super PAC” supporting Terry McAuliffe, the state’s governor at the time, who was a longtime ally of Hillary Clinton’s. A White House official confirmed Tuesday night that Mr. Trump had asked the question, saying it was in the context of first asking about Mr. McCabe’s family, which led to a discussion about Mr. McAuliffe and then to how Mr. McCabe had voted. The F.B.I. declined to comment. Mr. Trump has also assailed the independence of the F.B.I., and has described its reputation as being “in Tatters,” a stunning broadside from a sitting president against a law enforcement agency he oversees. Mr. Comey has testified publicly and under oath that Mr. Trump asked for his loyalty in one of their meetings. Mr. Trump has denied the allegation. "
"WASHINGTON — Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, spent the weekend managing the shutdown of the federal government. On Tuesday, he turned his attention back to his secondary job running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency he would probably shut down if he could. In a 1,118 word mission statement that was sent to the bureau’s staff on Tuesday, Mr. Mulvaney, the acting director, outlined a vision for an agency that enforces financial regulations and consumer protections with “humility and prudence” and that will no longer “push the envelope” when it comes to jurisdiction and scope. Mr. Mulvaney insisted that he would not shutter the bureau, if only because doing so would be against the law. “When I arrived at C.F.P.B., I told folks that despite what they might have heard, I had no intention of shutting down the Bureau,” Mr. Mulvaney wrote. “Indeed, the law doesn’t allow that, and as members of the Executive Branch we are charged with faithfully executing the laws.” The consumer bureau, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, has been an ongoing target of Republican lawmakers, who complain that its mandate is too broad, that it has too much power and that its director is unaccountable. The agency is loathed by Republicans because its authority is intended to be independent of the White House and Congress. In the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Mulvaney directly attacked the approach of his predecessor, Richard Cordray, who left late last year. Mr. Cordray, he said, viewed the bureau as an agency of “good guys” fighting “bad guys” who modeled himself as the “new sheriff in town” with a broad mandate to crack down on businesses as he saw fit. Mr. Mulvaney’s missive also incorrectly quotes Mr. Cordray discussing his strategy of “pushing the envelope” in a Politico Magazine story. That remark was made by an anonymous former CFPB official, not Mr. Cordray. "
"DAVOS, Switzerland — By any measure, he made a lot of money, the kid from Queens, maybe not as much as he boasted, but a fortune. And yet never accepted, never respected, he remained on the outside pressing his nose against the window of the club of elites he both revered and resented. So when President Trump arrives in this snowy, mountaintop resort where financial titans mingle with heads of state in an annual saturnalia of capitalism, it may feel like a moment of vindication. Never invited when he was merely a businessman, Mr. Trump will arrive on Thursday as leader of the world’s last superpower, commanding attention if not admiration. Whatever else, he cannot be ignored now. “Part of him will feel the resentment that has long smoldered within and part will revel in the fact that he’s the president and no one else is,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Trump biographer. “Considering his tendency to say or tweet whatever comes to mind, we might expect both Trumps — the testy one and the triumphant one — to appear. We may even see and hear him toggle between the two, uncertain if he’s superior or inferior.” Mr. Trump’s decision to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, something American presidents generally avoid lest they look out of touch hanging out with the jet-setting crowd, sets the stage for one of the most intriguing encounters of his year-old presidency. Not only will he finally crash the party that would not have him, but he will also bring his protectionist, “America First” message to the ground zero of globalization, addressing the very people he has cast as the villains of his political narrative. The president foreshadowed the awkward and perhaps tense visit by slapping tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines just before departing Washington. “I’m going to Davos,” Mr. Trump said after signing the orders. “We’ll be talking about investing in the United States again, for people to come in and spend their money in the good old U.S.A.” Rather than touting the virtues of lowering economic barriers, Mr. Trump will promote the growing American economy and argue for foreign investment.

"The leaders of 21 global aid organizations asked the Trump administration on Wednesday to restore withheld funds to the United Nations agency that helps Palestinians, calling the funding cut a “dangerous and striking departure” from a history of American generosity. In a letter to top administration officials, the groups’ leaders expressed concern that the White House’s decision to withhold more than half of the planned contribution to the agency, if maintained, would disrupt Palestinian access to food, health care, education “and other critical support to vulnerable populations.” The administration announced last week that it was withholding $65 million from a scheduled payment of $125 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which aids more than five million Palestinians in refugee camps across the Middle East. The announcement came after Palestinian leaders had accused the administration of blatantly siding with Israel in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict and dimming prospects for a Palestinian state that would exist side by side with Israel. Administration officials said that restoration of the aid depended partly on the Palestinian aid agency’s making unspecified reforms, and that withholding the funds had not been punitive. Many Palestinians and their supporters disputed that assertion. They pointed to statements by administration officials, including a Jan. 2 Twitter message by President Trump, who complained that “we pay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.” "
"WASHINGTON — American-backed Kurdish militias in northern Syria are detaining hundreds of Islamic State fighters and family members in makeshift camps, raising fears among United States military officials of potentially creating a breeding ground for extremists — repeating a key security mistake of the Iraq war. Despite its concerns, the Trump administration has largely taken a hands-off approach toward the detainees, who come from more than 30 countries and were captured or surrendered after last year’s collapse of Raqqa, the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital. Unlike suspected Islamic State militants seized in neighboring Iraq, largely from the northern city of Mosul and surrounding areas, the detainees being held in the Kurdish region of Syria fall into a legal gray area and face an uncertain long-term fate. Kurdish authorities are meting out justice in ad hoc courts, but the region is still part of Syria, and Kurdish control is not internationally recognized. Some countries like Russia have signaled that they will repatriate their fighters, but many other nations are refusing. The detention of the Islamic State fighters is just one issue the United States is grappling with in its partnership with Syrian Kurds. American troops have fought alongside Kurdish-led militias on battlegrounds against the Islamic State in northeast Syria, and the Pentagon is showing no sign of backing away from them. At the same time, however, Washington is trying to tamp down escalating tensions in Syria between the Kurdish militias and Turkey, a longtime NATO ally that views the Kurds as a terrorist threat. United States Special Operations troops advising the Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces are cataloging fingerprints and other so-called biometrics of many of the estimated 200 to 300 detainees in at least three camps near Raqqa. The American forces also are interrogating the detainees to learn more about foreign fighter networks and threats to their home countries. "
"DAVOS, Switzerland — French President Emmanuel Macron laid claim to the mantle of leader of the free world on Wednesday, with an ambitious speech before a packed assembly at the World Economic Forum. He sought to place France at the center of a mission to revamp global capitalism while spreading its spoils more equitably, forging a mode of commerce centered on innovation, yet bearing protections for workers set back by change. Mr. Macron’s hourlong speech before the annual gathering of the world’s wealthy and powerful in the Swiss Alps came on the same day that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni issued their own forceful speeches toward advancing European integration, while defending the notion of international cooperation. Collectively, they signaled that Europe — only a year ago dismissed as a crippled economic realm fraught with political recrimination — has regained force. Europe’s leaders left no doubt that they aim to channel their newfound economic strength toward advancing the project of European integration first launched in the middle of the last century, seen as an antidote to the brutalities of two world wars. President Trump was not in the room (he is not due to speak here until Friday). But the shadow of his America First policies hung heavily. The three speeches resonated as a broad rebuttal of the doctrine that Mr. Trump has made his own. In contrast to Mr. Trump’s pullback from international trade agreements and his renouncing of the Paris climate accord, the European leaders emphasized their commitment to prosperity through global commerce.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he was willing and eager to be interviewed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, insisting that he has done nothing wrong. “I’m looking forward to it, actually,” Mr. Trump said of talking to Mr. Mueller, answering months of speculation over whether he was willing to submit to questions from the special counsel, who is also believed to be looking into whether the Trump campaign aided Moscow’s effort and whether the president sought to thwart the inquiry itself. “Here’s the story, just so you understand,” Mr. Trump said during an impromptu question-and-answer session with reporters in the West Wing. “There’s been no collusion whatsoever. There’s no obstruction whatsoever, and I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Trump suggested that his efforts to defend himself against damaging allegations had been unfairly misinterpreted as wrongdoing. “You fight back,” he said, and such a response is characterized as, “‘Oh, it’s obstruction.’” The president’s surprise exchange with about 20 reporters served as a reminder of the extent to which Mr. Trump sees the Russia inquiry as simply an invalidation of his electoral victory, and feels a deep sense of bitterness about the narrative surrounding his presidency. His lawyers have been negotiating for weeks with Mr. Mueller’s team about the prospect of having him answer questions in the inquiry, including what topics would be covered. Mr. Trump said last year he would be willing to speak with Mr. Mueller, but he has more recently suggested that should not be necessary because the allegations being examined were baseless. "

"WASHINGTON — A pair of groups supporting President Trump say they raised $30 million last year, then spent tens of thousands of those dollars at the Trump International Hotel here and on payments to a few Trump loyalists like the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and the former Milwaukee County sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., according to new campaign finance reports and news reports. Of the millions raised, at least $1 million came from a coal company that has gained extraordinary access to the Trump administration to push for pro-coal policy changes. The campaign finance reports shed light on a network of groups that were formed to support Mr. Trump, but have spent less than other groups bolstering his agenda, while steering money to the president’s businesses and his most ardent surrogates. One of the groups — a “super PAC” called America First Action — spent nearly $33,000 at the Trump International Hotel, primarily on events for donors, and paid tens of thousands of dollars each to Mr. Lewandowski; Brad Parscale, a digital strategist for Mr. Trump’s campaign; and Katrina Pierson, a campaign spokeswoman. Those figures were revealed in a report filed on Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission, which shows that the group raised $4 million last year. An affiliated nonprofit group, America First Policies, raised $26 million last year, according to a report by Axios. That group is registered under a section of the tax code — 501(c)(4) — that allows it to shield most information about its finances, including the identity of its donors. The America First groups have been viewed as something of an enigma in campaign finance circles. While many of the Republican Party’s traditional elite donors have publicly kept their distance from the groups, the organizations have the blessing of the administration and have projected confidence in their fund-raising.

"SACRAMENTO — When Jerry Brown became the 34th governor of California in 1975, he was a young and impetuous bachelor who slept on a box spring and took pleasure in defying political convention. He was the vanguard of the left, the face and spirit of a new generation of a state that — politically and culturally — was proudly distinct from the rest of the nation. He has been such a fixture ever since that it seems impossible to imagine California without him. Now, as Mr. Brown enters the final 12 months of his second tour as governor, and as he prepares to deliver his final State of the State speech here on Thursday, he has become the face of the old order — admired for his long stewardship, but also seen as a roadblock for some younger Democrats who have impatiently awaited change. This is a decidedly more liberal class of Democrats, on issues ranging from single-payer health care to the impeachment of President Trump, and many of them have long said the time has come for Mr. Brown’s generation to step aside. “He is a middle-of-the-road sort of guy and if I’m being perfectly honest, he is not completely in touch with the way the majority of folks in California feel,” said Kimberly Ellis, a Democratic leader from the Bay Area who lost a fight last year to lead the state Democratic Party. “In many ways, with respect to single-payer and other issues, he and others play the safe role — the conservative role.” Now, with a spirited race to succeed him underway, the talk has turned to Mr. Brown’s next chapter and the resilience of the imprint he has left on a state with which he has been identified for so long. After more than 45 years, Mr. Brown, 79, is entering what he says are his final months in public life. He has been governor (twice), attorney general, mayor of Oakland, secretary of state, state Democratic Party chairman, and a candidate for president (three times). Mr. Brown is barred by term limits from running yet again. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he is open to a path to citizenship after 10 to 12 years for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, days after rejecting a bipartisan plan with that as its centerpiece. Mr. Trump once again seemed to undercut his administration’s message, telling reporters at the White House that he would allow the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, to “morph into” citizens over a period of time. The reporters had gathered for a briefing from a senior official detailing the administration’s plans to stick to a restrictive immigration agenda when the president dropped in unprompted, shortly before departing for Davos, Switzerland, pre-empting the official. “Over a period of 10 to 12 years,” Mr. Trump said, “somebody does a great job, they work hard — that gives incentive to do a great job. Whatever they’re doing, if they do a great job, I think it’s a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen.” In September, Mr. Trump ended an Obama-era program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, saying it was an illegal assertion of executive authority by his predecessor. But even as Mr. Trump’s actions threatened nearly 700,000 young immigrants with deportation when the program expires March 5, he has urged Congress to find a permanent solution that could allow them to live and work in the country legally. In addition to suggesting a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers, Mr. Trump said that he would request $25 billion to build a wall along the United States border with Mexico, though he said he would build it “way under budget.” He also said that his plan would include a request for $5 billion for additional security measures along the border.

"President Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports of solar panels and components is the opening salvo of his America First campaign to protect domestic manufacturers from Chinese competition. The stakes are high: Solar is the world’s fastest-growing energy industry, attracting over $160 billion in investment in 2017. Yet these tariffs will do little to make American manufacturers competitive with dominant Chinese ones. Instead, they might actually discourage domestic investments in innovation, crucial to an American solar manufacturing revival. On top of this, the tariffs will cause collateral damage by slowing down the installation of solar panels in the United States, destroying more jobs than they create, and provoking trade disputes and retaliation. The United States enacted tariffs on solar imports from China in 2012 (they were expanded to include Taiwan in 2014), when the Obama administration concluded that China had lavished generous subsidies on its domestic manufacturers, which dumped below-cost solar panels on global markets. But by that point, established manufacturers as well as Silicon Valley start-ups developing solar technologies had already been washed away by a flood of cheap Chinese panels based on conventional silicon technology. American manufacturers’ share of global solar-components production had plunged below 5 percent by 2011, down from over a quarter a decade earlier. What remained after the carnage was a hollowed-out American industry in no shape to compete with the huge scale of Asian producers. Against this backdrop, the Trump administration hopes to breathe new life into the enfeebled domestic solar industry with tariffs of 30 percent on solar imports from nearly every country. This approach comes at the behest of two manufacturers, which complained that they couldn’t compete with cheap solar panel imports. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump is arriving at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to explain his “America First” approach at a moment when the world is moving ahead with a trade agenda that no longer revolves around the United States. The world marked a turning point in global trade on Tuesday, when 11 countries agreed to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, announcing they had finalized the pact and expected to sign a deal on March 8 in Chile. It was a remarkable moment for a beleaguered agreement that was conceived and constructed by the United States, then abandoned by Washington when Mr. Trump took office last year. As the world’s largest economy and architect of many international organizations and treaties, the United States remains an indispensable partner. But as the global economy gains strength, Europe and countries including Japan and China are forging ahead with deals that do not include the United States. Thirty-five new bilateral and regional trade pacts are under consideration around the world, according to the World Trade Organization. The United States is party to just one of them, with the European Union, and that negotiation has gone dormant. The United States is also threatening to withdraw from one of its existing multilateral agreements — the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada — if it cannot be renegotiated in the United States’ favor. “Maybe there was some sort of presumption on the part of the president and his team that if the U.S. said stop, this process would come to a halt,” said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and an economist in the George W. Bush administration. “What this shows is that’s not true. The world just moves on without us.” In July, Japan signed a wide-ranging new trade deal with the European Union — a step the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, referred to as hoisting “the flag of free trade high amidst protectionist trends.” The European Union pushed ahead with a major update to its agreement with Mexico, while China pursued a pan-Asian agreement, among other deals.

"WASHINGTON — He boasted about it at a banquet given by the Communist president of Vietnam. He crowed about it during a pep rally for anti-abortion marchers in the Rose Garden. He even slipped it into his Thanksgiving Day greeting to American troops serving abroad. No president has taken more delight, or claimed more credit, for the roaring stock market than Donald J. Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average has become for him what the Rasmussen Poll was during the 2016 presidential election: a daily source of validation. “Had the other side gotten in, the market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was,” Mr. Trump told a gathering of women at the White House last week, diplomatically avoiding the name Hillary Clinton. “Remember that.” Now, though, Mr. Trump’s fixation with Wall Street is colliding with one of his most cherished legislative projects — a more protectionist trade policy — and it is not clear which one will win. Mr. Trump, for example, has repeatedly threatened to pull the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Korea Free Trade Agreement. But two top economic advisers, Gary D. Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have warned him that withdrawing from those deals would hurt the stock market, several officials said. Tellingly, those threats have receded. On Wednesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, expressed optimism that the United States would be able to renegotiate the deal with Canada and Mexico.

"Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas was narrowly confirmed to an ambassadorship on Wednesday after a six-month wait that left Kansans increasingly confused about who was in charge of their state. The Senate split 49-49 along party lines on the nomination of Mr. Brownback, a Republican who has grown unpopular in Kansas, to be ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote. Many religious leaders praised Mr. Brownback’s confirmation, and said he could use his political experience to help religious minorities, including oppressed Christian and Yazidi communities in the Middle East. “He has been a consistent, vocal, competent and impassioned advocate for these issues,” said the Rev. Johnnie Moore, a Southern Baptist minister who served on the evangelical advisory board for President Trump’s campaign. “It was all very logical to us that he would be the nominee, and we were thrilled by it.” Many Democrats and gay rights advocates opposed the nomination of Mr. Brownback, who ended anti-discrimination protections for gay state workers in 2015. Mr. Brownback, who served seven years as governor after stints in both chambers of Congress, drew national attention to Kansas after he oversaw the largest income tax cuts in state history. But the missed revenue forecasts and wholesale cuts to state services that followed led many legislative Republicans to buck Mr. Brownback and undo his signature policy last year. Mr. Brownback, whose term would have ended next January, was passed over for more prominent jobs in the Trump administration. When he was nominated for the religious freedom ambassadorship last summer, many expected a swift confirmation. Mr. Brownback began handing off tasks to Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer after he was nominated, but month after awkward month passed in Topeka without a confirmation vote. Mr. Trump had to renominate Mr. Brownback this month after the full Senate declined to vote last year. “Our state’s been in kind of a leadership vacuum of chaos,” said Jim Ward, the Democratic leader in the Kansas House of Representatives and a candidate for governor. “It’s really slowed down and pretty much stopped all progress on any kind of policy because you’ve got two different guys acting like the governor.” Mr. Brownback announced on Thursday that he will resign as governor next week, on Wednesday. “Wherever my new duties may take me, my Kansas values and experience will always travel with me,” he wrote in his resignation letter. Mr. Colyer, a Republican and a plastic surgeon from suburban Kansas City, will assume the governorship. Mr. Colyer, who is seeking a full term as governor in the election this year, will face several challengers in the Republican primary. "

"WASHINGTON — Simmering tensions between Turkey and the United States spilled into the open on Wednesday as President Trump warned President Recep Tayyip Erdogan against the growing risk of conflict between the two nations. The Turkish president, for his part, demanded that the United States end its support for Kurdish militias. The two men, both populists and unapologetic nationalists, spoke by telephone as Turkish forces attacked Kurdish militias in Syria. American officials said they were increasingly uneasy that the campaign against the Islamic State would be seriously undermined by the newest battlefront in a country that has been ravaged by war for nearly seven years. Mr. Trump “urged Turkey to exercise caution and to avoid any actions that might risk conflict between Turkish and American forces,” the White House said in a description of the call. “He reiterated that both nations must focus all parties on the shared goal of achieving the lasting defeat of ISIS,” or the Islamic State. His tough tone with Mr. Erdogan was an abrupt reversal from a White House briefing just a day earlier, where senior administration officials suggested that the United States would side with Turkey, a NATO ally, in disputes with Kurdish forces that have fought the Islamic State with direct support from Washington. Turkey has fought for decades against Kurdish insurgent groups that Ankara considers terrorist threats. Kurds in the region — most notably in Turkey, Iraq and Syria — dream of creating an independent state even as they seek greater political and cultural rights. In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Erdogan said there was no difference between the Islamic State and Kurdish militias, and questioned “the humanity of those who accuse Turkey of being an invader and support an organization that has the blood of tens of thousands of innocent children, women, elderly people and innocents on its hands.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department warned the House Intelligence Committee chairman on Wednesday that it was “extraordinarily reckless” for Republicans to push to release a committee memo that draws on classified information to portray the origins of the Russian investigation as scandalous. In a letter to Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the committee, Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, stressed that the committee had refused to show the memo to the F.B.I. “We do not understand why the committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the intelligence community,” Mr. Boyd wrote. The rebuke came as Democrats announced that they had drafted their own classified memo based on the same underlying materials to rebut Mr. Nunes. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, called the Republicans’ document extraordinarily misleading. The moves to curb Mr. Nunes by the Democrats as well as by Mr. Boyd, a Trump administration appointee, came during sharply escalating partisan conflict over the Russia investigation. Republicans and conservative commentators have increasingly argued that the investigation derives from a conspiracy by biased law enforcement officials seeking to sabotage President Trump. Democrats, in turn, have accused Republicans of constructing a false narrative in an attempt to undermine the inquiry on behalf of Mr. Trump. Adding to the rising turbulence, Republicans are also pointing with alarm to newly revealed texts between two F.B.I. officials who were once part of Mr. Mueller’s team, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Mr. Mueller removed Mr. Strzok from his team over the summer after learning that the two had exchanged texts expressing a dislike of Mr. Trump. "
"I don’t know if you heard, but this week a boy with a handgun killed two of his fellow students at a high school in Kentucky. “It is unbelievable that this would happen in a small, close-knit community like Marshall County,” said the governor, Matt Bevin. Actually, that part is completely believable. Given that another school shooting this week was in Italy, Tex., population under 2,000. And that two months ago, 25 people were shot to death while attending church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., population 362. It’s about guns, not population density. And it is a huge story. But I know, people, you have been beating your heads against the wall about this issue forever, and a certain numbness creeps in. “You had the worst mass shooting in the country in Las Vegas, followed by a really horrific event in a church. People just get worn out,” said Mark Kelly, who co-founded a gun-safety organization with his wife, then-Representative Gabby Giffords, after she was shot in the head while meeting with her constituents. Donald Trump — who yelled about “carnage” in big cities during his inauguration speech — has said not a word about the Kentucky shooting except to tweet his “thoughts and prayers.” (Even that, commenters noted, came nearly 24 hours after the prime minister of Canada sent his sympathies.) It is highly unlikely this lack of focus was due to weariness. “You’ve got to wonder,” Kelly said in a phone interview, whether the president would have had a more intense reaction if the news reports suggested “the shooter was of a different ethnicity.” True that. During his government-shutdown-immigration rants, Trump kept pointing out that the man who killed eight people with a truck in Manhattan had come to the country through a visa lottery system. That happened on Oct. 31. Since that time, 73 people have been killed in mass shootings in this country. But about gun regulation we have not heard a presidential peep. "
"FRANKFURT — Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, directed unusually sharp criticism at Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, on Thursday, effectively accusing Mr. Mnuchin of violating agreements among nations against starting currency wars. Mr. Draghi, speaking at a news conference here, said he objected to “the use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn’t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.” He then quoted from an agreement reached in Washington in October under which countries promised to “refrain from competitive devaluations.” Mr. Draghi did not mention Mr. Mnuchin by name, but he was clearly referring to the Treasury secretary’s remarks on Wednesday at a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland, that a weaker dollar was good for United States trade. The comment was interpreted as an effort to talk down the dollar, which would breach the international nonaggression pact on currency rates. On Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin told reporters in Davos that his comment had been misunderstood. “I thought it was actually balanced and consistent with what I’ve said before,” he said, “which is we’re not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term. It’s a very, very liquid market and we believe in free currencies. And that there’s both advantages and disadvantages of where the dollar is in the short term.” (After arriving in Davos, President Trump said during an interview that he wanted “to see a strong dollar” and that Mr. Mnuchin’s remarks had been misinterpreted.) Central bankers usually refrain from rhetorical fisticuffs with government officials, but Mr. Mnuchin’s initial remark arrived at a sensitive time for the eurozone. Europe’s economy is performing better than anyone had expected it would be just a few months ago. But the growth has brought some unwelcome side effects. In particular, the euro has reached a three-year high against the dollar as investors anticipate the European Central Bank dialing back its economic stimulus efforts sooner than previously expected, which would mean higher interest on the euro.

"Don Buchwald — or “superagent Don Buchwald,” as he is known to listeners of “The Howard Stern Show” — was giving a nostalgic tour of the Friars Club on a Thursday night last month. On the third floor of the club, housed in a 1909 German Renaissance mansion in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Buchwald looked around the Ed Sullivan Room, its paneled walls painted white and minimally decorated with head shots of people such as Carol Burnett and Steve Allen. This is the room Mr. Buchwald used in the 1970s as a makeshift office to meet with clients. He strolled next into the William B. Williams Room, named for a radio disc jockey who coined the “Chairman of the Board” nickname for Frank Sinatra and who hosted the “Make Believe Ballroom” program. Mr. Williams was one of Mr. Buchwald’s clients. So too were Tony Curtis, Kim Novak and José Ferrer. “The Tony Curtis story I can’t tell you because it’s kind of smutty,” he said. To listeners of Mr. Stern’s radio show, Mr. Buchwald, 80, long ago emerged as something of an Oz figure: referred to often, heard from rarely. And he prefers it that way. “I’m not a particularly boastful person,” said Mr. Buchwald, who is the kind of guy who wears a fedora and tips his head as he ducks into the back seat of his driven Mercedes. But he wants to publicize a recent development at his firm, Don Buchwald & Associates, which has changed its name to Buchwald. Mr. Buchwald’s daughter, Julia, is expanding the agency’s Los Angeles practice, including its branding and digital media departments. The firm consists of about 50 agents, and its marquee clients include Kathleen Turner, Ralph Macchio and Ali MacGraw. Mr. Stern is the only client whom Mr. Buchwald personally represents — in 2015 he secured him a deal with Sirius XM satellite radio that is estimated to be worth some $90 million a year. He also serves as Mr. Stern’ s de facto manager and publicist. Lloyd Braun, an entertainment industry entrepreneur and executive who has known Mr. Buchwald for 30 years, called negotiating on the same side of a deal with him “a joy.” Less so when negotiating against Mr. Buchwald. “There is a nightmare quality to it. Because you’re only going to do so well. If you want to do better than that, you’re probably going to have to grovel,” Mr. Braun said. "
"WASHINGTON — Nearly $800 million worth of fentanyl pills were illegally sold to online customers in the United States over two years by Chinese distributors who took advantage of internet anonymity and an explosive growth in e-commerce, according to a Senate report released on Wednesday. A yearlong Senate investigation found that American buyers of the illegal drugs lived mostly in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. The Chinese sellers primarily used Bitcoin, the digital currency, as their preferred method of payment and shipped the drugs through other countries to reduce the risk of the opioids being seized by customs officials, Senate investigators said. The 104-page bipartisan report was produced by the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s investigations arm. It was requested by Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the panel’s chairman, and Tom Carper of Delaware, the committee’s top Democrat. They will discuss the report’s findings in a hearing set for Thursday and are expected to press law enforcement and Postal Service officials for details on plans to combat the growing opioid shipments. China has a large pharmaceutical industry and hosts thousands of illegal labs that manufacture counterfeit and illicit drugs, Senate investigators said. The country has long been identified by American officials as the source of much of the illegal opioids flowing into the United States. The report, Senate investigators say, shows how easy it is for Americans to buy the drugs online, and why officials at the post office and Customs and Border Protection has struggled to track and stop the shipments. The Senate investigators said drugs traffickers are exploiting a loophole in the international mail system to send hundreds of pounds of deadly opioids into the United States each year. "

Or maybe you didn’t vote for me, because your wives, if you had voted for me, they’d withhold sex. But, when I won, in your hearts, you were very happy. And now you’re all so much richer, and your wives, girlfriends, boyfriends, whatever — I’m a very tolerant person — they aren’t withholding, probably. Am I right? I’m right.

As I said, you’re all doing very, very well. The markets are up, up, up, like never before. Seven, eight trillion dollars in market cap since Trump was elected.

"BOBTOWN, Pa. — When Nic Zmija applied for a job at the 4 West coal mine three years ago, he was tantalized by a fat raise and a secure future. Once hired, he was told that someday even his two young sons had jobs waiting for them. “It all sounded good,” Mr. Zmija recalled with a tight smile while sitting at his kitchen table the other day. “They said my kids would be able to retire here.” But right after New Year’s, management announced that the mine would have to close, leaving 370 workers scrambling to find new jobs. The Zmija family must now prepare to move in search of the next coal job. The fateful turn of events in Appalachian mining towns like Bobtown, isolated between craggy bluffs and wooded hills 70 miles south of Pittsburgh, illustrates the seemingly relentless downturn of the coal industry. While President Trump has offered some regulatory relief to the industry, market forces still dictate a gloomy future — one largely shaped by the glut of cheap natural gas yielded by the drilling boom in shale fields near here and across much of the nation. As aging coal-fired power plants are shut — roughly 20 of 380 have closed or are in the process of shutting since Mr. Trump took office — coal’s share of the nation’s power mix has plummeted from nearly half in 2008 to roughly a third today.

"A number of women — including you, as the interim replacement for Charlie Rose on PBS — have taken over positions of men who were fired over sexual-abuse accusations. Are you surprised at the number of men in media who have been implicated? Of course I’m surprised, especially when it’s people you know and you’ve worked with, and then this kind of thing comes to light. But on the other hand, the patriarchy has dominated for thousands of years, and people see it as their God-given right. It’s not just sexual harassment or abuse or all the other sexual issues — it’s everything. According to the I.M.F., when women are equally represented in all aspects of economy and business, it can cause national G.D.P.s to rise rapidly. In the United States, having equal numbers of women in the work force would raise America’s G.D.P. by five percentage points. In India, by 27 percentage points. If people can’t be persuaded to see a woman’s right to control her own body as a moral issue, it’s most definitely an economic one. There has been some hand-wringing about the fired men: that a mass of male talent is departing the industry. Do you agree? That pisses me off. These talented men are suppressing talented women! You cannot put a figure on the number of young women who have been squelched or run out of Dodge because they haven’t been able to tolerate it. What was it like studying how other cultures deal with sex for “Sex and Love Around the World” while there’s this crisis back in the United States? I set out to talk to people about their sense of empowerment, of agency over their own bodies, feelings, futures, marriages, their ability to be free in their own society, how much control they have over their sexuality. It just so happens that it dovetailed with this evidence that many people in the West have less control over that than we would like to imagine. I have to admit, watching it felt like a departure from the reporting we’ve seen from you in the past. In asking people questions about sex, you inadvertently kind of reveal what you think about sex. I hope people will not be shocked. One thing I found: Everywhere we went, everybody had the same questions. You realize that we’re all the same. "
"TRUMPOCRACY
The Corruption of the American Republic
By David Frum
301 pp. HarperCollins. $25.99. Donald Trump is the oddest president America has ever elected. He lived in a gilded tower on New York’s Fifth Avenue but nevertheless became the voice of the left-behind. He made his public reputation as a reality-TV star but nevertheless defeated one of the most experienced politicians in the land. Trump has done so many extraordinary things in his first year in office, from tweeting about nuclear war to conducting public business in sight of paying guests in a resort he owns, it’s easy to forget that, unless impeachment intervenes, he still has another three years — and perhaps seven — to go. Trump’s election has set off a furious competition among America’s pundits to explain what is going on: The most depressing political story of our time is also the most exciting. David Frum has usually been at or near the front of the pundit pack with a succession of articles in The Atlantic, where he is a senior editor. Most commentators are dyed-in-the-wool liberals who exhausted the language of fulmination during George W. Bush’s presidency. Frum worked for Bush and even had a hand in writing his “axis of evil” speech. Most commentators regard conservative America as an alien land inhabited by monsters. Frum has been writing sharp but sympathetic books on that land since his first, “Dead Right,” on the weaknesses of Reaganism, in 1994. The central theme in Frum’s excellent new book, “Trumpocracy,” which draws on his Atlantic articles, is what Trump’s career tells us about the deeper structural problems of America in general, and conservative America in particular. Frum argues that Trump’s greatest talent — his genius really — is spotting and exploiting weaknesses. The Republican establishment spent $100 million to put the crown on Prince Jeb Bush’s head. Trump incinerated Bush (and all that cash) with his gibe about “low energy.” He then proceeded to incinerate “little” Marco Rubio and “lyin’” Ted Cruz. Trump’s campaign against Hillary Clinton was in some ways a model of how not to run campaigns — he lurched from crisis to crisis and never bothered to enumerate any detailed policies. But he understood her great limitation: that she represented the nexus between meritocracy and plutocracy, indebted to Big Money and divorced from millions of heartland Americans. Trump’s political operatics worked because he understood deeper weaknesses in American society. The white working class is suffering from two great hammer blows. The first is to its economic well-being: A group that thrived during the golden years of the 1950s and 1960s has seen its incomes stagnate and its job security disappear. Great swaths of white America now suffer from maladies that are all too familiar to black America: broken homes, drug addiction, listlessness, early death. The second hammer blow is to its psychological well-being: Even as their economic position has declined, members of the white working class — particularly white working-class men — have seen themselves denounced, often by people who spend more on college education in one year than they earn shoveling dirt, as agents of privilege and oppression. What better way to respond to being defined as a problem than to vote for a man who promises to punch back? Trump grasped that America is suffering from an epistemological weakness as well as economic ones: The line between truth and falsehood is becoming dangerously blurred. Again, America’s knowledge elite is partly responsible for this: Armies of postmodern academics had prepared the way for Trump by arguing that truth is a construct of the power elite. But the biggest culprit is technological progress. Digitalization is not only creating a deafening cacophony of voices. It is also making it harder to finance real journalism while simultaneously making it easier to distribute tripe. "

"Near the end of Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, North Korea undertook an extraordinary gamble against the United States, attacking and capturing a Navy spy ship, the Pueblo. Six gunboats and two jets pounced on the Pueblo off North Korea’s rugged eastern coast as it tried to pinpoint radar and other military installations. One American sailor died in the Jan. 23, 1968, attack; 82 others were imprisoned. The unexpected assault on the surveillance ship 50 years ago this week set off an international crisis that tested Johnson’s nerves and brought the United States closer to conflict with North Korea than at any time since the Korean War erupted in 1950. In Washington, North Korea’s action precipitated cries for vengeance. “There can be only one answer for America — retaliation, retaliation, retaliation!” bellowed L. Mendel Rivers, the South Carolina Democrat who led the House Armed Services Committee. But the president, his hands full with the Vietnam War, didn’t give in to pressure to use force. The last thing he wanted was a second war in Asia. Instead, he pursued 11 months of frustrating but ultimately successful diplomacy. In the end the 82 American captives came home alive. A half-century on, Johnson’s patience and measured responses in the face of extreme incitement by the North Koreans offer lessons for American policymakers as they confront a far more dangerous North Korea, now armed with nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.

"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • The fallout from the Presidents Club dinner is growing. • An awkward dinner shared by Travis Kalanick and Dara Khosrowshahi at the World Economic Forum. • Qualcomm’s big fine by the E.U. • Tech giants’ struggles in Washington. • The fight atop Och-Ziff. • Katerra, a construction start-up, wins the backing of the SoftBank Vision Fund. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The Presidents Club dinner was a little-known charity event held at the posh Dorchester Hotel until yesterday, when the FT published a scathing investigation into the all-male-attendee event. What the news outlet discovered from its undercover reporting was what it described as a bacchanalia filled with drinking — and the groping of women hostesses. From the article by Madison Marriage, who said she, while working undercover, had been harassed: Here’s what Anne Milton, an education minister, said of the event in a session of Parliament today: The responses • The Presidents Club said that it would not host any more events. • WPP, which had bought a table at the event over the years, said early today that it had ended its association with the event. • An organizer of the event, the businessman David Meller, has stepped down from a nonexecutive chairman position at the Department of Education. • British lawmakers demanded that companies that had attended the event publish their employee gender ratios quickly.

"HAVANA — “Being here is like heaven,” the composer and musician David Amram said after watching the singer Daymé Arocena light up the crowd at the Casa de la Cultura here on Friday. “Like getting a second chance at life, and most people don’t even get a first chance.” Mr. Amram, who first visited Cuba in 1977, returned last week for the 33rd International Jazz Plaza Festival, a six-day event that drew Cuban jazz veterans like Chucho Valdés and the Orquesta Aragón, as well as rising stars like Ms. Arocena and Yissy García. Despite tightened restrictions on travel to Cuba from the United States, the festival relied heavily on American performers, including Joe Lovano, whose first trip to Cuba was in 1986, and Randy Weston and Dee Dee Bridgewater, who were visiting for the first time. However this year’s event took place under a cloud of renewed uncertainty for many Cuban musicians. Since the Trump administration’s withdrawal of diplomats from Havana in September, the United States Embassy here has stopped processing visa applications from Cubans, who have taken to traveling to a third country to apply for visas to the States. But visiting musicians like Mr. Amram and Ms. Bridgewater spoke of their role as cultural ambassadors who could touch hearts in spite of political borders. “My being here is my way of saying, yes, Cuba, yes, you all amazing musicians, I stand with you,” Ms. Bridgewater said at a news conference, raising her fist in solidarity. “I am your sister in music and that is all I care about.” Ms. Bridgewater opened her performance at the Teatro Nacional de Cuba with Mongo Santamaría’s “Afro Blue,” the title track from her 1974 debut album. She described her presence at the festival as “an extension of Dizzy Gillespie’s love.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, a few words on road safety: What portion of Americans killed in vehicle crashes are not wearing seatbelts? I was stunned by the answer when I saw it yesterday. It has hovered between 48 percent and 51 percent in each of the past five years. For many people, a seatbelt has become second nature. They can’t imagine traveling without one — or even allowing someone riding in their car to do so. But lack of seatbelt use remains a major public-health problem in this country. About 15 percent of American drivers don’t wear one, compared with less than 5 percent in several European countries. That’s one reason the United States now has the most dangerous roads in the industrialized world, as I wrote in a recent column. Vehicle deaths here have also risen significantly in the last few years, after decades of decline. This is a largely solvable problem — as every other affluent country is proving. Not only that, but it’s a problem that doesn’t require action from the often dysfunctional federal government. It’s mostly a state issue. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Across Los Angeles, they sleep in tents, under tarps or out in the open air, and their numbers are growing. Last year the population of homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles increased 23 percent, and officials believe the numbers have continued to rise. This week the city will start to find out just how much. Starting Tuesday night in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and San Gabriel Valleys, thousands of volunteers fanned out to neighborhoods to count the homeless, an annual three-day exercise that in recent years has confirmed an alarming crisis in Los Angeles County. The count, along with demographic surveys, will help policymakers decide how to spend public money: $355 million per year raised by Los Angeles county from a special sales tax, and a $1.2 billion city bond issue to build housing for the homeless. Once mostly associated with Skid Row, the vast tent encampment in downtown Los Angeles, the homeless are now spread out across the city, setting up tents under highway overpasses and moving into affluent neighborhoods like Bel-Air, where a wildfire that threatened the area’s mega-mansions was sparked last year by a cooking fire at a homeless encampment. As the homeless population has grown, the old stereotypes — of single men, mentally ill or addicted — have been upended. Now the crisis, not just in Los Angeles but across California, is closely connected with another of state’s challenges: an overheated housing market. Many of those who have recently fallen into homelessness have jobs, but have been pushed to the streets by skyrocketing rents. “I think the causes are pretty clear and explicit,” said Peter Lynn, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. “Los Angeles is absolutely at the center of a crisis of housing affordability.” "
"ROME — The serpent in the Garden of Eden hissed the first fake news to Eve and it all went downhill from there, Pope Francis wrote in a major document about the phenomenon of fake news released on Wednesday. “We need to unmask what could be called the ‘snake-tactics’ used by those who disguise themselves in order to strike at any time and place,” the pope wrote in a message ahead of what the church has designated as its World Day of Social Communications, in May. Arguing that the “crafty” serpent’s effective disinformation campaign to get Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge “began the tragic history of human sin,” he added, “I would like to contribute to our shared commitment to stemming the spread of fake news.” Pope Francis has worn many hats since his election in 2013 — Vatican reformer; global advocate for refugees, the poor, and world peace; and, more recently, defender of bishops accused of covering up for pedophile priests. But in a varyingly sophisticated, spiritual and questionable analysis of the fake news epidemic, the 81-year-old pontiff tried on the cap of contemporary media critic to address an issue that has wreaked havoc and undermined democracies from the United States to Europe and beyond. In doing so, he offered a largely cleareyed assessment of the problem, its social impact, and the responsibility of social media giants and journalists. And he called on news consumers to break out of their comfortable echo chambers and cushy news feeds by seeking out different points of view. "
"Frank Bruni, a Times Op-Ed columnist, hosted an online conversation with Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor and the managing director of Bain Capital Double Impact, and Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist most recently with the Doug Jones Senate campaign in Alabama, about the 2018 midterm elections and the challenges and opportunities they present for Democrats. FRANK BRUNI: Many Democratic activists are seething about their senators’ votes to reopen the federal government without any guarantee of a deal on Dreamers. Strategists and pundits of all stripes believe that the Democrats handled this badly and are doing an ace job of jeopardizing their likely midterm election gains and their chances of retaking at least one chamber of Congress. How concerned or worried are you about what just happened on Capitol Hill? DEVAL PATRICK: Frustrated but not that concerned. I hate government shutdowns. I’m not that focused on tactics anyway, so much as I am on the convictions at stake. To me, there are two. First, a great country doesn’t intentionally hurt innocent people. That’s what we’re doing by throwing out the Dreamers. And everybody knows it. Second, the Congress needs to govern. We need a real budget, preferably a multiyear one so people can plan and make progress, not another temporary stopgap measure. JOE TRIPPI: No one wants a government shutdown — but no one wants to continue kicking the can down the road while Dreamers are living with uncertainty and being deported, and the military and domestic programs have no ability to plan. PATRICK: Democrats have given Republicans yet another chance. What happens next will tell us all whether we can depend on Republican congressional leadership and the president not only to keep their word but also to govern. "
"Nigerian death rites can be quite elaborate — even after a funeral, there is often a “second burial” with days of lavish celebration to ease the deceased person’s journey to the afterlife. Ngozi Anyanwu knows this because she’s heard about it from her mother and father, who traveled back to Nigeria to bury their own parents. And she knows that, when the time comes, she will have to do the same for her father, who has spent his entire adult life in the United States, but still expects to be buried in the country where he was born. But what does Ms. Anyanwu, a 35-year-old performer and playwright born in Trenton and raised in Bucks County, Pa., know about Nigerian burial customs? That question, and the puzzle of what it means to be simultaneously connected to and disconnected from the country of one’s family, prompted Ms. Anyanwu to write “The Homecoming Queen,” a new play that opened Monday at the Atlantic Theater Company, an Off Broadway nonprofit. The poignant drama is about a Nigerian-born American novelist who is confronted by her own ambivalent feelings about home and homeland when she returns to visit her dying father. The play is the latest indicator of an emerging trend: American playwrights who are the daughters of immigrants from Africa. Ms. Anyanwu is the fourth female playwright born to African immigrants to have a play produced by a prestigious New York theater in the last two years, and all of the shows have been critical successes.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration must give lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union 72 hours notice before transferring a United States citizen imprisoned in Iraq as an enemy combatant for more than four months, a federal judge has ruled. The man, whose name has not been released, was captured by a Syrian militia in September and turned over to American forces as a suspected Islamic State fighter, raising a dilemma about what to do with him. He is said to have been born in the United States to visiting Saudi parents, making him an American citizen, but raised in Saudi Arabia, where he apparently also is a citizen. After law enforcement officials concluded that they had insufficient courtroom-admissible evidence to bring criminal charges against the man, Trump administration officials in December decided to try to transfer him to Saudi custody, according to officials familiar with deliberations. But the eight-page ruling late on Tuesday by the judge, Tanya Chutkan of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, ensures that if such a diplomatic deal is reached, the man could fight his transfer in court. “Absent a showing that the government — for international relations reasons or otherwise — needs to transfer petitioner now, the court does not find that the government’s interests outweigh the petitioner’s right to challenge his detention without fear of his transfer to another country,” she wrote. The Justice Department had argued that there was no legal basis for inhibiting the government’s ability to release the detainee from American custody by transferring him to the custody of another country, should a diplomatic deal be reached. The government has not publicly confirmed that it is talking to Saudi Arabia, specifically, about a transfer. "
"DAVOS, Switzerland — One could get the feeling that President Trump might not be set for a rousing welcome when he arrives in this Swiss Alps resort this week to address the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum. The forum, a pilgrimage for the wealthy and powerful, is an unabashed champion of globalization. It advocates ceaselessly for the notion that every problem — from climate change to joblessness to terrorism to cybersecurity — requires international cooperation and multilateral solutions. Mr. Trump’s derisive rejection of such ideas as the woolly-headed notions of the global elite is central to his identity. He used his inaugural address a year ago to declare the dawning of a new “America First” era. He has since pulled the United States out of a sprawling Pacific trade deal, while renouncing American participation in the Paris climate accord. He has spurned the modern sensitivities to race and gender. While many here are poised to recoil at Mr. Trump’s arrival — diplomats, heads of state and members of human rights organizations — much of the moneyed elite who pay the bills for many Davos festivities are willing to overlook what they portray as the American president’s rhetorical foibles in favor of focusing on the additional wealth he has delivered to their coffers. Among banking chiefs, hedge fund managers, private equity overseers and others who make their living managing vast piles of money, Mr. Trump is the rare politician who has made good on his words, having slashed corporate taxes and ditched regulations they view as anti-business. However they publicly greet Mr. Trump, they are happy with key ways in which he has wielded his power. “If you take away Trump’s Twitter ridiculousness, it’s actually been a pretty good year for the business community,” said Raymond Nolte, a managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that manages more than $10.7 billion in assets. “He’s basically accomplished major reform.” "
"Hurrah! For the second year running, the Oscars won’t be so white. Sure, the nominations on Tuesday had some lamentable omissions — Dee Rees for best director, for one, along with her movie “Mudbound.” But one of its stars, Mary J. Blige, got two nominations, and Jordan Peele got three, with “Get Out,” his evisceration of smug white liberalism, landing on the best picture list. To quote Tiffany Haddish, as she stumbled over the “Get Out” star Daniel Kaluuya’s name while announcing the nominees, “Kallelujah!” Also, wahoo, the Oscars won’t be so male. Greta Gerwig became only the fifth woman to ever get a directing nomination, for “Lady Bird,” Rachel Morrison became the first female Oscar-nominated cinematographer, for “Mudbound,” and four of the nine best picture finalists are about women. But check out the list of nominated actresses. It’s hard to find an ingénue — to use a term long past its sell-by date — in the bunch. And by and large, the women these actresses portray onscreen are not “likable” in the traditional sense but instead wily, ferocious and unbowed. Who out there wouldn’t want to follow Frances McDormand’s Mildred, from “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” into battle? Or, for that matter, the tough mamas played by Allison Janney in “I, Tonya” and Laurie Metcalf in “Lady Bird”? At the very least, these are not women anyone would soon cross. Nor are Lesley Manville’s icy Cyril from “Phantom Thread”; Margot Robbie’s Tonya Harding; the co-conspirator Octavia Spencer plays in “The Shape of Water”; Mary J. Blige’s sharecropper’s wife in “Mudbound” (Ms. Blige was also nominated for best original song); or even, the Bagger wagers, Saoirse Ronan’s no-nonsense high schooler in “Lady Bird.” This is quite a thing. Only a few years ago, the apparent truism that women had to be winsome or sympathetic to sell films was still holding strong. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump arrives in Davos, Switzerland, setting the stage for one of the most intriguing encounters of his year-old presidency. Mr. Trump will bring his protectionist, “America First” message to the center of globalization, among the elite he has cast as villains. But though some elites dislike him, they think he has been good for business. China’s delegation is already in Davos, promising to open its markets to foreign competition, and curb its soaring debt. _____ “The wall offer’s off the table.” That was Senator Chuck Schumer, pulling back the Democrats’ biggest bargaining chip: funding for President Trump’s proposed wall at the Mexican border. That leaves the push for an immigration deal back at Square 1. Separately, Washington’s mixed messages on Turkey’s attacks on Syria Kurds reflect competing pressures: Turkey is a NATO ally, but the Kurds have been crucial partners in the war against the Islamic State. Here’s an explainer on Turkey’s campaign. "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Alex M. Azar II on Wednesday to be secretary of health and human services, clearing the way for President Trump’s second health secretary to begin controlling more than a trillion dollars a year in spending on medical insurance coverage for about one-third of all Americans. The vote was 55 to 43. Mr. Azar, an ophthalmologist’s son and former drug company executive who served in the administration of George W. Bush, faces two huge challenges. He is supposed to find a way to rein in prices charged by drug companies, which Mr. Trump said last year were “getting away with murder” — a view shared by many consumers. In addition, Mr. Azar must decide how to administer the Affordable Care Act, a task for which he will be personally and legally responsible, at a time when Mr. Trump and many Republicans in Congress want to undermine and eventually kill the law. On many issues, Mr. Azar will face a choice: whether to try to stabilize insurance markets and repair the health law or to “let Obamacare fail,” as Mr. Trump threatened to do last summer. His choices could have significant consequences for consumers and for Republicans on the ballot this fall. At hearings before two Senate committees to review his qualifications, Mr. Azar presented himself as a problem-solving pragmatist rather than an ideologue. At no time did he deviate much from the policies set by Mr. Trump. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration unfurled new sanctions on Wednesday targeting North Korea and its weapons program, underscoring the aggressive approach that President Trump has promised to take against the government of Kim Jong-un. The new sanctions, released by the Treasury Department, target North Korean and Chinese trading companies, North Korean ships and North Korea’s ministry of oil. They also hit North Korean representatives in China and Russia who are members of the Workers’ Party of Korea and who have helped North Korea transfer chemicals and equipment used for weapons production. “Treasury continues to systematically target individuals and entities financing the Kim regime and its weapons programs, including officials complicit in North Korean sanctions evasion schemes,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement. Mr. Mnuchin said that, in accord with United Nations Security Council resolutions, he also is calling on Russia and China to expel anyone working in their countries on behalf of North Korea’s financial networks. The moves come as the White House has been ratcheting up pressure on North Korea following a fiery exchange between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim earlier this year, in which Mr. Trump declared on Twitter that America’s nuclear arsenal is “much bigger” and more powerful than Mr. Kim’s. The saber-rattling renewed fears about the prospect of war and raised questions about whether such a bombastic approach was the best way to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In recent weeks, however, Mr. Trump has suggested that he might be willing to hold direct talks with Mr. Kim. He also voiced his support for the political thaw between North and South Korea, which have agreed to march their athletes together under one flag at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.

"To the Editor: Re “A Syria Plan That Breaks the Law” (Op-Ed, Jan. 24): Senator Cory A. Booker and Oona A. Hathaway’s article advising that “Congress must tell the president he cannot engage our troops in an illegal war in Syria” is misdirected. If we know nothing else, we know that the Republican congressional leadership will not challenge this president on this or any other outrage, as he has the power to end their political careers. There are exactly two remaining forces standing between President Trump and the complete wreckage of world order: the courts and the American electorate. As the courts are relatively insulated from political pressure, Senator Booker and Ms. Hathaway’s alarm needs to be aimed directly at those Americans who still value democracy and the rule of law. This Congress cannot heal itself and must be replaced. ERIC R. CAREY, ARLINGTON, VA. To the Editor: The failure of Congress to assess the merits of a United States military intervention in Syria has even more profound slippery-slope implications for a far more concerning matter: North Korea. The administration has repeatedly threatened the use of force to halt Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. This may be mere bluster to intimidate the Kim Jong-un regime. But if not, who should decide the application of force: the president alone, or has the time come for Congress to assume its responsibility and confront the matter after expert testimony and serious debate? BENNETT RAMBERG, LOS ANGELES The writer served as a policy analyst in the State Department’s Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs in the George H. W. Bush administration. "
"WASHINGTON — The immigration battle between the Trump administration and local governments escalated on Wednesday, as the Justice Department increased its pressure on so-called sanctuary cities and Democratic mayors from several of the country’s largest cities responded by canceling a meeting with the president. The Justice Department asked 23 jurisdictions across the country to furnish documents proving that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities. Mr. Sessions said he would subpoena local governments that failed to respond in a thorough and timely manner. “Protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “Enough is enough.” In objection to the Justice Department’s request, mayors of New York, Chicago and other cities declined to attend a scheduled meeting to discuss infrastructure with President Trump at the White House. Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans and the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday that he saw the Justice Department’s move as an “attack,” and that he could not “in good conscience” attend the White House meeting. “President Trump shouldn’t invite us to the White House for a meeting on infrastructure and three hours before issue the equivalent of what are arrest warrants for standing up for what we believe in and, by the way, what America believes in,” said Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago. "
"Saturday is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. For President Trump, it is a shot at redemption. He failed a moral test on the same occasion a year ago when he issued a message that strangely left out any specific reference to the six million Jews murdered in the Nazis’ industrialized genocide. The White House cast the omission as somehow an “inclusive” approach because, it said, Roma, gays, the disabled and others were also victims. But Jews were unique targets. Failing to mention them was as bizarre as it would be to write a history of slavery and ignore the ordeal of Africans brought to America in chains. It was an example of Mr. Trump’s complex, at times disturbing, instincts in regard to Jews. On one hand, his elder daughter is a convert to Judaism, married to an observant Jew. His years in New York real estate involved frequent dealings with Jewish counterparts. He has thrilled many American Jews by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital (though he’s displeased many more of them, who fear that this will impede the search for Middle East peace). At a ceremony on Capitol Hill in April, he spoke forcefully about the Holocaust as he pledged “never again.” But there’s always another hand with Mr. Trump, and it can be unsightly. After a march that included neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, the president said that there were “very fine people” among them. No, there weren’t. There are no very fine Nazis, neo or otherwise. He has passed along tweets from unabashedly anti-Semitic accounts, and has been slow to denounce assaults, vandalism and other Jew-hating acts, which the Anti-Defamation League says have risen sharply. In the first nine months of 2017, the latest period with available numbers, the league reported there were 1,299 such episodes, an increase of 67 percent over the 779 recorded in the same stretch of 2016. "
"On the first anniversary of his inauguration, President Trump spent the day blasting Democrats for the government shutdown, suggesting that women marching in protest of his presidency were somehow celebrating it, and embroiled in allegations that he paid off a porn star to keep her quiet about their relationship. Melania Trump, meanwhile, commemorated the anniversary by tweeting a single photo of herself on Inauguration Day on the arm of a Marine. Her husband was nowhere in sight, and she did not mention his name. A few days later — on what happened to be the Trumps’ 13th wedding anniversary — she canceled her plans to accompany Mr. Trump to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. She may not be progressive. She may not be political. And yet Mrs. Trump may end up doing more than any of her predecessors to upend our expectations of the slavish devotion a first lady must display toward her husband. Her reasons for doing so, of course, are almost certainly personal. With the exception of the Clintons, there has not been a more complicated first couple in modern history: Mrs. Trump is the third wife of a man who once told the radio host Howard Stern he would “give her a week” to lose the baby weight after their son, Barron, was born. During the 2016 campaign she was put in the position of defending him after a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video showed him bragging about groping women. Since then, however, she has been anything but a public defender, and, in fact, has been defiant in her silence. First ladies are expected to accept their husband’s infidelities and cruelty and to remain their strongest champions, no matter what the circumstances (and Mrs. Trump’s are, undoubtedly, extreme). Lyndon Johnson could be downright mean to his wife, Lady Bird, upbraiding her in public and comparing her with women he found more beautiful. But when he was upset about negative press coverage ahead of the Democratic National Convention in 1964, it was his wife who cheered him on. In a fawning letter, Mrs. Johnson wrote: “Beloved — You are as brave a man as Harry Truman — or FDR — or Lincoln. You can go on to find some peace, some achievement amidst all the pain. You have been strong, patient, determined beyond any words of mine to express.” It is hard to imagine Mrs. Trump writing anything of the sort to her husband. "

"Television ratings for the N.F.L. have fallen 17 percent over the past two seasons. The league is embroiled in a continuing crisis over concussions, and youth participation rates are falling. All of this suggests a difficult future for the sport, yet the N.F.L.’s most notorious competitor, Vince McMahon’s XFL, has a comeback in the works. McMahon, the chairman and chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, announced on Thursday that he would take a second crack at professional football, with play scheduled to start in early 2020. McMahon first tried to reimagine pro football 17 years ago. The old XFL was a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation (W.W.E.’s former name) and NBC, which had lost rights to broadcast N.F.L. games. Violence was amped up: An opening scramble replaced the coin toss and fair catches were banned. So was the sex appeal, with cheerleaders who were even more scantily clad than the ones in the N.F.L., and advertising that included innuendo about them. “Where is my smash-mouth, wide-open football?” McMahon asked rhetorically at the news conference announcing plans for the original XFL “This will not be a league for pantywaists and sissies.” "
"Stephanie Miner, the former Democratic mayor of Syracuse, announced Thursday that she would not challenge a Republican congressman in her Central New York district, but instead was seriously considering a run for governor. To date, no major candidate has stepped forward from either party to oppose Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this fall, and Ms. Miner’s public ruminations about such a challenge are sure to rankle state Democratic Party officials. “I’m still seriously considering it,” Ms. Miner said about a campaign for governor. In 2014, a relatively unknown candidate, Zephyr Teachout, a law professor, took on Mr. Cuomo and garnered a surprising 34 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary. Just as Ms. Teachout highlighted some of Mr. Cuomo’s perceived shortcomings, suggesting that he had tilted too far to the right, Ms. Miner, an unapologetic progressive, wasted no time in pointing out Mr. Cuomo’s vulnerabilities. In an interview in Midtown Manhattan, Ms. Miner, who is teaching a course on municipal finance at New York University, chastised the governor for his handling of the transit crisis, with the subway system troubled by delays and breakdowns. “Anywhere and everywhere I go, people talk about the transit issue,” she said over coffee at Pennsylvania Station, where she was preparing to board an Amtrak back to Syracuse. “People’s frustration and anger is palpable. I think he bears a great deal of responsibility.” "

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump met with his British and Israeli counterparts at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He’s set to give a highly anticipated speech tomorrow. Calling the reports of a rift with Prime Minister Theresa May, above left, “a false rumor,” Mr. Trump indicated that he might be planning another trip across the pond. The last one was canceled, averting the risk of large protests. And with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, at his side, he criticized the Palestinians for refusing to meet with Vice President Mike Pence during his visit to Israel this week.

"DAVOS, Switzerland — When President Trump arrived on Thursday at the conference center where the world’s financial and political elite have been meeting, onlookers crowded a balcony and craned their heads to see the leader who has challenged the very international order that Davos represents. At first, it was quiet. Then someone called out a question. “Are you going to be treated well?” he was asked. “You tell me,” Mr. Trump replied. The reverse question was unasked but hung in the air: How was he going to treat them? If he was not exactly entering the lion’s den, it was nonetheless a fraught moment for both sides as the America First president ventured into the lair of the we-are-the-world banking titans, corporate magnates and international leaders who have spent decades preaching the virtues of global integration. Rather than confrontation, both sides labored for conciliation, at least to a point. For one afternoon and evening, at least, Mr. Trump threw no protectionist grenades and even broached the possibility, however remote, that he would re-enter a Pacific trade agreement that he scrapped last year, if it were renegotiated. For its part, the Davos crowd welcomed its top critic with a reception and warm words. The mood was strikingly different from a year ago, when Mr. Trump was about to take office and the globalists meeting in this mountaintop getaway reeled in shock, panicked that his campaign promises meant the end of the movement they had nurtured for decades. A year later, many of the business and political elites remain dismissive of him, privately rolling eyes and using words like “madman,” but there was excitement about economic growth, and the tax cuts and regulatory rollback he has ushered in.

"BERLIN, Wis. — For as long as he can remember, the only thing Matt Gies really wanted to do for a living was repair farm equipment. But ever since he quit his job more than three years ago at a John Deere dealership — where he worked too hard for too little pay, he said — he has struggled to find a position in the same line of work. One key reason for the difficulty is a wave of consolidation in the industry. Of the seven John Deere farm equipment dealerships within about an hour’s drive of his house, the one Mr. Gies left and refuses to work for, Riesterer & Schnell, owns four. “It was just tough,” he said. “Everyone around here’s been bought out by Riesterer.” Mr. Gies’s predicament is not uncommon in today’s job market. In the past few years, a growing chorus of economists has expressed concern that consolidation among companies, often considered a problem for consumers, may be limiting workers’ employment options and holding their wages down as a result. And that, in turn, could help explain the wage stagnation that has become a vexing feature of the labor market since the late 1990s. A recent working paper by the economists José Azar, Ioana Marinescu and Marshall I. Steinbaum examined job listings on CareerBuilder.com from 2010 through 2013 and found that tens of millions of Americans lived in areas where a relatively small number of employers posted most of the listings. They showed that wages fell when fewer employers in a geographic area listed most of the jobs in an occupation. "
"WASHINGTON — Victims’ rights and women’s rights groups sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday, saying that rules that she issued last year to guide campuses on how to manage sexual assault complaints violated federal law and discriminated against accusers. Three organizations, represented by prominent civil rights litigators, filed a complaint in the Northern District of California outlining ways that the guidance issued by Ms. DeVos in the fall had had a “chilling effect” on campus sexual assault investigations. Since the guidance was issued, the groups charged, accusers have been less inclined to pursue sexual assault cases, and colleges have demonstrated a lack of urgency and clarity in pursuing them. In September, Ms. DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance on how colleges should manage the investigations under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination and governs the rules on investigating sexual assault on campus. A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Under Ms. DeVos’s administration, the department has continued to open sexual assault cases and has maintained a contentious Obama-era practice of publishing a list of campuses with open investigations. Last week, in an abrupt and unannounced move, the department began publishing a database of all pending civil rights cases. According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases. "
"How should we explain the fact that President Trump got away with making 2,140 false or misleading claims during his initial year in office? Both the left, in “America’s First Postmodern President” (written by Jeet Heer in The New Republic last summer), and the right, in “Donald Trump is the First President to Turn Postmodernism Against Itself” (written by David Ernst in The Federalist a year ago), have argued that Trump, without knowing the first thing about, say, Michel Foucault, is an avatar of the rejection of objective truth. Postmodernists, Heer wrote, describe a world where Along parallel lines, Ernst wrote, Scholars of contemporary philosophy argue that postmodernism does not dispute the existence of truth, per se, but rather seeks to interrogate the sources and interests of those making assertions of truth. As Casey Williams wrote in The Stone in The Times last April: It is not usually the job of political journalists to analyze postmodernism, so I turned to some scholars who are devoted to the subject. Trump’s “truths,” as Alan Schrift, a professor of philosophy at Grinnell College, pointed out, Put in the most straightforward terms, Johanna Oksala, a professor of social science and cultural studies at the Pratt Institute, responded by email to my inquiry: For something to be objectively true, Oksala wrote, In the Trump era, the core concept of truth has become deeply politicized and among Trump supporters there is scant appetite for “a rigorous peer-review process.” Andrew Cutrofello, a professor of philosophy at Loyola University Chicago, argues this point in an email: For some scholars, the attempt to link Trump’s lies — his falsehoods, his prevarications, his exaggerations, his duplicity, his “truthful hyperbole” — with postmodernism grows out of a misperception of the term. Todd May, a professor of philosophy and religion at Clemson, wrote by email that In “The Postmodern Condition,” Lyotard conducted a full-scale assault on the idea of a grand narrative as well as an assault on established norms. He wrote: “Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives. … Postmodern knowledge is not simply a tool of the authorities; it refines our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability to tolerate the incommensurable.” Daniel Dennett, a professor of philosophy at Tufts, has given much thought to the current state of events. “We’re entering a period of epistemological murk and uncertainty that we’ve not experienced since the Middle Ages,” he told The Guardian. In a 1998 essay, “Postmodernism and Truth,” Dennett explains why, in his view, objective truth is in fact something real, verifiable and of vast importance: Dennett adamantly rejects “a slide into some form of relativism.” He argues that while “it is true that past scientific orthodoxies have themselves inspired policies that hindsight reveals to be seriously flawed” and that “the methods of science aren’t foolproof,” it is also true that Trump’s utter indifference to the truth, what some of his critics have come to call his “normlessness,” is intensely alarming to many Washington analysts.

"What is signal and what is noise in the news and developments coming out of the Russia investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel? President Trump said Wednesday he would “love to” testify under oath in the investigation. As Mr. Mueller lines up the president for an interview, the issue of obstruction of justice will take center stage. Donald Trump and officials of the 2016 Trump campaign have established a clear pattern of lying to the media. More important for the law on obstruction, they have also either approached or crossed right over the line of lying to federal authorities. Giving false statements to the media is not a crime. But lying to federal authorities can land people in jail. We know that to the media, since at least July 2016, Mr. Trump and campaign officials lied, repeatedly and often, about not having had contacts with Russian officials. As late as August 2017, President Trump held that line, telling The Wall Street Journal: “There’s nobody on the campaign that saw anybody from Russia. We had nothing to do with Russia.” This sustained pattern of lying to the media about any Russian contacts was almost surely done by design and coordinated from within Mr. Trump’s inner circle. Were statements to federal authorities also done by design and coordinated? If you direct your attention to the series of known cases when Trump officials have not told the truth to the F.B.I. and to Congress about Russian contacts, what emerges is a likely conspiracy on the part of Mr. Trump’s inner circle to mislead federal officials.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump said on Wednesday that he was open to a path to citizenship after 10 to 12 years for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. His comments came days after he rejected a bipartisan plan built around that idea. The fate of the so-called Dreamers is at the center of a stalemate in Congress made more complicated by Mr. Trump’s shifting position: He has expressed sympathy for the young immigrants while demanding a crackdown on illegal immigration. • Poll after poll has found that a large majority of Americans support protection for the Dreamers. We spoke to some of those who don’t. • President Trump said he was eager to be interviewed by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, possibly in the next few weeks. “There’s been no collusion whatsoever,” the president said. “There’s no obstruction whatsoever, and I’m looking forward to it.” "
"For Pav Sterry of Columbus, Ohio, legalizing any undocumented immigrants — even those who came as children without a choice in the matter — is just plain wrong. Huy Pham of St. Paul believes any concessions for the so-called Dreamers will unleash another tidal wave of illegal immigration. And Daniel Cotts of Phoenix regards “blanket amnesty” for them as unfair to foreigners who languish for years waiting to come here the legal way. Poll after poll has shown that a large majority of Americans support protections for young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children. Yet there remains a slice of the American public for whom the idea of legalizing an undocumented immigrant has not gotten better with age. They do not dispute that most of the immigrants are eager and hardworking and did not choose their station in life. But for these voters, that is all beside the point. “I think DACA recipients should be given a few months to get their affairs in order and return to their home countries,” said Ms. Sterry, 58, a former math teacher, referring to the Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that President Trump has ended but which could be revived or replaced in a congressional deal.

"Donald J. Trump’s boardroom in “The Apprentice” was like something out of a movie. Specifically, “Network.” In the Netflix documentary “The Confidence Man,” two “Apprentice” producers say they found the actual Trump Organization offices too dated and dowdy for TV. So they built a set in Trump Tower, modeled on the darkened lair where the mogul, Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), dresses down the rebellious newsman Howard Beale (Peter Finch), howling, “The world is a business!” That’s what reality TV does: It set-designs locations (a “Survivor” island, a “Bachelor” love nest) to look more convincing, more in line with our mental cartoons than the real thing. “The Confidence Man,” a swift, brutal overview of Mr. Trump’s business career, argues that he had been doing the same thing with his image for decades: He wasn’t a business titan so much as he played one on TV. The film, directed by Fisher Stevens (“Bright Lights”), is the last episode of a six-part anthology, “Dirty Money,” from the filmmaker Alex Gibney (“Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room”), arriving Friday. The installments range from an infuriating look at payday lending to an offbeat story about Canadian maple syrup cartels. "

Do you have questions about climate change? We’re answering them in this newsletter. Send us yours via the form at the bottom of our climate Q. and A. This one was sent to us from Sue Pfeffer in Toronto: How much of the problem is caused by methane gas emitted from raising farm animals for the meat industry? The impact of agriculture, a category that includes everything from growing lettuce to raising livestock, is tricky to express because the gasses produced — mostly methane and nitrous oxide — have much more warming potential than carbon dioxide but also dissipate more quickly. According to the latest thinking, though, farming is responsible for the equivalent of 574 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States each year and 56 million metric tons in Canada. That’s about 8 percent of each country’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Methane is increasingly drawing attention from researchers because its worldwide levels have doubled in less than 10 years after remaining flat since the 1990s. The reasons behind the increase are not well understood. In the United States, 42 percent of agricultural emissions come from animal agriculture. Two-thirds of those gases are directly emitted by ruminants: animals like cows, buffalo and sheep that use bacteria in their stomachs to ferment food. That allows them to eat foods, like grasses, that humans can’t. "

"BERLIN — The previous time I lived in Berlin, in 2000, China had recently bought a building by the Spree River to use for a sprawling new embassy, and the staff would bully the clients of a women-only gym that had a lease on the top floor with verbal insults and by making them undergo intimidating security checks. The bizarre practice was aimed, apparently, at forcing out the gym and securing use of the entire building for China. It worked. Today, the silver and mirror-clad embassy sparkles by the spinach-colored waters of the Spree, satellite dishes and antennas poking out on top. I’m back in Berlin, having spent the intervening years reporting in Beijing as China vaulted from sixth place to second in global economic strength, pushing down Germany from third to fourth. Returning to this country from China, I am struck by how Beijing is asserting its interests here in ways that threaten Germany’s core values, going well beyond intimidating gym-going women. Germany must end Chinese meddling in its hard-earned democracy. Berlin has a stronger hand than many Germans appear to realize: China does not want to lose the good will and cooperation of this technologically strong and politically influential partner in the heart of Europe. Germany should be pushing back against Chinese interference with consistency and strength, just as China does when it feels its core interests are threatened. In recent months China has sent up a series of trial balloons to see how far it can stretch the boundaries of German democracy. First and most easily spotted: challenges to free speech and political protest on German soil. Take an incident in November, when the Chinese halted a soccer match between their under-20 team and TSV Schott Mainz in southwestern Germany to protest a handful of Tibetans and German fans with Tibetan “snow lion” flags. China regards the flags as a sign of resistance to its rule in Tibet. The Chinese players returned to the field only after the flags were furled. (China lost, 3-0.) "
"In the fall of 2016, Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, sat down with some of the most powerful figures in the global economy. Hosted by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, their discussion focused on financial trouble spots around the globe. There was scant talk about poverty, which the World Bank has committed to eradicate. And as such, there was no cause for Mr. Kim to join the discussion in a meaningful way. “I sat there and thought, ‘we are completely irrelevant to the majority of these countries,’” Mr. Kim recalled. “The I.M.F. is a systemically important financial institution. But we are seen as just a bunch of do-gooders.” The World Bank, once a powerhouse of global finance, is searching for relevance. Mr. Kim’s unusual solution: embrace Wall Street. For decades, the World Bank followed a simple formula. Developed-world governments that are the bank’s members provided the bulk of its money, which was used to make loans to developing nations for infrastructure projects and the like. But that model is under strain. Some 1.3 billion people still live in extreme poverty, and the bank’s war chest is dwarfed by the funds pouring into developing countries through financial markets. Perhaps most important, the World Bank’s biggest benefactor and largest shareholder — the United States — has become its most trenchant critic. "
"WASHINGTON — Rest easy, everyone. A year after President Trump’s inauguration, Twitter claims it has solved the problem of Russian disinformation that plagued the 2016 election by playing — and according to Twitter executives, winning — this round of the game of Whack-a-Troll. In a Friday afternoon post updating users on its review of the 2016 election, Twitter touted its removal of 3,814 accounts and associated posts from the infamous St. Petersburg troll factory known as the Internet Research Agency. Facebook has similarly issued several statements this month about planned changes to address disinformation on its platform. Both companies have employed strong language to condemn the use of their platforms for spreading lies; Samidh Chakrabarti, the head of Facebook’s civic engagement team, admitted that Facebook was “far too slow to recognize how bad actors were abusing our platform.” It’s refreshing to see that these companies have finally realized their culpability in the spread of online disinformation. But their solutions to the phenomenon overlook homegrown purveyors of it. The companies have misplaced their focus in the fight, concentrating too heavily on removing Russian content while ignoring the problematic articles and posts created and shared by American outlets and users. In its statement, Twitter asserted that it is committed to identifying and removing more bots in the future. But it also added a few important caveats: “automated election-related content associated with Russian signals represented a very small fraction of the overall activity on Twitter in the ten-week period preceding the 2016 election,” and of tweets from Internet Research Agency-linked accounts, only 8.4 percent were “election-related.” What Twitter does not address is that the trolls will keep popping up. The Kremlin is unlikely to have concentrated all of its information warriors in one building. And according to researchers, up to 15 percent of all active Twitter accounts might be bots, Russian or otherwise. Twitter has a great deal more work to do on the automation front, but Whack-a-Troll is not where its disinformation problem ends. "

"DAVOS, Switzerland — President Trump sought to repair one diplomatic rift while widening another on Thursday as he smoothed over months of friction with Britain but threatened to cut financial aid to the Palestinians after they withdrew from peace discussions. Separate meetings with the prime ministers of Britain and Israel showcased the wide disparity in Mr. Trump’s ties with key counterparts. His session with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain was tense as they tried to put the relationship back on track, while his sit-down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was warm as the two agreed on what they cast as Palestinian intransigence. The strain between the United States and Britain, its closest ally, increased when Mr. Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos posted by an ultranationalist British group, which Mrs. May called “wrong,” and culminated in his decision to cancel a scheduled visit to London, where the mayor declared him unwelcome. Sitting down on Thursday with Mrs. May, Mr. Trump said he was now exploring a visit later in the year and dismissed talk of discord as a “false rumor.” “We’re on the same wavelength, I think, in every respect,” Mr. Trump said. “And the prime minister and myself have had a really great relationship, although some people don’t necessarily believe that, but I can tell you it’s true.” He expressed respect for Mrs. May, and said he thought “the feeling is mutual from the standpoint of liking each other a lot,” adding that the two were “very much joined at the hip” on military matters. Mrs. May was polite but less effusive and offered no personal testimonial to Mr. Trump, keeping her comments focused on their mutual national interests. “We, too, have that really special relationship between the U.K. and the United States,” she said. “It’s at each other’s shoulders. We face the same challenges across the world, and as you say we’re willing to go and to defeat those challenges and meet them.” The meeting with Mr. Netanyahu showcased one of Mr. Trump’s strongest international relationships. Mr. Trump recently discarded decades of American policy to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and has threatened to pull out of a nuclear deal with Iran that the Israeli leader despises. During a visit to Israel this week, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the United States Embassy would move to Jerusalem in 2019. "
"They can be hard to spot — let alone take at face value — amid the usual spray of insults and bombast, but every now and then President Trump emits a sensible idea. Mr. Trump offered at least the appearance of such an idea when he strode into the White House briefing room late Wednesday and announced that he was open to a multiyear path to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, about 700,000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children and granted protection from deportation by President Barack Obama. His words sent his surprised staff scrambling and heartened Democrats who have been seeking a just solution for these young people. But the price of the offer became clear Thursday afternoon, when White House officials said that citizenship for the Dreamers, and about 1.1 million other young immigrants who could qualify for the status but didn’t apply, would come only as part of a bargain that included an additional $25 billion for border security and a crackdown on legal immigrants, including family members of those already in the United States. Mr. Trump, who canceled the Dreamers’ protection in September, has professed his “love” for them, but the real policy is being made by hard-liners in the White House. In the heat of the struggle over the fate of the Dreamers, what has often been obscured is how the heartless anti-immigration crowd has ominously pushed the broader debate to attack immigration as a whole. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Last weekend, as the federal government was shutting down amid partisan squabbles over immigration, President Trump’s re-election campaign released an ad featuring an undocumented immigrant from Mexico accused of murdering two Sacramento police officers. Democrats, the ad stated, are “complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.” On the same day, a group of California Republicans put out their own ad about immigration. It featured the sunny disposition of Ronald Reagan, and words he spoke form the Oval Office in 1989, as he prepared to leave office. In the address, President Reagan defined what he meant when described, as he often did, America as a “shining city.” It is a country, he said, “teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.” The contrasting tone of the two ads — one dark and ominous, the other bright and optimistic — say a lot about the divergence between the national Republican Party and the party in California. In California, the party is fighting for relevance in a state whose diversity — Latinos are a plurality in the state — and progressive values have placed it at the forefront of opposition to the Trump administration. “In California we have a problem,” said Chad Mayes, a former Republican leader in the California State Assembly, who was pushed out of his leadership position last year after a backlash within his party because he negotiated with Democrats on climate change. Mr. Mayes, from Yucca Valley, grew up the poor son of a preacher and has taken moderate positions on a number of issues, including immigration, climate change and poverty. In an effort to rebrand his own party, Mr. Mayes recently founded New Way California, which put out the Reagan ad and has drawn the support of the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. When he was his party’s leader in the State Assembly, polling he conducted showed that many Californians, “didn’t think we cared about people,” he said. “They thought we were caustic and abrasive,” he added, and only looked out for, “rich white people.” "
"DAVOS, Switzerland — His name now appears on the dollar bill. But that does not mean it is safe for him to actually talk about the dollar. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin got a searing reminder of that this week when an apparently offhand comment, that a weak dollar benefits American trade, helped plunge the currency to a three-year low and touched off a flurry of speculation about the Trump administration’s economic plans. The market-moving hullabaloo highlighted the sensitivity about President Trump’s “America First” trade agenda here at the World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of capitalist titans and world leaders. If the United States were reversing more than two decades of policy, as some feared Mr. Mnuchin’s comment indicated, it could initiate a return to the currency wars that once roiled the global economy. But Mr. Mnuchin insisted on Thursday that was not the case. He meant his previous remark only as a statement of fact, not an objective of the administration or another tool in Mr. Trump’s war against what he considers unfair practices by America’s trading partners. Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager and Goldman Sachs executive, deemed the resulting tumble of the dollar to be an enormous overreaction by the world’s money traders. “I thought my comment on the dollar was actually quite clear yesterday,” he told reporters hours before Mr. Trump arrived in Davos. “I thought it was actually balanced and consistent with what I’ve said before, which is we’re not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term, it’s a very, very liquid market, and we believe in free currencies. And that there’s both advantages and disadvantages of where the dollar is in the short term. Let me say, I thought that was clear.” Maybe it should have been. But Treasury secretaries have learned over the years that comments they thought were clear have not always been taken that way. More than perhaps any other official in the American government except the Federal Reserve chief, a Treasury secretary finds his remarks flyspecked to an extraordinary degree, with each word often given far more meaning than intended.

"DAVOS, Switzerland — In the year and a half since Britain’s shocking decision to sever itself from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May has labored to portray her country’s future as one of glorious progress. She has described a bold new era in which Britain would look beyond the confines of Europe, striking trade deals and reclaiming its place as a global power. All the while, an uncomfortable reality has been sinking in. Britain’s stature on the world stage has diminished, and its economy has sagged. The former colonial empire has been reduced to a lesser actor, a reality that hit home on Thursday as Mrs. May delivered a sparsely attended speech before the World Economic Forum. Mrs. May devoted part of her speech to declaring Britain’s steadfast commitment to global trade and international engagement. But one of her primary examples of that commitment — highlighting Britain’s role in a European bloc it is actively leaving — underscored the strange moment she inhabits. “The U.K. has been at the forefront of championing new trade deals including the E.U.’s deals with Canada and Japan,” Ms. May said. “And as we leave the European Union, the U.K. will continue to be a global advocate of free trade.” The day before, President Emmanuel Macron of France had received rock star-style treatment from a packed crowd that waited nearly an hour for a chance just to get into the room where he was to speak. People who arrived a moment before Mrs. May’s speech found empty seats within a few rows of the stage. Much of Britain’s receding status comes from its decision to abandon Europe — Brexit, in the parlance — and to remove itself from a realm of some 500 million people that sprawls from Ireland to Greece. Given that nearly half of Britain’s exports land within the European Union, any rupture to this trade could cost the country substantial treasure. "

"PARIS — The evening before President Trump arrived in Davos, Switzerland, to hobnob with the global elite and throw down the gauntlet of America First — and maybe nail down a date with President Emmanuel Macron of France for his first state dinner — Pierpaolo Piccioli, creative director of Valentino, stood atop an ornate iron staircase in the Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild here and brought the couture shows to a close with a meditation on the subject of dreams. It’s a popular word when it comes to couture, which pretty much everyone involved likes to refer to as “the dream” (in part to justify that it is out of reach for 99.9 percent of consumers). But, like so many other words (Sad! Huge!) and language elements (the exclamation point) in the past year — and especially the past few weeks — it has been Trumpified. It’s almost impossible to hear “dream” and not think “Dreamers” instead. That has a way of taking your mind in a different direction. So perhaps it was fitting that Mr. Piccioli framed his collection not as escapism but rather as an opportunity to put the old idea to rest and move on. “The essence of the dream of couture is its past,” he said, standing next to a bulletin board tacked with pictures of Audrey Hepburn and Charles James gowns. “But I was not the kind of kid who had a grandma who wore couture. So I wanted to take elements of classic couture — volume, ruffles, bows — but do them in the lightest way I could imagine, because it is only when you confront your past that you can face your future.” "
"The comments President Trump reportedly made recently, asking why the United States should accept immigrants from “shithole countries,” shed an uncomfortable spotlight on Haiti, El Salvador and the entire African continent. Several political figures and others from these nations responded swiftly — with a mixture of anger and mocking humor — to counter the sentiment, both in public statements and on social media.  The tourism industry jumped on the comments as well. The lodging company Gondwana Collection Namibia released a satirical Namibian tourism video featuring the voice of a Mr. Trump impersonator.  And Airbnb is reportedly spending at least $100,000 on a digital ad campaign to promote travel to these countries — a message echoed in a tweet from its chief executive. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump proposed legislation on Thursday that would provide a path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants in exchange for an end to decades of family-based migration policies, a costly border wall and a vast crackdown on other immigrants living in the country illegally. Describing the plan as “extremely generous” but a take-it-or-leave-it proposal, White House officials said they hoped it would be embraced by conservatives and centrists in Congress as the first step in an even broader effort to fix the nation’s immigration system. Officials said the legislation would pave the way to citizenship not only for the 690,000 people who had signed up for protection under an Obama-era program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, but also for another 1.1 million undocumented immigrants who would have qualified for the program but never applied. Mr. Trump ended the DACA program, whose protections did not include a path to citizenship, last September. But the new plan — drafted by Stephen Miller, the president’s hard-line domestic policy adviser, and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff — was immediately rejected by Democrats, immigration advocates and some Republicans, with some describing it as nothing but an attempt to rid the country of immigrants and shut the nation’s borders. Republican and Democratic senators are working on a narrower immigration plan of their own. They hope that if it can pass the Senate with a strong bipartisan majority, it will put pressure on the House — where attempts at immigration overhauls have died in recent years — to pass the legislation as well. Senate passage of a bipartisan bill could perhaps leave Mr. Trump with the take-it-or-leave-it decision. Just over two weeks ago, in a televised negotiating session at the White House, Mr. Trump said he would sign anything that got to him. "
"Among Amazon’s 20 finalist cities for its coveted second headquarters are several that would have to be called long shots: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville and Miami, to name three. And then there’s Indianapolis. In the frenzy of coverage and speculation that accompanied Amazon’s initial announcement of a North America-wide competition for the new headquarters, I couldn’t find anyone who cited Indianapolis as a likely finalist. This week the Irish betting site Paddy Power had Indianapolis tied for last among the finalists, with the odds of being chosen at 20 to 1. (Boston and Atlanta have been vying for the best odds, with Boston on top this week at 2 to 1.) The commercial real estate firm CBRE ranked Indianapolis only 33rd among 50 American cities for what CBRE calls “tech talent.” Amazon has cited access to highly trained and educated technology workers as one of its top priorities. And then there’s what might be called the “cool” factor — which Indianapolis, at first glance, would seem to be lacking. Bob Stutz, chief executive of Salesforce.com’s Marketing Cloud, which is based in Indianapolis, came to the fast-growing company from Microsoft, and lived in Amazon’s hometown, Seattle. When Salesforce asked him to move to Indianapolis, his first thought was, “You’ve got to be kidding.” "
"The Doomsday Clock, a potent symbol of scientific concerns about humanity’s possible annihilation, was advanced by 30 seconds on Thursday, to 2 minutes to midnight, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced in Washington. The last time the clock was moved so close to midnight was in 1953, during the Cold War. “In 2017, world leaders failed to respond effectively to the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change, making the world security situation more dangerous than it was a year ago — and as dangerous as it has been since World War II,” the bulletin’s science and security board, which oversees the clock, said in a statement. It cited the risks from North Korea’s nuclear program; discord between Russia and the United States; tensions in the South China Sea; the buildup of the nuclear arsenals of Pakistan and India; and uncertainty over the Iran nuclear deal. The scientists also warned that the sustained reductions in greenhouse gases needed to prevent disastrous warming of the planet had not yet occurred and cited the dangers that technology disruption is causing for democracies, including disinformation campaigns intended to manipulate elections and undermine confidence in democracy. They also found that “in 2017, the United States backed away from its longstanding leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges.” The scientists cited, among other destabilizing factors, the harsh rhetoric President Trump has exchanged with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un; Mr. Trump’s disavowal of the Iran deal; the hiring of climate-change deniers at the Environmental Protection Agency; and the administration’s plans to remake and expand the nation’s nuclear arsenal.

"PHILADELPHIA — Malcolm Jenkins, the Philadelphia Eagles’ star safety, was dragging Monday afternoon, and for good reason. The previous night, he helped the hometown team earn a trip to the Super Bowl with a 38-7 thumping of the Minnesota Vikings. He left the stadium at 11 p.m. After a brief appearance at a team party, he went home and played poker with some college fraternity brothers until 3 a.m. His alarm went off at 6 a.m., as it always does. He looked in on his 5-day-old baby and got ready to take his 4-year-old daughter to school. Then it was off to the Eagles’ training facility for rehab, Super Bowl planning and to discuss his other full-time job — fighting for criminal justice reform and addressing racial inequality. “There’s a huge emphasis for me on time management,” Jenkins said with a shrug. “Sometimes it requires burning the candle on both ends.” Jenkins, 30, has been burning that candle since the summer of 2016, when the killing of several African-Americans by the police became his call to action. Since then, he has used every waking hour he isn’t spending on football or family to work with the Players Coalition, a group of N.F.L. players seeking solutions to seemingly intractable problems facing African-Americans. His raised fist during the playing of the national anthem before games in October and November became one of the enduring images of this most political of N.F.L. seasons. Beyond that gesture, though, Jenkins and the Players Coalition have met with leaders of police departments, public defenders, bail officers and lawmakers. They have visited prisons and courts to learn about problems, and pushed for legislation to address them. They also met with top N.F.L. executives repeatedly throughout the season. After some prodding, the N.F.L. announced in December that it would spend up to $89 million over seven years to help grass-roots groups fight inequality. On Tuesday, the league said that the owners of the Browns, the Cardinals, the Dolphins, the Falcons and the Jaguars, along with three current players and two retired players, would form a committee to choose programs and initiatives to support.

"Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, writes: This transformation presents students with an opportunity to watch, and study, presidential drama in real time, as history unfolds — and to learn more about the office of the presidency and American democracy. With a year of Mr. Trump’s tenure completed, students can also grade the president on his performance so far, and make predictions about what’s to come. Below, we present four approaches to using President Trump’s first year in office as a topic for teaching and learning: 1) Evaluate President Trump’s first year in office.
2) Analyze how, and to what extent, Mr. Trump has changed the presidency.
3) Study major policy shifts advanced by the Trump administration.
4) Voice your opinion. _________ Part I: Working in small groups, students should brainstorm a list of what they think are the most important qualities of a president. Encourage them to come up with at least five qualities or characteristics they think would make anyone who holds that office successful. To help them generate a list, you might offer as a starting place these criteria proposed by Sean Wilentz, a professor of history at Princeton, in his recent Op-Ed: And if you want students to go deeper, you can have them read one or more of these five essays about what makes a good president, written by the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the Republican strategist Karl Rove and others. Part II: Next, ask students to brainstorm a list of President Trump’s most important or memorable actions or statements over the past year. They should come up with at least five important moments in his presidency. "
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — One day after an American drone strike killed a leader of the militant Haqqani network in northwestern Pakistan, United States officials on Thursday rejected a claim by Pakistan that the strike had targeted an Afghan refugee camp. There were also conflicting accounts of the location of the drone strike and the number of people killed. A statement by Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday condemned the strike and maintained that it had “targeted an Afghan refugee camp in Kurram Agency” — an assertion that the United States rejected on Thursday. “The claim in an M.F.A. statement yesterday that U.S. forces struck an Afghan refugee camp in Kurram Agency yesterday is false,” said Richard W. Snelsire, the United States Embassy spokesman in Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital. American officials said that there were no Afghan refugee camps in Kurram, a remote tribal region straddling the border with Afghanistan, where they said Wednesday’s drone strike had taken place. The strike, which killed Nasir Mehmood, a commander of the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network, was at least the third American drone strike in the past two months in Pakistani territory. The United Nations refugee agency also said it had not been operating in the tribal regions of Pakistan since 2005. “We don’t have any access to FATA,” Qaisar Khan Afridi, the agency’s spokesman said, referring to the semiautonomous tribal regions.

"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. Our Washington investigations editor, Mark Mazzetti, who was a national security reporter for a decade, has spent the past year exploring the controversy clouding the 2016 presidential election and the Trump presidency. Was there collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin? What role did social media play? Did President Trump try to obstruct the F.B.I.’s continuing investigation? How vulnerable is the president to criminal charges for his conduct in office? Where is the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, headed? How do reporters get this information? On Tuesday, Feb. 13, in New York City, on a panel titled “Unpacking the Russia Story With the Experts Who Have Covered It,” Mark and his fellow Times reporters Michael Schmidt and Scott Shane will explore this and more with Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at The New School.

"Updated, 11:30 a.m. Good morning on this bright, cold Thursday. She’s been called a “Trump-whisperer,” “Trump’s favorite foe” and ""the best reporter in the room.” Maggie Haberman, The New York Times’s White House correspondent, consistently breaks front-page news with deeply sourced articles about the Trump White House. We recently spoke to Ms. Haberman as part of an interview series in which successful New Yorkers offer advice to newcomers to their industries. She got her start as a clerk at The New York Post and became a reporter there. She also worked at The Daily News and Politico before joining The Times — where her father, Clyde Haberman, has written for more than 40 years — in 2015. She splits her time between Washington and New York City, and we reached Ms. Haberman, 44, at The Times’s Washington bureau. Her responses have been lightly edited and condensed. How does someone get started in journalism today? It’s not what it was when I started, which was you worked at a local paper — in my case, the tabloids in New York. It’s still a good idea to clerk somewhere, either a print newsroom or TV network. But you’re going to be doing a lot of grunt work for not a lot of pay early on. It was always a difficult field to get into. It’s harder now. What’s your best advice for a young journalist? Basically, outwork everybody: Start out earlier and end your day later. Go to every stakeout that you can on a story. Always make the additional phone call. When a rival beats you on a story, try to figure out how they got it and go from there. Meet with whoever asks to meet with you, although we’re in a bit of a “gotcha” environment now, so you have to be more careful. How do you avoid burnout? I don’t know. I’m very tired (laughs). But we’re all very tired. I think that the demands of reporters now are very different. The only way to avoid burnout is to take cues from your body and your brain. If you’re making mistakes in your copy, take a few extra minutes and look it over a few extra times. Double-check yourself. That doesn’t really deal with the feeling of “I can’t keep doing this,” but if you need to take a break, take a break. "
"The past few days have seen a flurry of news about the Robert Mueller investigation: who has been interviewed (Attorney General Jeff Sessions), whom Mueller plans to interview shortly (Donald Trump) and the seeming focus of Mueller’s inquiry (obstruction of justice). Concurrently, Trump and his allies have continued to attack the credibility and authority of the F.B.I. and the media, attempting to pre-emptively discredit any charges Mueller may file and any finding he may make public, as well as the media that would herald those charges and findings. Furthermore, Trump constantly says that there was no collusion with the Russians because, as I am sure he has been told by his attorneys, collusion is not a crime and therefore would not be one of Mueller’s charges. And the Republican-led inquiries in the House and Senate would move heaven and earth to prevent an affirmation of collusion from being included in a final report. This will encourage the Trump team to more forcefully make this argument: They looked for collusion and didn’t find it, so they fished around, on a politically motivated mission, to find anything they could. This would be a twist of the truth, but that is par for the course in these times, with this administration. It is clear from what we already know that there was an appetite in the Trump camp to accept whatever help they could get from the Russians. It is clear that there were a disturbing number of undisclosed meetings with Russians. It is clear that there are some incredibly curious coincidences of timing between activities by the Russians and activities by the campaign. "
