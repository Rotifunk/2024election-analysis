"Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had her 15 minutes of infamy today when she posted a photo on Instagram of herself exiting a military jet. The plane was stamped with the name of our country. Ms. Linton’s slim figure was emblazoned with brand names she tagged. Sunglasses: Tom Ford. Shoes: Valentino. Her scarf was, of course, Hermès. The comparisons to Marie Antoinette rolled right in. “Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable,” commented Jenni Miller, a Democrat from Portland, Ore. Rather than ignoring the comment, Ms. Linton opted for a retort one would expect from a grade-school bully: “Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable!” she asked. “Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?” Linton continued: “I’m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day ‘trip’ than you did.” Keeping it classy, she added, “You’re adorably out of touch.” It’s Ms. Linton who’s out of touch. And this isn’t the first time she has made headlines for being utterly tone-deaf. Ms. Linton, a 36-year-old native of Scotland, gained attention for her memoir about the time she spent in Zambia when she was 18.

"With white supremacists emboldened and a national spotlight shining on bigotry and hate, 67 former state attorneys general are calling on Americans and their leaders to condemn hatred unequivocally. Follow the example, they suggest, that an Alabama attorney general set four decades ago. In February 1976, that attorney general, Bill Baxley, received a threatening letter. It was from Edward R. Fields, a grand dragon in the Ku Klux Klan, who was furious that the state had reopened an investigation into the Birmingham church bombing that killed four young girls in 1963. He demanded a response, and Mr. Baxley obliged. “Dear ‘Dr.’ Fields,” he wrote. “My response to your letter of February 19, 1976, is — kiss my ass.” Mr. Baxley did not publicize his letter. (“For one thing,” he recalled in an interview on Tuesday, “I would have been worried about what my mother would say about me using that language.”) But the K.K.K. quickly released it, thinking it would hurt him politically. It did not quite work out that way. And four decades later, Mr. Baxley’s retort is the centerpiece of the former attorney generals’ statement. The statement — which was released Monday and is conspicuously addressed not to President Trump or any other official, but rather to the broad, unnamed public — begins, “There are times in the life of a nation, or a president, or a state attorney general, when one is called upon to respond directly to the voice of hate.” "
"Derek Black, a former white nationalist and a godson of David Duke, spoke with Michael Barbaro in an episode of “The Daily” that received a particularly intense response on Tuesday. In the podcast, Mr. Black describes his experience growing up in a white nationalist family, taking part in a radio show on his father’s website Stormfront.org and how he turned on the white nationalist movement. This is an unedited transcription from the podcast. Please listen to the corresponding audio before quoting from it. DEREK BLACK: Yeah, I was born into one of the most prominent white nationalist families in the country. MICHAEL BARBARO: Wow. D.B.: My godfather for lack of any other word was David Duke, who was married to my mother before I was born … and then my father started the largest white nationalist website .. Stormfront … it was the first white nationalist website on the internet, and it has been the largest one ever since. So I grew up with the leadership of the white nationalist movement, all coming over to the house, and when I got older, we’d go to conferences and it was my life. M.B.: Derek Black grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida, across from the president’s Mar-a-Lago mansion and he used to drive past it almost every day in a red pickup truck with a confederate flag sticker on the back window. His father is Don Black, once a grand wizard of the K.K.K. M.B.: It sounds like what you’re describing is like you’re the First Child of American white nationalism? "
"WASHINGTON — As anyone associated with the Trump administration knows, it only takes one outburst — a few haphazard emojis here, a call to The New Yorker there — to cement a new reputation. This week, in the time it took her to type out an Instagram screed, Louise Linton transformed herself from the Treasury secretary’s wife to a Real Housewife of the Treasury. The protests and rallies and arguments roiling the country for months have not seemed to bother Ms. Linton, a Scottish actress who spent the summer after her wedding to Steven Mnuchin posting evidence of her lavish lifestyle on Instagram. She zipped around on a speedboat in an Italian lake. She sipped wine at a restaurant overlooking the Louvre. She lounged in a very nice-looking pool with a very nice-looking giant inflatable swan, a tiny Chihuahua nestled in her arms. Along the way, Ms. Linton tagged and touted a parade of designers. “#TomFord.” “#Valentinorockstudheels.” “#HermesScarf.” This in-the-clouds lifestyle abruptly collided with her husband’s political day job on Monday after Ms. Linton, 36, dressed down a stranger on Instagram for criticizing her travels. She apologized hours later, but it was too late to stop the social-media dredging of her past mistakes, including “In Congo’s Shadow,” a much-criticized memoir about her spotty gap year spent in Africa. It was too late to stop critics from defacing her Wikipedia page, usually the first sign of any true social media frenzy. And it was too late to go back to her relatively under-the-radar Washington life. She even managed to upstage President Trump, a man who had just stared directly into the sun. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s declaration that “we will win” in Afghanistan came with bellicose language about taking “fast and powerful” retribution against militants and a promise to succeed where other presidents have failed to resolve the nearly 16-year-old conflict. Left unclear by the Trump administration was the answer to a question that has stumped Washington, including the two previous commanders in chief, since the United States became involved in the war there: What does winning look like in Afghanistan? For Mr. Trump, winning looks a lot like a very long war. “From now on, victory will have a clear definition,” Mr. Trump said on Monday during his prime-time televised address on his strategy for Afghanistan. “Attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing Al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.” But hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the president’s top advisers offered a far different view of success, arguing that the ultimate solution to the conflict in Afghanistan was a settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban, who would theoretically be beaten down by the Americans and forced to the negotiating table. Mr. Tillerson endorsed that approach on Tuesday, arguing that the president had laid out a strategy “intended to put pressure on the Taliban.” "
"ERBIL, Iraq — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis asked the president of Iraq’s Kurdish autonomous region on Tuesday to postpone a referendum next month on Kurdish independence. Mr. Mattis’s meeting with President Massoud Barzani was part of a broader push by American officials to head off what they fear may be a new period of political instability as Iraq continues its battle against the Islamic State. “Our point right now is to stay focused like a laser beam on the defeat of ISIS and to let nothing distract us,” Mr. Mattis told reporters, using an acronym for the Islamic State, shortly before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous region. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson made a similar appeal for the Kurds to postpone the referendum, which is scheduled for Sept. 25, in a telephone call earlier this month with Mr. Barzani. So did Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the United States Central Command, who visited Iraq last week. But Kurdish officials said that Mr. Barzani did not pull back from the referendum in his meeting with Mr. Mattis even as he has kept the door open for further talks with Iraqi officials in Baghdad and with the United States. “We intend to proceed with the referendum on Sept. 25 to allow our people to determine their own future,” Masrour Barzani, a top Kurdish security official and the son of Massoud Barzani, said on Tuesday night. “This remains the only solution; forced coexistence in Iraq isn’t working.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday denied Egypt $96 million in aid and delayed $195 million in military funding because of concerns over Egypt’s human rights record and its cozy relationship with North Korea. Analysts said they were surprised by the moves, which followed an Oval Office meeting in April between President Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, during which Mr. Trump lavished praise on the military strongman. “I just want to let everybody know, in case there was any doubt, that we are very much behind President el-Sisi,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. We are very much behind Egypt and the people of Egypt. The United States has, believe me, backing, and we have strong backing.” Egypt is among the largest recipients of United States aid. But on Tuesday, the State Department confirmed that it was curtailing its funding to the country because of its lack of progress in human rights and a new law restricting the activities of nongovernmental organizations. Asked if Egypt’s robust relationship with North Korea played a role in Tuesday’s action, a State Department official would say only that issues of concern have been raised with Cairo, but refused to provide details about the talks. While Mr. Sisi approved the new law almost two months after his meeting with Mr. Trump, concerns over Egypt’s human rights record and its relationship with North Korea have been percolating for years.

"A federal jury in Las Vegas declined to convict four men of any crimes for their participation in the 2014 armed standoff near the Bundy ranch in Bunkerville, Nev. During that conflict, ranchers and militia members blocked federal officers from confiscating livestock owned by the Nevada cattleman Cliven Bundy. On Tuesday, jurors acquitted the defendants Richard R. Lovelien and Steven A. Stewart of all charges and O. Scott Drexler and Eric J. Parker on most counts against them. Jurors could not reach a decision on two charges against Mr. Drexler and four charges for Mr. Parker, all related to an alleged assault on a federal officer while carrying a firearm. The United States District Attorney’s office in Nevada issued a statement on Tuesday saying that prosecutors had not decided if they would retry the men on those charges. “That is huge,” said Andrea Parker, whose husband, Eric, was photographed pointing a rifle at officers and others during the confrontation. The image became a symbol of the standoff. “The government did everything they could to stack and get guilty charges,” she continued. “I might actually get to hug my husband for the first time in 18 months.” The decision is only one chapter in the best-known land use case in the contemporary West. For years, officials had ordered Mr. Bundy to remove his cattle from a publicly owned desert expanse near Bunkerville, Nev., northeast of Las Vegas. When he did not, the authorities moved in to do it themselves, but allies of Mr. Bundy traveled from around the country to stop them. "
"Last Wednesday, even as top executives were abandoning President Trump’s business advisory councils after his remarks on white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va., other industry leaders were busy making their interests known to a business-friendly White House. Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group, traveled to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to meet with Mark Calabria, the chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence. The men talked tax reform, and Mr. Howard pressed for incentives including the mortgage interest deduction. It was the kind of back and forth that goes on between business interests and the administration every day. And that relative normalcy — even on a day when a number of prominent C.E.O.s publicly abandoned Mr. Trump — served as a reminder that no matter the president’s missteps, his top legislative priorities, particularly tax reform, still draw strong support from business leaders. Now, with some signs that the worst fallout from Mr. Trump’s response to Charlottesville has passed — and with the departure of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s volatile strategist — some in the business community are voicing hope that the administration can tackle tax reform. “Everyone is similarly motivated to reach some version of success, to get a tax bill to the president’s desk that he can sign,” said Rohit Kumar, a tax specialist at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “On tax, there’s a lot of business community support, there’s a lot of similar incentives.” Efforts to overhaul the tax code are expected to begin in earnest this fall. Already, big business groups are lining up to support the White House’s efforts. "
"WASHINGTON — A few thousand American troops to train the Afghan Army. A single-minded focus on counterterrorism, with C.I.A. drones and Special Operations units hunting down terrorists. A healthy skepticism of Pakistan as an abettor of Islamic extremism. And an explicit repudiation of grand plans to nurture a Jeffersonian democracy in Central Asia. These are the hallmarks of the Afghanistan strategy  President Trump set out on Monday night. They are also the hallmarks of the strategy  former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried unsuccessfully to sell to President Barack Obama in the fall of 2009. The parallels between Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Biden’s plans provided a sense of irony — even comfort — for the Washington foreign policy establishment, which has felt deeply alienated during this presidency, watching Mr. Trump’s unorthodox statecraft with a mix of horror and dismay. But the similarities are more than a historical footnote: Mr. Biden has talked about running for president in 2020, and he would start off as a front-runner in a splintered Democratic field. If Mr. Biden were to run, he would no doubt make his foreign policy credentials, and Mr. Trump’s haphazard debut on the global stage, a major theme of his campaign. Now that Mr. Trump has embraced Mr. Biden’s plan for Afghanistan, he has blurred a line between him and Mr. Obama’s No. 2, as well as with the foreign policy establishment Mr. Trump ran against in 2016. “I had a strong sense of déjà vu listening to Trump’s speech,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “It’s almost as if our national security institutions and foreign policy elite are only capable of recycling different versions of some of the same ideas discussed for more than a decade and a half on Afghanistan.” "
"To the Editor: Re “In Speech, Trump Sets U.S. Strategy for Afghan War” (front page, Aug. 22): So after President Barack Obama tried to extricate us from the longest war in our history, President Trump is going to send thousands more American troops into Afghanistan without an exit strategy. Never mind the corrupt government, the ineffective Afghan Army, various warlords, the religious factions that have hated one another for a century. Why spill more blood and spend more money in an effort that is just plain stupid? TOM MINNERICK, ELGIN, ILL. To the Editor: President Trump was supposed to tell us about his new strategy for Afghanistan. I watched, I listened and I realized … same strategy, nothing new. I got suckered into what was nothing more than another effort to divert attention from the major kerfuffle about his comments on Charlottesville, Va. All in all it was a great speech, and kudos to the writer(s). But nothing new was learned about Afghanistan. So given the bait and switch, I would like a refund of my 30 minutes, please. LINDA WILLIAMS, MINT HILL, N.C. To the Editor: President Trump and the generals’ “new” strategy for Afghanistan is to kick the can down the road. Letting the generals make decisions based on conditions on the ground — to increase troop levels, to back them down or to get out, without any time frame — is to continue to muddle along. Muddling along isn’t a bad plan when you cannot come up with a better one. There is no real upside other than the postponement of the uncertainties of leaving now. But the downside is real: the continued sacrifice of our soldiers for an uncertain end. We remain on the horns of a dilemma. "
"WASHINGTON — Three American presidents have spent nearly 16 years alternately cajoling, coaxing, threatening and bombing Pakistan, all with a goal of trying to change the Pakistani government’s decisions about the factions it supports in Afghanistan’s desperate civil war. The latest of those, President Trump, tried a different approach during his speech on Monday night. After chastising Pakistan for harboring militants and terrorists, he called on India — Pakistan’s archrival — to flex its economic influence in Afghanistan to help stabilize the country. It was an unsubtle warning that Mr. Trump would not hesitate to put a thumb on one side of the balance in South Asian power politics, publicly drawing the United States closer to India while casting Pakistan as a friendless pariah state. But there was broad skepticism on Tuesday — both in Washington and Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan — that the tactic would force Pakistan’s government to abandon its longtime strategy in Afghanistan. Some even predicted that Mr. Trump’s approach would have the opposite effect, causing Pakistani military and intelligence leaders to recommit to the groups they have long supported in the Afghan conflict. Some said it would further cement links between Pakistan and China, which sees India as a rival in Asia. “Afghanistan continues to be a proxy war between New Delhi and Islamabad, and both sides see it as a zero-sum game,” said Seth G. Jones, an Afghanistan expert at the RAND Corporation, a policy research institute. “Will any of what Trump said move the dial in Islamabad? Probably not,” he said. American officials have spent years trying to persuade Pakistan to sever ties with the Taliban and the Haqqani network, one of its most dangerous factions, which Islamabad has historically seen as reliable proxies to advance Pakistani interests in Afghanistan and blunt Indian influence there. Officials said the support includes both active help with money and military equipment as well as benign neglect — allowing leaders of the groups to use western Pakistan as a base of operations for attacks into Afghanistan.

"The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises. What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility, complicated by the position of Mr. McConnell’s wife, Elaine L. Chao, in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, according to more than a dozen people briefed on their imperiled partnership. Angry phone calls and private badmouthing have devolved into open conflict, with the president threatening to oppose Republican senators who cross him, and Mr. McConnell mobilizing to their defense. The rupture between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell comes at a highly perilous moment for Republicans, who face a number of urgent deadlines when they return to Washington next month. Congress must approve new spending measures and raise the statutory limit on government borrowing within weeks of reconvening, and Republicans are hoping to push through an elaborate rewrite of the federal tax code. There is scant room for legislative error on any front. A protracted government shutdown or a default on sovereign debt could be disastrous — for the economy and for the party that controls the White House and both chambers of Congress. Yet Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell are locked in a political cold war. Neither man would comment for this article. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, noted that the senator and the president had “shared goals,” and pointed to “tax reform, infrastructure, funding the government, not defaulting on the debt, passing the defense authorization bill.” Still, the back-and-forth has been dramatic. In a series of tweets this month, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. McConnell publicly, and berated him in a phone call that quickly devolved into a profane shouting match. "
"Tony A. de Brum, a longtime political leader in the Republic of the Marshall Islands who helped negotiate his country’s independence in the 1970s and decades later fought for its survival in the face of climate change, died on Monday in the capital city, Majuro. He was 72. Hilda C. Heine, the country’s president, announced his death. President Heine called Mr. de Brum a “national hero” for advocating for nuclear disarmament and for giving the Marshall Islands, in the central Pacific, an outsize voice in global climate-change negotiations. In dozens of speeches to the United Nations over the years and in various government roles, Mr. de Brum would weave together the dominant themes of his country: the struggle for independence, the lingering suffering from nuclear testing that the islanders had endured, and the threat of rising sea levels from climate change. The 67 nuclear tests the United States conducted in the Marshall Islands from 1946 to 1958 led to widespread fallout contamination and numerous documented cases of illness and death related to radiation. The nuclear issue was vividly real to Mr. de Brum: As a boy, in 1954, he had witnessed from a fishing boat a test of what was then the most powerful nuclear bomb ever developed by the United States.

"KABUL, Afghanistan — Soon after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the United States military’s attention turned to Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda’s leaders were based. The world awaited an invasion that many knew was sure to come. What nobody knew was that the invasion to rout the Taliban and Al Qaeda would turn into a war that has now stretched into its 16th year — America’s longest. It has vexed three American presidencies and outlasted a dozen American military commanders. The war also opened a window into a country where modernity clashed with tribal customs and religious edicts. On Monday night, President Trump announced a new strategy for the war, bringing with it a possible increase in troop levels and a seemingly open-ended commitment to American involvement. Here in reverse-chronological order are images that depict the arc of the war, as seen through the eyes of New York Times photographers who shadowed the soldiers of the United States and its allies.

"Beginning in early 2017, I began asking teenagers around the country to make videos in which they responded to the following question: “What are your values as a person? What are American values? Do you think the country is living up to those values today? Why or why not?” Their answers have a new urgency in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, Va., which has brought lingering questions about America’s past, present and future to the forefront of the national conversation. The footage in the video above was all submitted before the rally in Charlottesville. I was inspired to collect it by my conversations with young people in the months following the 2016 election. It started with an election-week experiment — I wanted to hear what first-time voters in Pennsylvania had to say about starting their voting lives in what already felt, to me, like a historically bizarre time. In the weeks that followed, I talked to young protesters, youth reporters at a local newspaper and teenage environmental activists. Adults often dismiss teenagers, assuming that they’re callow, apathetic or uninformed. But the kids I was meeting cared passionately about education, foreign policy, racial justice and more. Even when they weren’t sure how they felt about a certain candidate or issue, they were clearly thinking deeply. Struck by what I’d heard, I decided to solicit young people’s opinions in a more systematic way, to paint a picture of how their generation sees the country today. That’s how this collection of personal videos came about. I wrote to dozens of teenagers — young people I’d met at protests, young Republicans I’d talked to around Election Day, teenagers who were already vlogging about their high school experiences on YouTube. I also reached out to Christian youth groups, home-schooling associations, L.G.B.T. rights organizations, groups representing Native American youth and many other organizations, asking them to recommend young people who might want to participate. My goal was to pull together a group that was diverse in as many ways as possible: geographically, politically and in terms of race, gender and sexual orientation. Not everyone said yes — one teenager wrote to me that “Trump could learn from President Putin how to deal with ‘journalists’ like yourself.” But in the end, I got more than 30 videos in which teenagers talked about their values. Some of them also agreed to submit follow-up videos in which they told me more about the communities where they lived. The video above contains a sampling of the videos the teenagers submitted. It’s not as scientific or wide-ranging as a poll or a survey. Instead, think of it as a kind of preview: This is how our country looks today to some of the young people who will help decide its future. "
"To the Editor: Re “Why Trump Loves Arizona,” by Tom Zoellner (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Aug. 23): With regard to Arizona’s affinity for President Trump and its rejection of political liberalism, one might at least point out that Arizona flourishes only as a result of handsome federal subsidies by and large financed by strapped taxpayers living elsewhere. In fact, in 2014, the Grand Canyon State received about 43 percent of its operating funds from the national government, the highest ratio in the country. Perhaps the most dismaying failure of liberal Democrats is their consistent inability to hammer home the extent that would-be rugged individualists (most of them white and disdainful of “welfare”) are in fact dependent on the kindness of strangers.

"Last week President Trump, facing a mutiny by American business leaders on two of his business advisory councils, abruptly shuttered them. The councils were largely ceremonial, but suddenly they were an opportunity for executives to take a stand against Mr. Trump’s equivocations following the recent white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. And the executives, not often looked to for moral guidance, were being lauded for taking a principled stand against the president. All of which raises a question. What about the people who actually are supposed to provide moral guidance — the president’s 25-member Evangelical Executive Advisory Board? The board, which Mr. Trump created in 2016 while he was running for president, is likewise a largely ceremonial body, though also one designed to give cover to the famously irreligious candidate and allow him an entree to millions of evangelical voters. In exchange, the board members got unprecedented access to the White House; one activist later said the president had them on “speed dial.” President Trump has also followed through on many of his promises to the evangelical community, such as nominating an anti-abortion jurist to the Supreme Court and taking on Planned Parenthood. But access comes at a price. While these leaders may think they are doing the right thing for their followers in keeping a clear line to the president, in doing so they are forced to be silent on his transgressions. So far only one member of the board, A. R. Bernard, a pastor in Brooklyn, has resigned, citing “a deepening conflict in values between myself and the administration.” Although he submitted his resignation on Aug. 15, Mr. Bernard said that he had already decided to leave a few months ago.

"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — At least seven people were killed Wednesday in southern Afghanistan, where a Taliban suicide car bombing struck an Afghan National Army convoy, Afghan officials said. It was the first major attack since President Trump announced his strategy for Afghanistan in a speech Monday night. Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the governor of Helmand Province, said that a car bomb exploded at the parking lot of the Police Headquarters of the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. The target appeared to be a parked convoy of soldiers, but the explosion killed two women and a child, as well as four soldiers. Another 38 people were wounded, most of them civilians, Mr. Zwak said. The parking lot was also used by civilians visiting the Police Headquarters. “Next to the bombing site we have a mosque in which children are studying religious subjects, they suffered casualties from the powerful bombing,” said Abdul Salam Afghan, a spokesman for the Helmand police. He said he did not know how many students were hurt, but that several were in critical condition. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.. In a statement emailed to reporters, the Taliban’s spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said that the attack was carried out by a member of the “Battalion of Martyrdom Seekers,” which targeted a convoy of Afghan forces inside the Police Headquarters. The Taliban control most of Helmand Province outside the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, where suicide attacks by the insurgents are common. As the Taliban have gained territory through the country, they have killed government forces at the highest rate of the war. On an average day, 31 Afghan police officers and soldiers are killed, as well as nine civilians, according to official data. "
"ALBUQUERQUE — Wander into El Super, a sprawling grocery store in the same valley where fortune seekers on horseback laid claim nearly four centuries ago to one of Spain’s most remote possessions, and the resilience of the language they brought with them stands on display. Reggaetón, the musical genre born in Puerto Rico, blares from the speakers. Shoppers mull bargains in the accents of northern Mexico. A carnicería offers meat, a panadería bread, a salchichonería cold cuts, and there’s also a tortillería — that one’s self-explanatory for many who never even studied the language of Cervantes. “Everything I need here is in Spanish,” said Vanessa Quezada, 23, an immigrant from the Mexican state of Chihuahua, gesturing toward the branch of the First Convenience Bank, where tellers greet people with a smile and “Buenas tardes.” Indeed, the United States is emerging as a vast laboratory showcasing the remarkable endurance of Spanish, no matter the political climate.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump has widened an extraordinary rift with his own party, as he threatened a government shutdown over his long-promised border wall and attacked key lawmakers whose votes he needs heading into a crucial legislative period. The escalating tensions between the Republican president and the Republican Congress endanger delicate negotiations in the coming weeks to overhaul the tax system, keep the government running and avoid a costly default on the country’s debt. They are the clearest signs to date that the uncomfortable alliance between Mr. Trump, who won the presidency promising to “drain the swamp,” and Republican lawmakers who hoped to enact long-stalled conservative priorities, has begun to fray. In a challenge to Republicans late Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened to shut down the government in a matter of weeks if Congress did not fund the wall on the southern border that was a signature promise of his campaign for the White House. “If we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” Mr. Trump told a raucous rally in Phoenix as his supporters chanted, “Build that wall!” “The American people voted for immigration control — that’s one of the reasons I’m here,” he added. “One way or the other, we’re going to get that wall.” On Wednesday, he followed up on the threat by attacking Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who has said he is skeptical of building a border wall between the United States and Mexico unless, as Mr. Trump promised, Mexico pays for it. Mr. Flake is one of two Republican senators up for re-election next year in a swing state, and the president has put his finger on the scale toward a primary challenger, Kelli Ward. "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump has invited Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia to visit the White House in September despite Mr. Najib’s involvement in a billion-dollar corruption scandal. The White House said in a statement on Wednesday that the visit was intended to “strengthen and broaden our bilateral relationship and expand regional cooperation with one of America’s closest partners in Southeast Asia.” The invitation represents a significant boost to Mr. Najib’s international standing and is likely to put to rest rumors in Malaysia that he would be arrested the next time he stepped on American soil. In July, the Justice Department filed a civil complaint in a money-laundering case outlining how Mr. Najib, identified as “Malaysian Official 1,” received $731 million from a government fund he oversaw. Investigators around the world are tracking the money trail to his bank accounts in what has become a billion-dollar scandal. Critics say the visit, scheduled for Sept. 12, also demonstrates that the Trump administration places concerns about corruption well behind other issues. Mr. Najib is yet another visitor to the Trump White House with a history of suppressing free speech and intimidating the political opposition, said Robert G. Berschinski of the advocacy group Human Rights First. The invitation is “just another sign that this White House pays only lip service — if that — to the idea that promoting human rights or fighting corruption redounds to the benefit of the United States,” he said. Since abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that would have tied together a dozen nations and 40 percent of the world’s economy, the Trump administration has been casting about for ways to regain its lost clout in Southeast Asia, a region increasingly dominated by China.

"President Trump’s angry condemnation of the news media during a campaign-style rally on Tuesday heightened the fear among journalists that verbal attacks on the profession could lead to physical attacks. While criticizing media coverage has long been a surefire tactic to rile up crowds, the depth of the president’s most recent jabs took even seasoned journalists by surprise. He called journalists “sick people,” accused the news media of “trying to take away our history and our heritage” and questioned their patriotism. “I really think they don’t like our country,” he said. Throughout the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump would frequently turn the attention of rallygoers to the areas containing journalists, who would then be greeted with obscenities and taunts. Journalists are well-accustomed to being disliked at his rallies. But Tuesday’s remarks struck a tone that alarmed journalists more than usual. Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist for The Washington Post, called it “the most sustained attack any president has ever made on the press.” “To see this sort of attack coming yet again from the president is deeply disturbing,” said Courtney C. Radsch, the advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists. “It creates an environment in which attacks on the press, both verbal and potentially physical, could become common.” There has been little doubt that journalists have faced increasing harassment online, leading to widespread self-censorship, Dr. Radsch said. Journalists have been targets of “doxxing,” or publishing sensitive personal information like phone numbers and home addresses of the journalists and their families. "
"The screenwriters Tracy Oliver and Kenya Barris set their sights on “Girls Trip” the moment they heard murmurings about the project, a comedy that would examine the friendship among four black women attending the Essence Festival in New Orleans. That film, released in July, just made history by being the first with an all-black creative team in front of and behind the camera to earn $100 million at the box office. (It’s also the first time a female African-American writer has ever reached that milestone.) The two now hope the film’s success will lead to more movies starring black actors and created by black writers. In phone interviews on Tuesday, Ms. Oliver, whose credits include the web series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,” and Mr. Barris, the showrunner of the ABC comedy “black-ish,” discussed what the film’s success may or may not mean for future Hollywood productions, and the role their work is playing in national conversations about racism. Here are edited excerpts from the conversations: “Girls Trip” just crossed the $100 million threshold. What does this accomplishment mean to you and what does it mean about the possibilities for films starring black actors and written by black writers? TRACY OLIVER I could not believe it, I basically went online and tried to fact-check it myself because I was like, “That cannot be true.” What I realized is that this represented an issue that still needs to be fixed because there are movies like “Hidden Figures,” for example, that have black women in lead roles that have grossed over $100 million but when you look into them further, most of the time they’re not written by black people at all. That’s something producers and studios need to take a harder look into and start reaching out to people of color more often. KENYA BARRIS It opens up the possibility for what it means to be a person of color in this industry, a woman, all at the same time. The thing that is most interesting to me is what it is doing for the international box office. Traditionally we have been told that our movies don’t do well overseas. That is one of the biggest obstacles to making movies with people of color and I’m actually seeing that this movie is having some steam overseas. Do you think it will translate into more films being made? OLIVER I hope that it translates into more opportunities. Personally I’ve seen my opportunities increase and all of the opportunities that I’m interested in are about black women. As far as the industry at large, if there’s been an uptick or increase in opportunities, I can’t speak to that. I hope that it’s not a Halle Berry situation, where it takes another decade or so before you see any kind of increase again. "
"Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, has faced unease and frustration in his newsroom over his stewardship of the newspaper’s coverage of President Trump, which some journalists there say has lacked toughness and verve. Some staff members expressed similar concerns on Wednesday after Mr. Baker, in a series of blunt late-night emails, criticized his staff over their coverage of Mr. Trump’s Tuesday rally in Phoenix, describing their reporting as overly opinionated. “Sorry. This is commentary dressed up as news reporting,” Mr. Baker wrote at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday morning to a group of Journal reporters and editors, in response to a draft of the rally article that was intended for the newspaper’s final edition. He added in a follow-up, “Could we please just stick to reporting what he said rather than packaging it in exegesis and selective criticism?” A copy of Mr. Baker’s emails was reviewed by The New York Times. Several phrases about Mr. Trump that appeared in the draft of the article reviewed by Mr. Baker were not included in the final version published on The Journal’s website. The draft, in its lead paragraph, described the Charlottesville, Va., protests as “reshaping” Mr. Trump’s presidency. That mention was removed. The draft also described Mr. Trump’s Phoenix speech as “an off-script return to campaign form,” in which the president “pivoted away from remarks a day earlier in which he had solemnly called for unity.” That language does not appear in the article’s final version. Contacted about the emails on Wednesday, a Wall Street Journal spokeswoman wrote in a statement: “The Wall Street Journal has a clear separation between news and opinion. As always, the key priority is to focus reporting on facts and avoid opinion seeping into news coverage.” In February, Mr. Baker fielded tough questions at an all-hands staff meeting about whether the newspaper’s reporting on Mr. Trump was too soft. Mr. Baker denied that notion, and he suggested that other newspapers had abandoned their objectivity about the president; he also encouraged journalists unhappy with the Journal’s coverage to seek employment elsewhere. But apprehensiveness in the newsroom has persisted. This month, Politico obtained and published a transcript of a White House interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mr. Baker and several Journal reporters and editors. Unusually for an editor in chief, Mr. Baker took a leading role in the interview and made small talk with Mr. Trump about travel and playing golf. When Ivanka Trump, the president’s older daughter, walked into the Oval Office, Mr. Baker told her, according to the transcript, “It was nice to see you out in Southampton a couple weeks ago,” apparently referring to a party that the two had attended. The Wall Street Journal is owned by the media magnate Rupert Murdoch, who speaks regularly with Mr. Trump and recently dined with the president at the White House. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump often talks about “clean coal” in his speeches, but it is not always clear what he means by the term. Consider his comments at a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday night. “We’ve ended the war on beautiful, clean coal,” Mr. Trump said. “And it’s just been announced that a second brand-new coal mine where they’re going to take out clean coal — meaning they’re taking out coal, they’re going to clean it — is opening in the state of Pennsylvania.” That’s a little confusing, to say the least. The term “clean coal” was popularized in 2008 by coal industry groups, at a time when Congress was contemplating climate change legislation. While the term is deliberately vague, it is often understood to mean coal plants that capture the carbon dioxide emitted from smokestacks and bury it underground as a way of limiting global warming. This technology, known as carbon capture and storage, is still in its infancy. Only one coal plant in the United States, the Petra Nova project in Texas, actually captures CO2 in this fashion, having come online in January with the help of $190 million from the Obama administration. The carbon dioxide is pumped underground into nearby oil fields to help extract hard-to-reach crude. "
"The emergence of Great Wall Motors as a potential partner for Jeep highlights just how much Fiat Chrysler, Jeep’s owner, has looked to China to help bolster its fortunes. The New York Times notes that Fiat Chrysler has openly sought investors for two years and, as early as last year, the carmaker sent a team specializing in mergers and acquisitions to China. The Italian-controlled automaker had been in discussions with Chinese companies about potential equity investments or deals involving its Ram pickup division and the Jeep brand. Then Great Wall, a big maker of sport utility vehicles, made public its interest in Jeep. Great Wall was not one of the companies with which Fiat Chrysler had been talking — but that doesn’t mean Fiat Chrysler wasn’t interested. Investors reacted by sending Fiat Chrysler shares trading in New York to their highest point in more than two years. But a sale to a Chinese buyer could be problematic. It might be subject to government reviews. Great Wall — which acknowledged that it hadn’t actually contacted Fiat Chrysler because of “big uncertainties” about how to proceed — may struggle to secure financing or approval for the deal. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The path to the governorship of California winds through the Central Valley. That, at least, is the idea animating the candidacy of Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a former two-term mayor of Los Angeles and speaker of the State Assembly. While California is a blue state, candidates in the 2018 governor’s race won’t be able to rely on Democratic votes alone. Among registered voters, roughly 45 percent are Democrats, and 26 percent Republican. Mr. Villaraigosa, 64, was raised by a single mother in a poor neighborhood on Los Angeles’s Eastside. In speeches and interviews, he has portrayed himself as a potential champion of California’s interior, where he spent time during an extended “listening tour” that began in 2015. Along the way, he’s taken shots at his better-funded rival, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and former San Francisco mayor, whose candidacy has been a favorite of voters in the Bay Area. "
"When President Trump sought solace from arguably the most disastrous week of his presidency, he headed toward Arizona — and seemed to have a grand old time. His speech Tuesday in Phoenix was classic Trump: He lambasted the “very dishonest media,” for almost a half hour; he relitigated his Charlottesville responses in petulant detail; he defended Confederate statues as “our history and our heritage.” And, just for fun, he dangled a possible pardon for Joe Arpaio, the hometown authoritarian former sheriff who was convicted of criminal contempt in July. What better venue for Mr. Trump, praised just the night before as presidential during his Afghanistan speech, to revert to his natural form? Arizona, after all, is the state that effectively made him president, and not merely for the 11 electoral votes it awarded him last November. The 45th president’s journey from a stunt candidate to a serious force began in Phoenix, on July 11, 2015, less than a month after his escalator-ride announcement in which he spontaneously excoriated Mexican immigrants as “rapists.” His tiny staff found themselves overwhelmed with ticket requests for a rally at a Phoenix hotel and had to book the Phoenix Convention Center on short notice. Something was about to burst forth that nobody full understood at the time — perhaps not even Mr. Trump himself. A few immigration activists showed up with banners, and were immediately set upon by an angry crowd of rally attendees who had just discovered that a loudmouth with a Queens accent was just the right person to shout their frustrations by proxy. Perhaps not coincidentally, this was one of the first rallies of his campaign to be broadcast live on cable. The rowdiness and near-gladiatorial atmosphere — along with the symbiotic and contradictory dynamic of media-bashing and media glare — made for ratings gold and would persist at Trump rallies through the campaign. But this strange recipe got its first taste-test in Phoenix. He started his campaign polling in seventh place; after that 2015 appearance in Phoenix, he was in the lead. And the crowds were genuinely impressive: The convention center was packed to its capacity of 4,200, though Mr. Trump later exaggerated the number by a factor of three. He made reference to its size again on Tuesday night. “The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight,” he marveled. “Believe me Arizona, I will never forget.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Trump blames media for divisions. After a statesmanlike address on Monday about national unity, President Trump preached division at a raucous rally Tuesday night in Phoenix. (Watch video excerpts here.) The president accused the news media of misrepresenting his condemnation of bigotry after the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., and suggested that journalists were responsible for deepening divisions in the country. Outside, the police used tear gas to disperse thousands. Mr. Trump also implied that he planned to pardon Joe Arpaio, a former sheriff in Arizona convicted over his roundups of undocumented immigrants. “I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,” the president said. “I’ll make a prediction: I think he’s going to be just fine.” "

"President Trump deserves high marks for his new Afghanistan strategy. It is bold, reasoned and offers the prospect of success against the violent Islamist groups of the region. But it will also face opposition in the region. The president will have to show an unflagging commitment to the cause and be prepared to respond to moves by adversaries to disrupt his plan. The deliberative process worked well to arrive at this strategy. The administration reviewed American interests and objectives broadly, and all the key agencies participated effectively. The president’s admission that he changed his mind and shifted away from a rapid withdrawal is a sign of his seriousness of purpose and thoroughness of the review. Mr. Trump is now the third successive president to acknowledge America’s important national security interests in Afghanistan and the region, which include the threat of Islamist extremism and terrorism, even the potential for nuclear terrorism. He recognizes that abandoning Afghanistan would allow safe havens for international terrorist organizations to emerge once more. The new strategy is not only comprehensive but also a major evolution in American policy. Though he did not specify numbers, the president indicated that he will deploy a surge of United States forces, without any timeline for their withdrawal — the error of the Obama administration. Another major change from the Obama era is Mr. Trump’s decision to give American commanders in the field the flexibility they’ve long sought in assisting the Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and other insurgents. The president also adopted a realistic position regarding peace talks, moving away from President Barack Obama’s pursuit of reconciliation regardless of the deteriorating military situation. A key element of the new strategy is the recognition that America needs a new approach toward Pakistan. Unlike his two predecessors in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has chosen to address the fact that Pakistan has been playing a double game. He unequivocally called out Pakistan for pretending to be a partner and receiving large-scale American assistance while providing sanctuary and support for the Taliban and the Haqqani terrorist network, which have been killing Americans and Afghans.

"Only three blocks long, Central Park South is lined on one side with busy buildings, where people live in apartments that are mostly pricey and often glamorous. Squirrels and statues reside on the other side, among the trees of Central Park. Patients who visit Dr. Daniel Kaplan, a periodontist and implant specialist who works in one building facing the park and lives in another a block away, often tell him that the view from his chair is “very calming,” he said. “It’s a soothing view. With each changing season, the park has a different coat.” Dr. Kaplan, 61, said he enjoyed the view so much that after opening his office at 200 Central Park South, in a mostly residential condominium, in 1989, he began looking for an apartment nearby. In 1994, he bought a two-bedroom, two-bath condo at 100 Central Park South, also known as Trump Parc East, with a panorama that extends to the park’s northern edge 51 blocks away. “You’ll laugh,” he said when asked the price: “I paid $750,000.” (At the moment, apartments in the building are listed for $2 million to $7 million, according to StreetEasy.) At first, he used the apartment on workdays, while his wife, Tova, and their three children, still in school, stayed in the leafy Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale. But these days, he and Tova spend most of their time there. “Riverdale is now the country house,” he said. “This street used to be hotel row,” he added. “Now, it’s more residential.” Most of the hotels have been completely or partially converted to condos or co-ops. Central Park, Dr. Kaplan said, “is our gym.” He jogs, walks and ice skates there. “We’re not planning to sell the apartment, ever.” This short stretch along the park has become a “micro-neighborhood,” said Lawrence Lee, an associate broker at Triplemint real estate. “An identity has formed: It’s fun and exciting, with people on the street speaking every language imaginable,” he said.

"We’re supposed to be fixated, at the moment, on the shock of a president capable of finding “fine people” among hordes of white supremacists. More than a week ago, Donald Trump spent a lot of a news conference asserting such a thing was possible. According to him, there isn’t much difference between the supremacists who were protesting the removal of a statue memorializing the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in a park in Charlottesville, Va., and the appalled folks responding with a protest of their own. And that’s despite the murder of one and the injury of dozens of others after a 20-year-old nationalist plowed his car into a crowd. But to watch the movies or TV — or even to catch the hype for a certain boxing match — is to know that normalized white supremacy has been here all summer. It’s to know that the people who manufacture all sorts of popular culture have also, intentionally or not, tossed some racism onto the assembly line. It’s to know that whatever occurred in Charlottesville and then at that news conference didn’t happen in a vacuum. They were just the gnarliest flare-ups in a season of provocations that seem so business-as-usual that they scarcely feel provoked. How else could anyone explain Lee? Not the aforementioned hero of the Confederacy but the dunce from ABC’s “The Bachelorette.” Normally, “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” feature a gentleman or a lady who leaps into a heterosexual pool of suitors and climbs out with a potential spouse. That was more or less true this season, too. Only, for the first time ever, a black woman took the plunge. And the show, which concluded earlier this month, seemed to be of two minds: It didn’t want to make a big deal about it but understood what a big deal it was. So it played games. Before its official kickoff, in a sort of televised tailgate party, the bachelorette, Rachel, met a few of her suitors. One was a sweetie named Dean, who told her that he was “ready to go black,” as if he were preparing to head deep into outer space. But at least he seemed to understand the journey. Lee, a white musician from Florida, was stuck on dreary old Earth. His interest in Rachel went only as far as robbing other contestants of time with her. His primary targets were the other black men on the show, namely Kenny, a charming pro wrestler, whom Lee characterized to Rachel as “aggressive” and about whom he fabricated an altercation that culminated in Kenny’s heaving Lee from a van.

"Growing up, I was aware of the kids-don’t-like-vegetables trope, but it didn’t make much sense to me. I never had any choice; all the traditional Iranian dishes my mom cooked teemed with herbs and vegetables. There was no eating around the fava beans, celery and eggplant that made up the fragrant rice and stew ­dishes she served each night, though my younger brothers certainly tried. I ate the food but didn’t think much of the vegetables one way or the other. Then I moved to Berkeley for college, and for the first time, I understood how someone could hate her vegetables: The pallid, overcooked steam-table brussels sprouts and zucchini served in the dining hall were depressing at best. So when I started busing tables at Chez Panisse a couple of years later, I wasn’t prepared for the daily sight of grown men and women cooing over fruits and vegetables. Soon after, I began working in the kitchen and quickly learned why each produce delivery was met with such excitement: flawless, just-picked vegetables are sweeter and more flavorful than anything you can get at the store. I learned to cook vegetables with the aim of preserving that perfection. That usually meant doing as little to them as possible. Much of the time, we’d simply boil the haricots verts, marble-size turnips or thick spears of asparagus in ample, salted water until they were barely cooked through, then pull them out and let them cool on a baking sheet in the fridge. We’d later quickly reheat them in boiling water or a sauté pan, then drizzle them with immoderate amounts of fruity olive oil before serving. No matter the vegetable, the only rule in the kitchen was ‘‘do not overcook.’’ The memory of that dining-hall mush was enough to scare me straight; my green beans were always perfectly crisp. Then I went to Italy. I apprenticed myself to Benedetta Vitali, a Florentine chef who ran a tiny trattoria on the outskirts of town. Eager to please my new boss, I tried to work ahead on the prep list one morning while she was upstairs in the office. I found the filet beans among the vegetable delivery, set a huge pot of water on the stove and trimmed away the stems while the water came to a boil. I cooked them just as I’d learned to in California, careful not to let all of the crunch boil away. I pulled them, vibrant and sweet, from the water and let them cool. Benedetta came downstairs. She cocked her head and picked up a green bean. ‘‘Who cooked these beans raw?’’ she asked, her voice incredulous, while the inch-long ash from her dangling cigarette threatened to fall onto the tray. Mortified, I took responsibility. She chuckled and poked fun at my American way with vegetables. ‘‘The only thing that should be cooked al dente here,’’ she said, ‘‘is pasta.’’ Then she heated a big, shallow pot, added a generous splash of olive oil and garlic, tossed in the green beans and lightly browned them. She turned down the heat, handed me the wooden spoon and told me to keep an eye on the pot for two hours. I was simultaneously horrified about how overcooked they’d be in that time and deeply ashamed about how far off I’d been. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump called himself a “problem solver” on Monday during his address on the war in Afghanistan. On “The Daily Show” the next night, Trevor Noah offered a second opinion. He said Mr. Trump’s speech hadn’t offered much in the way of specifics. Conan O’Brien wasn’t sure how responsible Mr. Trump was for preparing his prepared remarks.

"Here was Donald Trump tethered by his generals. The new-old Afghan war strategy set out by the president Monday night contained a Trump line or two — terrorists as “losers,” the nixing of “nation-building” — but was the work of the adults in the room. They forced the commander-in-chief to curtail his wilder instincts. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, both have bitter experience of Afghanistan. John Kelly, the chief of staff, lost his 29-year-old son, First Lt. Robert Kelly, there. They were not about to let Trump declare Afghanistan “a complete waste,” as he did in 2012, and walk away. In a sense this is reassuring. Trump is not home alone. He fires off, gets a lesson on the real world, bridles again, and is momentarily muted. Qatar, North Korea, Iran and Charlottesville: the pattern repeats itself. It’s ominous but it has not sent the world over a cliff, yet. And now we have Afghanistan, the nearly 16-year-old war that just became Trump’s war, against the wishes of Steve Bannon, his ousted chief strategist. The decision not to leave was the right decision; and Trump was also right to note that telegraphing future pullout dates for American troops, as President Obama did, is military folly. Ashraf Ghani, the embattled Afghan president, needs United States help in holding the line against an invigorated Taliban. But what Trump announced did not amount to a strategy, let alone a new one. It amounted rather, in the tweeted words of Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert at New York University, to “a set of incoherent slogans.” Trump talked plenty about “victory” but did not even attempt to define what would constitute it. That’s because there can be no military victory in Afghanistan. The best that can be hoped for is keeping the Taliban from power, and bolstering government forces to the point the Taliban can be persuaded to sue for peace. In other words, the end game can only be diplomatic. "

"Berlin — To many Germans, the violence in Charlottesville, Va., this month and the American president’s reaction to it came as a shock. Even those who have come to expect little of Donald Trump — he’s a uniquely unpopular figure among Germans — were aghast. “It’s racist, far-right violence, and that requires determined and forceful resistance no matter where in the world it appears,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said. What a strange moment, when the German chancellor lectures the American president on how to deal with neo-Nazis. But it’s also an instructive one, in that it highlights how the two countries deal with extremism. In Germany, the very presence of neo-Nazis openly marching through a city bearing swastika-emblazoned flags, as in Charlottesville, is unthinkable. Unlike the United States, Germany places strict limits on speech and expression when it comes to right-wing extremism. It is illegal to produce, distribute or display symbols of the Nazi era — swastikas, the Hitler salute, along with many symbols that neo-Nazis have developed as proxies to get around the initial law. Holocaust denial is also illegal. The law goes further. There is the legal concept of “Volksverhetzung,” the incitement to hatred: Anybody who denigrates an individual or a group based on their ethnicity or religion, or anybody who tries to rouse hatred or promotes violence against such a group or an individual, could face a sentence of up to five years in prison. These laws apply to individuals, but they and others are also defenses against extremist political parties. The Constitutional Court, Germany’s highest court, can ban parties it deems intent on impairing or destroying the political order. This year the court came close to banning the extremist right-wing National Democratic Party but determined the organization was too weak to outlaw. This legal regime is backed by a political culture that effectively bans expression that might pass legal muster but still flirts with racist ideologies. The German right-wing-populist Alternative for Germany is a good example. Though its program and members do not openly embrace or reference Nazism, the party’s program dabbles in ideas that might be construed as racist, and as a result the party is considered untouchable by mainstream voters and politicians.

"It should be no surprise that The Village Voice has ended its print edition in favor of an online, digital-only presence. The alternative newspaper, whose weekly edition once helped set New York’s political and cultural agenda, is merely going the same route as a slew of other newspapers and magazines before it. It’s a path likely to be well-trod by others in the near future. At least the publication will continue, which is more than The Boston Phoenix or The San Francisco Bay Guardian or a host of other late-lamented alt-weeklies can say. “Welcome to the 21st Century,” was one nostalgia-spiking tweet that popped up within minutes of The Voice’s press release. And yet, the announcement by The Voice’s current owner that he is cutting his losses by giving up ink, paper, delivery trucks and the red plastic bins on the street corners that made you fear for your health each time you reached inside had the unmistakable feel of one more piece of Old New York slipping away. It’s a loss that hardly ranks with the deaths earlier this year of two of The Voice’s great stalwarts — Nat Hentoff, whose columns on civil liberties and other issues were a weekly feature for 50 years, and Wayne Barrett, the old-school muckraker who was the first to report on a craftily ambitious young developer named Trump. The paper laid off both men in recent years in response to earlier economic concerns. Yet both would doubtlessly cheer for the paper to soldier on, even if no one will ever again spread a copy over a bar or across a table in a Greenwich Village coffee house. Hentoff and Barrett were just among the longest serving of a list of writers far too long to assemble who made The Voice, over several generations since its 1955 founding, a touchstone for against-the-grain journalism.

"The Trump administration has no grounds for blocking the “fiduciary rule,” an Obama-era regulation that requires financial advisers to put their clients’ interests first when giving advice or selling investments for retirement accounts. But blocking the rule remains an administration priority, no matter how arbitrary, capricious and harmful that would be. In one of his first acts in office, President Trump effectively delayed the rule’s implementation date, April 10, by issuing a memorandum that called for its review and possible rollback. The Labor Department, which has jurisdiction over the issue, could find no legal way to alter or rescind the rule, so it took effect on June 9, with one catch: The department said it would not enforce the rule until Jan. 1, 2018, ostensibly to give financial firms time to adapt. Then this month, the department  requested a further enforcement delay, to July 1, 2019. The request will be considered by none other than the White House Office of Management and Budget, which vets regulation. This is obstruction, pure and simple. The fiduciary rule was debated and drafted over many years, before being completed in 2016. Since then, it has survived several legal challenges in federal court brought by the financial industry. In one of the cases, decided in February, the judge described the industry’s arguments as “without merit,” “unpersuasive” and “at odds with market realities.” Those judgments, as well as copious research that preceded the rule-making, attest to its importance: The fiduciary rule, properly enforced, would prevent banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies from steering customers into overly expensive products and strategies when comparable lower-cost option are available; such steering annually drains tens of billions of dollars in excessive fees from Americans’ retirement savings. Still the Trump administration persists in its efforts to derail the fiduciary rule. Why? Several financial firms that have already made strides in adapting to the rules may pine for a return to the old days, but that can’t be the whole story. Another plausible explanation is fear on Wall Street that consumers and regulators might someday demand similar, customer-first standards for all financial advisers, not just those handling retirement accounts.

"SANA, Yemen — At least 30 civilians were killed or wounded on Wednesday, the first day in two months that airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition struck targets around the capital of Yemen, a United Nations official said. Estimates of casualties made by the authorities in Sana, dominated by the Houthi rebels who are fighting the Saudis, were even higher, putting the toll at 71 dead or wounded from at least three airstrikes around the capital. For more than two years, the Saudis have been fighting the Houthi rebels, whom they believe are receiving military support from Iran, Saudi Arabia’s regional rival. Saudi officials have insisted their aircraft avoid civilian targets, but hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities have been struck by Saudi warplanes. Last October, the coalition confirmed that one of its jets had accidentally bombed a wedding party in Sana, killing 100 people. Because of the risk of civilian casualties, the Saudis have said they were refraining from airstrikes in and around the capital, but the attacks resumed on Wednesday without explanation. The last airstrikes in Sana were in June. The resumption of airstrikes in the area comes as the Houthi rebels and their allies around former president Ali Abdullah Saleh have been on the verge of turning on one another. The Houthis have accused Mr. Saleh of trying to negotiate separately with the Saudi-led coalition, which supports the ousted government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, now exiled to the southern part of the country. Mr. Saleh has responded by ridiculing the Houthis’ ideology. "
"President Trump’s seesawing response to the deadly racial violence in Charlottesville, Va., has been rebuked by countless politicians, business executives, community groups and religious leaders. The leaders of Britain and Germany spoke about the need to condemn such violence. Now the United Nations has weighed in, too. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, a body of United Nations experts on Wednesday denounced “the failure at the highest political level of the United States of America to unequivocally reject and condemn” racist violence, saying it was “deeply concerned by the example this failure could set for the rest of the world.” Mr. Trump’s wavering responses to the violence — he has blamed “many sides,” but also singled out the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi groups and white supremacists for condemnation — has roiled his administration, but also unsettled rights advocates around the world. “We were shocked and horrified by what happened,” the committee’s chairwoman, Anastasia Crickley, said in an interview, expressing disgust at the televised images of white supremacists’ torchlit parade through Charlottesville. “I was horrified as well by the way leaders of that movement were able to state afterwards that they felt secure in their support.” In a two-page decision that was dated Aug. 18 but released on Wednesday, a day after Washington was informed, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination invoked “early action and urgent warning procedures” in deploring the violence and urging the United States to investigate.

"The Plaza Hotel, with its marble lobby facing Fifth Avenue, crystal chandeliers, famed Palm Court and $35,000-a-night royal suite, has been a star of stage and screen in Manhattan for many decades. Now it’s at the center of an international battle over who will control one of New York’s enduring icons. Subrata Roy, the embattled chairman of the India-based Sahara Group and the principal owner of the Plaza, who has repeatedly put the hotel up for sale without ever making a deal, is looking for a buyer once again. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Mr. Roy had hired the JLL Hotels and Hospitality Group, which has represented him and his company for years, to begin soliciting offers. But Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation, a New York investment and development company, which together own a 25 percent stake in the hotel, have their own plans for the Plaza. And they don’t include Mr. Roy. The prince, who has been an owner of the hotel since 1995, formed a partnership with Ashkenazy earlier this year to buy out Mr. Roy and restore the Plaza to its five-star grandeur. Under the ownership agreement, the partners have the right to match any offer for the hotel and to take it over, according to real estate executives who have been briefed on the agreement and who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to disclose the details. “We are not selling our stake and are comfortable with our rights relating to any sale by others,” said Sarmad Zok, chief executive of the prince’s company, Kingdom Hotel Investments. “We are proud to have partnered with Ashkenazy to reinstate the glory of this unique asset.” "
"Tucked in the lower lobby of Trump Tower, near the restrooms, is a newsstand that long sold the usual fare of periodicals, lottery tickets, miniature yellow cabs and “I ♥ New York” T-shirts. Then came the election of Donald J. Trump. Now the stand, Roger’s News, has morphed into an outpost for Trump memorabilia, from $1 postcards to $40 bobblehead dolls. “People come to Trump Tower for Trump, and I give them Trump,” said the owner, Roger Sewani, 58, who began stocking Trump memorabilia after the presidential election. He has watched his little shop turn into a gold mine. “I’d say 90 percent of what we sell now is Trump.” Mr. Sewani rang up sale after sale in his cramped shop in the glitzy Fifth Avenue skyscraper that was Mr. Trump’s longtime home before moving to the White House. He said that tourists are eager for Trump items that come from “the source.” “They want to buy a souvenir from where he lived, the most authentic place,” said Mr. Sewani, who still sells Powerball tickets to local New Yorkers and snacks to Secret Service agents posted at the building. Gone from the shelves, however, are magazines and newspapers, to make room for Trump-themed merchandise. Most of the sales now are to tourists who make the shop one of the few places in New York City where one can find almost unanimous devotion to the president. "

ne of my favorite things about living abroad has always been the way that distance adds a fresh perspective on wherever it is one calls home. In my case, I often feel as though I never see the United States quite so clearly as I do when I’ve just returned after a long time away, which was the case last week. I was home for a wedding, a bit of work and a little vacation, and at every stop, I found myself marveling at the sheer American-ness of conversations and experiences. In my last newsletter, I shared a few of my impressions about Australia. What you’ll find below is its American counterpart — what I noticed in one small corner of the U.S. after months away, and what stood out more clearly in part because of my experience in Australia. Americans Are Exhausted Love him or hate him, Donald Trump seems to be wearing people out. Many of the journalists I talked to seemed spent, tired from covering a country that seems to convulse again and again, with each passing week. And among voters on opposite sides of the Trump divide, I heard a lot of exasperation and not a whole lot of understanding. A few Trump critics I saw at my friend’s wedding chewed over every speech and every new development after the Charlottesville protests; others seemed to have less capacity for continuous outrage, offering little more than an “I know” and a shake of the head, asking how anyone could see any Trump as a positive force.

"RENO, Nev. — President Trump reverted to his script as commander in chief here on Wednesday. The morning after he delivered an aggrieved and impromptu defense of his comments on the violence in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump spoke in a more measured tone to the national convention of the American Legion, telling its members that “we are not defined by the color of our skin,” and that the country will overcome its challenges by reaffirming its common values. “We are here to hold you up as an example of strength, courage and resolve that our country will need to overcome the many challenges that we face,” the president said, speaking slowly and gravely as he read from a teleprompter. “We are here to draw inspiration from you as we seek to renew the bonds of loyalty that bind us together as one people and one nation.” It was a day-and-night contrast to Mr. Trump’s performance Tuesday night in Phoenix, where he lurched from subject to subject and accused the news media of ignoring what he insisted had been his message of unity in the aftermath of Charlottesville. But such contrasts have become a recurring motif of his presidency: Mr. Trump has toggled between Teleprompter Trump and Unplugged Trump every day since the deadly clashes in Virginia, leaving Washington and the rest of the nation with a chronic case of rhetorical whiplash. The split speaking personality is not new. Mr. Trump spent years mocking President Barack Obama for using a teleprompter. But ever since Mr. Trump won his first round of primaries and his path toward the Republican presidential nomination became likelier, his family members and some supporters have urged him — not with a lot of success — to professionalize his performances, and to try to avoid the dangers of the kind of spontaneous remarks he made in Arizona.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. As I listened to President Trump outline his new strategy in Afghanistan, I could not help wondering what his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was thinking. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, lost his son in Afghanistan in 2010. Shortly afterward, Kelly gave a eulogy for two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter, who were killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. The speech, published in 2013 by Business Insider, makes powerful reading, not least because the quality of unflinching valor evoked by Kelly sits at such a distance from Trump, a man whose fascination with the military is equaled only by his failure to come close to the “selflessness, courage and resolve” of America’s troops. Yale and Haerter, faced by an explosives-laden truck barreling down on them, did not flinch. As Kelly put it, “With their feet spread shoulder width apart, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could work their weapons. They had only one second left to live. The truck explodes. The camera goes blank. Two young men go to their God.” He concluded: “Not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag, or about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty...into eternity. That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight — for you.” Yale and Haerter were 22 and 20, respectively. Kelly’s son, First Lieutenant Robert Kelly, was 29. Such sacrifice demands more and better than a commander in chief who attempts (via Twitter!) to ban transgender people from the military and who, as a candidate, insulted the Muslim parents of a fallen American officer in Iraq. Trump’s Afghan strategy is full of holes. Militarizing American foreign policy while relegating diplomacy will bring no victories. But the deeper issue with Trump is his moral unfitness, his shifting neediness. How do those who serve him coax this troubling fact from their minds? "

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday released a major report urging actions to protect the “reliability and resilience” of the nation’s electric grid, a move that could lay the groundwork for future support of America’s ailing coal and nuclear industries. The 187-page study, commissioned by Energy Secretary Rick Perry in April, recommends that federal regulators make changes to wholesale electricity markets that could potentially benefit existing coal and nuclear plants. Revenues for many of these facilities have slumped in recent years as electricity prices have declined, mostly because of cheap natural gas, the study said, but also as a result of low electricity demand growth and the rise of wind and solar power. More than 200 coal plants and five nuclear reactors have closed across the United States since 2010, and President Trump has vowed to revitalize both industries, though doing so would require resisting powerful market forces reshaping the energy landscape. The Energy Department report concedes that the nation’s electricity system remains reliable today, even with a sharp rise in intermittent wind and solar power, in part because natural gas generators and existing hydropower can easily fill any gaps in renewable generation. But the study raises concerns that a future grid with fewer “baseload” coal and nuclear plants, which are capable of producing electricity around the clock, could pose challenges to grid operators trying to keep the lights on.

"On a baking-hot evening in Phoenix on Tuesday, in another of the campaign-style rallies in red states that seem to give him strength when he runs into trouble in Washington, President Trump trotted out the usual enemies, the malefactors in the “very dishonest media” and the “anarchists” of the left to whom that very same media had paid too little attention. But this time he gave equal billing to his fellow Republicans in Congress — the people he will surely need if he hopes to deliver on infrastructure or anything else of value to the working-class Americans who elected him. Among these were Arizona’s two senators — John McCain, who cast the decisive vote in the Senate to dash Mr. Trump’s effort to repeal Obamacare, and Jeff Flake, a conservative who has been a thorn in the presidential side. Neither was mentioned by name. Mr. McCain was sarcastically referred to as “one vote.” As for Mr. Flake, “Nobody knows who the hell he is.” All this, as well as a broader attack on congressional “obstructionists,” came on the same day that The Times published an article detailing the rapid disintegration of the relationship between Mr. Trump and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Mr. McConnell has fought fiercely and loyally for the president at every turn, whether on health care or his judicial nominees, and his support will continue to be important on major issues. Other presidents have gotten crosswise with their own parties, but this president seems to have alienated everybody. And whether one hopes to see the president’s agenda enacted or stymied, his failure to perceive this essential political dynamic is evidence of how little he understands what it takes to convert campaign positions into reality. Among Mr. McConnell’s sins, in Mr. Trump’s eyes, is that he has publicly questioned Mr. Trump’s understanding of the presidency and privately fumed at Mr. Trump’s threats against Republicans. Mr. Trump has not, in fact, been acting in a manner befitting his office, nor offering a coherent governing strategy. He has alternately abused and belittled his putative allies. During the health care struggle, he told Senator Shelley Moore Capito that she couldn’t ride home to West Virginia on Air Force One unless she voted for repeal. He dispatched Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, to threaten Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska with loss of federal funding unless she voted the right way. (She did not.) And he started calling out Mr. McConnell by name, in tweets and comments. “Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing,” he tweeted. Over the phone, the two engaged in a profane shouting match, as Mr. Trump, fearful of the F.B.I.’s investigation of his administration’s possible ties to Russia, accused Mr. McConnell of failing to protect him.

"TORONTO — Last fall, one Canadian judge was required to appear before a very rare disciplinary panel because he asked a rape complainant why she had not kept her knees together. A decade ago, another had to answer questions about changes he made to a court transcript. On Wednesday, Justice Bernd Zabel of Ontario faced a four-member disciplinary panel because he arrived in his Hamilton courtroom wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat on Nov. 9 — the day after the United States election. The judge said it was meant as a joke, and a week later he apologized in his courtroom, stating that the hat was not a political statement or an endorsement of any political views, particularly not “the views and comments of Donald Trump.” But, as an indication of how pervasive American politics is in Canada and how divisive President Trump has become, that apology was not enough. More than 80 complaints from law schools, lawyers’ associations and individual lawyers poured into the Ontario Judicial Council demanding that Justice Zabel be sanctioned, so public trust could be restored to the bench. Even Justice Zabel, 69, seemed to agree that in Canada, Mr. Trump’s professed views are largely seen as contrary to Canada’s embrace of multiculturalism and human rights. “I’m not a racist,” he told the panel, according to Canadian media reports. “I’m not a bigot. I’m not a misogynist.” In Canada, judges are appointed, not elected, and they are considered largely apolitical, particularly at the lower court levels. "

"Every time you think President Trump’s anti-press rhetoric can’t get worse, he finds a way of surprising you and not surprising you all at the same time. That he will attack journalists on a regular basis should be expected at this point, and it is. The surprising part comes when he manages to outdo himself. After all, he couldn’t possibly top “enemy of the people,” could he? Yet there he was in Phoenix on Tuesday, telling a crowd of thousands of ardent supporters that journalists were “sick people” who he believes “don’t like our country,” and are “trying to take away our history and our heritage.” The moment matters. Mr. Trump’s latest attack on the media came at a time of heightened racial tension stoked by a white supremacists’ rally in Charlottesville, Va., and continuing now in the national debate over removing statues that commemorate Confederate figures from the Civil War. Mr. Trump’s speech in Phoenix reprised a question spawned by his raucous rallies during the presidential campaign: How long before someone is seriously hurt, or worse? “Coming off the violence in Charlottesville, with tensions so high and the kindling so dry, it felt like President Trump was playing recklessly with fire, singling out a specific group of people — the media — for disliking America and trying to erase our country’s heritage,” Jim VandeHei, chief executive of the Axios news website, told me. “He’s just wrong to paint so wildly with such a broad brush, and, worse, putting reporters at real risk of retribution or violence.” (In a passionate appeal on Twitter on Wednesday, Mr. VandeHei posted the following message: “To family/friends who support Trump: What he said last night was despicable, extremely deceptive, dangerous.”) "
"For years, the presidential conference calls were a nonpartisan holiday tradition: President Barack Obama would speak by phone with hundreds of rabbis in advance of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, in what participants described as a meeting of minds, largely free of raw politics. But that emerging tradition was thrown into jeopardy on Wednesday, in a sign of the still-intensifying backlash against President Trump’s response to the violence this month in Charlottesville, Va. Four coalitions of rabbis, hailing from different strains of American Judaism, publicly spurned Mr. Trump, denouncing him in unusually pointed language, and pre-emptively announcing that they would not participate in any conference call before the Jewish holidays next month. Mr. Trump has drawn widespread criticism, and in some cases condemnation, from Jewish leaders after a string of public remarks in which he has played down the racist and anti-Semitic views of white supremacist demonstrators in Virginia. Jewish members of his administration have faced calls to condemn the president or resign, and a few have expressed public and private discomfort with his comments, including Mr. Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman. But the rabbinical groups’ announcement on Wednesday was a rebuke on a different level, and appeared to signal that Mr. Trump will encounter extreme difficulty in any immediate efforts to reach out to American Jews. In a joint statement, the organizations — which claim the backing of more than 4,000 rabbis and congregations — accused Mr. Trump of having given “succor to those who advocate anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia” with his comments after the bloodshed in Charlottesville, where a young woman was killed after a man drove his car into a crowd of protesters. All four Jewish groups — the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Rabbinical Assembly, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association and the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism — said they could not participate in interactions with Mr. Trump around the fall holidays. "
"LONDON — In his first solo trip to the broader Middle East as President Trump’s designated peacemaker, Jared Kushner has found both cause for optimism and reminders of just what a daunting task his father-in-law has given him. Over the course of two days, he met with leaders from several influential Arab countries and emerged encouraged by their stated eagerness to help him bring Israelis and Palestinians together. But his visit on Wednesday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt showed how other issues can easily complicate the initiative as both sides sought to paper over a dispute over American aid. Just a day earlier, the United States cut or delayed nearly $300 million in aid to Egypt, a symbolic blow to a strategic relationship that has been a pillar of American policy in the Middle East for almost four decades. It was also a sign of growing impatience on the part of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who does not share Mr. Trump’s affinity for Mr. Sisi. Mr. Kushner was caught out by bad timing — his trip to Egypt had been fixed weeks earlier and officials said the aid decision was driven by schedules unrelated to his travels. Mr. Sisi and Mr. Kushner gave no public hint of discord as they grinned and shook hands for the benefit of news photographers; Mr. Sisi’s office later issued a lengthy statement praising relations between the two nations. Mr. Tillerson tightened the purse strings to signal displeasure with Mr. Sisi for several reasons. One was a harsh law enacted by Mr. Sisi in May making it virtually impossible for some nongovernmental organizations to operate freely in Egypt. The other was Egypt’s close relationship with North Korea, which stretches back to the 1970s but has become a serious irritant amid the recent surge in tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. Mr. Kushner, however, hopes to enlist Egypt as a partner in making progress between the Israelis and Palestinians. He accompanied Mr. Trump, his father-in-law, on a visit to the region and separately traveled to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders over the summer. But this was Mr. Kushner’s first trip to see leaders from Arab states he considers critical to resolving the generations-old conflict. "
"SEATTLE — Amazon’s bid to become a bigger player in the grocery business took a major step forward Wednesday, as federal antitrust regulators approved the internet company’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market. And earlier in the day, Whole Foods shareholders voted to approve the $13.4 billion deal, which will give Amazon a major bricks-and-mortar presence with more than 460 stores in a huge retail category where success has eluded the company. The Federal Trade Commission, which was handling the federal review of the deal, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon that the agency had concluded that the deal would not harm competition. “Based on our investigation we have decided not to pursue this matter further,” Bruce Hoffman, the acting director of the F.T.C.’s bureau of competition, said in the statement. “Of course, the F.T.C. always has the ability to investigate anticompetitive conduct should such action be warranted.” The agency’s approval removed the last major hurdle to the deal’s closing. Antitrust lawyers had not expected the acquisition to be blocked by regulators, largely because Amazon and Whole Foods are not major competitors today.Amazon has run an internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but it accounts for less than a 2 percent share of total grocery spending in the United States, according to estimates by Cowen & Company, a stock research firm. Amazon has said the deal is expected to close this year, and on Wednesday the company did not change that prediction. Despite its prominence as a purveyor of high-end groceries, Whole Foods is also a relatively small player in the overall grocery market. The food and beverage portion of the grocery business is one of the largest categories of consumer spending, totaling more than $800 billion a year, with more than $450 billion in additional spending on personal care, pet and other consumable products, according to Cowen. Combined, Cowen estimates Amazon and Whole Foods will be the fifth-largest grocery retailer in the country. Even if it seemed a long shot that regulators would stop the acquisition, there was still some uncertainty over the way competition regulators under the Trump administration would approach big acquisitions. There has been speculation about possible interference by the White House in antitrust reviews of deals like AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner. In the case of Amazon, President Trump has on several occasions expressed his animosity toward the company, accusing it earlier this month of killing retail jobs. He has also falsely accused the company of not collecting taxes on internet sales and has suggested that Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is using his personal ownership of The Washington Post to intimidate members of Congress from examining Amazon.

"PHOENIX — Noemí Romero still shudders when she hears the name Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff responsible for the workplace raid in 2013 when she was arrested and spent two months in jail. So when President Trump signaled that he was considering a pardon for Mr. Arpaio for his contempt conviction, her memories of trauma flared into outrage. “Trump is delivering a slap in the face to dignified, hard-working people whose lives were ripped apart by Arpaio,” said Ms. Romero, 25, a former supermarket cashier who now babysits to make ends meet. “Arpaio belongs in jail, getting a taste of his own medicine. Trump wants to put Arpaio above the law, showing they are both about white supremacy.” Mr. Trump’s expression of support for Mr. Arpaio, the 85-year-old crusader against illegal immigration, has ignited a debate across Arizona about the tactics used to crack down on Latinos, the reactions the strategy spawned in fueling the repudiation by voters who ousted Mr. Arpaio, and the nationalist sentiment stoked by Mr. Trump, one of the former sheriff’s most ardent admirers. Detested by some, loved by others and facing up to six months in jail for failing to heed a federal judge’s order to stop targeting Latinos based solely on the suspicion of their legal status, Mr. Arpaio finds himself thrust back into the political fray at a time when he could quietly be in the twilight of his career. This enduring prominence and the expressions of support from Mr. Trump suit some in Arizona just fine. "
"HOUSTON — A federal judge blocked Texas from enforcing its revamped voter identification law on Wednesday, ruling that the State Legislature’s attempt to loosen the law did not go far enough and perpetuated discrimination against black and Hispanic voters. The decision was only the latest chapter in a yearslong court battle over the state’s voter ID rules, and comes amid concerted efforts by the Trump administration to enact tougher voting restrictions. The stakes are particularly high for Texas: As a result of previous court rulings, the state could be forced to undergo federal oversight of its election procedures. The judge — Nelva Gonzales Ramos, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas — had previously found that the original law, one of the most restrictive in the nation, was passed in 2011 with the intent to discriminate against blacks and Hispanics. It required voters to show one of seven forms of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, before casting a ballot. The Republican-controlled Legislature softened the law, in response to legal challenges and court rulings, by allowing potential voters to sign an affidavit and show more widely available types of identification, including a utility bill or a bank statement. The new law, known as Senate Bill 5, was set to take effect in January, despite complaints from critics that it created criminal penalties for those who made false claims about needing to use alternate IDs. In her ruling, Judge Ramos noted that the retooled law still barred voters from showing state or federal employee ID cards. Because those who lack the accepted forms of identification were “subjected to separate voting obstacles and procedures,” Judge Ramos wrote, “S.B. 5’s methodology remains discriminatory because it imposes burdens disproportionately on blacks and Latinos.” "
"LONDON — Qatar restored full diplomatic relations with Iran on Thursday, the latest volley in an 11-week-old geopolitical feud that has set the tiny yet fabulously wealthy Persian Gulf nation against its neighbors and rattled a previously placid part of the Middle East. Qatar’s Foreign Ministry announced that it was sending its ambassador back to Tehran after a 20-month hiatus that started in January 2016, when Qatar broke off relations after attacks on two Saudi diplomatic facilities in Iran. The Qataris gave no explanation for the sudden move. But the timing suggested a purposeful snub of Saudi Arabia, which along with three other countries began a punitive boycott of Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting terrorism and having a too-cozy relationship with Iran. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut their air and sea routes to Qatar, and closed its only land border, with Saudi Arabia. Mediation by the United States, Kuwait and Germany has failed to resolve the feud in the gulf, the one corner of the Middle East that has been largely free of war, refugees or political turmoil in recent years. Analysts said the partial blockade has badly weakened the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council and threatens to undermine regional stability. The crisis lapsed into a stalemate after Qatar refused an initial list of 13 demands, which included cutting all ties with Tehran. But things took a turn for the worse this week after a visit by a minor Qatari royal, Sheikh Abdullah al-Thani, to the Saudi ruler, King Salman, at his holiday villa in Morocco. Sheikh Abdullah, who lives in London and comes from a wing of the ruling family that was ousted in a 1972 coup, posed for pictures with King Salman at his lavish coastal palace outside Tangiers. (Estimates of the cost of the king’s holiday run as high as $100 million — expensive even for a monarch who typically travels with an entourage of 1,000 or more.) "
"Last week, following the tragic events in Charlottesville, Va., President Trump took to Twitter to express his lament over the loss of Confederacy monuments, asking, “Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson — who’s next, Washington, Jefferson?” As we contemplate the removal of these statues and what they mean for race relations in this country, here are three books that address two Civil War generals and one president — all controversial historical figures — and how they are remembered. (We decided, rightly or wrongly, to let Washington rise above the fray.) READING THE MAN
A Portrait of Robert E. Lee Through His Private Letters
By Elizabeth Brown Pryor
688 pp. Viking Adult. (2007) In this epistolary biography, Pryor uses Robert E. Lee’s letters as a launching pad for essays that discuss his life story and his military record. She insists, in her preface, that “we cannot compartmentalize him, and we cannot simply lionize him. His letters show him to be too human for that.” Lee’s decision to leave the United States Army and side with the South, for instance, was not an easy one; the choice put him at odds with his family and friends, many of whom were in favor of maintaining the Union. Lee’s correspondence is well-written and revealing, and Pryor complements it with intelligent insight and analysis. STONEWALL JACKSON
The Man, the Soldier, the Legend
By James I. Robertson Jr.
950 pp. Macmillan Publishing USA. (1997) Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson, the man, has defied proper investigation. He was notoriously secretive, writing uninformative or bare bones letters in both his private and professional life. As a result, his story has been embellished to the point of becoming legend. In this book, however, Robertson mines the source material for new information, busting myths in the process. He delves into Jackson’s Presbyterian faith, which bordered on fanatical, and how it informed his merciless approach to battle. Jackson placed his fate in God’s hands, which made him fearless on the field. Our reviewer said this work propelled the writer “straight to the head of the class of Jackson biographers, and likely to remain there.” MOST BLESSED OF THE PATRIARCHS
Thomas Jefferson and the Empire of the Imagination
By Annette Gordon-Reed and Peter S. Onuf
400 pp. Liveright. (2016) This addition to the copious literature on Thomas Jefferson concentrates on his interior life, analyzing how his contradictions were most present in the “ambiguous moral geography” of Monticello, his mountain refuge. The writers divide the book into thematic chapters such as “Home,” “France,” “Politics” and “Privacy and Prayers” and investigate how Jefferson’s experiences shaped his philosophy. Rather than tackle the question of whether he deserves reproach or reverence, they address issues like freedom and slavery head-on, and reveal how Jefferson viewed himself and the American experiment.

"The events of the last few weeks have shown us that we are fully living in Trump’s America, with a president who is slow to condemn the actions of white supremacists. The realization has been exhausting. This week, we take a step back to think about what the political moment is doing to our emotional and physical states. We discuss our routines of self-care — and investigate the origins of the phrase and why it feels overused and even a little cliché.

"Tropical Storm Harvey strengthened into a hurricane on Thursday as it headed to coastal Texas, where it was expected to bring life-threatening flooding, meteorologists said. The National Hurricane Center said that Air Force hurricane hunter planes had spotted Tropical Storm Harvey strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico, with about 60-mile-per-hour winds more than 300 miles off the southern coast of Texas early Thursday. A hurricane warning, meaning hurricane conditions are expected, had been in effect from Port Mansfield in far southern Texas to Matagorda, about 100 miles southwest of Houston. But later in the day, the planes spotted the system strengthening, and the estimated maximum sustained winds increased to close to 100 m.p.h. the hurricane center said early Friday. It was expected to make landfall Friday night or early Saturday. Parts of Louisiana and the lower Mississippi Valley were also in the path of hurricane conditions from the storm system, the hurricane center said. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on Thursday that Hurricane Harvey was expected to hit Corpus Christi early Saturday as a Category 3 hurricane, but that its outer bands of rain could be felt earlier. The impact on Louisiana was expected early next week, he said. “It is getting more and more serious as time goes by,” Mr. Edwards said in a news conference. He said the weather service had told him there was a possibility the hurricane could make landfall in Texas and then re-enter the Gulf before moving east to Louisiana, he said. "
"CHICAGO — Note: Friday night, after this Op-Ed was published, it was announced that President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio. At his rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, President Trump strongly implied that he would pardon Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., who was found guilty in July of criminal contempt for defying a judge’s order against prolonging traffic patrols targeting immigrants. This is not idle presidential chatter: On Thursday morning, CNN reported that the White House has prepared the necessary paperwork, along with talking points for its allies. This is uncharted territory. Yes, on its face the Constitution’s pardon power would seem unlimited. And past presidents have used it with varying degrees of wisdom, at times in ways that would seem to clash with the courts’ ability to render justice. But the Arpaio case is different: The sheriff was convicted of violating constitutional rights, in defiance of a court order involving racial profiling. Should the president indicate that he does not think Mr. Arpaio should be punished for that, he would signal that governmental agents who violate judicial injunctions are likely to be pardoned, even though their behavior violated constitutional rights, when their illegal actions are consistent with presidential policies. Many legal scholars argue that the only possible redress is impeachment — itself a politicized, drawn-out process. But there may be another route. If the pardon is challenged in court, we may discover that there are, in fact, limits to the president’s pardon power after all. The only effective means courts have to prevent or stop governmental violations of constitutional rights is through injunctions. But injunctions have teeth only when they have the potential of a contempt conviction behind them. In other words, in issuing an injunction, a court is saying, “stop doing that or else.” The “or else” is a criminal conviction for contempt, leading to a fine, imprisonment or both. Absent the “or else,” the injunction is all but meaningless. But if the president signals to government agents that there exists the likelihood of a pardon when they violate a judicial injunction that blocks his policies, he can all too easily circumvent the only effective means of enforcing constitutional restrictions on his behavior. Indeed, the president could even secretly promise a pardon to agents if they undertake illegal activity he desires. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump handed Democrats a gift this week with his vow to shut down the government if he doesn’t soon get money for his border wall. Democrats may be only too happy to let him follow through on his threat since it will now be easy for them to blame the president for any government interruption, which would probably aggravate many Americans. Rather than cowing Democrats, Mr. Trump’s tough talk is more likely to embolden the opposition in ongoing negotiations, particularly since he has now twice suggested he was willing to shutter government agencies if he didn’t get his way. It also puts more pressure on Republicans to find the votes internally to pass spending bills and an increase in the federal debt limit — two things hard-right conservatives in the House and Senate have refused to support in the past. That Republican resistance provides Democrats leverage — Republicans can either grant concessions such as no wall money or produce all the votes for the spending bills and debt limit increase themselves. Mr. Trump also has spent the past few weeks taunting and denigrating Republican leaders who will be responsible for navigating these formidable fiscal obstacles, providing them incentive to look out for themselves rather than the interests of the president.

"It has become increasingly clear to me after the tragedy of Charlottesville that Donald Trump not only has no interest in being president of the entire country but also is specifically tailoring his so-called presidency to the white racial-grievance apparatus. This week he reinforced his racial rhetoric, appealing to loss of history and heritage. He defended Confederate monuments and mocked those who agreed to remove them. He tried to rewrite his own history of standing up for white supremacists. This is the man we have: one who doesn’t want to lead a country but wants to rule a tribe. Most of the people who support him are just fine with his approach and behavior. These people baffle the throngs who see a man unfit for office and possibly inching closer to diagnosable insanity. But I think that if people want to understand what is happening here, to understand why Trump’s support is so strong in some quarters, we need to broaden the scope of inquiry beyond just the Rust Belt states that he won by razor-thin margins and beyond border states where the wall would have great impact. We also need to look at Southern states that he carried by enormous margins. We have to look at states like Alabama. In doing so, we have to examine the history of Alabama and see how white supremacy tracks across time and culminates with Trump. "
"For months, the White House under President Trump operated with few real rules, and those were barely enforced. People wandered into the Oval Office throughout the day. The president was given pieces of unvetted information, and found more on his own that he often tweeted out. Policy decisions were often based on whoever had last gotten Mr. Trump’s attention. Mr. Trump’s Twitter habit shows little sign of abating. On vacation earlier at his private club in Bedminster, N.J., and now, ensconced again in the White House, he has been watching television — unfettered by any aides — and responding as he always has. But inside the West Wing, the president’s new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, has been trying to control the things he can. After being sworn in on July 31, he spent three weeks assessing how to create a less jumbled, chaotic churn around Mr. Trump, and how to create a system that the president’s staff will respect. In two memos sent to the staff on Monday he began to detail his plan, starting with how he wants information to get to the president, and how Mr. Trump will respond. Codifying of paper flow and decision-making is not usually of note in a White House, and the practices laid out were fairly standard in previous administrations. But in Mr. Trump’s White House, where fiefs have been in constant combat and decision-making has often been ill defined, the memos, first reported by Politico, mark a new era. The pair of memos, signed by Robert Porter, the assistant to the president for policy coordination and staff secretary, as well as Mr. Kelly, codified rules and procedures that a White House typically sets at the outset of an administration. Mr. Kelly’s predecessor, Reince Priebus, sent some similar guidelines around early in the administration, according to two officials, but they were never taken seriously. Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been treated with a different level of deference inside the building, those aides said. Staff members discovered early on that they could defy Mr. Priebus, the officials said, but crossing  a Marine is a different matter. "

"To the Editor: Re “The President Turns on His Own” (editorial, Aug. 24): President Trump not only risks his agenda by lambasting Republican senators but also continues to prove that he is not the great negotiator he constantly boasts that he is. A great negotiator does not bully his opponents, as Mr. Trump tried to do with senators over the health care bill. A great negotiator does not threaten to shut down the government to get Congress to pay for his wall (after he failed to get Mexico to pay for it — another negotiation fiasco). A great negotiator doesn’t hurl insults or threats that he wouldn’t follow through on, like a nuclear war with North Korea (or would he actually be willing to push that button?). So let’s burst Mr. Trump’s self-deluded bubble and remind him that bullying and threats, insults and self-congratulation, do not great negotiations achieve — as is clear from his lack of legislative victories. Gee, isn’t he tired from all this losing? JAMES S. BERKMAN, BOSTON To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Shutdown Threat Risks Splitting His Party” (front page, Aug. 24): President Trump now threatens to shut down the government if Congress does not fund a wall on the southern border of the United States. The demanded funding this year alone is $1.6 billion, and $3.6 billion over the next two fiscal years. Rather than creating an asset for America’s future, like highways, roads or bridges, this expenditure would further increase government debt spending. If this poorly conceived wall is built, one can imagine how it will require billions more in upkeep, or rapidly deteriorate and end up being a graffiti-covered monument to a failed investment, like a bankrupt Trump hotel. MARK MILLER, DOYLESTOWN, PA. To the Editor: As I recall, at many of Donald Trump’s campaign rallies, the overwhelming, unified response to the question ”And who will build that wall?” was “Mexico!” So why does Mr. Trump want the cost of the wall to be in our budget?

"KIEV, Ukraine — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis vowed on Thursday to help Ukraine stand up to Russian violations of its sovereignty and signaled that the Trump administration was considering providing defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military. President Barack Obama had resisted such a step, fearing it would be seen as a provocation by Russia. In the first visit to Ukraine by an American defense secretary in nearly a decade, Mr. Mattis seemed to be anticipating that argument. “Defensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor, and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor since it is their territory where the fighting is happening,” Mr. Mattis said at a joint news conference with Ukraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko. State and Defense Department officials have recommended that the United States provide Javelin anti-tank missiles and other defensive weapons to Ukraine to strengthen its forces and raise the potential cost to the Kremlin of a Russian attack. But President Trump, who has consistently taken a more conciliatory position toward Russia than have his top national security advisers, has yet to take up the matter. Mr. Mattis declined to disclose what he planned to recommend to Mr. Trump. Nor did he indicate any timetable for deciding the matter. But his comments suggested that he was sympathetic to supplying defensive weapons — long a topic of enormous interest in Ukraine. "
"To the Editor: Re “President’s Feud With McConnell Becomes Hostile” (front page, Aug. 23): The deterioration of the relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, should concern every American. The rancor between them is not merely political theater or a trivial battle for supremacy; rather, it is detrimental to the American system of governance. This extraordinary intraparty conflict virtually ensures that government gridlock will reign for the foreseeable future. The Trump-McConnell feud is a microcosm of a broader issue that has become pervasive in our nation. We cannot allow the acrimony and dissonance that have regrettably become commonplace in America to become an acceptable norm. Civility, not further conflict, can begin helping our nation heal. After the events in Charlottesville, Va., what we need is more dialogue and less discord. We need to come together, not tear ourselves further apart. N. AARON TROODLER

"WASHINGTON — President Trump started his day on Thursday publicly criticizing leaders of his own party for not advancing his legislative agenda, which the president called “so easy.” Mr. Trump said he asked Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Representative Paul Ryan, the House speaker, to include language about the debt ceiling in a recent Department of Veterans Affairs bill. “They didn’t do it so now we have a big deal with Dems holding them up (as usual) on Debt Ceiling approval,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of Twitter posts. Congress has until mid-October to raise the legal borrowing limit or the United States could risk defaulting on its debt obligations. A White House official said on Thursday that Mr. Trump was specifically referring to a bill to extend emergency funding to the multibillion-dollar Veterans Choice program, which pays for veterans to receive care from private doctors if they face long wait times or travel distances. Congressional aides said on Thursday that there had indeed been a short-lived effort late last month to tie the debt ceiling language to the Choice bill. But with the veterans’ program set to run out of money by mid-August, apparent opposition from conservative budget hard-liners and a congressional recesses looming, the idea was never given serious consideration. The Choice legislation ultimately passed both the House and the Senate unanimously, shortly before each chamber began its summer recess. Mr. Trump signed it into law on August 12. Mr. McConnell said on Monday that there was no chance Congress would fail to raise the debt ceiling by the end of September. The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell has been disintegrating over the summer and could jeopardize urgent legislation when Congress returns from its August recess. Mr. Trump has been publicly critical of Mr. McConnell for not being able to “repeal and replace” President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation. He repeated his criticism in another tweet on Thursday: “The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed! That should NEVER have happened!” Mr. Trump shifted his focus on Twitter briefly to the Obama administration on Thursday. The president shared a post from one of his supporters that was critical of Mr. Obama. And Mr. Trump called out Mr. Obama’s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., who has publicly questioned whether Mr. Trump is fit to be president. “I really question his ability to — his fitness to be in this office,” Mr. Clapper said on CNN this week. Mr. Trump also lashed out at “Fake News” on Thursday for reports on the different styles of his recent public speeches. Several news outlets, including The New York Times, wrote articles comparing his speaking style at recent appearances, including in Arizona at a campaign-style rally on Tuesday and at an American Legion convention on Wednesday night.

"Challenging the Republican ascendance in states where labor once carried enormous sway, a prominent union plans to spend tens of millions of dollars during the 2018 campaign cycle to reverse the trend. The Service Employees International Union, one of the largest and wealthiest unions in the United States with roughly 2 million members, will fund an extensive campaign over the next 14 months to elect politicians with labor-friendly stands on the minimum wage, unions and health care. The effort will primarily aim at the traditionally industrial states of the Midwest and Rust Belt, where labor’s political influence has come under a furious assault from conservative forces in recent decades, culminating in President Trump’s electoral sweep of the traditionally Democratic states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Since 2010, four states in the region have enacted so-called right-to-work legislation that allows workers to opt out of paying fees to unions that bargain on their behalf. Elected leaders in several states have acted to block or reverse minimum-wage increases. “If you think about what the No. 1 job of an elected official ought to be, it’s raising the standard of living of citizens they’re elected to represent,” said Scott Courtney, an executive vice president of the union, which will formally unveil the initiative on Labor Day. “But if you look at what has been happening in battle ground states in the Midwest, it’s just the opposite.” The high-profile involvement of S.E.I.U., whose membership in the Midwest has steadily increased over much of the past generation, is in some sense a reflection of the changing economic landscape of the region, where health care has replaced manufacturing as the top employer in many states.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) An intense debate is being waged in Sacramento over a proposal that would alter how crucial services are provided to Californians. Sponsored by the Service Employees International Union, the measure would require that counties adhere to a raft of new conditions before contracting out for services in health care, housing, public safety and other areas. Dozens of government, business and nonprofit groups have opposed it. So have newspapers across the state, including The Los Angeles Times, The Fresno Bee, San Francisco Chronicle and Sacramento Bee. (A “bucket of horse slop” is how one described it.) Still, the measure known as AB 1250 has been advancing through the Legislature. It was approved with Democratic support in the Assembly in June. It’s now in the State Senate. Supporters have argued that contracting out to private and nonprofit groups results in lower quality services. The rules, they say, are meant to ensure officials are held accountable for how tax money is spent. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. You grow numb. You grow weary. I recall discovering a few weeks back that President Trump had lied about two phone calls, one from the president of Mexico and one from the head of the Boy Scouts. The calls, supposedly to congratulate him, did not exist. They never happened. They were pure inventions. Asked if Trump had lied, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said, “I wouldn’t say it was a lie.” I actually remember shrugging. The shrug was terrifying. This is how autocrats — or would-be autocrats — cement their power. They wear you down with their lies. They distract you. They want you to believe that 2+2=5. They want you to forget that freedom withers when the distinction between truth and falsehood dies. In a dictatorship there is a single font of “truth”: the voice of the dictator. Remember Trump at the Republican National Convention a little over a year ago: “I am your voice.” And now his voice is everywhere. There’s the scripted Trump voice, which is fake. There’s the unscripted voice, which is genuine. The two tend to alternate; call this the choreography of disorientation. It’s confusing, like having a president who isn’t really a president but instead acts like the leader of a rabble-rousing movement. The Oval Office is a useful prop, no more than that. He’s held eight rallies since becoming president in January. The latest was in Phoenix, where he called the media “very dishonest people.” He led the crowd in a chant of “CNN sucks.” He attacked the “failing New York Times.” It’s familiar. That familiarity is menacing. It led me to think of my half-repressed shrug at the beginning of this month. Trump has one fundamental talent: a ruthless ability to mess with people’s minds and turn their anger into the engine of his ambition. A dishonest president calls the media that report on his dishonesty dishonest for doing so. This is where we are. This is the danger that Trump represents. "
"The generals publicly supported their intervention in Afghanistan, but in private they worried they were trapped. After 16 years, they feared they had produced “a recipe for endless war,” according to an American ambassador who met with them. But the generals, the ambassador said, “felt there was no alternative, no realistic alternative” than to continue fighting a doomed mission. Those generals were Pakistani. Their meetings with the ambassador, Tom Simons, took place in 1996. Mr. Simons recounted the experience to the journalist Steve Coll in 2002, one year into an American mission in Afghanistan that has now also lasted 16, and which President Trump announced on Monday that his administration would extend. There is a reason that Afghanistan’s conflict, then and now, so defies solutions. Its combination of state collapse, civil conflict, ethnic disintegration and multisided intervention has locked it in a self-perpetuating cycle that may be simply beyond outside resolution. “I’m not saying that state formation will never work in Afghanistan, but externally building, as we’re trying to do it, cannot work,” said Romain Malejacq, a political scientist at the Center for International Conflict Analysis and Management in the Netherlands. American-led efforts, despite some successes, have ended up reinforcing and accelerating the broader cycles of violence and fragmentation that have been growing since the state’s collapse in the early 1990s. “The more we go on, the more fragmented it gets,” Professor Malejacq said. “I’m getting more and more pessimistic. I don’t really know how Afghanistan is going to get out of it, to be truly honest.” "

"Sigh. If only President Trump denounced neo-Nazis as passionately and sincerely as he castigates journalists. What could be an easier task than distancing oneself from Nazis or violent white supremacists? Yet Trump manages to make it infinitely complicated — and then get distracted by self-pity and excoriate reporters for committing journalism. The key strain of his sulfurous speech in Phoenix on Tuesday was an extended attack on “dishonest” reporters (including at “the failing New York Times”). Look, we in journalism deserve to have our feet held to the fire. We make mistakes all the time, and too often we are superficial, sensationalist, unfair, defensive or diverted by shiny objects. Critics are right that we in the national media are often out of touch with working-class America, and distressingly often, we are lap dogs instead of watchdogs. Yet for all our failings, journalism remains an indispensable constraint on power. Trump has systematically tried to delegitimize the institutions that hold him accountable — courts, prosecutors, investigators, the media — and that’s the context for his vilification of all them, for we collectively provide monitoring that outrages him. The New York Times and The Washington Post have separately tallied Trump’s lies, with The Post calculating that he has now made more than 1,000 misleading statements since assuming the presidency. That’s a grueling pace of almost five a day, and it is accelerating (at the six-month mark, it was 4.6 a day). This prevarication proliferation is an indication that John F. Kelly is unable to rein in Trump, and that the problem was not Steve Bannon but the president himself. Trump’s caricature of journalists as dishonest is hypocritical, and it insults the courage and professionalism of my colleagues who sometimes risk their lives trying to get a story. "
"A great day of triumph for Donald Trump! The president went to an American Legion convention Wednesday and read a speech off a teleprompter. Nothing weird happened. Total victory. We now divide the president’s public addresses into two categories. There are the unremarkable and predictable ones written by someone else and the ones in which he ignores the script and just says what’s on his mind, terrifying and confusing all Americans who are not in his base. (About the base. Polls make it very clear that 30 to 40 percent of voters are going to approve of what Trump does, no matter what. Many of them don’t mind if he comes on stage and starts talking like Uncle Fred Who Gets Drunk at Family Dinners. They enjoy Uncle Fred. Some of them are Uncle Fred.) Any other president who went to a convention of veterans and called for Americans to “work together” would have gotten no notice whatsoever. But Trump was coming off his spontaneous appearance in Phoenix when he frightened the whole country with his rants about the media and his wild riffs of self-congratulations. “Now you know, I was a good student,” Trump ad-libbed at his Arizona rally. “I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They’re elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.” Three points about this comment, only one of which is: “Wow, the president of the United States is so insecure he finds it necessary to brag about his grades in school.” The second is that we know about as much about his actual grades in school as we do about his tax returns.

"In the wake of the presidential election, we’ve all been asking simplistic questions about how Donald Trump won. Was it economics? Was it racism? Was it misogyny? Did it come down to identity? We know that it can’t have been just one thing, and that President Trump’s triumph was a concoction of many things. Nonetheless, several factors came together in a peculiar way, with serious electoral consequences. Millions of white voters began to see themselves more openly not as white supremacists but as white identified. It is no secret that the president has capitalized on the increasing salience of race and ethnicity in recent years. The furious reaction to many different historical and cultural developments — mass immigration; the success of the civil rights and women’s rights movements; the election and re-election of a black president; and the approaching end of white majority status in the United States — has created a political environment ripe for the growth of white identity politics. Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke, puts it this way: White voters for whom racial identity is important include a minority faction of white supremacists, but as a whole they constitute a much broader and encompassing group. In an Aug. 16 essay for The Washington Post’s Monkey Cage, Jardina wrote: A total of 36 percent of whites described their racial identity as either “very important” (16 percent) or “extremely important” (20 percent), according to an American National Election Studies survey in January 2016. Another 25 percent said it was “moderately important.” Careful examination of Trump’s initial support shows the key role of white identity voters in Trump’s ascendance. Between Jan. 22 and Jan. 28, 2016, as Trump consolidated his early support on the eve of the Republican caucuses and primaries, ANES conducted a special pre-election survey. To explore the role of white voters for whom racial identity was especially important, three political scientists — John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck — analyze the ANES data in their forthcoming book, “Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America.” The survey, they write, On the basis of that scale, the authors assembled the data illustrated by the accompanying chart, which shows that fewer than five percent of white Republicans who indicated that their racial identity was of little importance supported Trump. Among those who said their identity as whites was extremely important to them, Trump’s support reached 81 percent. "
"When it comes to Afghanistan, we’ve tried everything. The lesson is: Nothing works. We’ve tried “light footprint.” From the initial defeat of the Taliban in 2001 until 2007, monthly U.S. troop numbers never exceeded 25,000. Result: a reconstituted Taliban, their leadership secure in Pakistan, made inroads into more than half of Afghanistan. We’ve tried big footprint. Barack Obama ran for the presidency calling Afghanistan “a war that we have to win.” After he came to office, he ordered a surge that brought force levels to 100,000, along with tens of thousands of NATO troops. Result: The Taliban were pushed out of many of their strongholds, which were brought under government control. But because the surge had a predetermined deadline, the Taliban knew they could wait us out. “NATO has all the watches, but we have all the time,” went their refrain. We’ve tried nation building. At least as of 2014, the United States had spent $104 billion on Afghan relief and reconstruction funds, most of it for security but also nearly $30 billion for “governance and development” and $7.5 billion on counternarcotics. Result: As of 2015, more than three in five Afghans remained illiterate. Afghan security forces lost 4,000 members a month — less to the Taliban than to simple desertion. The country ranks 169th out of 176 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, ahead of only Somalia, South Sudan, North Korea, Syria, Yemen, Sudan and Libya. Opium production is surging. We’ve tried killing terrorists. Lots and lots of them. As many as 42,000 Taliban and other insurgents have been killed and another 19,000 wounded in fighting since 2001, according to one rough 2016 estimate. The United States has also carried out more than 400 drone strikes in Pakistan, decimating Al Qaeda’s core leadership. Last year a drone took out the Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Trevor Noah took a close look at President Trump’s rally on Tuesday in Arizona. He said the event seemed like a success, at least if you dampen your expectations. Conan O’Brien pointed out that people at the rally spent some time assailing the mainstream news media. But he said there might be one network they dislike even more. The “Daily Show” correspondent Roy Wood Jr. returned to the air on Wednesday to examine the crowd at Mr. Trump’s rally. He focused in on one person in particular: the lone black man shown behind Mr. Trump throughout the rally, holding a sign saying “Blacks for Trump.” Mr. Wood explained that the man goes by the name “Michael the Black Man,” and was once a member of the Yahweh Ben Yahweh cult, which was responsible for over a dozen killings, including some by beheading.

"To the Editor: Re “I Was Wrong,” by Julius Krein (Op-Ed, Aug. 20): While it is admirable for an adult in politics these days to actually admit a mistake, Mr. Krein’s mistake — the support of a presidential candidate with no cohesive policy proposals and a temperament obviously and egregiously unsuited for the job — has had dire consequences. If he and a few of his conservative thought-leading peers had had the simple intellectual foresight that almost 66 million other Americans had, paired with the courage of their convictions to put country before party, we would still be nit-picking about Hillary Clinton’s email servers instead of teetering on the brink of nuclear war with North Korea and facing a white supremacist resurgence at home. Therefore, I pose to you, Mr. Krein: You helped make this mess and you have admirably and publicly apologized for it; how do you intend to clean it up? ADAM E. BLOCK
PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. To the Editor: I commend Julius Krein for his humble apology. His (and others’) misunderstanding of Donald Trump has been extremely confounding to me. He is a thoughtful conservative. I am a thoughtful progressive. From the beginning, I saw Donald Trump as a con man of the highest order: manipulative, dishonest, unprincipled, amoral. Unless Mr. Krein limited his news access to extremist outlets, he must have seen the same videotapes that I have seen. So why is Charlottesville the last straw? He mentions Mr. Trump’s notorious “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone,” and I assume that he is aware of the boast about grabbing women, the invitation to the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s emails, the exhortation to his supporters at his rallies to assault protesters, the denigration of John McCain’s military service, not to mention the endless lies. There must be more at work here than just the desire to see conservative policies enacted. Perhaps the pundits of the future will explain it to us all. JENIFER KOLKHORST
ORINDA, CALIF. To the Editor: Is Julius Krein’s acknowledgment that it was a mistake to support Donald Trump’s candidacy a plea for absolution? I can forgive a coal miner who naïvely believed that Mr. Trump could revive an industry doomed to extinction. I cannot forgive a politically sophisticated individual who was fully aware that he was promoting a candidate with a lifetime history of personal and public behavior unbecoming a future president. You bought this presidency. You are not forgiven. SCOTT MARTIN MILLER, CHICAGO "
"In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Adam Kirsch and Francine Prose discuss what free speech means in the context of Charlottesville and beyond. By Adam Kirsch Liberalism is founded on the belief that we should tolerate one another’s error. Nowhere is the unnaturalness of liberalism more obvious than when it comes to the principle of free speech. Political speech involves making claims about what is true: the planet is warming; the president is a criminal; Jews are out to destroy white America. If I disagree with your truth claim, then I believe you are either ignorant or a liar, and it is not immediately obvious why ignorance and lies deserve any kind of respect. Shouldn’t I use every means in my power to stop you from spreading falsehood? Isn’t it my moral responsibility to do so? This kind of reasoning is especially compelling when it deals with speech that has potentially dangerous consequences. If you deny global warming and try to convince people that it doesn’t exist, while I believe it presents an immediate danger to the survival of the species, then it makes sense that I would take any measures necessary to silence you, for the sake of humanity’s very future. And this does not apply only to empirical threats. For a true religious believer, nothing is more dangerous than the propagation of false beliefs about God, since heresy imperils something even more important than lives — it threatens our souls. The Inquisition burned heretics because it saw in their speech such a spiritual threat; surely it was an act of kindness to protect the innocent from deadly lies? It took the Western world many generations of religious wars and persecutions before liberal thinkers, in the 17th and 18th centuries, began to challenge this imperious logic. The key to the invention of free speech was the recognition of pluralism — the fact that, in any human population, there will be people with irreconcilably different understandings of the truth. Pluralism is not relativism: I do not have to agree that there is no truth about climate change or racism or God. But I must recognize that we do not all agree on what that truth is. The question is what to do with that disagreement. Liberalism is founded on the belief that we should tolerate one another’s error, not because we approve of it, but to avoid the violence that would result if we each sought to silence the other. The liberal believes that life is more important than truth — that it is better to live in a peaceful society full of error than in a pure society full of persecution. The price of this toleration is that we must constantly put up with hearing speech that we consider wrong; we must smother our moral instincts. As the poet Robert Lowell put it, the liberal is someone who “bites his own lip to warm his icy tooth.” "
"OKLAHOMA CITY — For months, health officials in this socially conservative state capital have been staggered by a fast-spreading outbreak of a disease that, for nearly two decades, was considered all but extinguished. Syphilis, the deadly sexually transmitted infection that can lead to blindness, paralysis and dementia, is returning here and around the country, another consequence of the heroin and methamphetamine epidemics, as users trade sex for drugs. To locate possible patients and draw their blood for testing, Oklahoma’s syphilis detectives have been knocking on doors in dilapidated apartment complexes and dingy motels, driving down lonely rural roads and interviewing prison inmates. Syphilis has led them to members of 17 gangs; to drug dealers; to prostitutes, pimps and johns; and to their spouses and lovers, all caught in the disease’s undertow. “Syphilis doesn’t sleep for anyone,” said Portia King, a veteran Oklahoma state health investigator. “We have 200 open cases of sex partners we’re looking for. And the spread is migrating out of the city.” It took months for investigators to realize Oklahoma City had a syphilis outbreak. Last fall, the juvenile detention center reported three cases — a boy and two girls, the youngest, 14. The center had never had a syphilis case in seven years of testing for it. Investigators were mystified: The teenagers did not know each other, live in the same neighborhood or attend the same school. "
"BEARS EARS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Utah — Parts of this sprawling region of red-rock canyons and at least three other national monuments would lose their strict protection and could be reopened for new mining or drilling under proposals submitted to President Trump by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday, according to congressional aides and others who have been briefed on the report. Environmentalists, ranchers, tribal governments and Western lawmakers had been watching closely to see if Mr. Zinke would propose changing the borders of the Bears Ears National Monument, which President Barack Obama established at the end of his term, and other scenic and historic areas under federal protection. In recent days, Mr. Zinke had been considering a dramatic reduction to Bears Ears, to approximately 160,000 acres from 1.35 million, according to multiple people familiar with the process. No president has ever reduced a monument by such a large amount. Shrinking the monuments would be widely seen as a direct blow to Mr. Obama’s environmental legacy, and would probably prompt the first major legal test of a century-old conservation law. Mr. Zinke was believed to be leaning toward such a step. But when he submitted his recommendations on Thursday, he declined to announce specifically what he had proposed for Bears Ears or the other monuments under review. He referred to his recommendations only in general terms, saying they would “provide a much-needed change for the local communities who border and rely on these lands.” The people briefed on the plans said that along with Bears Ears, Mr. Zinke had proposed reducing the size of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, also in southern Utah, and two others.

"Questions about the ownership and corporate structure of the HNA Group, one of China’s biggest — and most acquisitive — companies, are mounting, prompting scrutiny by regulators in the United States and Europe and leading at least one Wall Street bank to step away from it. The mystery surrounding HNA is illustrated by its relationship with a New York-based company, the Pacific American Corporation. HNA has previously said that PAC, as it is known, is an independent company that buys engines, spare parts and other airline equipment for HNA’s subsidiary, Hainan Airlines. HNA has said that it has no ownership stake in PAC. Previously unreported corporate documents reviewed by The New York Times show a closer relationship. PAC is run by the son and younger brother of HNA’s co-founder and co-chairman Chen Feng, and was once controlled by HNA. The younger brother of HNA’s co-chairman was also instrumental in helping create the initial ownership structure of HNA Group, these records show, through the use of entities set up outside China, in Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands. These offshore companies effectively obscured the control wielded by top executives and their relatives. The lack of such disclosures in HNA’s regulatory filings may have violated China’s securities laws on “connected” transactions, two experts in Chinese law say. The omissions are likely to raise more questions about who ultimately controls HNA, a private company that in recent years has spent more than $30 billion acquiring stakes in global companies like Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank.

"BETHEL, Alaska — The contractions were coming eight minutes apart, and Billie Jo Yupanik was breathing into them, her gaze down, hands cradling her abdomen. Around her, other pregnant women padded around the open, airy rooms of the Yukon-Kuskokwim prematernal home, chatting on phones or grabbing coffee from the pot. They mostly smiled and nodded at Ms. Yupanik as they passed, but otherwise seemed to pay her little mind. Going into labor, after all, is hardly remarkable in this place. Childbirth has become more dangerous for women across much of the United States over the last two decades; maternal death rates have doubled since the late 1980s, according to federal figures. Rural places — here in Alaska and across the lower 48 states — are among the hardest hit as vast distances, widespread poverty and fewer doctors make it harder to obtain access to health care. And Native populations are often on the very edge of that disparity: A baby born to an Alaska Native mother is four times as likely to die in the first year of life as a white baby. But here on the far western end of the nation’s biggest and most rural state, where roads are nearly nonexistent and populations are scattered across tiny villages, caregivers are trying to change the equation not by sending more doctors out, but by bringing more women in. At their first prenatal visits to the hospital, doctors assign a due date for the baby and a “be in Bethel” date 30 days earlier, for a stay at the prematernal home, which the hospital operates nearby. An added stern warning makes most women comply: If they don’t come, they might give birth without a doctor’s care at all. Bethel, population 6,400, is the biggest town for more than 350 miles in any direction, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, the one hospital in the region, serves an area the size of Oregon.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: First, if you were in Chicopee, Mass., and picked 6, 7, 16, 23 and 26, with a Powerball number of 4, congratulations. $758.7 million is all you need to know. • The wall between Trump and his party. President Trump is threatening to shut down the government in a matter of weeks if the Republican-led Congress doesn’t fund his long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. That complicates an already ambitious congressional to-do list, including resolving the budget, avoiding a default on the country’s debt and overhauling the tax system. The president also attacked lawmakers, notably Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, whose votes he’ll need when Congress returns next month. Mr. Trump promised on Wednesday to improve medical care for veterans, in a speech that contrasted sharply with his rally the night before. "
"HAMBURG, Germany — If you haven’t heard anything about the election campaign in Germany, that’s because there isn’t much of one, despite the fact that nationwide elections that will determine, among other things, whether Chancellor Angela Merkel stays or goes are set for Sept. 24. Yes, we are talking about the same Germany that has taken in roughly one million refugees and migrants in the last two years. The same Germany that bailed out bankrupt European states with billions of euros. The same Germany that has taken a tough stance toward Russia after its annexation of Crimea. The same Germany that is switching off all its nuclear power plants and turning to green energy. All of this has happened under Ms. Merkel’s watch, and all of it is controversial here. And yet there is little doubt that she will win her fourth run at the chancellorship, which she has held since 2005. According to polls, if the elections were to take place now, she would beat her opponent, the Social Democrat Martin Schulz, by 20 points. As of now, the only question appears to be whether Ms. Merkel will seek a coalition of her Christian Democrats with the Liberals or the Green Party. And while both candidates have held rallies and made speeches, the public, and even much of the news media, seems either uninterested or resigned to the results. It’s not that Germans are uninterested in politics or the issues; it’s that they’ve accepted the fact that the country’s national politics are locked in place by a centrist consensus that gives them little choice at the ballot box. This mass resignation highlights two paradoxes about German politics right now. The first paradox is that German voters are so temperamentally conservative — i.e., afraid of change — that they are about to re-elect a chancellor who has brought about the most drastic changes the country has seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall. “You know me” was Ms. Merkel’s central message in the run-up to the previous elections, in 2013. But it was only after she had retaken office that the Germans really got to know her. Nobody would have believed that this rather reserved, calculating physicist would, based on a gut decision in September 2015, allow several months of largely uncontrolled immigration into Germany. After the influx, Ms. Merkel’s message was “we’ll manage this,” without explaining what exactly “we,” “manage” and “this” mean. "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — Days after President Trump’s announcement of a new strategy for Afghanistan, the top American officials in Kabul said Thursday that a promised increase in United States military personnel and air power was already underway in the country. At a news conference in the Afghan capital, the military commander for United States and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John W. Nicholson, said that the influx of new troops — mostly trainers for the Afghan security forces — would continue over the next few months. He did not provide details on the number of troops, and he emphasized that American forces would remain in Afghanistan with no prestated timeline for withdrawal. Previous reports have suggested that the increase, which Mr. Trump has put in the hands of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former Marine general, would amount to around 4,000 additional American troops. They would be joining an American force that officially totals about 8,400, but that the Pentagon recently acknowledged to The Wall Street Journal is closer to 12,000. More than 4,000 troops from other NATO countries are also said to be in Afghanistan. “There will be additional capabilities, some of that is already arriving,” General Nicholson said. “But we are not going to talk about the specific numbers. We are not going to telegraph to the enemy what it is we are going to do and how we are going to influence the battlefield.” General Nicholson said that air support to the Afghan forces would also be ramping up. That support has already been extensive in a year of major territorial gains for the Taliban insurgency. The United States Air Force reported dropping about 1,250 bombs and other ordnance in the first seven months of this year, almost twice as many as in the same period last year. "
