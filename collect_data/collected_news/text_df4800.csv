"WASHINGTON — Republicans took a critical step toward notching their first significant legislative victory since assuming full political control, as the House and Senate voted along party lines on Tuesday and into early Wednesday to pass the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in decades. The $1.5 trillion tax bill, which is expected to head to President Trump’s desk in the coming days, will have broad effects on the economy, making deep and lasting cuts to corporate taxes as well as temporarily lowering individual taxes. The endeavor was not without hiccups, however, as three small provisions in the final tax bill agreed to by the House and Senate were found by the Senate parliamentarian to violate the budget rules that Republicans must follow to pass their bill through a process that shields it from a Democratic filibuster. As a result, the bill changed slightly in the Senate, and the House will now need to vote on it again since both chambers must approve identical legislation. Among the items that were deemed out of order was the title of the bill: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The approval of the bill in the House and Senate came over the strenuous objections of Democrats, who have accused Republicans of giving a gift to corporations and the wealthy and driving up the federal debt in the process. As the final vote approached in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, gave his closing argument against the bill and scolded his Republican colleagues for talking during his remarks on the floor.

"At the end of this banner stock market year, you can bet that major business publications will be naming their investor of the year. You can stop now. I have the winner, and nobody is even close when it comes to his total return on investment: Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. A recent report in The Washington Post, quoting intelligence sources, said Putin may have spent less than $500,000 to hack our last election and help (though Hillary helped much more) Donald Trump become president. And Putin’s payoff is Trump’s first year: a president who is simultaneously eroding some of our most basic norms, undermining some of our most cherished institutions and enacting a mammoth tax bill that will not make America great again. If you assume, as I do, that Putin wants to see an America that is not an attractive model for his own people or others to emulate, and that he wants an America run by a chaos president who cannot lead the West, then Trump is his dream come true, whether or not there was any collusion between them. So Vladimir Putin, come on up! You’re my Investor of the Year. You’re the Warren Buffett of geopolitics. Just do the math: On norms, we’ve grown numb to a president who misleads or outright lies every day. Different newspapers measure this differently. The Washington Post says Trump has averaged 5.5 false or misleading claims every day in office, putting him on pace for 1,999 in his first year. According to The Times, Barack Obama told 18 “distinct falsehoods” over his entire eight-year presidency, while Trump, in his first 10 months in office, “has told 103 separate untruths, many of them repeatedly.” Given the power of the president to shape our public discourse, it’s chilling to imagine what four years and 8,000 lies or misleading statements from Trump will do to trust in government in America — and how deeply that will filter into society, giving permission to anyone and everyone to lie with impunity.

"WASHINGTON — With more and more states running out of money for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, parents took their case to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, pleading with Congress to provide money before their sons and daughters lose health care and coverage. But the program, known as CHIP, which insures nearly nine million children, took a back seat as lawmakers raced to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut. CHIP’s fate, it appears, is now caught up in a messy fight over an end-of-the-year deal on spending that must be struck by Friday to avert a government shutdown. “CHIP is being used as a pawn in larger debates and negotiations,” Linda Nablo, the chief deputy director of the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, said Tuesday in an interview. “It has fallen victim to the dysfunction and partisanship in Congress. And we are getting very close to the point where some children will also be victims.” Virginia sent letters last week to parents of 68,000 children warning them that CHIP coverage would end on Jan. 31 unless Congress took action. Congress has known since April 2015 that funds for the popular children’s insurance program — created and sustained for two decades with bipartisan support — would expire this year at the end of September. The Senate Finance Committee approved a five-year extension of funding for the program in early October, but did not specify how to pay for it — and Republicans insist that it must be paid for. The House passed a bill to provide five years of funds in early November, but those funds would come from public health programs set up under the Affordable Care Act and an increase in premiums for affluent Medicare beneficiaries, provisions that are unacceptable to most Democrats. House Republicans plan to send those same provisions to the Senate again this week as part of a stopgap spending bill, knowing they will be killed.

"WASHINGTON — The sting of failure on health care still lingered in the Senate on Aug. 3, when Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, summoned the Republican members of the Budget Committee to his office. We need to pass a tax bill this fall, Mr. McConnell told his colleagues, and we need a budget that allows us to do that. There was no dissent. Within two months, party leaders had hammered out a budget that steamrolled their previous concerns over adding to the federal budget deficit, in order to pave the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. In rapid order, the budget passed the Senate, then the House, putting Republicans on track to deliver a tax bill at breakneck speed to President Trump’s desk by Christmas. The $1.5 trillion bill represents the most sweeping overhaul of the United States tax code in decades, delivering deep and permanent cuts to corporations and temporary tax cuts to individuals. Early Wednesday morning, Republicans claimed victory as the Senate voted 51-48 to pass the bill, which the House passed on Tuesday 227 to 203. But in many ways, the bill represents a political and economic gamble for Republicans. A majority of Americans oppose it, and relatively few believe they will benefit personally from it, polls show. Economic analyses predict it will add more than $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next decade, an amount that would betray the party’s longstanding messaging that mounting federal debt will sap economic growth. Republicans spurned those concerns, rallying around what has been the animating ideology of their party since the Reagan era: that tax cuts will drive faster growth and national prosperity. More immediately, they followed an overwhelming desire to notch a legislative “win” for the president, their donors, the restless voters of their party base and for their own political fortunes. There were crucial steps that ensured passage, including a deficit bargain struck between Senators Patrick J. Toomey and Bob Corker in September, pressure from Mr. Trump on a controversial push to tweak retirement savings in the bill and, in the Senate, an early and crucial endorsement from John McCain of Arizona, the Republican wild card whose late defection killed the health care bill.

"WASHINGTON — The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has influenced Republican White Houses and shaped conservative policy since the 1970s, named a new president on Tuesday who has deep ties to the party’s social conservative and evangelical Christian wing as it moved to steady itself after a year of internal turmoil. Kay Coles James, who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, will fill the vacancy left this year when Heritage’s board unexpectedly removed Jim DeMint, the former senator from South Carolina who became a leading practitioner of the uncompromising, no-apologies style of conservatism that characterized the Tea Party revolt. If Mr. DeMint’s appointment in 2013 was a sign that Heritage was embracing the grass-roots energy that had proved so disruptive to the Republican Party, naming Ms. James was an acknowledgment that many inside the organization believe Heritage had strayed from its mission of acting as the intellectual and policy guide star for conservatives. Like other institutions that had grown comfortable in their roles as fixtures of the political establishment, Heritage has struggled to find a meaningful role for itself in President Trump’s Washington. Some inside the group complained that it had little influence in shaping debates on Capitol Hill that conservatives should have been far better prepared for — like the struggle over repealing the Affordable Care Act. And a few of Heritage’s largest donors and board members like Rebekah Mercer, whose family helped finance Mr. Trump’s campaign, agitated for change, arguing that the group was squandering its opportunity to lead at a time when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. Inside the organization, people viewed Ms. James as a safe choice who, while unlikely to resolve the tensions over Heritage’s direction, would not make them any worse.

"Donald Trump has often been described as the second coming of P. T. Barnum, the legendary 19th-century showman. Biographers, academics and journalists have embraced this idea, as have members of Mr. Trump’s family. “He is P. T. Barnum,” his sister once said. With a movie opening on Wednesday that is loosely inspired by Barnum’s life — “The Greatest Showman,” starring Hugh Jackman — we’re likely to hear these comparisons again. Please: Barnum would be appalled by Mr. Trump. While they share some superficial similarities, it’s the differences that stand out. Phineas Taylor Barnum is a figure frequently invoked but rarely understood. He amassed a fortune promoting a bewildering range of popular entertainments: an elderly slave masquerading as George Washington’s nursemaid; a gifted Swedish opera singer, Jenny Lind, whom he turned into an international superstar; a half-monkey, half-fish masterpiece of taxidermy that he advertised as the FeeJee Mermaid; and other attractions, dubious and genuine. Many of these he exhibited at his American Museum in Lower Manhattan. Later, he took the show on the road, touring the world with his famous circus and sideshows. Barnum’s hyperbole, his willingness to bend the truth when promoting his entertainments, his artful manipulation of the press, never mind his participation in outright hoaxes, invite comparisons with Mr. Trump. Likewise, Barnum’s fondness for living large — he built a garish Moorish mansion he called “Iranistan” — calls to mind Mr. Trump’s gilded excesses. Both men became teetotalers; both went bankrupt, only to claw their way back to the top. And then, of course, there’s Barnum’s famous saying: “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Except that Barnum never said that or anything like it, though it was a popular saying among 19th-century con artists and flimflam men. As a showman, Barnum went to great lengths to distinguish himself from these swindlers. He believed that if he accepted customers’ hard-earned cash, he had to give them their money’s worth. “No one,” Barnum declared in his autobiography, “can say that he ever paid for admission to one of my exhibitions more than his admission was worth to him.” A patron of Barnum’s museum might dispute the authenticity of some exhibits. But visitors rarely, if ever, came away feeling shortchanged or cheated. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/opinion/trump-barnum.html?searchResultPosition=110

"WASHINGTON — An end-of-the-year showdown that was once promised over delicate issues like immigration, health care and surveillance appeared to fizzle on Wednesday as key Republicans dropped their demands to shore up shaky health insurance markets and Democrats appeared to abandon their goal to force adoption of a measure protecting young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Instead, Congress moved toward a one-month punt that would keep the government funded into January and once again put off policy confrontations. As Republicans celebrated the passage of their tax overhaul at the White House with President Trump, the party’s leaders in the House and Senate worked behind the scenes to shape a stopgap spending measure to fund federal agencies and avert a government shutdown. Only days ago, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she would vote for the tax bill because she had secured a promise from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to include two health care provisions to stabilize insurance markets in an end-of-the-year spending measure. On Wednesday, she dropped that demand and said she hoped it would be passed in early 2018. “It looks like the Christmas present of lower health insurance premiums will now have to be a Valentine’s Day present,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who had joined Ms. Collins’s demand. Similarly, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, traded his vote on the tax bill, in part for a promise from Republican leaders to consider a deal to protect young immigrants brought into the United States as children, known as Dreamers. Mr. McConnell said on Wednesday that if negotiators could reach bipartisan agreement on the deal in January, he would put it to a full Senate vote.

"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court indicated on Wednesday that federal courts in California had moved too fast in ordering the Trump administration to disclose documents concerning its decision to end a program that protected some 800,000 young, undocumented immigrants from deportation. In an unsigned opinion, the justices instructed the lower courts to consider the administration’s arguments on two threshold legal issues before requiring that the documents be turned over. The administration contends that its decision to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was within its lawful discretion and that the courts are in any event without jurisdiction to review the matter. “Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the district court to examine a complete administrative record,” the Supreme Court’s opinion said. Should the courts reject those arguments, the opinion said, they should nonetheless consider requiring fewer documents to be produced and allow the administration to present arguments about whether particular documents are privileged. There were no noted dissents from Wednesday’s opinion, which appeared to be the product of compromise. That was in contrast to the Supreme Court’s first order in the case on Dec. 8, when the justices split 5 to 4 along ideological lines. The more conservative members of the court were in the majority, and they allowed the administration to temporarily shield the documents. The dispute arose in five consolidated lawsuits in California that accused administration officials of acting unlawfully when they abruptly rescinded the program. The plaintiffs include four states: California, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota. Judge William H. Alsup of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered the administration to turn over internal documents concerning its reasons for canceling the program. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the administration’s request to block Judge Alsup’s order, with the majority saying that the few documents provided by the administration had been inadequate in light of the magnitude of the decision to end the program. In an emergency application to the Supreme Court, the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, asked the justices to step in. He said Judge Alsup’s order was an “extraordinary departure from bedrock principles governing judicial review of federal agency action,” given the practical burdens it imposed and in its intrusion into the administration’s internal deliberations. In its opinion on Wednesday, the Supreme Court noted that the administration had produced just 256 pages of documents, of which “nearly 200 pages consist of published opinions from various federal courts.” In setting aside the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, the Supreme Court said it was not expressing any views on the merits of the dispute.

"When President  Trump adds his distinctive signature to the tax bill, he will also be making a huge bet that the Republican strategy of deep cuts for businesses and wealthy individuals will fuel extraordinary growth across the board. Perhaps more than any other American political leader, Mr. Trump knows that long shots, like his own presidential bid, sometimes pay off. In that vein, he and congressional Republicans are arguing that their bitterly contested and expensive rewrite of the tax code will ultimately create more jobs and raise wages. If they are proved correct, they will be repudiating not only historical experience, but most experts. From Congress’s own prognosticators to Wall Street’s virtuosos, scarcely any independent analyses project anything like the rosy forecasts offered by the president’s top economic advisers. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the normal models just do not fully capture the high-octane “rocket fuel” embedded in the tax plan. Mr. Trump intuitively understands just how much attitudes and expectations can shape economic decisions. With a businessman in the White House, Mr. Trump argues that companies, large and small, have a renewed faith in the economy. And the corporate tax cut, combined with the rollback in regulation, will prompt waves of new investment and hiring, as middle-class Americans liberally spend the extra money in their pockets. “We’re going to easily see 4 percent growth next year,” the National Economic Council director, Gary D. Cohn, said. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared the tax plan would generate enough growth to more than pay for its $1.5 trillion cost.

"Time was when any New York politician with a grain of ambition had to show reverence for the three I’s. That would be Ireland, Italy and Israel. For anyone aspiring to high office, visiting those lands was almost as fundamental as breathing, and a balanced citywide ticket contained descendants of each I. So you had carefully assembled combos like O’Dwyer, Joseph and Impellitteri (Democrats, 1945) and Lefkowitz, Fino and Gilhooley (Republicans, 1961). The three-I rule hasn’t disappeared, though it lacks the power it once had. These days, New York politicians seem more in thrall to a one-I imperative: Iowa. That’s where Mayor Bill de Blasio was to be found this week, talking up a progressive agenda at a gathering of like-minded liberals in Des Moines. Given that Iowa sounds the opening bell in presidential races, did the trip reflect his 2020 vision? Not at all, Mr. de Blasio insisted repeatedly in an echo of Calvin (“I do not choose to run”) Coolidge. Somehow, no matter how many times he said it, not everyone was convinced. When political types book passage to Iowa and deny any thought of national office, they sound an awful lot like guys who claimed back in Playboy’s heyday that they bought the magazine solely for the Nabokov and Cheever short stories. Iowa got a heavy dose of New York in 2015 and early 2016, what with campaign tramping by Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who may represent Vermont but still speaks with the unmistakable cadences of his Brooklyn yout’. This week, in addition to the mayor, the city imposed itself on Iowans in the form of anti-de Blasio labor protests. The Transport Workers Union bought billboard space and took out ads in The Des Moines Register — “a warning to the people of Iowa” that this Bill was “phony as a $3 bill.” And the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association dispatched officers to stalk the mayor with a message that he shouldn’t be allowed “to stand on the mantle of being progressive and pro-labor when we know the truth is different.” Those were the words of the P.B.A. president, Patrick Lynch, not normally noted for worrying about the state of progressivism in America.

"DES MOINES — The House of Representatives had just passed its sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code, and Mayor Bill de Blasio unfurled his long arms in a windowless Iowa conference room to express his displeasure at what he said was a “bad day for the country.” “Now,” he said, “comes the work of dealing with it.” The bill will deeply affect New York City, but on Tuesday Mr. de Blasio was a time zone away, talking up his two-pronged plan to remake the Democratic Party and then retake Congress in 2018. Buoyed by his own re-election last month — he volunteered his winning percentage multiple times in a 30-minute interview here — the mayor said he sees himself as proof positive that his “brand” of “progressive economic populism” sells. “I think that gives me license to say, ‘Hey guys, I want to give you a good example,’” he said. “I don’t pretend to be the arbiter of all truth, but I think I have something to contribute. And I think people are listening.” So Mr. de Blasio flew to Iowa this week, tucking his nearly 6-foot-6 frame into a pair of coach seats (he had a layover) to visit the state that kicks off the presidential nominating contest. Coming here guaranteed that Mr. de Blasio would get the 2020 question — no, he says, he is not running — even as he feigned frustration that it’s been asked and answered. Some passengers recognized him and could be overheard discussing his itinerary. “Big ambitions?” one person said. “Yup,” said another. If the idea of Mr. de Blasio-to-Iowa rings familiar, that’s because it is. He did much the same in 2015, to notable failure. He tried to get Democrats to adopt his “progressive agenda,” launched a nonprofit group and promised a presidential forum. All three fizzled. He then stalled for months before endorsing his former boss, Hillary Clinton, and when he finally did, her campaign buried his blessing among an avalanche of other mayoral backers. Now he is again unapologetically opening his political aperture far beyond New York City, even before his second-term swearing-in. His 28-hour jaunt to Iowa, he said, is just the first stop. Why here and now? ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-democrats-iowa.html?searchResultPosition=60
"As Republican lawmakers celebrate the passage of a tax bill that will make the wealthiest Americans richer, many lower-income families are faced with the real possibility that their children will soon lose their health insurance because Congress didn’t care enough to renew funding for it. The Children’s Health Insurance Program has enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation in 1997. It covers about nine million kids from families who are not affluent by any stretch of the imagination but happen to earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. In the past, the program was typically reauthorized for five years with little controversy. Not this time. Republican leaders in Congress have been unwilling or unable to make CHIP, as the program is known, a priority since funding lapsed nearly three months ago. The situation has gotten so bad that families with young children who benefit from the program visited Capitol Hill this week to beg lawmakers to fund CHIP. This has forced state governments, which run the program, to scramble. This week, officials in Alabama said they would drop the coverage of 7,000 children and freeze the program to new enrollees on New Year’s Day. That state would have to end its program, which serves 84,000 kids in total, on Feb. 1. Virginia told parents of 68,000 children that its program could end on Jan. 31. Connecticut, Colorado and other states have issued similar warnings. All told, 16 states will run out of CHIP funds by the end of January, and another 21 will run out of money by the end of March, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Republican lawmakers say they will eventually get around to reauthorizing CHIP. First, though, they insist that Democrats must agree to cut other spending to offset some of the cost of the program. For example, they have proposed raising Medicare premiums on affluent retirees and cutting spending on public health programs created by the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have rightly balked at such demands, especially since Republicans just passed a tax bill that will mostly benefit corporations and the wealthiest families in the country while adding more than $1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. By contrast, CHIP costs just $14 billion a year, or $140 billion or more over a decade. In dismissing concerns about the program, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah epitomized the degradation of so much of the Republican Party this year. Mr. Hatch, who helped create this program with Senator Edward Kennedy, said on the floor of the Senate, almost sneering sanctimoniously, “the reason CHIP’s having trouble is because we don’t have money anymore.” Mr. Hatch and his Republican colleagues had no trouble finding boatloads of money to cut taxes on real estate developers, hedge fund managers and corporate chief executives.

"WARSAW — Poland’s president signed sweeping legislation on Wednesday to overhaul the country’s judicial system, a move critics say fundamentally undermines the rule of law in a nation that only three decades ago broke free from the yoke of the Soviet Union to embrace democracy. The new laws effectively put the Polish courts under the control of the right-wing governing party, Law and Justice. In signing them, President Andrzej Duda defied a formal warning delivered only hours earlier by the European Union, which called the legislation a “serious breach” of bedrock values like the rule of law. Once viewed as a symbol for the successful integration of former Eastern Bloc countries into the West, Poland is now seen as portending a far darker trend — a turn toward right-wing populism and away from values like pluralism and respect for dissent. The turn has underscored an emerging rift on the Continent between countries in the West like France and Germany, where the political establishment has rallied around core democratic values, and countries in the East like Poland and Hungary, where populist leaders have succeeded by appealing to the old gods of nation, faith and family. “If you had asked me two years ago if Poland would have found itself at this moment, I would have said no way,” said Michal Baranowski, who directs the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a pro-European research organization dedicated to trans-Atlantic values. “I think it comes to the surprise of many, not only in Poland but throughout the West.” Charles A. Kupchan, an adviser on European affairs during the Obama administration, said the new laws were “yet another sign of the rising tide of illiberalism that has taken hold in Central Europe.” He called the changes “inconsistent with democratic norms and values.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/world/europe/eu-poland-law.html?searchResultPosition=91
"When Donald Trump’s campaign was accused of spreading “fake news,” he quickly appropriated the term for himself. The true purveyors of fake news, he claimed, were television networks like CNN and newspapers like this one. Now, as Mr. Trump and his allies seem on the verge of staging a coup against independent institutions and the rule of law — maligning the special counsel Robert Mueller and threatening a purge at the F.B.I. — the president’s supporters are appropriating yet another word for themselves. Mr. Mueller’s investigation aims to “destroy” the Trump presidency “for partisan political purposes and to disenfranchise millions of American voters,” the Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed on Saturday. “We have a coup on our hands in America.” This marks a new era in American politics. The Republican Party is no longer just obfuscating the truth or defending the president when he is accused of wrongdoing. Rather, Mr. Trump, Fox News and Republicans in Congress seem to be actively using falsehoods to prepare an assault on the institutions that allow American democracy to function. In all democracies, politicians occasionally lie to cover up scandals or exaggerate their legislative accomplishments. In the United States, the rise of the right-wing news media in recent decades has tempted politicians to play to their own supporters without worrying whether their rhetoric is inflammatory or fair. But the construction of an alternate reality that obviates the very possibility of conducting politics on the basis of truth is a novelty in this country. And it is increasingly becoming obvious that it will serve a clear purpose: to prepare the ground for egregious violations of basic democratic norms. Once any string of words is considered as true as any other, any course of action comes to seem as legitimate as any other. One moment, Mr. Mueller is a respected civil servant leading an important investigation at the behest of the Justice Department. The next, he is plotting a coup — potentially committing treason, a felony for which the law demands the death penalty. By the same token, Mr. Trump would, at one moment, be scandalously overstepping the bounds of his rightful authority in firing Mr. Mueller or pardoning his closest associates. The next moment, he would be valiantly defending the Republic. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/opinion/trump-republican-coup.html?searchResultPosition=62
"President Trump on Wednesday commuted the prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, whose Iowa meatpacking plant was the target of a huge immigration raid in 2008, and whose 27-year prison sentence angered many Orthodox Jews. Mr. Rubashkin made national headlines nine years ago after federal agents arrived by helicopter at the Agriprocessors plant in Postville, Iowa, and detained nearly 400 undocumented immigrants, including several children, who were working there. Mr. Rubashkin was the company’s chief executive, and the plant had been the largest kosher meatpacking operation in the country. He was later convicted of bank fraud in federal court. Many Jewish leaders have rallied behind Mr. Rubashkin, whose treatment they said was unfair, perhaps even anti-Semitic, and whose sentence they considered unduly harsh and out of line with what other white-collar criminals received. Mr. Rubashkin had tried for years to get a reduced sentence, but was repeatedly turned down by the courts. “Rubashkin has remained strong throughout his ordeal and convinced he would eventually obtain justice,” said Guy R. Cook, the lead trial lawyer for Mr. Rubashkin, in an email on Wednesday night. “Rubashkin and his family are overjoyed he is free and will be reunited with them.” In a statement announcing the commutation, White House officials said they had received letters from more than 30 members of Congress, including several members of both parties, supporting an examination of the case. “The president’s review of Mr. Rubashkin’s case and commutation decision were based on expressions of support from members of Congress and a broad cross-section of the legal community,” the White House statement said.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The Republican tax bill will soon be law. But the fight over it is just beginning. Democrats will campaign against it and hope to repeal much of it. And no matter which party is in charge, Congress and the White House will have to revisit tax policy in coming years, because this bill is full of gimmicky expiration dates. It’s an unstable bill that’s “likely to prove fleeting,” as Fordham’s Rebecca Kysar and Linda Sugin write in The Times today. So when Congress next takes up tax policy, are there any parts of the bill it should preserve? Yes. Even a bill as dreadful as this one has a few positive attributes. In particular, this bill contains the faint outlines of sensible tax simplification. They are very faint, to be clear. The status quo would be vastly preferable to this bill. But once this bill becomes the status quo, Democrats should avoid trying to repeal all of it merely for the sake of doing so. As Bloomberg’s Justin Fox notes, a lower corporate-tax rate makes sense. For years, this country’s corporate-tax code has been the worst of both worlds. The official rate has been higher than almost any other country’s, encouraging companies to distort their behavior to avoid paying that rate. Yet the government has raised relatively little money in corporate-tax revenue, because the code’s many loopholes allow companies to avoid the official rate. (I went into detail in this 2011 column.) This bill solves only the first of those two problems and solves it too aggressively, cutting the rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent. As a result, it’s a huge handout to corporate America. “But,” Fox writes, “going back to 35 percent would be a bad idea.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/opinion/tax-bill-vote-congress.html?searchResultPosition=92

"President Trump’s National Security Strategy marks a dramatic departure from the plans of his Republican and Democratic predecessors, painting a dark, almost dystopian portrait of an “extraordinarily dangerous” world characterized by hostile states and lurking threats. There is scant mention of America’s unrivaled political, military, technological and economic strength, or the opportunities to expand prosperity, freedom and security through principled leadership — the foundation of American foreign policy since World War II. In Mr. Trump’s estimation, we live in a world where America wins only at others’ expense. There is no common good, no international community, no universal values, only American values. America is no longer “a global force for good,” as in President Obama’s last strategy, or a “shining city on a hill,” as in President Reagan’s vision. The new strategy enshrines a zero-sum mentality: “Protecting American interests requires that we compete continuously within and across these contests, which are being played out in regions around the world.” This is the hallmark of Mr. Trump’s nationalistic, black-and-white “America First” strategy. But the world is actually gray, and Mr. Trump’s strategy struggles to draw nuanced distinctions. Throughout, China and Russia are conflated and equated as parallel adversaries. In fact, China is a competitor, not an avowed opponent, and has not illegally occupied its neighbors. Russia, as the strategy allows, aggressively opposes NATO, the European Union, Western values and American global leadership. It brazenly seized Georgian and Ukrainian territory and killed thousands of innocents to save a dictator in Syria. Russia is our adversary, yet Mr. Trump’s strategy stubbornly refuses to acknowledge its most hostile act: directly interfering in the 2016 presidential election to advantage Mr. Trump himself. On China and Russia, I suspect the White House realists, to escape the embarrassment of a strategy that ignored Russia’s hostile behavior, agreed to lump China with Russia and almost always mention China first, to placate their nationalist colleagues who hate China but admire Russia. The result is a flawed analysis that may actually drive Russia and China closer together. In several respects, including nuclear weapons and arms control, weapons of mass destruction, counterterrorism, intelligence, cyberthreats, space policy, unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property, the strategy falls within the bipartisan mainstream of United States national security policy, differing little from that of a more traditional Republican president. In other areas, it helpfully corrects this administration’s wavering course, as in its unequivocal embrace of United States allies and partners and reaffirmation of our Article V commitment to defend NATO. The strategy recognizes the threat from pandemics and biohazards and the importance of strengthening global health security. And it maintains at least a nominal commitment to women’s empowerment and providing generous humanitarian assistance.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump issued a threat on Wednesday to cut off American aid to any country that votes for a resolution at the United Nations condemning his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Mr. Trump’s statement, delivered at a cabinet meeting in which he exulted over the passage of a tax overhaul, followed a letter to General Assembly members from the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, in which she warned that the United States would take note of countries that voted in favor of the measure. “All of these nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council or they vote against us, potentially, at the Assembly, they take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,” Mr. Trump said. “Well, we’re watching those votes,” he added. “Let them vote against us; we’ll save a lot. We don’t care.” It is difficult to see how Mr. Trump can make good on that threat because it could involve cutting off financial assistance to the country’s most strategic allies in the Middle East. Some of those programs, like Egypt’s, are congressionally mandated. While the president can hold up aid unilaterally as a form of leverage, canceling it would require new legislation. Still, the bitter confrontation at the United Nations shows the lingering repercussions of Mr. Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem, which defied world opinion and upended decades of American policy. While the decision has not unleashed the violence in the Arab capitals that some had feared, it has left the United States diplomatically isolated.

"BERLIN — Deborah Feldman has learned to follow the sun. December marks the 31-year-old Brooklyn-raised writer’s fourth winter living in Berlin, a place notorious for its long, gray months, and by now she has it down: On the rare days when the cloud cover breaks, she hurries to her local market hall, a 100-year-old, light-flooded space in Berlin’s Kreuzberg neighborhood. There, the sun shines around noon, for an hour. Then, juggling TV interviews, photo shoots, newspaper deadlines, public readings, awards ceremonies, child care and work on her new novel, Ms. Feldman moves to a west-facing terrace in a nearby cemetery, before heading to her favorite cafe table at around 2 p.m. for a final 20-minute glimpse of the sun. “I try to get all the light I can,” Ms. Feldman said, with a smile. This perseverance has characterized much of Ms. Feldman’s extraordinary life. Born into a Yiddish-speaking Hasidic Jewish sect founded by Holocaust survivors, after World War II, in Brooklyn, Ms. Feldman was raised to believe that Hitler’s extermination of the Jews was God’s punishment for European Jewish assimilation. To save the Jewish nation, she was taught that Jews must live apart from society, and abide by old Jewish rules and traditions. She documented her repressive upbringing, the arranged marriage she entered into at 17 and her decision to take her young son and leave the community in her best-selling memoir, “Unorthodox,” which was published in the United States in 2012. But even after the success of her book, Ms. Feldman never felt quite at home in the United States. She found mainstream American life disorienting. “I grew up in a shtetl,” Ms. Feldman said, referring to the economic, political and cultural bubble she lived in. “It would have been really hopeless for me to try to become American.” In one of the dramatic ironies that punctuate her story, Ms. Feldman — who was raised by a loving but traumatized grandmother (her father was mentally ill and her mother left the marriage and the community when Ms. Feldman was young) who barely survived several Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen — instead found herself drawn to Berlin.

"MOSCOW — The war in rebel-held eastern Ukraine has escalated sharply this week, with the heaviest fighting in nearly a year, European observers and Western diplomats reported on Wednesday. The fighting broke out in the midst of a snowstorm overnight Tuesday and has continued unabated since, the observers say. While skirmishes are common, the heavy artillery barrages have been the thickest since a flare-up in February. Ukrainian authorities linked the escalation to the Russian military’s decision to withdraw officers from a joint Russian and Ukrainian liaison group that had assisted in monitoring the shaky cease-fire deal, known as the Minsk 2 agreement. The Russian Foreign Ministry placed the blame for that on Ukraine, saying the Ukrainians had been intimidating the officers and that “all responsibility for possible consequences lies fully on the Ukrainian side.” Since then, a Ukrainian village and a town have been hit with rocket-artillery barrages, wounding eight people and damaging about 50 homes, and at least eight Ukrainian soldiers have been killed. The fighting has also drawn perilously close to a water-treatment plant that stores poisonous chlorine gas, alarming Western officials. “This is considered extremely dangerous,” Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said of the fighting that has now come within about 500 yards of the plant. Pipes that transport the gas — used mostly to disinfect water today, but as a chemical weapon during World War I — are now vulnerable.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump ended a chaotic first year by achieving his most convincing legislative triumph on Wednesday, making good on his promise to deliver what he called a “big, beautiful” tax cut before Christmas and finally demonstrating the political power of unified Republican control in Washington. Mr. Trump will soon affix his signature to the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that will have broad and far-reaching implications for individual and corporate finances, and will cement the president’s political ownership of an already growing economy that he inherited from his predecessor, President Barack Obama. House lawmakers gave final approval to the tax bill on Wednesday, voting 224 to 201 to drop the corporate rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent, and to deliver tax breaks to other businesses. As Republicans seek to bolster American competitiveness and spur economic growth, the bill also includes tax cuts for individuals that are set to expire after 2025 to make the bill comply with budget rules. The president’s turbulent first year in office has been dogged by investigations, staff turmoil and legislative missteps. But with passage of the tax overhaul, Mr. Trump will enter his second year in office with a roster of Republican achievements that he and his party will try to sell to voters in the 2018 midterm elections: lower taxes, more conservative judges, fewer regulations and more restrictive borders. “This is a big week,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a longtime Trump supporter. “A wide range of people are starting to say, ‘I like him, the tweets may irritate me, but something’s happened.’ Clearly this was the pièce de résistance — this bill at this moment just before Christmas.” It is not clear whether Mr. Trump is going to sign the bill before the end of the year. Republicans need to work with Democrats to avert automatic spending cuts that could be set off as a result of the tax bill adding to the deficit. They need support from Democrats to avoid these spending cuts, and if they wait until next year, it will buy them extra time to reach such a deal. Republicans in Congress were struggling to reach an agreement that would keep the government funded into January and avoid a shutdown.

"Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we’re dealing with uncertainty. How will the Trump administration’s national security strategy, which doesn’t mention global warming, influence military planning for a changing world? How can city planners prepare for rising seas when we don’t know how quickly those seas will rise? How much of a lasting imprint will oil drilling leave in the Arctic wildlife refuge? If all of that is worrisome, not to fear. You’re certain to like next week’s newsletter, when we’ll  look back at some of our biggest climate coverage of 2017. This week, national security experts and environmental activists lamented that President Trump’s new national security strategy does not identify climate change as a threat. It’s a stark reversal from President Barack Obama’s strategy in 2015, which stated that rising global temperatures were an “urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter.html?searchResultPosition=84
"It was the year when athletes got political again, very political. By the time December arrived, it seemed more routine than incendiary when Lindsey Vonn, the star American skier, made it plain in a CNN interview that she would not be accepting an invitation to the White House if it were extended after the coming Winter Olympics. She said she would be representing her nation at the Games but not President Trump. “I am proud to be an American, and I want our country to continue to be a symbol of hope, compassion, inclusion and world unity,” Vonn said later, in another sign of the times, on her Instagram account. “My travels around the world have recently made clear that this is no longer how people view the United States. You cannot pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV in Europe without noticing how people are questioning our direction.” In a different era, Vonn, with her extensive list of corporate sponsors and hard-earned prominence in a niche sport, might have been the sort of well-entrenched figure who would have determined that she had much more to lose than to gain by taking a stand (or a knee) on a polarizing matter. There are still ample risks: see Colin Kaepernick’s current employment status after leading the way on national anthem protests in the N.F.L., or the menacing messages Vonn said she received from Trump supporters. But there is no doubt that Vonn was part of a sports chorus in 2017. “I think ‘take a knee’ has really taken on a life of its own and spearheaded everything else that’s been going on,” said the former tennis champion Martina Navratilova, 61, who came out as a lesbian and often spoke up — to her own commercial detriment — during her remarkable career. “Things always kind of operate by waxing and waning. This has been a big spurt, and it’s not done yet, because it hasn’t really been resolved one way or the other as far as I can tell.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/sports/year-sports-protests.html?searchResultPosition=83

"Congressional Republicans have finally done it: Both the House and Senate passed tax legislation. The bill has now headed to President Trump’s desk for his signature. Most dissection of the plan has focused, for obvious reasons, on the way it changes our tax bills. The Tax Policy Center found that in the first years most people would get a tax cut, although the biggest cuts are reserved for the wealthiest. By 2027, lower- and middle-income Americans would get no benefit or actually pay more in taxes. But this bill also serves as a setup for steep government cuts. Programs from Medicare to flood insurance to food stamps will be at risk the moment President Trump’s signature dries. Some reductions would be inflicted automatically. Others, Republicans will pursue with a handy justification — the revenue hole created by their own legislation. Under the Pay-as-You-Go Act of 2010, or Paygo, the Office of Budget and Management has to order automatic spending cuts if legislation passed by Congress is set to increase the deficit and the rules aren’t waived or the loss isn’t covered by new revenue. According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, spending cuts would have to total $136 billion for a bill, such as the tax legislation, that increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion over a decade. What would get cut? Some programs, like Social Security and unemployment benefits, are spared. But plenty of others are seriously exposed. While there are limits on how much Medicare would be pared back, it would still be slashed by $25 billion. The rest of the $111 billion would have to come from other mandatory government programs, and because most have no protection, they would be reduced to barely any funding or nothing at all. That includes block grants for things like Meals on Wheels, farm aid like the crop insurance fund, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and the National Flood Insurance Program.

"WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on five Russian individuals on Wednesday, including the leader of the Republic of Chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses and involvement in criminal conspiracies, a sign that the Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on Russia. The move, which comes despite a more accommodating tone that President Trump has struck with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, blocks property investments that the individuals hold in the United States and forbids Americans from engaging in financial transactions with them. The Treasury Department unveiled the sanctions under the authority of the 2012 Magnitsky Act, an American law that freezes the assets — held in the United States — by Russian officials responsible for human rights abuses, and bars them from receiving American visas. The law was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention after exposing a $230 million tax-theft scam plotted by Russian officials. “Treasury remains committed to holding accountable those involved in the Sergei Magnitsky affair, including those with a role in the criminal conspiracy and fraud scheme that he uncovered,” said John E. Smith, director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. “We will continue to use the Magnitsky Act to aggressively target gross violators of human rights in Russia, including individuals responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture and other despicable acts.” Among those targeted by the sanctions were Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, and Ayub Kataev, a Chechen law enforcement official, for their roles in extrajudicial killings and torture. In 2013, Mr. Kadyrov was placed on a classified list of Russians that the Obama administration had barred from traveling to the United States and whose assets were frozen. The list of prominent Russian figures was kept secret to avoid retaliation by Mr. Putin, but Treasury made public the sanctions against Mr. Kadyrov on Wednesday.

"To the Editor: Re “Republican Tax Bill Passes Senate in 51-48 Vote” (nytimes.com, Dec. 20): During the second 2016 presidential debate, Donald Trump laid the responsibility for failing to close tax loopholes, which he freely admitted to exploiting, squarely at Hillary Clinton’s feet: “Why didn’t you change it when you were a senator?” He then promised — twice — to eliminate the carried interest provision (“one of the greatest provisions for people like me”), along with offering the assurance of “big league” tax relief for the middle class. Mrs. Clinton’s reply is worth remembering: “I’ll tell you what he’s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had … Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.” One of those candidates was telling the truth. The other is now the president of the United States. HOWARD KORDER, SANTA FE, N.M. To the Editor: The 27th Amendment says any pay raise that members of Congress give themselves cannot take effect before an intervening election, so that constituents can have a voice in whether the raise was deserved. Something is terribly foul, then, when Republicans in Congress enrich themselves and their president through a blatantly self-interested tax bill, enacted with no public hearings and minimal scrutiny. In all likelihood, the new tax code will benefit many politicians much more than any raise would. It took our Republic more than two centuries to ratify the 27th Amendment. It took the 45th president and Congress less than two months to render it irrelevant. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/opinion/republican-tax-bill.html?searchResultPosition=76
"UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations High Commissioner for human rights, who has openly criticized powerful governments, including the Trump administration, has made the unusual decision to not seek a second four-year term, saying it “might involve bending a knee in supplication.” The decision by the official, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and former diplomat, was conveyed in a short statement that was emailed to his staff early Wednesday and shared with The New York Times. His four-year term expires next September. “After reflection, I have decided not to seek a second four-year term,” he wrote. “To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication; muting a statement of advocacy; lessening the independence and integrity of my voice — which is your voice.” Most United Nations officials serve as long as their mandate allows. Of the previous human rights chiefs, not one has served a full four-year second term. It has been unclear for months whether Mr. al-Hussein’s boss, Secretary General António Guterres, would support him in seeking a second term or whether the five veto-wielding permanent members of the United Nations Security Council would use their influence to block it. Mr. al-Hussein has been critical of all of them. He has been outspoken about the Russian-backed government of Syria. He has warned of the prospects of genocide by the Chinese-backed government of Myanmar. And he has called out the Trump administration several times, most pointedly on the travel ban against citizens of Muslim-majority countries and after the demonstrations by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.

"WASHINGTON — Senior national security officials in the Trump administration are embracing a proposal to transfer to Saudi Arabia an American citizen being held in Iraq as a wartime detainee, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. A meeting last week of the National Security Council’s “deputies committee” — the No. 2 leaders of national security departments and agencies — found its members united around a goal of pursuing such a transfer for the detainee, suspected of being a low-level Islamic State fighter, who has been held in military custody as an “enemy combatant” for the past three months, the officials said. The man, whose name the government has refused to make public, was born in the United States to visiting Saudi parents, the officials said. A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to comment. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal deliberations. The Trump administration has been wrestling with what to do with the man since a Syrian militia turned him over to American forces in mid-September. Legal pressure to resolve his fate has been building since the American Civil Liberties Union filed a habeas corpus lawsuit in October challenging his detention on his behalf.

"The jury considering the fate of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker charged with participating in an oil-for-gold smuggling scheme that violated United States sanctions against Iran, was sent home by the judge on Wednesday after deliberating for half a day without reaching a verdict. Mr. Atilla, 47, was a deputy general manager of a Turkish state bank, Halkbank, that prosecutors say was crucial to the success of the sanctions evasion. The government presented evidence that Mr. Atilla helped to devise the scheme and that he deceived United States Treasury Department officials about it. “This is a case about lies,” a prosecutor, Michael D. Lockard, said Tuesday in the government’s closing argument. “This is a case about the lies that Mr. Atilla told to cover up a multibillion dollar sanctions-busting scheme operating out of his bank.” Mr. Atilla, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he had participated in any such conspiracy or that he had engaged in wrongdoing. His lawyers painted him as the victim of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who pleaded guilty in October and has been cooperating with the government. “Hakan Atilla is a blameless pawn, collateral damage in a story that belongs in the ‘Twilight Zone,’ not in an American courtroom,” Victor J. Rocco, a lawyer for Mr. Atilla, told the jury on Tuesday in the defense’s summation. Over seven days of testimony, Mr. Zarrab, 34, said the scheme had been approved at the highest levels of the Turkish government. In 2012, he said, Recep Tayyip Erdogan — then Turkey’s prime minister, now its president — ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the operation.

Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The Republican tax plan, which passed Congress Wednesday, has caused AT&T to open up its wallet. The telecom giant said in a press release that it will pay a $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 employees in the United States and would increase its capital expenditure budget for next year by $1 billion. (AT&T said last month it would invest an additional $1 billion if the tax bill became law.) At a news conference Wednesday, President Trump cited AT&T’s move. Is AT&T trying to get on Mr. Tump’s good side? The company is locked in an antitrust battle with the Justice Department to complete its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. The department sued to block the deal and it is scheduled to go to trial March 19. The Justice Department has pushed for AT&T to divest either CNN’s parent company, Turner Broadcasting, or its valuable DirecTV service in return for approval. Those terms have raised the question of whether the department was making good on President Trump’s campaign threat to block the deal. AT&T would not be the first company to seemingly try and get on Mr. Trump’s good side to complete a deal. Last month Broadcom’s C.E.O. held a press conference with President Trump to announce plans to move the company’s headquarters to the United States.

We have a breakdown of how every representative and senator voted on the bill, which would make deep and lasting cuts to corporate taxes as well as temporarily lowering taxes for most individuals. No Democrat in either house voted in favor. As a reminder, here’s what’s in the bill, and a calculator to help you determine how your taxes might change. • Still have questions?

"WASHINGTON — It was an unsightly and painful yearlong slog, but Republicans are finally getting what they so desperately craved — a major legislative victory in the form of a consequential tax overhaul. By coupling a substantial corporate tax cut with an assortment of naked appeals to undecided lawmakers, Republican leaders pushed their tax bill through the House on Tuesday and the Senate on Wednesday, touching off a self-congratulatory tidal wave by a party that had struggled mightily through nearly all of 2017. After an embarrassing inability to repeal the Affordable Care Act — a core promise by congressional Republicans since 2010 — Republicans knew they had no choice but to deliver a tax package or face brutal repudiation by their voters and campaign donors. “Our attitude from the beginning was failure was not an option,” said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No.3 House Republican and the party’s chief vote counter. But even as they closed in on what they celebrated as a historic triumph, Republicans found another creative way to stumble. A challenge to the House-passed measure by Senate Democrats discovered three provisions — including the very title of the bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — that violated special Senate rules being used to skirt a filibuster. The flub necessitated the formality of a second House vote on Wednesday after Speaker Paul D. Ryan and his membership had already spiked the ball after initial approval of the bill on Tuesday.

"A scientist recruited by the renowned Cleveland Clinic is stuck in India because his visa is delayed. An entrepreneur courted by Silicon Valley companies had his application denied. Many green card applicants have new interviews to pass. The Trump administration has pursued its immigration agenda loudly and noticeably, ramping up arrests of undocumented immigrants, barring most travel from several majority-Muslim countries and pressing the case for a border wall. But it has also quietly, and with much less resistance, slowed many forms of legal immigration without the need for Congress to rescind a single visa program enshrined in the law. Immigration and State Department officials are more closely scrutinizing, and have started more frequently denying, visas for people seeking to visit the United States on business, as well as for those recruited by American companies, according to lawyers representing visa seekers. Foreigners already in the United States whose employers wish to extend their stays are also facing new hurdles. “I call this the real wall,” said Anastasia Tonello, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The wall is being built.” The changes show how the Trump administration has managed to carry out the least attention-grabbing, but perhaps farthest-reaching, portion of the president’s immigration plans: cutting the number of people entering the United States each year as temporary workers or permanent residents.

ordan Peele is famous, in part, for imitations — of rappers and dingbats and the 44th president of the United States. But he would be impossible to imitate. He isn’t ribald. He’s droll. Sometimes he’s not even that. Sometimes he’s quiet. Sometimes he’s sitting across from you expecting you to hold up your end of a conversation. Sometimes he’s listening and hearing you — like, really hearing you. This is the Peele who made “Get Out,” and it takes a minute to square him with the Peele from “Key & Peele.” On Halloween, we had lunch at one of those casually cool American bistros in Los Angeles where all the food seems as if it was grown out back. He chose a spot outside, not to be seen (although a few people saw him) but mostly to see. Peele, who is 38, lives in his head, and he watches the world around him intensely. I got the duck, then so did he, and while we ate I was pretty sure I could hear him thinking. It was toward the end of the meal when he saw someone he recognized. Well, he thought he did. “He’s dressed like Chris,” he said with some amusement. “Do you think he’s being Chris?” He was looking past me, so it was hard to turn all the way around to confirm with any subtlety. But Peele’s gaze made it perfectly obvious to the person approaching that Peele was looking at him. “Are you Chris from ‘Get Out’ for Halloween?” Peele asked, committing less an act of racial profiling than an uncanny identification of his own handiwork. “Get Out,” of course, is the surprise hit movie that Peele wrote and directed about a black man named Chris, who discovers that his white girlfriend’s family is running a nasty racist conspiracy. Chris has big, watery eyes that seem red from weariness (or weed) and wears a collarless blue chambray shirt over a gray T-shirt and jeans. The man Peele thought might be costumed as Chris was also black, with skin as dark and eyes as striking as those of Daniel Kaluuya, the actor who plays Chris. This impostor was indeed Chris-attired too. And the white woman he was with could also have been part of the costume. It was the sort of similarity that, once pointed out, can’t be unseen. Alas, it wasn’t Halloween for this guy, just Tuesday. He was thrilled, nonetheless, to be stopped by Chris’s inventor, and he asked Peele for a photo. Peele, who got a kick even out of being wrong, asked him for one, too. The impostor then offered an incidental, partial explanation for why “Get Out” became the phenomenon it did: No, he wasn’t Chris, “but I could be.” It has been 10 months, and we’re still talking about this movie and its alarming presentation of white racism. “Get Out” opened at the top of the box office at the end of February and has grossed many, many times the $4.5 million it cost to make. Racism is old, but Peele found a poetic new way of talking about it. He gave us language we didn’t know we lacked. For a white audience, the movie might be one of the few times they’ve been asked to identify with a regular, imperiled black person without the sweetener of a white co-star — no Spencer Tracy or Sandra Bullock here, just Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford as the Armitages, the sort of parents who’ll inquire about the history of their daughter’s interracial relationship by asking: “How long’s this been going on? This thang,” as daddy Armitage does. For a black audience, the movie could have ended right there. What does an affluent, middle-aged, suburban white dude know about a thang? And what’s he doing saying the word with this much insinuating self-delight, this much put-on jive? “I didn’t want any white saviors,” Peele said over lunch. White saviors hog the history of race in American film. Instead, his movie is full of white people whom Peele reveals as insatiable predators of blackness.

"Early in “The Greatest Showman,” P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: “Just once I’d like to give them something real.” What fun is that? Even after the long-running circus bearing his name closed up shop this year, P.T. Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There’s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: “We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.” “The Greatest Showman,” a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It’s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right. “Showman” has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year’s hit movie “La La Land” (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show “Dear Evan Hansen” (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn’t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn’t get any wittier than that.

"PRIENAI, Lithuania — It was only fitting, perhaps, that an intercontinental escapade exhibiting the awesome power of the present day sports-celebrity-industrial complex began with a late-night direct message on Twitter. At around 1:30 a.m. on Dec. 6, Erikas Kirvelaitis, a 21-year-old basketball journalist in Lithuania, sent an unsolicited question via Twitter to Harrison Gaines, a sports agent in Los Angeles with two semifamous teenage clients: Would LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball, by any chance, be interested in playing professional basketball in Prienai? Kirvelaitis had been hired only a few months earlier to do part-time communications work for Prienai-Birstonas Vytautas, a small club here in the Lithuanian basketball league. His bosses did not know at first about his Twitter gambit. It was a shot in the dark, anyway. But to Kirvelaitis’s amazement, Gaines wrote back asking for more information. And less than a week later, the young Americans were signing contracts to begin their professional careers in this unassuming town nearly 6,000 miles from home. “It was like a dream, crazy, a miracle, for our club to even have contact with them,” Kirvelaitis said. “But I’m someone who believes anything can be done if you try.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/sports/liangelo-lamelo-ball-lithuania.html?searchResultPosition=99
"WASHINGTON — The House, forced to vote a second time on the $1.5 trillion tax bill, moved swiftly to pass the final version on Wednesday, clearing the way for President Trump to sign into law the most sweeping tax overhaul in decades. House lawmakers approved the tax bill 224 to 201 on Wednesday, after being forced to vote on the bill again after last-minute revisions were made to it in the Senate, which passed the measure 51 to 48 early Wednesday morning. The final House vote was essentially a formality, as the changes, which were made to comply with Senate budget rules, did not significantly alter the overall bill. But the need for a second vote gave ammunition to Democrats, who had already accused Republicans of trying to rush the tax overhaul through the House and Senate. “We are five days away from Christmas, but it feels like Groundhog Day,” said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who denounced the process by which Republicans undertook their tax rewrite as “nothing short of an abomination.” Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said, “We will be cleaning up this mess and the blunders in this bill all of next year.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/us/politics/tax-bill-republicans.html?searchResultPosition=94
"WASHINGTON — President Trump celebrated the tax bill that Congress approved on Wednesday by characterizing it as a two-for-one victory, falsely claiming that it also made good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “When the individual mandate is being repealed, that means Obamacare is being repealed,” Mr. Trump said in a cabinet meeting. “We have essentially repealed Obamacare, and we will come up with something that will be much better.” Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he kept two key campaign promises with one bill is not accurate. Effectively, the tax bill does repeal the individual mandate beginning in 2019. The mandate is a core component of the Affordable Care Act and fines people who do not have health insurance. But the tax bill leaves every other vital part of the current health care law intact. “The A.C.A. is far more than the mandate, and the repeal of the mandate is by no means a fatal blow. Most of the A.C.A. survives, and most of its coverage gains will remain,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law and a contributing editor for the journal Health Affairs. Republicans repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act over the summer. The individual mandate was one of 12 key elements of the health care law, which also included provisions that addressed access to insurance, requirements for insurance policies and costs of coverage.

"WASHINGTON — The Republican tax bill headed for President Trump’s desk is the most ambitious test yet of his approach to economic policy — that his ideas for strengthening American business will increase the prosperity of the American people. Mr. Trump championed the plan to cut corporate and individual taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade, forgoing revenue that could have been spent on new roads, worker training or better schools, on the theory that investors will make better use of the money, creating wealth for all Americans. He is pressing to reduce federal regulation, declaring last week that the government has imposed too many rules and constraints, creating a burden that “destroys our companies” and hurts American workers. And bolstering business in the United States is the guiding principle of Mr. Trump’s approach to trade — although his vision of what will help companies competing in a global economy differs sharply from the perspectives of many corporate executives. Mr. Trump, whose worldview is that exports strengthen the economy while imports drain away the nation’s wealth, wants to erect tariffs and other trade barriers to protect American companies from foreign competition, arguing that will translate into more and better-paying jobs. In recent decades, the two political parties pursued economic policies focused on helping people directly. Republicans championed lower income taxes; Democrats emphasized expansion of the social safety net. Both parties sought to improve education through regulation and subsidies. And presidents from the two parties backed trade deals that sacrificed manufacturing jobs for a wave of imports that let consumers buy televisions, furniture and clothing at lower prices.

"Last week, we found ourselves in an unexpected place: in the very back of the top balcony in the Stockholm Concert Hall, watching as King Carl XVI Gustaf awarded medals to this year’s Nobel laureates — in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and economics. As Americans spending the year in Sweden, we were honored and surprised to learn that we had been invited. While we were inspired by the pageantry of the celebration of human achievement, we were simultaneously sobered by the realization that the Trump administration is attacking the very institutions that make Nobel Prize-winning careers possible. In doing so, our country is charting a path to its own irrelevance. The Nobel ceremony takes place each year on Dec. 10, and tickets to the 1,800-seat hall are hard to come by. Each laureate gets 35. The royal family and political figures get their share. Some tickets are given by lottery to students, who wear sailor caps with their universities’ insignia. The remaining invitations are issued according to some unknown hierarchy. Most Swedes end up watching it from their living rooms. Befitting our low rank in the hierarchy, we found out only in late November that we would be attending. We dressed as best we could — a boring suit and tie instead of tails, a borrowed cocktail dress instead of a ball gown — and made our way to the ceremony. As Americans, this was an especially good year to attend. An impressive eight of the 12 individual laureates were American. Watching the ceremony, it was easy to feel patriotic. The laureates on stage represented decades of persistent, innovative work. They showed the intellectual power of the United States’ educational system and the transformative research it produces. We thought about the thousands of students who had passed through their labs, classes and office hours. While the awards are given to only a select few, we know well that each laureate represents an entire intellectual community. But this year, the American Nobel laureates were shunned by President Trump. Breaking with recent tradition, he refused to invite them to the White House. This is difficult to understand. If you’re interested in building up and blaring out American greatness, why not show off what’s already great about the country? In this scenario, the laureates are like the proverbial canaries in a coal mine. The contrast between their warm celebration in Stockholm and their cold reception back home is a harbinger of the United States’ future irrelevance. All of the American laureates are university professors. Yet the current administration and its supporters consistently attack universities as biased, irrelevant and hyper-politicized. It ignores the many contributions that “basic research” has made to human liberty and security. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has no experience — professional or personal — with public schools and no familiarity with fundamental concepts of education. The administration uses dishonest critiques as an excuse to push its political agenda, cutting funding for research that is politically inconvenient. In our own state university system in North Carolina, conservative political appointees to the governing board have closed research centers focused on poverty and banned litigation by the Center for Civil Rights. They are exploring ways to force conservative views onto campuses through intellectual affirmative action. The United States has the best system of higher education in the world, yet this administration and its acolytes seem bent on tearing it down.

"President Trump on Wednesday was poised to sign the new tax bill, passed by Congress, which lifts a decades-old ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska. Here’s a look at what might happen now. No. Both supporters and opponents say it could be years before the first lease sale, a precursor to any drilling. The new legislation requires that the Department of Interior conduct one sale within four years and a second within seven. But there are many steps that must be taken before those sales can be held, and the process is not completely clear. Lawsuits and other actions by opponents of drilling could slow things, both before and after any lease sales. The Interior Department will have to identify lands in the 1.5 million acres of the refuge along the coastal plain, known as the 1002 area, for leases. Once the department comes up with a list of options, there will be at least one comment period in which the public will have a chance to be heard. One question mark is whether new seismic studies will be undertaken. Such studies can reveal underground formations that have high oil development potential, and the only ones that were done in the refuge are more than three decades old. Based on the old studies, the United States Geological Survey has estimated that the 1002 area contains from 5 to 16 billion barrels of oil. David W. Houseknecht, a senior research geologist with the survey, said the agency was about to re-analyze the data using improved software in hopes of reducing the uncertainty of that estimate. But new studies using modern three-dimensional technology could produce even better estimates. The Interior Department in September proposed allowing new studies, but it is unclear whether oil companies, if allowed, would undertake them, or whether the Interior Department would wait for them to be done before conducting a sale. Oil companies have bid on drilling leases in other areas with less-than-ideal information. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/climate/drilling-arctic-anwr.html?searchResultPosition=69
"A day after a dramatic recount handed Democrats a single-vote victory in a Virginia House of Delegates race, the outcome abruptly shifted on Wednesday as a three-judge panel declared the race now tied. The judges meeting in Newport News, Va., agreed to a Republican request to count a problematic ballot discarded the day before, said Philip L. Hatchett, a lawyer for David Yancey, the Republican incumbent who seemed to have lost his seat to Shelly Simonds, a Democrat. A victory by Ms. Simonds, a school board member in Newport News, would evenly split the Virginia House 50-50 and end 17 years of Republican majorities. The decision sets up a remarkable scenario: a drawing of a name from a bowl to pick the winner of the race and, with it, the balance of power in a chamber of the state legislature. The drawing will take place on Wednesday in Richmond, the State Board of Elections announced on Thursday. According to James Alcorn, the chairman of the election board, each candidate’s name will be put into an old 35-millimeter film canister, the canisters will be mixed together in a bowl, and one will be plucked by an elections official. Mr. Alcorn said the same process is used regularly to choose the order of names on a ballot. The disputed ballot in that was debated in court on Wednesday showed two bubbles filled in, one for Ms. Simonds and one for Mr. Yancey, but with a fine line struck through the Simonds vote, according to a copy obtained by The Virginian-Pilot.

"Two teenage unauthorized immigrants who sued the Trump administration to be allowed to obtain abortions while in custody are free to end their pregnancies, even as the legal fight continues over the policy that had prevented them from doing so. When they decided they wanted abortions this fall, the teenagers were being held in government-run shelters for young immigrants who are caught crossing the border illegally and without an adult. But the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency that operates the facilities, had adopted a policy in March prohibiting federally funded shelters from taking “any action that facilitates” an abortion for an unaccompanied minor without the approval of the agency’s director. The immigrants challenged the policy in court, and on Monday, a federal judge in Washington ruled in their favor, ordering the government to allow the teenagers, referred to in court documents as Jane Roe and Jane Poe, to obtain abortions. The Trump administration quickly appealed. By Tuesday night, however, the government had stood aside: Roe was released from custody, and administration lawyers stopped attempting to block Poe from moving ahead with her abortion. The underlying issue is still being fought in court. The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the two women as well as a third young immigrant who was able to end her pregnancy after a court order in October, has asked the judge to allow the A.C.L.U. to continue litigating the abortion policy as a class-action lawsuit, which would seek to prevent the administration from stopping such abortions in the future. “We know that there are other young women who will need access to abortion, abortion information, and this policy will prevent them from accessing the abortion, just as it did for all the other Janes,” Brigitte Amiri, the lead A.C.L.U. lawyer on the case, said. “It is extreme and unconstitutional and just heartless.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/us/abortion-undocumented-immigrants.html?searchResultPosition=72
"The tax bill passed by Congress on Wednesday is effectively a giant bet that benefits given to companies and the wealthy will help average workers. That makes them a big risk for the Republicans who control Congress. Here are five factors to measure the policy’s success. Inequality: Republicans have done a bad job selling their plan to the public, with 55 percent of Americans opposing it, according to a CNN poll. The top 5 percent of income earners would see the biggest cuts, the Tax Policy Center said. Republicans risk the biggest backlash on this front, with reductions in tax breaks like state and local deductions hitting average Americans. Any sign that the tax bill has worsened rather than eased inequity will hand Democrats a stick to thwack Republicans in midterm elections next year. Wages: Pay increases have been disappointing given the low 4.1 percent level of unemployment. The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers said a corporate tax rate of 20 percent — just below the 21 percent on which Congress settled — would result in an average annual income increase of at least $4,000 at the end of 10 years. A visible rise in wages would be a positive effect of the tax bill. Yet it’s also one of the most dubious projections because companies will be under pressure to share earnings gains with shareholders, too. Stock market: One of President Trump’s most common brags is on the rise of markets. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tweeted “DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.” Tax cuts will probably send markets even higher — and are most likely one reason valuations are already so lofty — but because it suggests investors think higher earnings will flow to the bottom line rather than being paid out to workers, it’s perhaps not such an encouraging sign. Capital investment: Nonresidential business investment has improved after being sluggish or negative over the last two years. Spending on equipment rose 10.4 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in three years. But the type of investment is important. An increase will only matter if it helps bolster sluggish productivity. G.D.P. growth: Mr. Trump predicted tax cuts would turbocharge the economy to a 6 percent growth rate, compared with the 3.3 percent annualized expansion in the third quarter. The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated an earlier Senate tax plan would add 0.8 percent to G.D.P. over a decade. Trump’s estimate is unrealistic but a modest lift is expected. Still, the tax plan will not pay for itself, as the White House contends, and may add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. That trade-off may be this tax bill’s biggest legacy. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/business/dealbook/republican-tax-plan.html?searchResultPosition=73

Once upon a time, before ugly Christmas sweaters were a joke, that was the case. “A lot of the most popular designs of the ugly Christmas sweater revolution were taken from thrift shops or an aunt or grandmother’s closet,” said Brian Miller, one of the authors of “Ugly Christmas Sweater Party Book: The Definitive Guide to Getting Your Ugly On.” “They weren’t really intended to be funny or mass produced,” Mr. Miller said. “They were just gaudy and stood out when you put them on, and other people thought, ‘That’s hilarious.’” According to his research, the first large, organized ugly Christmas sweater party was at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver in 2002. About a decade ago, the trend caught on more widely. Personally, Mr. Miller favors Nordic designs from the 1970s made with high-quality wool. The mark of a good sweater, he said, “is basically something you would have opened from your great-aunt as a 10-year-old and thrown a fit. Those are the ones I love now.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/nyregion/new-york-today-what-makes-an-ugly-christmas-sweater-beautiful.html?searchResultPosition=95
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday that 8.8 million people had signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s federal marketplace, a surprisingly large number only slightly lower than the total in the last open enrollment period, which was twice as long and heavily advertised. The numbers essentially defied President Trump’s assertion that “Obamacare is imploding.” They suggested that consumers want and need the coverage and subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act, even though political battles over the law, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, are sure to continue in Congress and in next year’s midterm election campaigns. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, reported the total in a Twitter post on Thursday. She said her agency had done a great job to “make this the smoothest experience for consumers to date.” The number of people who signed up this year was 96 percent of the 9.2 million who selected health plans or were automatically re-enrolled through the federal marketplace in the last sign-up season. “It’s a very, very strong number,” said Joshua Peck, who was the chief marketing officer for HealthCare.gov in the Obama administration. “It implies that the final week of open enrollment this year was very big.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/us/politics/health-obama-care-affordable-care-act.html?searchResultPosition=20
"Eric Schmidt joined Google in 2001 to provide what amounted to adult supervision for the company’s young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He helped take Google public in 2004 and built it into a colossus. In 2011, after being appointed executive chairman, he became a prominent emissary for the company to Washington. Now, Mr. Schmidt is stepping down as executive chairman of the internet search giant’s parent, Alphabet, the company said on Thursday. He will relinquish his role at Alphabet’s next board meeting, in January. Mr. Schmidt, 62, will continue to be a member of the company’s board and become a technical adviser, Alphabet said, adding that it expects to appoint another chairman. No reason was provided for the change. In a statement, Mr. Schmidt said that he, Mr. Page, Mr. Brin and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, “believe that the time is right in Alphabet’s evolution for this transition.” The shift underlines how Mr. Schmidt’s influence at Alphabet has waned over time and how a new generation of leaders is firmly in charge at the giant company. Mr. Page and Mr. Brin remain at the top of Alphabet and retain voting control, but the executives they now have working for them have evolved. More of them are younger executives who rose through the ranks, such as Mr. Pichai, or are superstar executives hired from the outside, including Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer who was brought in from Morgan Stanley in 2015. Mr. Schmidt’s stepping back is expected to have little practical effect on the day-to-day operations of the behemoth operation. But it is one of the most significant personnel shifts at the internet giant since Mr. Page took over as chief executive in 2011, and especially because Mr. Schmidt has been such a willing public face of the company for so long. Internally at Google, the inclusion of Mr. Pichai in Mr. Schmidt’s statement on Thursday, alongside the names of Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, was seen as a passing of the torch and the creation of a new power triumvirate.

"DUBLIN — An Irish county council on Thursday gave a golf resort owned by President Trump approval to build two sea walls, a reduced version of an earlier plan but one that still generated opposition from environmentalists. Trump International Golf Links, which owns the resort at Doonbeg, County Clare, intends to build a line of two low, concealed sea walls, 2,000 feet long and 840 feet long, on the landward side of a public beach to prevent storm waters from eroding three holes of the course. A previous application for a continuous 1.7-mile-long structure was withdrawn last year. Thursday’s decision by the Clare County Council can be appealed to the national planning authority. The resort’s new plan was supported by some local residents, who said they hoped that Mr. Trump would follow up on plans to invest millions in the property. “We’ve been campaigning for 25 years to bring investment to our community,” said Rita McInerney, a local businesswoman. “There is a not a lot of opportunity for employment here. They already employ 250 people there in the summer, and there’ll be more if they feel they can expand it. We’ll continue to work with the owners, whoever they are.” Records show that Mr. Trump paid 8.7 million euros for the resort at an auction in 2014. It had originally opened in 2002, having cost €28 million to build. Environmentalists said the new coastal walls would damage a popular public beach and vulnerable dunes and heath. Some residents also objected, saying the walls would alter tidal flows and divert storm surges into their own properties. The leader of the Irish Green Party, Eamon Ryan, who objected to the application, said the party was disappointed in the decision and would consider filing an appeal. “The best advice we had was that it would be better to move the golf holes farther inland,” he said, “where there’s room for them, rather than disrupt the beach.” Mr. Ryan said that he did not believe Mr. Trump’s ownership had influenced the council members, but that “they wouldn’t be human beings if they weren’t sensitive to the fact that the golf course in question is owned by the president of the United States.” The earlier application had included references to climate change and the threat of global warming, which Mr. Trump had previously described as a hoax, in its case for building the wall. The new application did not mention global warming. The general manager of the resort, Joe Russell, said Trump Doonbeg was pleased with the decision and had ambitious plans to expand its facilities.

"WASHINGTON — In a legal victory for the Trump administration, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit on Thursday that accused President Trump of violating the Constitution by continuing to own and profit from his business empire. The complaint, filed this year in the Southern District of New York, said that Mr. Trump’s failure to divorce himself from his businesses had harmed companies or workers who compete against his restaurants or hotels in New York or Washington. By taking advantage of his official position, the lawsuit said, Mr. Trump violated clauses of the Constitution that prohibit a president from accepting any government-bestowed benefits, or emoluments, either at home or abroad. Judge George B. Daniels of United States District Court in Manhattan found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had suffered as a result of specific actions by Mr. Trump intended to drum up business for his enterprises. Even before Mr. Trump took office, the judge said, “he had amassed wealth and fame and was competing against” the plaintiffs. “It is only natural that interest in his properties has generally increased since he became president,” the judge said. Moreover, Judge Daniels said, customers might be patronizing Mr. Trump’s hotels and his hotels’ restaurants because of price or quality — reasons totally unrelated to his presidency. Beyond that, the judge found, the emoluments clauses of the Constitution are intended to protect the country against presidential corruption from foreign influences or financial incentives that might be offered by either states or the federal government. They were not meant to protect businesses from competition from presidentially owned enterprises, he ruled. Were that the case, Judge Daniels said, the Constitution would not have given Congress the power to allow a president to receive a foreign gift or benefit without considering how the president’s business rivals might be affected.

"UNITED NATIONS — More than 65 million people are displaced from their homes, the largest number since the Second World War, and nearly 25 million of them are refugees and asylum seekers living outside their own country. But that number doesn’t include people displaced by climate change. Under international law, only those who have fled their countries because of war or persecution are entitled to refugee status. People forced to leave home because of climate change, or who leave because climate change has made it harder for them to make a living, don’t qualify. The law doesn’t offer them much protection at all unless they can show they are fleeing a war zone or face a fear of persecution if they are returned home. That’s not surprising, perhaps: The treaty that defines the status of refugees was written at the end of World War II. A research paper, published Thursday in Science magazine, suggests that weather shocks are spurring people to seek asylum in the European Union. The researchers found that over a 15-year period, asylum applications in Europe increased along with “hotter-than-normal temperatures” in the countries where the asylum seekers had come from.

"WASHINGTON — Justice Department officials have indicated they do not believe the department can regulate the sale of gun bump stocks without congressional action, underscoring concern that an ongoing administrative review into that question is little more than an effort to slow-roll a politically divisive issue. The Justice Department announced this month that it would review whether bump stocks — a firearm accessory that can turn a semiautomatic rifle into a full-fledged machine gun — are prohibited under a federal statute that outlaws fully-automatic weapons. The review was prompted by the October mass shooting in Las Vegas, where gunman Stephen Paddock outfitted semiautomatic weapons with bump stocks to kill 58 concertgoers on the strip. But private and public comments from Justice Department officials following the October shooting suggest there is little appetite within the agency to regulate bump stocks, regardless of pressure from the Trump administration. Critics worry that whatever energy there is will fade over the holiday season. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and co-author of a bill to ban the devices, noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has said “that current law does not allow the agency to ban or regulate bump-fire stocks.” The A.T.F. is the lead enforcement agency on the issue within the Justice Department. “The A.T.F. director recently said the same thing to local police chiefs,” Ms. Feinstein said. “There’s no need for another review. It’s hard to believe this is anything other than another way for Republicans to stall congressional action.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/us/politics/justice-department-bump-stocks-mass-shootings.html?searchResultPosition=21
"Janet Benshoof, a lawyer who spent much of her career defending a woman’s right to an abortion, then expanded her work to champion causes for women around the world, including those raped in war zones, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 70. Her son David Benshoof Klein said the cause was uterine serous carcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of endometrial cancer. “For there to be justice, peace and security in the world, there has to be equality of women in fact,” Ms. Benshoof said at a Google talk in 2008. “If women are always out of the boardrooms and the decision makers and the military, then you do not have the sustainable justice, peace and security that is our ultimate aim.” Over 40 years, she pursued her advocacy at three organizations in New York City: as director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s reproductive freedom project and as the founder and president of the Center for Reproductive Rights and, most recently, the Global Justice Center. Ms. Benshoof (pronounced BEN-shawf) plotted the legal strategy for abortion and sex-education cases in state courts and the United States Supreme Court, and trained judges in Iraq to prosecute rape and sexual violence cases under international law. “No single person has done more to promote reproductive rights than Janet in the United States and globally,” Sylvia Law, a professor of law, medicine and psychiatry at New York University, said in a telephone interview.

"The surprising thing about Frances A. Rosenfeld’s extremely tall map of New York City is that the lake in Central Park is not first or second or even third. It is merely No. 4. Dr. Rosenfeld’s white-on-light-chocolate map shows the chronology of ice skating in the city by location. It turns out that the lake in Central Park came late to a craze that had captivated early Dutch and English settlers, and so No. 1 on Dr. Rosenfeld’s map is the colonial-era canal that was covered over for what New Yorkers now call Broad Street. No. 2 was a pond in Lower Manhattan, and No. 3 was another pond, on what later became fashionable Fifth Avenue. But — oh! — No. 4, the see-and-be-seen magnet that fixed skating in the city’s consciousness. Dr. Rosenfeld, who has documented the pastime for a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, says that the Central Park lake pulled in the crowds when the still-unfinished park opened in December 1858, wintry temperatures having done what wintry temperatures will do to 18 acres of water. “It was a flash mob kind of thing for its day,” she said. “All of a sudden, there was this new, artificial landscape that people heard about — Central Park — and they went there to go skating, and more people heard about it and went there to go skating, and more. It was wildly popular, way more than boating in the summer.” And that was that — the real beginning of skating in New York City, according to “New York on Ice: Skating in the City,” the exhibition that will continue through April 15, a full two weeks after the Wollman Rink in Central Park is to close for the season.

"WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on 52 people and entities Thursday for alleged human rights violations and corruption, a list that included Maung Maung Soe, a top Burmese general cited for an ongoing deadly crackdown on the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group. Maj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe was the chief of the Burmese Army’s Western Command during a crackdown that survivors say involved government soldiers stabbing babies, cutting off the heads of boys, gang-raping girls and burning entire families to death. More than 620,000 refugees have flooded into neighboring Bangladesh since August, fleeing what Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson described as “ethnic cleansing.” Maj. Gen. Maung Maung Soe is the first high-level Burmese military official to named in sanctions, an action that the Treasury Department said grew out of credible evidence of his involvement in the crackdown. “Today, the United States is taking a strong stand against human rights abuse and corruption globally by shutting these bad actors out of the U.S. financial system,” said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, adding that the sanctions send “a message that there is a steep price to pay for their misdeeds.” Among others penalized on Thursday was Yahya Jammeh, former president of Gambia who came to power in 1994 and stepped down in 2017. Mr. Jammeh created a terror and assassination squad called the Junglers that he used to intimidate, interrogate and kill people who threatened him, according to the Treasury designation. Benjamin Bol Mel of South Sudan, Dan Gertler, who did business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mukhtar Hamid Shah of Pakistan were also on the list. The designations are the first to result from the passage last year of the Global Magnitsky Act, a bipartisan bill intended to punish people around the world who are credibly accused of serious violations of human rights and of corruption. The law was a follow-on to a similarly named law passed in 2012 designed to punish such people only in Russia. On Wednesday, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on five Russians in designations from that earlier law. Among those targeted on Wednesday was the leader of the Republic of Chechnya.

In the years since, he has hopscotched the world, developed close ties to lawmakers and served on White House advisory panels for the Obama administration. Perhaps Google’s biggest victory during this time was its defeat of the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust probe.

"About one in five inmates in federal prison are foreign-born, and more than 90 percent of those are in the United States illegally, according to a report released on Thursday by the Trump administration, which has sought to highlight the dangers it says unauthorized immigrants pose to public safety. Officials at the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security quickly framed the statistics as evidence that the country needed stricter anti-immigration measures, particularly the wall President Trump has pushed to erect across the southern border. The report arrives as the White House and Republicans in Congress insist that any legislative deal to restore legal protections for young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children must include more restrictions on legal and illegal immigration. “At the border and in communities across America, our citizens are being victimized by illegal aliens who commit crimes,” the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said in a statement on Thursday, calling on Congress to pass Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda. “The simple fact is that any offense committed by a criminal alien is ultimately preventable.” Administration officials have repeatedly emphasized what it says are links between unauthorized immigrants and crime, even opening an office to advocate for the victims of crimes committed by immigrants. But a large body of research has suggested that immigrants are no more likely, and often less likely, to commit serious crimes than native-born Americans.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It could hardly come as a surprise to anyone who travels around the state: the number of people who are homeless in California continues to rise at a steady clip. Every year, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development releases a Point in Time count of the homeless population. This year that number reached nearly 554,000 — a 1 percent increase from last year, driven by the dramatic surge in West Coast cities. More than one-quarter of the total homeless population nationwide lives in California, roughly 114,000. The vast majority are “unsheltered” — a more bureaucratic term to describe the thousands living on the streets, under freeways and tucked into grassy fields and parks in cities all around the state. “It’s certainly a bigger increase than we would have expected,” said Ben Metcalf, the director of the state’s Department of Housing and Community Development. “There’s a tale of different countries here: We’re seeing a real significant increase and much of the rest of the country is not. We’re all doing the same things, but here the rent is too damn high. We’ve seen an incredible increase in the cost of housing.” About 1.6 million households are considered to be living in “worse scenarios,” Mr. Metcalf said, living with low-wages and spending more than half of their income on housing. That number has ballooned continuously through much of the last decade, while wages have remained flat. There is grim evidence at county morgues, too — because of a significant hepatitis A outbreak and because the homeless population is aging, several cities have seen a dramatic rise in the number of people who die homeless. In Santa Clara County, the number of homeless deaths have more than doubled since 2011, with 132 people dying on the street last year.

"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. At the White House yesterday, Republicans celebrated their passage of a big tax cut. Somehow, though, they still haven’t found the time or the money to protect health insurance for millions of low-income children. In September, Congress allowed funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (known as CHIP) to expire. By the end of next month, 25 states are likely to run out of their remaining CHIP money, according to a new report by Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. That could put health coverage for 1.9 million children at risk. Eventually, if CHIP isn’t extended, almost nine million children — or about one out of every eight children in America — could lose coverage. CHIP isn’t supposed to be controversial. It enjoys bipartisan support, at least rhetorically. Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who helped create the program in the 1990s, said yesterday that Congress should remain in session until its funding is restored. But the program has become a casualty of congressional leaders’ failure to agree on a plan to fund the federal government, largely because of an insistence on budget cuts from conservative Republican members. Congress seems likely to push an overall funding bill into January, creating uncertainty and anxiety for many families. Congress’s decision to put tax cuts ahead of health care, writes The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell, “has left millions of children, including some in the middle of lifesaving care such as cancer treatment, in limbo.” She adds: “When so many dire priorities abound, it’s hard to fathom how tax cuts got to the front of the queue.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/opinion/tax-bill-chip.html?searchResultPosition=34
"So it actually happened. Just last month, it was not certain that the Senate would go along with the House of Representatives’ proposal to let families use 529 college savings plans to pay for private school from elementary school onward. In a bill that offered many perks for the wealthy, the 529 provision was a particularly brazen giveaway. After all, it’s mostly wealthier people who can save enough to reap large benefits from the provision, which allows $10,000 in annual tax-free 529 account withdrawals for pre-college students starting in 2018. But it really did happen, and on Friday, President Trump signed the bill that makes it the law of the land. The short-term opportunities for affluent families are potentially worth five figures. The schools, however, will now confront a major financial aid question that the new bill forces on them. And states could make offsetting tax changes that cost 529 savers money. Any eventual populist blowback could threaten the plans, too. But let’s start with the good news, for those who have the money and the inclination. With 529 plans, you put money in, let it grow for years in mutual funds and then pull it out to use for higher education expenses. When you do, you don’t pay capital gains taxes on what you’ve earned over time. Other 529 tax breaks exist, too. It is states, not the federal government, that actually administer the plans, and 35 of them offer some sort of tax deduction or credit when you deposit money.

"COLUMBIA, Md. — The word “equality” carries special meaning in this planned community, nestled in the corridor between Baltimore and Washington. Subsidized apartment complexes and tidy townhouses coexist with single-family colonials and split- levels, and racial, socio-economic and religious diversity is embedded in the fabric. Columbia’s founding father created the town in 1967 with hopes that all types of workers could afford to live there, “from the company janitor to the company president.” It is through this lens that residents here are viewing the tax plan that Congress finalized this week. Even as people here try to assess how the new code will affect them individually, many are expressing greater concerns about the “knock-on” or secondary effects of the plan, which down the line could reduce or eliminate spending in some areas to pay for tax breaks for businesses and the wealthiest Americans. In Columbia, that could mean cuts to the well-regarded public schools and aid programs for the most vulnerable residents, changes that would further chip away at the egalitarian pillars on which the town was built. “It is definitely going to have some implications for us as a family, and yet we are solidly middle class,” said Maureen Harris as she sat with her husband, Bill, in the dining room of the house they share with their two teenage daughters. “I am not worried that we won’t be able to pay our mortgage or anything like that,” said Ms. Harris, who serves as the executive director of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Columbia. “But to me, it’s just immoral.

"WASHINGTON — The sweeping tax overhaul approved by Congress this week hands Republicans a long-sought achievement they believe will bolster their defenses in next year’s midterm campaign, but party officials concede the measure may only mitigate their losses in what is shaping up to be a punishing election year. While the tax legislation is broadly unpopular as it reaches President Trump’s desk, the bill offers Republicans the sort of signature accomplishment they have been lacking to galvanize their demoralized donors and many of their voters. Republican lawmakers, who spent much of this year forced to explain or defend Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior, now have an opportunity to go on the offensive with an issue that unites their increasingly fractious party. And they hope that up-for-grabs voters will reward them should the economy keep growing while their tax bills are falling. “Once the withholding tables change in January, voters will realize their paychecks are bigger as a result of tax reform,” said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who runs the House Republican campaign arm. But, alluding to past midterm defeats for the party in power at the White House, he acknowledged that “history is against us.” To reinforce the party’s message, the primary House Republican “super PAC,” the Congressional Leadership Fund, is planning a $10 million advertising and grass-roots campaign beginning next month in some of their most competitive districts to highlight the rate reductions, higher standard deduction and child tax credits in the bill. Corporations such as AT&T and Wells Fargo delivered Republicans an immediate gift by announcing they would reward employees financially because of the tax cut. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said in an interview that Senate Republicans next year would batter the many Democrats who are on the ballot in states won by Mr. Trump, such places as North Dakota, West Virginia and Indiana, for opposing the bill.

"WASHINGTON — Congress gave final approval on Thursday to legislation to keep the government funded into January, averting a government shutdown this weekend but kicking fights over issues like immigration, surveillance and health care into the new year. The stopgap spending bill extends government funding until Jan. 19 while also providing a short-term funding fix for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, whose financing lapsed at the end of September. After the House and Senate succeeded in passing a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul this week, the stopgap bill includes language to prevent automatic spending cuts that would be required to offset the tax bill’s effect on the deficit. The House passed the bill 231 to 188, with most Republicans voting for it and most Democrats opposing it. The Senate later gave its approval, as well, in a 66-to-32 vote. The extension of government funding saves Republicans from what would have been a colossal embarrassment just after they celebrated passage of the biggest tax rewrite in decades. But the lack of a resolution to several pressing issues leaves lawmakers facing a tough task when they return after the holidays, with the possibility of a high-stakes showdown when the next government funding deadline approaches. “I guess we better recharge our batteries,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. “It seems like Groundhog Day.

"UNITED NATIONS — A lopsided majority of United Nations members rebuked the United States on Thursday, denouncing its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and ignoring President Trump’s threats to retaliate by cutting aid to countries voting against it. In a collective act of defiance toward Washington, the United Nations General Assembly voted 128 to 9, with 35 abstentions, for a resolution demanding that the United States rescind its Dec. 6 declaration on Jerusalem, the contested holy city. The resolution is nonbinding and therefore largely symbolic, but the vote indicated the extent to which the Trump administration’s departure from a 50-year international consensus on Jerusalem’s status has unsettled world politics and contributed to America’s diplomatic isolation. Major allies like Britain, France, Germany and Japan voted for the resolution, though some allies, like Australia and Canada, abstained. Carrying out a promise to his base of supporters, Mr. Trump upended decades of American policy with his decision on Jerusalem, aggravating an emotional issue that has festered since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when the Israelis occupied the entire city. Many Security Council resolutions since then, which have the force of international law, have warned that Jerusalem’s status is unresolved, that claims of sovereignty by Israel are invalid and that the issue must be settled in negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.

"To the Editor: Re “Deceit and Confusion in Talk on Law and Order” (Fact Check, Dec. 16): Addressing elite F.B.I. National Academy graduates last week, President Trump utterly mischaracterized the diversity immigration visa program and described people who use it to immigrate legally to our country as “the worst of the worst.” As experts on hateful speech, we know that such words matter. Tarring whole groups of people as terrible and threatening is dangerous rhetoric that is all too familiar from societies where it has been a precursor to violence. In addition, the president is now attacking legal immigrants with the sort of vitriol he previously aimed at the undocumented. He is training Americans to fear and despise other people simply because they are “them” and not “us.” Language that can inspire violent hatred is all the more disturbing in a speech to local law enforcement officers who serve across the country. We must call it out for what it is. SUSAN BENESCH

"At least for the moment, it seems that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, may keep his job. President Trump declared this week that he does not currently intend to fire him — a concession, perhaps, to the overwhelming public opposition to such a move. But that doesn’t mean Mr. Mueller’s investigation is free from peril. The inquiry remains in great danger, facing four looming threats from Mr. Trump and his allies. Curbing Mr. Mueller: Almost as bad as firing him, Mr. Trump could install someone at the Department of Justice to oversee Mr. Mueller’s investigation, a minder who could control (and cut) Mr. Mueller’s budget, eliminate some of his team or curtail the scope of his investigation. Mr. Mueller seems safe as long as his current supervisor, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, is in place; Mr. Rosenstein just vouched for the special counsel before Congress. But the president has reportedly grumbled about Mr. Rosenstein and could replace him with a crony who would be more willing to interfere. The president might also try to force out Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself over a conflict of interest, and replace him with an anti-Mueller hand, who presumably would not have such an obvious conflict. Mr. Trump would be within his powers to make such a move, but the public can push back by calling for Congress to pass pending legislation to protect Mr. Mueller’s job. Congress should maintain its recent practice of taking short, pro forma adjournments rather than taking a full recess, because the latter would allow the president to fire Justice Department personnel and replace them with recess appointments. Issuing pardons: The president may also try to pardon away the special counsel’s investigation. Mr. Trump could grant pardons to individuals who have already pleaded guilty, such as Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. this month. Or Mr. Trump might do so prospectively, to those who may be targets, such as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, or his son Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Trump might even issue one to himself (he reportedly asked about it), whether individually or as part of a blanket pardon of all those involved in the Russia investigation. Here, too, voices must be raised now, and loudly, with Senator Mark Warner’s strong comments this week in defense of Mr. Mueller as an outstanding first step. Congress has a particularly important role to play, making clear that such pardons would be a red line that would lead to abuse-of-power hearings in the House Judiciary Committee and possibly impeachment.

"WASHINGTON — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage finance giants rescued during the financial crisis, reached a deal with the Treasury Department on Thursday allowing them to keep some of their profits as they brace for losses that will be activated by the tax bill soon to be signed by President Trump. Under the terms of the agreement, each company will be allowed to retain $3 billion from their earnings to serve as a capital cushion against future losses, including a decline in the value of their tax-deferred assets. The arrangement is a change from the 2012 agreement that they reached with the Obama administration requiring that they send most of their profits to the Treasury as a condition for having been rescued by the Bush administration during the financial crisis. Fannie and Freddie required $187 billion of taxpayer aid in the 2008 financial crisis and were placed under government conservatorship as a result. The firms, which buy or guarantee home loans, have been profitable for the last several years but are required to send almost all those profits to the Treasury, leaving the firms with little capital to protect against future losses. The $3 billion capital cushion is intended to help Fannie and Freddie deal with “ordinary income fluctuations” which could be exacerbated by the coming corporate tax cut. The drop in the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent is expected to bring steep losses to Fannie and Freddie as they write down the value of their tax-deferred assets. “Treasury’s first duty is to ensure that taxpayers are being protected,” said Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary. Analysts have projected that Fannie and Freddie could stand to lose $10 billion to $20 billion combined as a result of the corporate tax cut. Melvin L. Watt, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is the conservator of Fannie and Freddie, said in a statement on Thursday that he expected the additional cushion to be sufficient to cover the normal course of business, however additional funds could be necessary to address the impact of the tax cuts.

"It’s that time of year again. Some of us will get nice gifts, while others will get lumps of coal. But the rules have changed a bit this time, at least as far as the federal government is concerned. The St. Nick you knew is on vacation, possibly permanently. In his place we have Republican Tax-Cut Santa, who has different priorities. You see, the new guy doesn’t care whether you’re naughty or nice. In fact, he’ll actually reward you if you’re naughty in the right ways. But mainly he cares whether you’re rich, especially if your wealth comes from property (preferably inherited property), not hard work. In that case, you get a really big gift. If you’re an ordinary working family, not so much — and eventually you get that lump. So let’s talk about whose stockings will be stuffed by the tax bill Republicans just rammed through without a single hearing or a single Democratic vote. The centerpiece of the legislation is a huge tax cut for corporations. Republicans claim that this tax cut will be passed on to workers in the form of higher wages, but most independent studies conclude that even in the long run only between one-fifth and one-quarter of the tax cut will trickle down to workers. And the fraction will be much lower in the short run — say, the next few years. So this is basically a tax cut for shareholders. And who are these shareholders? About a third of the total benefits will go to foreigners. Among U.S. residents, while many people have some stock in their retirement accounts, those amounts are generally small. Even including indirect holdings through mutual funds, the top 1 percent of domestic households owns 40 percent of stocks, the bottom 80 percent just 7 percent. So when Tax-Cut Santa comes to town, it’s definitely good to be rich. Meanwhile, complicated things will happen to individual taxes: Some deductions will increase, others will be cut. Next year, most people will probably see a small tax cut, although for the middle class it will be a smaller cut than the one they got from Barack Obama in 2009 — a tax cut almost nobody noticed.

"Alexei Wood, a journalist who was arrested while covering a protest of Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, was found not guilty at the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on Thursday of all seven counts against him, including conspiracy to riot and several counts of destruction of property. Mr. Wood had originally faced up to 61 years in prison. His five fellow defendants — Michelle Macchio, Jennifer Armento, Christina Simmons, Oliver Harris and Brittne Lawson — were also found not guilty of all charges after a nearly four-week trial. “Alexei was overwhelmed in court and doubled over crying,” Brett E. Cohen, Mr. Wood’s lawyer, said in an interview soon after the decision came in. “In these times of press persecution, I feel this is an important victory.” Prosecutors said the six defendants were among a group that cut a violent swath through 16 blocks of the city, smashing windows of businesses, tossing newspaper boxes into the street and damaging a car. Authorities tallied the damages at more than $100,000. The lawyers for the defendants had countered that their clients and most others in the group of about 500 were peacefully protesting, with only a handful becoming violent. Mr. Wood, 37, a freelance photographer and videographer based in San Antonio, was one of over 200 people arrested at the protest, which was organized by an activist group called Disrupt J20. Among those arrested were nine journalists. The government has dropped the charges against seven of those people. Mr. Wood and Aaron Cantú, a staff reporter at The Santa Fe Reporter in New Mexico who was working as a freelancer in January, were the only two journalists who faced charges. Mr. Cantú’s trial is scheduled for October 2018. Mr. Wood had primarily worked as a commercial photographer but had been trying to build his portfolio as a photojournalist when he went to cover the J20 protest.

"With their tax bill, Donald Trump and the Republicans are raiding the Treasury in plain sight, throwing crumbs to the masses as the millionaires and billionaires make off with the cake. America should be aghast not only at the looting but also at the brazenness of its execution. It seems that for as long as I can remember, Republicans have been wringing their hands about deficits. And yet in this budget, they willingly, willfully exploded the deficit, not for public uplift or rebuilding America’s infrastructure but rather on the spurious argument that giving truckloads of money back to businesses will spark their benevolence. According to the government’s own nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the tax bill will lead to “an increase in the deficit of $1,455 billion over the next 10 years.” But be sure, when this bill leads to these predicted deficits, Republicans will return to their sidelined deficit rhetoric armed with a sickle, aiming the blade at the social safety net, exacerbating the egregious imbalance of the tax bill’s original sins. That’s the strategy: Appease the rich on the front end; punish the poor on the back. Feed the weak to the strong. The callousness of this calculation is hidden in the arguments over estimates and evidence, but it is not lost. Most Americans see through this charade. According to a CNN/SSRS poll released this week, most Americans disapprove of the tax bill. Furthermore, most believe the bill will benefit the wealthy, in general, and Trump and his family, in particular.

"When President Trump announced that the United States would formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, he upended a central tenet of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process: Under the first Oslo Accord in 1993, the status of Jerusalem was to be resolved through direct negotiations, and not through unilateral declarations by Washington or other third parties. For over two decades, Labor, Israel’s main center-left party, has been committed to a two-state solution that would honor the Oslo agreement. Times have evidently changed for the party. Its new leader, Avi Gabbay, who scored a stunning victory in Labor’s leadership election in July, celebrated Mr. Trump’s Jerusalem announcement, saying, “a united Jerusalem is even more important than peace.” Though other Labor leaders have also called for a united Jerusalem, the tone of Mr. Gabbay’s remarks, as an Israeli news website noted, “contrasted with that of the dovish Labor, which has long been the Israeli political standard-bearer for reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians.” While most Israelis already consider Jerusalem their capital, some prominent leftist politicians, including the Meretz Party chairwoman Zehava Galon and the Joint List leader Ayman Odeh, warned that Mr. Trump’s announcement would cause instability. With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dogged by two serious corruption investigations, including allegations of graft, this should be an ideal time for the country’s beleaguered center-left opposition to mount a serious, united challenge to Mr. Netanyahu and his right-wing government. Instead, the opposition is in disarray, encumbered by both internal strife and a national trend that threatens to sideline anyone perceived as remotely leftist. Now, after years of demonization by the Likud and its political allies, including spurious accusations of disloyalty, the Israeli left’s foremost political party has internalized the message. Mr. Gabbay, the best hope for a movement capable of challenging Mr. Netanyahu, has become a sad replica of Mr. Netanyahu himself. Since assuming the leadership of Labor, he has been making hasty appeals to Mr. Netanyahu’s base. In October, in response to a question about the fate of isolated settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mr. Gabbay said, “If you make a peace deal, solutions can be found that do not necessitate evacuations,” and later said that the settlements were “the beautiful and devoted face of Zionism.” While Mr. Gabbay has since tempered his remarks on settlements and insists that he fully supports a two-state solution, his position on crucial issues seems irrefutably at odds with it. Labor’s recent moves reflect the desperate situation Israel’s left has faced since the collapse of the Camp David peace talks in 2000. Labor’s shift is happening while other parties on the left are also struggling to stay relevant. Ms. Galon of Meretz, for instance, recently resigned from the Knesset to focus on her campaign to replace her party’s arcane system of electing its leader with a proper democratic primary.

"MILAN — Don Emilio is the parish priest at the cathedral of my hometown, Crema, 30 miles from Milan. He just hates Father Christmas (Babbo Natale if you’re Italian). The priest doesn’t simply ignore Father Christmas or disapprove of him: He hates him with a vengeance. A while ago he came over and rang my doorbell, and he was not a happy trouper: He’d noticed a brightly lit Santa Claus clinging to my balcony, clambering toward the window of the floor above. My family thought it was cute, but Don Emilio didn’t. He thinks Babbo Natale is an interloper and says as much in church, thundering from the pulpit now that Christmas is nigh, accusing him of elbowing out the infant Jesus — not from a manger in a Nativity scene, but from the minds of Italian children. Who brings gifts? Good old Santa, not a newborn, no matter how sweet he is. And we know how pragmatic children are. Let me say that Don Emilio has a point. We Italians tend to be xenophiles all year round, not just at Christmas. But during the festive season, our fascination with other cultures — above all with American culture — just rockets sky high. You may well say, “But Santa Claus isn’t American!” Indeed. He’s inspired by St. Nicholas of Myra, in Anatolia, a fourth-century Christian bishop. The character then got a Dutch name, entered Germanic folklore, helped the cause of the Reformation in England (the infant Jesus was considered papist), became patron saint of Russia. Later on, as we all know, he moved to Lapland, hired Scandinavian reindeers and bought a flying sledge. Not even Elon Musk owns such a cool vehicle. And Jeff Bezos, who’s testing drones to deliver packages right to his customers’ doorsteps, ought to pay royalties to Santa Claus. True, with Amazon, it’s one click; with Santa, you need snail mail (no credit card, though, since most 5-year-olds don’t carry one). Santa is an international character, you may conclude. His big white beard and big red suit, however, were products of 20th-century American advertising, given a global lift by Coca-Cola. Nothing wrong with that, of course. But there’s no doubt that this elderly foreign gentleman, who stubbornly refuses to retire and seems immune to arthritis or rheumatism, has ousted the baby Jesus. In Italy, at least.

"The individual mandate, an idea inspired by conservative intellectuals but ultimately embraced by Democratic lawmakers as an essential part of the Affordable Care Act, will soon be dead. The provision would be eliminated under the tax bill passed on Wednesday. Left behind would be a policy structure that relied on the mandate to push the young and healthy to buy health insurance and thus strengthen the marketplace for millions of Americans. The Affordable Care Act, which adopted the mandate as a central provision, will remain the law, and President Trump far overstated matters when he said that “we have essentially repealed Obamacare.” But the loss of the mandate — the  best-known and least liked part of the health care law — will cause substantial changes. The magnitude of the consequences is uncertain, but most experts believe the mandate’s elimination will usher in an era of higher insurance prices and lower health coverage rates. The economists at the Congressional Budget Office estimate that as many as 13 million more Americans could become uninsured in 10 years and that insurance premiums will rise by an additional 10 percent each year. The impact won’t start to become clear until 2019, when the provision’s penalties for remaining uninsured officially expire. The mandate was devised by conservative health care experts at the Heritage Foundation in the late 1980s, who conceived it as a necessary part of a market-based system for providing health insurance in America. The mandate was intended to encourage individual responsibility: More families should be able to choose their own health plans in a market, but they would be expected to have some sort of coverage so they wouldn’t burden their neighbors if they became sick or injured. “Society does feel a moral obligation to insure that its citizens do not suffer from the unavailability of health care,” Stuart Butler, then Heritage’s director of domestic policy studies, said in a 1989 lecture that was published in a book. “But on the other hand, each household has the obligation, to the extent it is able, to avoid placing demands on society by protecting itself.” It attracted interest across the political spectrum, becoming a favored policy prescription of some Republicans opposed to President Bill Clinton’s health care overhaul plan in the early 1990s. It was discussed in economics and policy journals. And it later became the basis for a bipartisan health care bill that attracted co-sponsors from both parties but never made it to a vote.

"These 12 blink-and-you-might-have-missed-them cultural moments of 2017 brightened up a year otherwise defined by the threat of nuclear war, natural disasters — from hurricanes to wildfires — that left hundreds of thousands homeless, a string of sexual harassment charges against some of the country’s most prominent political and entertainment figures and yet more terrorist attacks. These are the small but indelible pleasures that our editors and reporters have been grateful for in the past year. Let’s start with the leotards. Ruth’s is teal, with color-blocked sleeves and side panels. Arthie’s is pink, solid on one shoulder, candy-striped on the other. Tammé’s looks like she stole it from the set of “Fame.” Sheila’s is made out of fur. The scene is a training session in the second episode of the Netflix series “GLOW,” and the costumes, by Beth Morgan, are enough to snap anyone who lived through the ’80s into a nylon-spandex flashback. “GLOW,” a 10-episode comedy created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, is a heavily fictionalized account of the creation of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,” a distaff answer to the World Wrestling Federation that ran on television in the ’80s. I can remember being a kid and watching that earlier series after the cartoons ran out, bored by the phony athleticism and phonier comedy sketches, but fascinated by the hair spray and the makeup, the skintight cheerleader outfits and the scrunched-down socks. “GLOW” culminates in a televised bout, and the pleasure of the to-the-brow eye shadow and belted lamé is overpowering. But by that point the women have already turned themselves into TV-friendly caricatures — Liberty Belle, Welfare Queen, Fortune Cookie. So I have a soft spot for the costumes in the initial episodes, when the wrestling women aren’t yet playing their in-the-ring roles. If most of them are dressing for comfort, they’re also telegraphing how they’d like to be seen — Ruth’s serious blues, Arthie’s soft pinks — before they realize that the camera won’t want their real selves, Sheila’s pelt excepted. (That some of the women find their wrestling characters empowering while others don’t is one of the more interesting complications of the series.)

"WASHINGTON — A new report concludes that a Department of Homeland Security pilot program improperly gathers data on Americans when it requires passengers embarking on foreign flights to undergo facial recognition scans to ensure they haven’t overstayed visas. The report, released on Thursday by researchers at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University’s law school, called the system an invasive surveillance tool that the department had installed at nearly a dozen airports without going through a required federal rule-making process. The report’s authors examined dozens of Department of Homeland Security documents and raised questions about the accuracy of facial recognition scans. They said the technology had high error rates and were subject to bias, because the scans often fail to properly identify women and African-Americans. “It’s telling that D.H.S. cannot identify a single benefit actually resulting from airport face scans at the departure gate,” said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the center and an author of the report. “D.H.S. doesn’t need a face-scanning system to catch travelers without a photo on file,” he added. “It’s alarming that D.H.S. still hasn’t supplied evidence for the necessity of this $1 billion program.” Homeland security officials said the program was necessary and fulfilled a decades-old congressional requirement to prevent foreign visitors from overstaying their visas.

The speed from introduction to passage — seven weeks, with no substantive hearings — effectively precluded expert examination of the legislation’s regressive core, its special interest provisions and the long-term penalties it imposes on the working poor and middle class through the use of an alternative measure of inflation — the “chained CPI.” Only last Friday, when the legislation came out of conference committee and was no longer subject to amendment — and when decisive majorities of House and Senate Republicans had publicly committed to vote for the legislation — did experts and journalists begin to fully catch up with its defects. Two days before Congress gave final approval, a group of 13 tax law experts released the most incisive critique of the tax bill to date, a 30-page document called “The Games They Will Play: An Update on the Conference Committee Tax Bill.” The primary authors of the report — Ari Glogower, David Kamin, Rebecca Kysar, and Darien Shanske — describe the legislation as “a substantial blow to the basic integrity of the income tax” that will “advantage the well-advised in ways that are both deliberate and inadvertent.” The authors cite a wide range of specific flaws, but their main argument is that the measure is gravely deficient at its core: Glogower, Kamin, Kysar, and Shanske argue that some of the most egregious loopholes and schemes permitted by the legislation are that individual taxpayers Second, the legislation creates a huge incentive for anyone in a position to do so to change his or her status from employee to “independent contractor or a partner in a firm.

Lasby, “Eisenhower’s Heart Attack” • Jeffrey Frank, “Ike and Dick: Portrait of a Strange Political Marriage” • Birch Bayh, “One Heartbeat Away: Presidential Disability and Succession” • Jane Mayer and Doyle McManus, “Landslide: The Unmaking of the President 1984-1988” Expecting continuity of government to depend on a gentleman’s agreement with Richard M. Nixon was neither legal nor, in retrospect, judicious. By the time President Dwight Eisenhower wrote a letter in 1958 to Vice President Nixon designating him “the individual explicitly and exclusively responsible for determining whether there is any inability of mine that makes it necessary for you to discharge the powers and duties of the presidency,” Eisenhower had already had a heart attack in 1955, abdominal surgery in 1956 and a stroke in 1957. After the stroke, Jeffrey Frank writes in “Ike and Dick,” Nixon “had heard the president say ‘window’ when he meant to say ‘mirror’ and say ‘ceiling’ when he meant to say ‘floor.’” That would be a worrisome development in any era but was especially vexing in the thermonuclear age. When the ailing but popular Eisenhower ran for re-election in ’56, his most significant opponent was not Adlai Stevenson but his own body. Clarence G. Lasby supposes in “Eisenhower’s Heart Attack” that “the only way to prove that he was not an invalid was to serve another term.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/opinion/trump-holiday-gift-guide.html?searchResultPosition=43
"The Trump administration’s increasingly bizarre war on abortion continues as immigration officials keep trying to block access to abortion for pregnant undocumented teenagers in their custody. The administration has no law on its side (leading career lawyers in the Justice Department to withhold their signatures from its legal pleadings) but still won’t stop exploiting the plight of these most vulnerable young women, for no apparent reason other than a commitment to saving the world one fetus at a time. But the administration’s war on birth control came to a grinding halt the other day. In a little-noticed ruling, a federal district judge in Philadelphia issued a temporary injunction against a new policy that lets employers refuse to cover contraception in their employees’ insurance plans if they have either religious objections to birth control or “sincerely held moral convictions” against it. (Note that since no one is forcing these employers to use birth control themselves, their moral objection has to be to their employees’ using it.) Marveling in her 44-page opinion at the “remarkable breadth” of these exemptions, Judge Wendy Beetlestone raised the obvious question: “Who determines whether the expressed moral reason is sincere or not or, for that matter, whether it falls within the bounds of morality or is merely a preference choice?” Her answer: The administration “has conjured up a world where a government entity is empowered to impose its own version of morality on each one of us.” “That cannot be right,” she wrote. I commented on the new policy when the administration announced it in October. While I thought it was preposterous, I didn’t expect either that the state of Pennsylvania (which has a Democratic governor, Tom Wolf) would bring a lawsuit or that a federal judge would be so forthright in calling the administration out. “It is difficult,” Judge Beetlestone wrote, “to comprehend a rule that does more to undermine the contraceptive mandate or that intrudes more into the lives of women.” The contraceptive mandate is the much-litigated Affordable Care Act requirement for employer-based insurance to cover “preventive care and screenings” for women, as further defined to include “the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods.” The open-ended religious and moral exemptions, Judge Beetlestone wrote, amounted to “the proverbial exception that swallows the rule.” Of course, this saga may well not end in Federal District Court. After the ruling came down last Friday, a Justice Department spokeswoman strongly hinted that an appeal would be forthcoming. “This administration is committed to defending the religious liberty of all Americans, and we look forward to doing so in court,” Lauren Ehrsam said. I found it interesting that the official statement emphasized “religious liberty” while making no mention of the “moral” opt out. Was the administration conflating religion and morality, refusing to recognize that limiting the size of one’s family can be, and for many people is, itself a deeply moral choice, surely of equivalent weight to an employer’s conviction that every sex act by its female employees should carry the prospect of procreation? Among the more delicious aspects of Judge Beetlestone’s opinion in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Trump is the judge’s treatment of the administration’s claim that Pennsylvania lacked standing to bring the lawsuit because it could not demonstrate the “injury in fact” that is necessary to pursue a claim in federal court. I don’t know Judge Beetlestone, who was a partner in a major Philadelphia law firm and general counsel to the Philadelphia school district before President Barack Obama named her to the district court in 2014. I can only imagine — and hope — that she took some satisfaction in pointing out that Pennsylvania’s claim to standing was at least as strong as that of Texas in its suit two years ago that succeeded in undoing the Obama administration’s plan to defer deportation for parents of the “dreamers” brought to this country as children. Republicans who characterized the challenged policy, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, as executive branch overreach cheered the Texas lawsuit’s outcome, which the Supreme Court failed on a 4-to-4 vote to set aside. “There is no daylight between the 2015 Texas suit against the federal government and the current Commonwealth suit against the federal government,” Judge Beetlestone observed.
