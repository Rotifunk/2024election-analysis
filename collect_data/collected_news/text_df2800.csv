"WASHINGTON — Sometimes he just wants to know how he’s doing, like a maître d’ checking in after a meal. “How’s this playing?” President Trump asked Fox News’s Sean Hannity over dinner in the private residence of the White House the other night, a few hours after visiting Wisconsin to announce a deal to create thousands of new factory jobs. Often he’s effusive. “I love you, Jim,” Mr. Trump told Jim DeMint, the former Heritage Foundation president, during a small gathering of conservative leaders in the Oval Office in March. And often he delivers. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, pressed Mr. Trump for months to make the statement he issued last week saying transgender people would be barred from the military. “I’ve been to the White House I don’t know how many more times in the first six months this year than I was during the entire Bush administration,” Mr. Perkins said. Mr. Trump has strained relations with a lot of people these days — members of his own party in Congress, the 55-plus percent of Americans who say they disapprove of his performance, his attorney general, his recently ousted communications director and chief of staff. But through all the drama and dismay, one group has never really wavered: the leaders of the conservative movement. This is no accident. Mr. Trump and members of his administration have spent their first six months in office cultivating and strengthening ties to the movement’s key groups and players with a level of attention and care that stands out for a White House that often struggles with the most elementary tasks of politics and governing. Their outreach extends to groups across the ideological spectrum — small government, tax-averse Tea Party followers; gun owners; abortion opponents; evangelical Christians and other culturally traditional voters. And it reflects the importance that Mr. Trump and his aides have placed on the movement politics of the right, which they recognize as the one base of support they cannot afford to alienate since conservatives, according to Gallup, are 36 percent of the electorate.

"NATIONAL An article on Wednesday about ways in which war veterans are seeking serenity misspelled, in some copies, the given name of a former National Guard sergeant who is riding a bicycle across the United States. She is Sarah Lee, not Sara. • A correction in this space on Wednesday for an article about Anthony Scaramucci’s short tenure in the Trump administration misidentified, in some copies, the position he held in the White House for just under two weeks. He was the director of communications, not the chief of staff. BUSINESS DAY The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about tax reform, referred incorrectly to consumption taxes in the United States and for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Those taxes represent one-third of the total taxes — not of gross domestic product — in the O.E.C.D. economies, and 17 percent of the total taxes in the United States. • An article on Wednesday about France’s economy erroneously attributed a distinction to the Meraviglia cruise liner, built by the shipyard STX France, which an Italian competitor is trying to take over. At 171,598 tons, the Meraviglia is the world’s biggest luxury cruise ship built in 2017; it is not the biggest over all. (The 226,963-ton Harmony of the Seas, also built by STX France, holds that distinction.) • An article on Tuesday about a hotel boom in SeaTac, Wash., misidentified the company that employs Yogi Hutsen, an executive in SeaTac. He is executive vice president of Columbia Hospitality, not of Cedarbrook Lodge. (Cedarbrook Lodge is managed by Columbia Hospitality.) • Because of an editing error, the DealBook column on Tuesday, about Starbucks’s expansion plans in China, referred incorrectly to China Central Television, known as CCTV. It has not changed its name to China Global Television Network, or CGTV. "
"For aficionados of the absurd, August arrives like balm. The National Football League gears up for another season and inanities abound. This year brings the spectacle of Colin Kaepernick and his search for employment as a quarterback. All off-season, he wandered from franchise door to door, rattling his tin cup. His task did not appear impossible. If he was no longer the star who led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance and a second N.F.C. championship game in consecutive seasons, he remained a capable backup, with a strong arm and the long-legged stride of a wide receiver. Except Kaepernick has a principles problem, which is to say he possesses too many. Last year he took a knee during the pregame national anthem as a way of protesting racial injustice and police brutality. His quiet demonstration upset some fans and the men who own and run football franchises. Of late, the Baltimore Ravens have given thought to signing Kaepernick. Their starter, Joe Flacco, is injured. Steve Bisciotti, owner of the Ravens and a conservative man, met with fans at a team forum on Sunday and bared his soul about his unease with hiring this Kaepernick. "
"Despite the disorder in Washington — with a revolving door at the White House and roadblocks on Capitol Hill — Wall Street and corporate America are booming. The disconnect was evident Wednesday, as the Dow Jones industrial average passed the 22,000 mark, a new high. At the same time, blue chips like Apple, Caterpillar and U.S. Steel have all reported strong earnings in recent weeks that surpassed analysts’ forecasts. “None of the soap opera in Washington matters,” said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty coatings and sealants like Rust-Oleum. “Nobody in business cares about who talked to who in Russia.” What does matter, Mr. Sullivan said, is stronger global demand in heavy industries like mining and oil and gas, a weaker dollar that helps exporters, and a lighter regulatory touch by the new administration. The initial stock market rally that followed Mr. Trump’s victory in November — the so-called Trump bump — was fueled by optimism among investors that long-sought action on tax reform and infrastructure spending might finally be at hand. Few analysts are so sanguine now, especially after Republicans could not agree last month on how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after years of promising to do so. If anything, simplifying the tax code or investing in new roads and bridges seems farther out of reach than ever. "
"To the Editor: Re “A Threat to Nuclear Arms Control” (editorial, July 30): You rightly warn that American plans to spend more than $1 trillion over the next 30 years upgrading nuclear forces will undermine arms control and fuel a new arms race. But it is not enough to abandon this dangerous, expensive plan to enhance our ability to destroy the world. United States nuclear policy is based on the belief that nuclear weapons deter their own use: that nuclear-armed states will refrain from attacking one another for fear of the counterattacks they would suffer. Yet we know of more than a dozen instances when nuclear-armed countries began the process of launching their nuclear weapons, usually in the mistaken belief that their adversaries had already done so — more than a dozen times when deterrence failed. And we are told that North Korea must not obtain a nuclear capability because it cannot reliably be deterred. It is time to abandon this failed policy and to pursue the real security of a world free of nuclear weapons. IRA HELFAND, LEEDS, MASS. The writer is co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, the recipient of the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. To the Editor: Your assertion that “since setting off the nuclear age, America has been the major, if imperfect, force behind the restraints that exist” ignores the sorry history of the United States’ provocative expansion of its nuclear arms and delivery system programs as well as its rejection of numerous offers from Russia, China and even North Korea to ratchet down the hostilities. Start with President Harry S. Truman’s rejection of Stalin’s 1946 proposal to ban nuclear weapons under United Nations supervision; to President Ronald Reagan’s rejection of Mikhail S. Gorbachev’s offer to negotiate for the abolition of nuclear weapons, conditioned on Mr. Reagan’s agreeing not to seek military superiority in space with the “Star Wars” program, which Mr. Reagan refused. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea tested two long-range missiles last month, demonstrating that it may be able to reach American soil with a nuclear weapon. Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang are at a high point. In this atmosphere, multiple barriers — language, culture and ideology — make misunderstanding and dangerous miscalculations more likely, paving the way for conflict. We need more contact and communication among the people of North Korea, South Korea and the United States — not less. But the United States government is barring Americans from traveling to North Korea. The ban was put in place by the Trump administration following the death in June of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who had been detained in North Korea for more than a year and died after returning home in a coma. With the exception of humanitarian aid initiatives, citizen efforts will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, meaning that the travel ban is likely to end people-to-people engagement. Americans traveling to North Korea in search of their family members, dead and alive, are likely to be banned. Draconian United States and United Nations Security Council sanctions make it very difficult for Korean-Americans to send money to their impoverished relatives in the North, but the travel ban will probably cut off those channels, too. Two years ago, I crossed the world’s most fortified border, from North to South Korea, with 30 women from 15 countries calling for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, which was halted six decades ago with only a cease-fire. The North Korea travel ban will impede citizen diplomacy initiatives like our march. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Los Angeles just won a bid to host the 2028 Olympics, returning the games to the United States for the first time in what will have been 26 years. Mayor Eric Garcetti told the news media, “We’re a city that has always been a Games-changer and again will be in 2028.” Trevor Noah has an idea of what those changes might entail. Jimmy Kimmel isn’t even sure we’ll make it that far. Anthony Scaramucci, the White House’s flash-in-the-pan communications director, is still on Jimmy Fallon’s mind. The Bible and “The Art of the Deal” have one thing in common, Seth Meyers said. “I’ve just eaten some Lego.” Dave Chappelle just began a 10-show run at Radio City Music Hall, and to discuss it he’ll join Mr. Colbert on “The Late Show.” A film as widely loathed by critics as “The Emoji Movie” doesn’t come around every day. But there have certainly been some. Here’s a look at some of the scathing reviews that have greeted movies dismal enough to receive a “0 percent” score on the ratings website Rotten Tomatoes. "
"You’re a former Republican communications strategist who worked for George W. Bush, John McCain and Sarah Palin, and now you have a show on MSNBC. What’s it like on that side of the table? I was always the ‘‘squishy’’ one on the Bush White House staff. No one I worked for was ever deceived by my degrees of conservative principles, and that was my value to them: I understood the other side. I helped most of the people I worked for soften their polarizing edges. But to say that I would be totally unemployable in today’s political climate is probably an understatement. That’s just not what any of them do. What do you think it’s like working at the White House right now? There’s a pretty high level of alarm based on how easy it is to get people to talk about what’s actually happening inside the White House, and you never know the whole story. As chaotic and dysfunctional as it looks from the outside, from my experience with Sarah Palin, I know what’s known and discussed publicly is usually just the tip of the iceberg. Do you think we still know only the tip of the iceberg with Palin? Well, what I think was unknown was the degree of her rejection of us asking her to do anything that wasn’t her own idea. We were dealing with someone who was maybe ahead of her time. Her irreverence and disdain for the establishment of her own party and her embrace of the ‘‘isms’’ — nativism, isolationism, you know — she blew the walls out on the political norms before Donald Trump did. She was obviously onto something. She had crowds five times the size of McCain’s. We think it was all about her political skills, but it was also about her message. She railed against the mainstream media, she attacked all of us, her own advisers. That her audiences were so enthusiastic about that was the early signal that the party had changed. Many people think that, because of Trump’s volatility, we’re experiencing potentially unpredecented political destabilization. How do you think this administration stacks up to the Bush White House? Before 9/11, Bush spent the first seven or eight months of his presidency trying to work in a bipartisan manner. He passed the education bill with Ted Kennedy’s support; he passed the tax cut with Max Baucus’s support. I mean, he had some relationships on the other side, and then, obviously, the attack brought everyone together — probably for too brief a time. Trump went on Twitter and attacked a Republican, his sitting attorney general and the acting director of F.B.I. — all before 11 a.m. today. If something happened in the national security realm, he’d need them to assist him in protecting the country. It’s almost like that part of the job hasn’t been explained to him. He’s just there trying to do what he thinks the ‘‘president’’ part is. "
"WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration has warned Congress that it is frequently finding contamination, illegal ingredients and other problems in the soaring quantities of imported cosmetics, and that it has only “limited resources” to inspect the shipments. The warning was part of a letter sent in late June to a House Democrat who is pushing Congress to enact legislation giving the F.D.A. greater powers and resources to regulate cosmetics. The F.D.A. has the equivalent of just six full-time inspectors to monitor three million shipments of cosmetics coming in each year — lipsticks, eyeliners, nail polish, face powders, tattoo inks and other products — an amount that has doubled in the last decade, said the letter to Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey. He is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the F.D.A. These products came from 181 countries last year, sent by 29,000 foreign companies, few of which have registered with the F.D.A., as they are not required to do so, the agency told Mr. Pallone. “Cosmetics imports, by volume, are one of F.D.A.’s larger categories,” Anna K. Abram, an F.D.A. deputy commissioner, wrote in the June 30 letter, adding that the “F.D.A. has limited resources to examine imported cosmetics.” "
"JERSEY CITY — To the gentrifying stew of bankers, artists and college graduates who are transforming this once blue-collar city across the Hudson River from Manhattan, add an unexpected flavor. In a heavily African-American neighborhood, 62 families from a number of Hasidic sects based in Brooklyn and rarely seen here have bought a scattering of faded but roomy wood-frame rowhouses whose prices are less than half what homes of similar size would cost in New York — roughly $300,000 compared with $800,000. These families are pioneers in a demographic and religious shift that is reshaping communities throughout the region. Skyrocketing real estate prices in Brooklyn and Queens are forcing out young ultra-Orthodox families, which are establishing outposts in unexpected places, like Toms River and Jackson Township in New Jersey, the Willowbrook neighborhood on Staten Island and in Bloomingburg, N.Y., in the foothills of the Catskills. The influx, however, has provoked tensions with long-established residents, as the ultra-Orthodox seek to establish a larger footprint for their surging population. Residents complain that investors or real estate agents representing the ultra-Orthodox community have been ringing doorbells persistently, offering to buy properties at “Brooklyn prices.” Jersey City, Toms River and Jackson have all passed no-knock ordinances barring such inquiries under the threat of fines or have banned solicitations altogether. The mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, said his town took pride in its diversity but had been concerned about “very aggressive solicitation.” “They literally go door to door and can be very pushy trying to purchase someone’s house,” Mr. Fulop, a grandson of Holocaust survivors and a graduate of yeshivas, said in an interview. “It’s not the best way to endear yourself to the community, and there’s been a lot of pushback.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Inquiry hints at an antiwhite bias. The Trump administration is preparing to investigate and sue universities over admissions policies deemed to discriminate against white applicants, according to a Justice Department document obtained by The Times. The document does not explicitly identify who is deemed at risk of discrimination. But its phrasing — “intentional race-based discrimination” — cuts to the heart of affirmative action programs intended to bring more minority students to campuses. The plan is another sign that the department’s civil rights division is taking a conservative tilt under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. • G.O.P. bypasses Trump on health law. Congressional Republicans are working toward bipartisan legislation to shore up insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. "

"Republicans are reeling from the failure to pass health care legislation on their own. Senate Democrats are trying to revamp their populist economic agenda. Now would be a good time for some bipartisan efforts to overhaul the tax code together — or so the Democrats thought. But Republicans apparently disagree. On Tuesday, 45 Senate Democrats sent a letter to President Trump; the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell; and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, urging them to work with Democrats on a tax plan. The reception was frosty. And it is still unclear how enthusiastic Democrats would really be about making compromises that would allow Mr. Trump to score a major legislative victory. Despite setbacks in the administration’s legislative agenda, animal spirits are still at work in the stock market. Barring a sharp reversal, the Dow Jones industrial average could soon pass the 22,000 milestone for the first time. That would be an 11 percent surge for the year. But the Dow’s rise nearly mirrors a fall in the dollar. Currencies including the euro, the yen, the renminbi and the Mexican peso have been climbing against the dollar, while trillions of dollars slosh around the global economy to places where investors can receive a higher return, whether that’s junk bonds or Dow stalwarts like Amazon.

t’s been five months since I moved to Australia, three months since we officially opened The New York Times bureau in Sydney, and this seems like as good a time as any to step back and share a few observations. I’ll also be heading back to the United States soon for a holiday, and when I return, I’ll share some impressions about that experience as well. A lot seems to be changing and not changing since I left. What’s below is, of course, just a selection of what’s front of mind at the moment, so don’t expect comprehensiveness and feel free to disagree with or expand on my impressions. My goal, as always to some degree, is to open up the journalism process. So consider this, perhaps, my rolling answer to the question I hear all the time: So what do you think of Australia? Forever Friendly Earlier this week, I walked into my local surf lifesaving club to ask about the Nippers program for my kids, and was immediately welcomed by a woman who went out of her way to explain everything I needed to know. She even printed out pages of background and underlined the most important points. "
"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon conducted a test of an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday, with the timing expected to be of note in both North Korea, which recently tested its missile arsenal, and in China, which has been urged by the Trump administration to pressure North Korea on its nuclear program. The test came a day after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said that the United States was not seeking a regime change in North Korea and would be willing to talk to Pyongyang. “We do not seek a collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th Parallel,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department on Tuesday. Mr. Tillerson assured North Korea “we are not your enemy,” but added that Pyongyang “is presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond.” “We would like to sit and have a dialogue with them,” Mr. Tillerson said. American intelligence agencies recently said that North Korea was developing a missile that could reach the interior of the United States in about a year. “We’ll handle North Korea,” President Trump said on Monday before he met with his cabinet. “We’re going to be able to handle them. It will be handled. We handle everything.” The unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, according to an official statement from the Air Force Global Strike Command released early Wednesday after the test was completed. “While not a response to recent North Korean actions, the test demonstrates that the United States’ nuclear enterprise is safe, secure, effective and ready to be able to deter, detect and defend against attacks on the United States and its allies,” the statement said. The statement said the missile’s re-entry vehicle traveled about 4,200 miles over the Pacific Ocean to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The test was described as a way to “verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, providing valuable data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump signed legislation on Wednesday imposing sanctions on Russia and limiting his own authority to lift them, but asserted that the measure included “clearly unconstitutional provisions” and left open the possibility that he might choose not to enforce them as lawmakers intended. The legislation, which also includes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, represented the first time that Congress had forced Mr. Trump to sign a bill over his objections by passing it with bipartisan, veto-proof majorities. Even before he signed it, the Russian government retaliated by seizing two American diplomatic properties and ordering the United States to reduce its embassy staff members in Russia by 755 people. The measure reflected deep skepticism among lawmakers in both parties about Mr. Trump’s friendly approach to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and an effort to prevent Mr. Trump from letting the Kremlin off the hook for its annexation of Crimea, military intervention in Ukraine and its meddling in last year’s American election. Rather than the rapprochement Mr. Trump once envisioned, the United States and Russia now seem locked in a spiral of increasing tension. Unlike other bill signings, Mr. Trump did not invite news media photographers to record the event, nor did he say anything about it to reporters. He ignored questions about the legislation at an unrelated event and instead relegated his comments to two written statements, one meant for Congress to describe caveats in his approval of the bill and the other issued to reporters to explain his grudging decision to sign. As other presidents have in the past, Mr. Trump protested that Congress was improperly interfering with his power to set foreign policy, in this case by imposing waiting periods before he can suspend or remove sanctions first imposed by former President Barack Obama while Congress reviews and potentially blocks such a move. In the statement to Congress, Mr. Trump said the bill “included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.” Although he added that “I nevertheless expect to honor” the waiting periods, he did not commit to it. Moreover, he took issue with other provisions, saying only that he “will give careful and respectful consideration to the preferences expressed by the Congress.” "
"Dave Chappelle is the only artist alive who would close a comedy show by finding a ray of hope in our current political situation through a poetic recounting of the tragic murder of Emmett Till. No reviewer’s recounting can do justice to his intricate, virtuosic storytelling, so you will have to buy a ticket to Mr. Chappelle’s show at Radio City Music Hall to find out how he pulls off this feat. As audacious as it is, this set piece is also an example of how his singular daring can be in tension with a comic’s instinct to be as funny as he or she can be. There’s no joke at the end of this bit. Instead, Mr. Chappelle says that he has had trouble sleeping since Donald Trump was elected. His new set exudes the weary tone of many following the daily bombshells in the news, with Mr. Chappelle even expressing second thoughts about his “Saturday Night Live” monologue after the election when he said he would give Mr. Trump a chance. Mr. Chappelle hasn’t just started a three-and-a-half-week run, which ends on Aug. 24, when he’ll turn 44. He’s producing a massive cultural festival, headlining with a lineup of some of the greatest comedians of color in the country (Chris Rock, Leslie Jones, Ali Wong, Trevor Noah) along with top-shelf musical acts (Solange, Lauryn Hill, Chance the Rapper, Ice Cube). By presenting it in the sleepy month of August, he turns Radio City into the most exciting party in the city. Mr. Chappelle has always had an instinct for showmanship, honed from doing stand-up since age 14. His new show starts theatrically, with the comedian ascending from beneath the floor of the stage under a ring of lights and over a cloud of smoke. Puffing on a cigarette, he wears what has become his customary military jacket with his last name printed over his left breast pocket. This uniform makes him look more formal and severe than he did in his earlier days. His stage persona has changed too, with less animated physicality and a faster, raspier delivery. Mr. Chappelle’s jokes once moseyed before they exploded. They’re steadier now, quicker to start, but less likely to dart off in wild directions. And his voice doesn’t range as much, staying in a deeper register. Some of his agility and mischievousness has been replaced with an increased narrative ambition, rooted in a confidence in his ability to get a laugh so firm that he goes deep into ideas without a punch line. This strategy has risks, which he not only embraces but also luxuriates in. As he often does, Mr. Chappelle tells of getting booed — this time it was about a show in Cleveland after making a joke about a killer at large there (along with the nearly-as-provocative admission that he’s a Warriors fan). Another time, he introduces a bit about Michael Jackson by saying it’s not going to work. (It did O.K., but not nearly as well as his jokes on the same material from his 2004 special “For What It’s Worth,” one of the best this century has produced). "
"Good morning. A few years ago, my colleagues and I put together “A Field Guide to the American Sandwich” for The Times. It was a celebratory taxonomy, in the main, but we were lucky to pick up a few helpful recipes along the way, including Julia Moskin’s invaluable one for grilled cheese. Now, you’d think you wouldn’t need a recipe for grilled cheese, that grilled cheese could really be part of our regular Wednesday tradition of no-recipe recipes, that all you really need to do is slap some cheese into a sandwich and sauté it in a pan. But Julia’s recipe puts the lie to that, with all kinds of helpful advice that will elevate your grilled cheese sandwich from passable to extraordinary, with just a few swipes of mayonnaise and careful consideration of the ratio of cheese to bread. So perhaps that could be dinner tonight, and, if you like, you could add to it a no-recipe recipe flourish, taken from the refrigerator: the addition to the sandwich of some leftover chicken or pork or steak, a little dip or gochujang sauce, a few pickles, some sliced jalapeño, the tail end of a beefsteak tomato, maybe a fried egg. It’s the simplest kind of cooking, and on a Wednesday night in August that’s exactly what most of us need. Though perhaps you’re in the mood for an actual recipe? Tejal Rao is just back from interior Maine, with a delightful profile of the chef Erin French of the Lost Kitchen restaurant in Freedom. To go with it, she offers two recipes from Ms. French’s new cookbook. One is for halibut niçoise, a dish in which the main components of a classic salad are accounted for, but totally reconfigured into a dish that’s warmer and more substantial. (No halibut? Try fluke or flounder, turbot or cod.) The other is for a chilled golden beet and buttermilk soup, which layers bright and carefully balanced acidity into a marvelous whole. Serve with grilled garlic bread, is what I’m thinking. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump embraced a proposal on Wednesday to slash legal immigration to the United States in half within a decade by sharply curtailing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country. The plan would enact the most far-reaching changes to the system of legal immigration in decades and represents the president’s latest effort to stem the flow of newcomers to the United States. Since taking office, he has barred many visitors from select Muslim-majority countries, limited the influx of refugees, increased immigration arrests and pressed to build a wall along the southern border. In asking Congress to curb legal immigration, Mr. Trump intensified a debate about national identity, economic growth, worker fairness and American values that animated his campaign last year. Critics said the proposal would undercut the fundamental vision of the United States as a haven for the poor and huddled masses, while the president and his allies said the country had taken in too many low-skilled immigrants for too long to the detriment of American workers. “This legislation will not only restore our competitive edge in the 21st century, but it will restore the sacred bonds of trust between America and its citizens,” Mr. Trump said at a White House event alongside two Republican senators sponsoring the bill. “This legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first.” In throwing his weight behind a bill, Mr. Trump added one more long-odds priority to a legislative agenda already packed with them in the wake of the defeat of legislation to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s health care program. The president has already vowed to overhaul the tax code and rebuild the nation’s roads, airports and other infrastructure. But by endorsing legal immigration cuts, a move he has long supported, Mr. Trump returned to a theme that has defined his short political career and excites his conservative base at a time when his poll numbers continue to sink. Just 33 percent of Americans approved of his performance in the latest Quinnipiac University survey, the lowest rating of his presidency, and down from 40 percent a month ago. "
"Vice President Mike Pence told leaders of eight Balkan nations on Wednesday that “the future of the western Balkans is in the West,” a signal of the United States’ commitment to southeastern Europe and a warning against Russian encroachment in the region. Speaking in Montenegro, which defied Russia by becoming the newest member of NATO in June, Mr. Pence praised the tiny nation for its independence. “Your courage, particularly in the face of Russian pressure, inspires the world and I commend you for that,” Mr. Pence said at a dinner on Tuesday evening. Russian officials were so incensed by Montenegro’s decision to join NATO that they plotted a coup attempt in October to try to block the country from joining the alliance, Mr. Pence said — an accusation that Russia denies. On Wednesday, in a 19-minute address to leaders at the Adriatic Charter Summit meeting, the vice president called Russia an “unpredictable country that casts a shadow from the east.” “Russia continues to seek to redraw international borders by force,” Mr. Pence said. “And here in the western Balkans, Russia has worked to destabilize the region, undermine your democracies and divide you from each other and from the rest of Europe.” "
"This is a season of gerrymandering. A federal court in Texas will soon rule on whether the state discriminated against minorities when it adopted its current congressional map. The Supreme Court will hear the biggest case of all in October: a challenge to Wisconsin’s partisan gerrymander with the potential to curb partisan gerrymandering nationwide. But before the courts weigh in, it’s time to end the last debate over partisan gerrymandering. That’s the one that unfolded after the 2012 election, when Democrats won the House popular vote but fell 17 seats short of taking the chamber. It caused a classic feud between “data” and the conventional wisdom, with data journalists and political scientists contending that gerrymandering wasn’t responsible for Republican control of the House. Now, the electoral context has changed, and the old debate is moot. Heading into the 2018 midterms, data and conventional wisdom agree: Gerrymandering is a big reason the G.O.P. has a real chance to retain control of the House, even if the Democrats score a clear win. Most of the political-science-based estimates suggested that gerrymandering cost the Democrats a net of 7 to 12 seats in 2012 (with a few estimates coming in higher and lower). That wouldn’t be enough to prove decisive in 2012, not with the Democrats falling 17 seats short. But in other contexts, that’s potentially a very significant number. If the party had come somewhat closer to retaking the House, most political scientists and data journalists would have probably conceded that partisan gerrymandering was at least plausibly responsible for the G.O.P.’s margin of victory. Similarly, the Democratic margin of victory in the House popular vote simply wasn’t very large: a single percentage point. The political scientists needed only to find that the alternative explanations for the Republican edge — incumbency and the tendency for Democrats to “waste” votes in heavily Democratic cities — could account for that percentage point. Those who saw gerrymandering as the main cause of the G.O.P. victory implicitly assumed that those alternative explanations added virtually nothing to the Republican edge. There is little question that incumbency and geography help bias the House playing field against the Democrats. The incumbency advantage is perhaps the best-established effect in American elections, and Republicans entered the 2012 election with many more seats than the Democrats. The Democratic geography disadvantage has been harder to clearly establish, but there is little doubt that it exists. The Democrats routinely win 80-plus percent of the vote in big cities worth many congressional districts. There are very few places where the Republicans win 80-plus percent of the vote in an area with enough people to form a congressional district. The result is the remaining vote — and remaining districts — tilt Republican. "
"Are you an American? Chances are your answer to this question depends on whether you have (or could get) a United States passport. That is one way many people think about what it means to be American. Another way is to think less literally and more culturally. Being an American, in this sense, can conjure images of apple pie, baseball and summer picnics. It may evoke ideas about working hard and being rewarded, or treating people equally and extending everyone opportunities. We teach these notions to schoolchildren and hold them up as essentially American. But the 2016 election made clear that there isn’t universal agreement on what it means to be an American, with restrictive views centered on ethnicity and religion playing a major role in the Trump campaign. And yet trends in public opinion suggest that the nation as a whole is moving away from an exclusionary notion of American identity. The Democracy Fund, a bipartisan foundation that funds political research, recently put a series of questions about this topic to 8,000 people who voted in the 2012 presidential election as part of its Voter Study Group collaboration. The survey was fielded in November 2016, but it included re-interviews of people who were originally surveyed in 2011, 2012 and the summer of 2016. As John Sides, a member of the consortium reported, the results reveal more consensus than you might expect about American identity, but also some stark differences across parties and even within them. Among the questions: How important are things like speaking English or being born in the United States? Should it matter if someone has lived here only a short time or has non-European ancestors? What about religion — is being a Christian crucial? Most Americans agree on certain things that are objectively important to calling yourself an American. Across party lines, there was strong support for the importance of respecting American political institutions and laws, having citizenship, and accepting people of diverse backgrounds. Well over half the people in both major political parties agree that these things are fundamental to being American. More than 90 percent of self-described Democrats think openness to diversity is important to American identity, and 80 percent of Republicans agree. "

Here’s a bipartisan deal for the Senate to consider: Republicans publicly commit to ending their efforts at Obamacare repeal, and Democrats start to confirm more of President Trump’s nominees. So far, the Senate has obstructed those nominees at a higher rate than for any president on record. Only 20 percent of President Trump’s executive-branch nominees had been confirmed through July 31, compared with at least 56 percent at the same point in the terms of Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Dozens of top jobs across various cabinet departments remain unfilled as a result. Until now, the Democrats have had a good reason for their obstruction. It was a response to the unprecedented process that Senate Republicans pursued on health care. They rushed votes, tried to discredit independent analyses and refused to hold hearings. “If they continue to insist on ramming through a secret health care bill without any public input or debate,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said in June, “they shouldn’t expect business as usual in the Senate.” But if Republicans abandon their efforts to take health insurance from millions of people — as they seem close to doing — Democrats should begin confirming more nominees. They made some progress yesterday, approving eight Pentagon nominees. "
"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Saeb Erekat, a leading voice of the Palestinian cause for decades, now finds himself battling for his own health along with that of the long-ailing peace process. Both came into sharp focus this week as headlines in the Israeli news media blared that Mr. Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its veteran chief negotiator, is suffering from pulmonary fibrosis. He is waiting for a lung transplant, most likely to be carried out in the United States or Israel. That news coincided with a rather bleak assessment of the peace process by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and special adviser, as revealed in a leaked audio recording. In remarks that were intended to be off the record, Mr. Kushner told congressional interns on Monday that the administration was still “thinking about what the right end state is” and that “there may be no solution” to the conflict. In an unusual statement on Tuesday, Mr. Erekat criticized the Trump administration for not articulating support for the two-state solution — the internationally accepted principle for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the 1990s — and for failing to compel Israel to cease settlement activity. He described the administration’s silence on these issues as an obstacle to a resumption of negotiations. In an interview in his office in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Wednesday, Mr. Erekat, 62, a passionate and perennial champion of Palestinian statehood, took the opportunity to address his public and personal struggles. It is no secret that Mr. Erekat, who is still working and meeting with international diplomats, requires oxygen from a mobile tank. And now, it is out in the open that he is waiting for a lifesaving transplant. But after the news exposure this week, he is urging people to respect his privacy and that of his family. "
"DOHA, Qatar — Qatar agreed on Wednesday to buy seven Italian warships at a cost of nearly $6 billion in the latest example of checkbook defiance by the gas-rich country in its two-month-old feud with four neighboring Arab countries. The military deal between Qatar and Italy, announced by the foreign ministers of both countries in Doha, Qatar’s capital, was the latest in a slew of diplomatic and economic moves suggesting that the crisis, the worst to hit the Persian Gulf countries in decades, shows little sign of abating. Days earlier, Qatar brought its fight with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to international aviation and trade forums, and was even seen to have advanced a breathtakingly pricey soccer transfer as a means of flexing its muscles. The measures were countered by implacable demands from the Saudi-led quartet, and offered a sense of the challenge facing Western officials, led by the Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who have tried to defuse the crisis, so far in vain. On Tuesday, the State Department named Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, a four-star Marine general who retired in 2000, as a special representative to the Persian Gulf. He is expected to arrive in the region next week. On Monday, Qatar lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization against its neighbors, which have cut off all trade and diplomatic ties, and closed air and sea routes into the country. Saudi Arabia has shut Qatar’s only land border. Qatar also sought help this week from the United Nations aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization, in a bid to open new air corridors through the Emirates, which are currently closed.

"WASHINGTON — Caleb Bennett was days away from starting the final semester of an associate degree at ITT Technical Institute outside Indianapolis last fall when he got word that the school had unexpectedly gone belly up. Like thousands of ITT students, Mr. Bennett, an Army veteran with four years of service and a tour in Afghanistan, had paid for the schooling, books and even his family’s housing with benefits he had earned under the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill. With the degree, he planned to enter a bachelor’s program in electrical engineering and, eventually, to get a better-paying job to support his growing family. Instead, Mr. Bennett found himself with only a week’s notice, a pregnant wife and nearly two years of worthless credits paid from his non-reusable store of G.I. benefits. When a refund check from ITT bounced a month later, the young family’s finances were thrown into chaos. “It’s a real big hit on the chin,” Mr. Bennett, 25, said recently. “But you just have to suck it up and get to it and hope something happens. Thankfully something did.” That something came in the form of a sweeping set of changes to the G.I. Bill for post-Sept. 11 veterans like Mr. Bennett that passed the Senate by unanimous consent on Wednesday. A patchwork of fixes and coverage expansions years in the making, the measure restores education benefits to the thousands of veterans still reeling from the closings of for-profit schools like ITT and Corinthian Colleges while they were enrolled. Other major provisions include the lifting of a 15-year limit on benefit use, as well as the expansion of tuition assistance and other benefits for Purple Heart recipients; certain National Guard and military reservists who deploy on active duty; families of soldiers who die in the line of duty; and veterans pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and math. A host of smaller changes modernize the benefits program. "
"WASHINGTON — One of the remarkable features of covering the congressional battle over health care this year has been the way reporters pieced together a picture of what was happening from snippets of information extracted from members of Congress dashing through the Capitol. At times, I felt as if I were in a time machine — reliving, in reverse, my previous reporting for The New York Times on the laborious legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. Reporters roamed the halls like hunters and sprang into action with voice recorders in hand when a senator emerged from the Senate chamber, an elevator or a subway car, or an unmarked hideaway office. It was not unusual to see more than a dozen reporters surrounding or chasing after senators who appeared to be thinking out loud as they responded last week to questions about the latest iteration of the Senate Republican health plan. Republican senators themselves often professed to be in the dark about crucial details. But from the scattered clues they offered — like tiles of a mosaic — journalists assembled a picture of what was happening behind the scenes. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, for example, disclosed that Senate Republicans were planning to drop a tax cut for high-income people that had been included in a bill passed by the House and in a measure drafted by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who eventually cast a decisive vote against the Republican health plan last week, had hinted at the bill’s problems in a corridor conversation with journalists a month earlier. Asked about the chances of a quick deal on health care, Mr. McCain remarked, “Pigs could fly.” "
"MOSCOW — After shopping around for a defense lawyer this year, a Russian state bank settled on someone who it said had relevant experience, though the bank insists that experience does not include a promotional pitch from the lawyer’s firm: representing “President Donald J. Trump in a wide range of litigation matters for over 15 years.” In Russia, finding the right insider connection is essential for litigation success, but the case against the bank, Sberbank, is playing out in Federal District Court in Manhattan. There, concerns have been raised about Sberbank’s reasons for hiring the lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, as its lead defense counsel. The bank is being sued by a Russian businessman, Sergey P. Poymanov, who has sparred with it for years in Russian courts. The lawsuit appears unrelated to another of Mr. Kasowitz’s cases involving Russia — defending Mr. Trump in an investigation into possible collusion by his campaign officials in Russia’s meddling in last year’s presidential election. Mr. Kasowitz had been introduced as the lead lawyer in that matter, too, but his responsibilities have since been scaled back, and a lawyer with more Washington experience, Ty Cobb, has taken the lead. The potential for Russia’s meddling elsewhere — in American courts — has raised concerns among Mr. Poymanov’s lawyers, who are not convinced that Mr. Kasowitz’s ties to Mr. Trump played no role in Sberbank’s choosing him. They point out that on its website, Mr. Kasowitz’s firm, Kasowitz Benson Torres, prominently advertises his 15 years of pre-election service to the president. The website also noted other litigation experience and awards for Mr. Kasowitz: The publication American Lawyer called him a “heavy hitter,” a television show referred to Mr. Kasowitz as the “toughest lawyer on Wall Street” and a news agency once described him as an “uberlitigator.” “I don’t want to blame anybody, but I cannot exclude that they want to use him for his connections,” Dmitri Y. Fomichyev, a lawyer for Mr. Poymanov, said in an interview in Moscow. “I cannot exclude that was their motivation. The question is out there.” "
"VATICAN CITY — Two close associates of Pope Francis have accused American Catholic ultraconservatives of making an alliance of “hate” with evangelical Christians to back President Trump, further alienating a group already out of the Vatican’s good graces. The authors, writing in a Vatican-vetted journal, singled out Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, as a “supporter of an apocalyptic geopolitics” that has stymied action against climate change and exploited fears of migrants and Muslims with calls for “walls and purifying deportations.” The article warns that conservative American Catholics have strayed dangerously into the deepening political polarization in the United States. The writers even declare that the worldview of American evangelical and hard-line Catholics, which is based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, is “not too far apart’’ from jihadists. It is not clear if the article, appearing in La Civiltà Cattolica, received the pope’s direct blessing, but it was extraordinary coming from a journal that carries the Holy See’s seal of approval. There has apparently been no reprimand from the pope, who is not shy about disciplining dissenters, and La Civiltà Cattolica’s editor has promoted the article nearly every day since it was published in July. The article and the backlash to it — accusations of anti-Americanism have been rife, and one prominent American prelate likened the authors to “useful idiots” — have highlighted the widening distance between Francis and American Catholic conservatives. Since the 2013 election of Pope Francis, conservatives have worried that he has given short shrift to the social issues that have animated them, among them abortion and same-sex marriage. They have sat through his warnings to steer clear of politics. They have watched warily as Francis has installed pastors in his image while sidelining conservative leaders. "
"WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration moves to take on China over intellectual property, Washington will find it has limited firepower. Beijing has a strong grip on American technology companies, and global trade rules could favor China. Technology is proving a major battleground for China and the United States, as both sides vie to protect their economic and national security interests. Beijing has forced a long list of American companies to enter joint ventures or share research with Chinese players, part of a broader push to create its own technology giants. From makers of smartphones to chips to electric cars, American businesses have reluctantly agreed, fearful of losing access to China, which has the second-largest economy in the world. China’s ambitions have set off alarms in Washington, with concerns on both sides of the aisle. Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, is now preparing a trade case accusing China of extensive violations of intellectual property, according to people with detailed knowledge of the case. But China can play a strong defense. The country has broad latitude, under special rules it negotiated with the World Trade Organization, to maintain restrictions within its market. “The problem is that U.S. trade negotiators agreed to provisions allowing China to limit market access for U.S. companies unless they engaged in joint ventures,” said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which Congress created to monitor the relationship between the two countries. "

"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday scrapped a plan to overhaul the government’s system for collecting payments on $1.3 trillion in federal loans, canceling a contract procurement that would have handed management of nearly all aspects of the system over to a single vendor. “By starting afresh and pursuing a truly modern loan servicing environment, we have a chance to turn what was a good plan into a great one,” Ms. DeVos said. Most students who borrow for college use loans from the federal government to finance their studies. The Education Department outsources the work of servicing those loans — sending monthly bills, collecting payments and dealing with borrowers’ questions — to nine outside contractors. Their contracts expire in 2019. Consumer advocates have complained that the system is overly complex and rife with poor customer service. Under President Barack Obama, the Education Department announced last year that it would replace that patchwork with a new, single web portal through which all borrowers would obtain information on their loans. Ms. DeVos said in May that the department would stick with that approach, but with one major change: It wanted a single company to both build the new system and have the option of servicing all of the loans itself. Putting the entire project in one vendor’s hands would be “more effective and efficient,” she said at the time. But the department’s winner-take-all plan prompted a broad outcry from consumer advocates, lawmakers, and even the industry itself, which is accustomed to splitting up the government’s lucrative contracts for student loan collection among a number of entrenched vendors.

"Did the Trump campaign collude with Russian agents trying to manipulate the course of the 2016 election? Some analysts have argued that the media has made too much of the collusion narrative; that Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Kremlin-linked Russians last year was probably innocent (if ill-advised); or that Russian operatives probably meant for the meeting to be discovered because they were not trying to recruit Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump as agents, but mainly trying to undermine the American political system. We disagree with these arguments. We like to think of ourselves as fair-minded and knowledgeable, having between us many years of experience with the C.I.A. dealing with Russian intelligence services. It is our view not only that the Russian government was running some sort of intelligence operation involving the Trump campaign, but also that it is impossible to rule out the possibility of collusion between the two. The original plan drawn up by the Russian intelligence services was probably multilayered. They could have begun an operation intended to disrupt the presidential campaign, as well as an effort to recruit insiders to help them over time — the two are not mutually exclusive. It is the nature of Russian covert actions (or as the Russians would call them, “active measures”) to adapt over time, providing opportunities for other actions that extend beyond the original intent. It is entirely plausible, for example, that the original Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee’s computer servers was an effort simply to collect intelligence and get an idea of the plans of the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate. Once derogatory information emerged from that operation, the Russians might then have seen an opportunity for a campaign to influence or disrupt the election. When Donald Trump Jr. responded “I love it” to proffers from a Kremlin-linked intermediary to provide derogatory information obtained by Russia on Hillary Clinton, the Russians might well have thought that they had found an inside source, an ally, a potential agent of influence on the election. The goal of the Russian spy game is to nudge a person to step over the line into an increasingly conspiratorial relationship. First, for a Russian intelligence recruitment operation to work, they would have had some sense that Donald Trump Jr. was a promising target. Next, as the Russians often do, they made a “soft” approach, setting the bait for their target via the June email sent by Rob Goldstone, a British publicist, on behalf of a Russian pop star, Emin Agalarov. They then employed a cover story — adoptions — to make it believable to the outside world that there was nothing amiss with the proposed meetings. They bolstered this idea by using cutouts, nonofficial Russians, for the actual meeting, enabling the Trump team to claim — truthfully — that there were no Russian government employees at the meeting and that it was just former business contacts of the Trump empire who were present.

"WASHINGTON — The Interior Department announced on Wednesday that the Upper Missouri River Breaks, a famous chunk of river in central Montana that holds a national monument designation, would remain fully protected by federal land-use restrictions. The Montana site, which Lewis and Clark first explored in 1805, is the fourth so far among 21 land-based sites being evaluated at the request of President Trump by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke that has been removed from consideration for changes — such as reduction in size or elimination. The others no longer at risk are Craters of the Moon National Monument in Idaho, Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington and Canyons of the Ancients National Monument in Colorado. Mr. Zinke, who was born and raised in Montana, said in a statement on Wednesday that he essentially agreed with local environmentalists in Montana that the Upper Missouri River Breaks is too important of a national treasure and so it should not be touched. “The monument is one of the only free-flowing areas of the Missouri that remains as Lewis and Clark saw it more than 200 years ago,” Mr. Zinke said. The Missouri Breaks — named after the small hills known as breaks, which are odd-looking humps of land carved eons ago when the river ran a different course — was set aside as a national monument in 2001 by President Bill Clinton, who invoked the so-called Antiquities Act, a 1906 law that gives presidents the authority to protect areas of historic, prehistoric or scientific interest.

"To the Editor: Conservative commentators are setting up former President Jimmy Carter as a Democratic whipping boy, to mitigate President Trump’s governance problems. It is not true that Mr. Carter “got nothing done,” as Ross Douthat states in “The Empty Majority” (column, July 30), nor that he “was carried to the White House on the winds of change he did not fully understand,” as Matthew Continetti claims in “Trump Goes Rogue” (Op-Ed, July 31). Mr. Carter fully understood the conservative temper of his times, and his major legislative accomplishments are ranked by the Congressional Quarterly and the Miller Center of Public Affairs as among the very top of recent presidents, only slightly below Lyndon B. Johnson’s unmatched record. Mr. Carter pushed through three comprehensive energy bills that laid the foundation for America’s energy security today by deregulating natural gas and crude oil, stressing conservation and supporting alternative energy. To actually drain the swamp after Watergate, he established strict limits on gifts; financial disclosure rules for his appointees and for himself; inspectors general in every department; and the independent Ethics Office, now under siege. He revolutionized America’s transportation system by deregulating trucking and railroads, and brought air travel to the middle class by deregulating the airlines. He created the Department of Education and, with the Alaska Land Acts, doubled the size of the national park system. At Camp David he produced a peace between Israel and Egypt that has grounded America’s Middle East policy. The Panama Canal Treaty helped mend relations with Latin America. His tough response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan makes our current sanctions against Russia seem tame. Most important, he placed human rights at the center of his foreign policy, something future presidents ignore at their political peril. STUART E.

"After a heated auction that drew bids from about half a dozen publishers, James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, sold his book about ethics, leadership and his experience in government to Flatiron Books. The book, which will be edited by Flatiron’s editorial director, Colin Dickerman, is scheduled to be published next spring, which is remarkably fast. The terms of the deal, which was reported on Wednesday by The Associated Press, were not disclosed. Mr. Comey, who began meeting with publishers last month, is represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, partners at the literary agency Javelin. “He’s hard at work on it right now,” Mr. Latimer said. “He wants to tell his story.” In the book, Mr. Comey will look back on his two decades in government and recount his involvement in high-stakes cases against the Mafia and Martha Stewart, the politically charged investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and, most recently, his clashes with President  Trump over the investigation into whether there was collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Mr. Comey will draw on these episodes to make a case for more ethical leadership. In a news release announcing the deal, Flatiron dropped tantalizing hints that Mr. Comey would reveal new details about his interactions with the Trump administration, saying he would “share yet-unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career.” “His book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure,” Bob Miller, the president and publisher of Flatiron Books, said in a statement. “By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself.” "

Mr. Robshaw surrounds himself with paintings of maharajahs, or India’s princes and rulers, that he collects on his business trips to Jaipur.

"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Wednesday began an effort to outdo President Trump on a signature issue: protecting American workers from foreign competition. Democrats, outflanked by Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign, are seeking to recapture the loyalty of voters convinced that globalization is eroding their fortunes and prospects. They introduced a set of proposals built around two ideas: preventing unfair foreign competition and providing government support for domestic industries. The highlights include a new agency to prevent foreign investments that would harm the domestic economy, and tax incentives for “reshoring” jobs, or bringing jobs back to the United States, from overseas. The political challenge for Democrats is that the proposals echo Mr. Trump’s ideas on trade. Even the rhetoric Wednesday had a distinctly Trumpian flavor. “They’re rapacious, the Chinese,” declared Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the minority leader and moving spirit behind the proposals. “They do not play by the rules. And we sit there.” "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump on Wednesday signed a bill that curtails his ability to lift sanctions against Russia, he issued a signing statement challenging the constitutionality of several provisions in the new law that restrict his executive powers. “While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed,” he said. “In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.” Here is what you need to know. A signing statement is a document issued by a president when he signs a bill into law. It contains his legal interpretation of statutes created by the bill, often instructing subordinates in the executive branch to interpret them the same way. The device becomes controversial when presidents use it to claim that new laws are unconstitutional intrusions into their executive powers, meaning they can lawfully bypass such limits. Signing statements were once rare but became more common starting with the Reagan administration. George W. Bush, whose administration embraced sweeping views of executive power, used them to challenge more provisions than all previous presidents combined, including a torture ban. Barack Obama criticized Mr. Bush’s practice as an abuse during the 2008 campaign, but as president he sometimes issued them, too. The Constitution does not say presidents may deem part of a bill as invalid when they sign it into law, rather than vetoing it if they have objections. The American Bar Association, in 2006 and 2012, urged presidents to stop using signing statements, which it called “contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional system of separation of powers.” But executive branch legal teams in administrations of both parties have maintained that the device is legitimate and useful, in part because they consider it impractical to veto important bills over minor flaws. Yes and no. It was politically remarkable for Mr. Trump to issue a statement challenging aspects of this particular bill, which a distrustful Congress forced upon him. Notably, when President Obama signed a similar bill in 2015 permitting Congress to review his decision to lift sanctions against Iran for the nuclear deal, he issued no such statement. "
"Joined by three Western allies, the United States on Wednesday escalated pressure on Iran over its space launch last week, saying the act disregarded a United Nations Security Council resolution on the use of missiles and was “threatening and provocative.” In a letter to the Security Council and Secretary General António Guterres, Ambassador Nikki R. Haley of the United States and envoys from Britain, France and Germany said the Iranian missile that carried a satellite into orbit was “inherently capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.” Under the Security Council resolution, 2231, which endorsed the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, Iran is called upon “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.” The Trump administration, which has been seeking ways to declare Iran in violation of the nuclear agreement, quickly placed sanctions on Iranian companies connected to the launch last week, a unilateral and largely symbolic act that was expected to have little or no practical effect. But the letter from the four countries — all parties to the nuclear agreement — shows that the United States is not alone in its increasingly irritated response to Iran’s repeated missile testing. The tests do not violate the nuclear agreement, which eased or ended many punitive economic sanctions on Iran in return for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. Iran is abiding by the pact’s provisions, United Nations monitors have said. Still, Iran can ill afford to alienate Britain, France and Germany. Unlike the United States, they have been major sources of the foreign investment that has begun to flow into Iran, albeit slowly, since the nuclear pact took effect. “The technologies necessary for the conception, the fabrication and the launch of space launch vehicles are closely related to those of ballistic missiles, in particular to those of an intercontinental ballistic missile,” said the letter signed by Ms. Haley on behalf of all four ambassadors. “This launch therefore represents a threatening and provocative step by Iran.” The letter called Iran’s “longstanding program to develop ballistic missiles” inconsistent with Security Council Resolution 2231. The letter said the issue must be addressed by Mr. Guterres and other Council members but did not specify how. Ms. Haley emphasized the solidarity of the four nations in remarks to the Council on Wednesday. “Our friends and allies in the United Kingdom, France and Germany join us in calling out and condemning Iran’s destructive and threatening actions,” she said. “The world must not allow Iran to act in defiance of the Security Council and its resolutions.” There was no immediate comment from Iran’s United Nations mission. Iran has contended that its missile tests do not violate the resolution’s language, which does not specifically prohibit testing. Iran says its missiles are purely defensive and could not carry nuclear arms because the country has promised not to develop them. "
"WASHINGTON — Has President Trump told you about the time the head of the Boy Scouts called to say his was the best speech ever delivered to the more than century-old organization? What about when the president of Mexico picked up the telephone to let him know that his tough enforcement efforts at the border were paying off handsomely? The anecdotes, both of which Mr. Trump told over the last week, were similar in that they appeared to be efforts to showcase broad support for the president when his White House has been mired in turmoil. But they also had another thing in common, the White House conceded on Wednesday: Neither was true. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, confirmed at her daily briefing what the Boy Scouts and the Mexican government had already asserted publicly, which is that neither phone call that Mr. Trump referred to had occurred. The stories were not fabrications, Ms. Sanders insisted. “Multiple members of the Boy Scouts leadership” had praised Mr. Trump’s speech in Glen Jean, W.Va., after he finished last week, she said. And Mr. Trump and President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico had discussed border enforcement last month on the sideline of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, she added. “I wouldn’t say it was a lie — that’s a pretty bold accusation,” Ms. Sanders said. “The conversations took place, they just simply didn’t take place over a phone call, they happened in person.” The nonexistent phone calls added to questions about Mr. Trump’s credibility and that of his White House, already in doubt given shifting explanations on matters large and small, including the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump’s inauguration and his involvement in drafting a statement about why his son Donald J. Trump Jr. had met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer during the campaign. The calls appeared to be the latest evidence that the president, who prefers impromptu storytelling to a fact-checked script, is willing to shade or even manufacture events to suit his preferred narrative — even when the story is easily disprovable and of little consequence. “He’s been lying his whole life, almost reflexively, and it’s almost as if he finds it more satisfying and easier than to speak with precision,” said Michael D’Antonio, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who later wrote a biography of Mr. Trump, “The Truth About Trump.” “When he was a kid, he lied about whether he hit a home run or not, and when he was a young man, he lied about how tall Trump Tower is — how many floors it is and the actual floors in feet — and he lied about which beautiful women were interested in him.” "
"WASHINGTON — In the Trump administration’s first serious attempt at a diplomatic opening to North Korea, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has offered to open negotiations with Pyongyang by assuring “the security they seek” and a new chance at economic prosperity if the North surrenders its nuclear weapons. Mr. Tillerson’s comments came just hours before the United States on Wednesday tested an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, sending it 4,200 miles to a target in the Marshall Islands. The Pentagon said the test was not intended as a response to the North’s launch on Friday of a missile that appeared capable of reaching Los Angeles and beyond. But military officials said the test demonstrated that the American nuclear arsenal was ready “to deter, detect and defend against attacks on the United States and its allies.” The combination of Mr. Tillerson’s outreach and the missile test laid bare an internal administration debate over what course to take — and whether a combination of diplomatic outreach and maximal military pressure would change North Korea’s current course. Most intelligence assessments have concluded that the North has no incentive to begin negotiations until it demonstrates, even more conclusively than it has in recent weeks, that its nuclear weapon could reach the United States mainland. The missile test was the latest demonstration of American power to North Korea. Over the weekend, the United States flew two strategic bombers over the Korean Peninsula, alongside fighter jets from South Korean and Japan. And for years, with mixed results, the United States has targeted the North’s missile program with cyberattacks. Trump administration officials said Mr. Tillerson was increasingly concerned that the recent North Korean advances, especially its missiles’ range, were driving the United States to a binary choice: Accept a North with nuclear weapons that can target American cities, or head toward a military confrontation.

"WASHINGTON — The White House has engaged in a slow-motion purge of hard-line officials at the National Security Council in recent weeks, angering conservatives who complain that the foreign policy establishment is reasserting itself over a president who had promised a new course. The latest to go was Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who ran the N.S.C.’s intelligence division and, like others who have left, was originally appointed by Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser. Mr. Flynn resigned in February after it was disclosed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about a telephone call with Russia’s ambassador. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster succeeded Mr. Flynn and has slowly tried to move out some of Mr. Flynn’s appointees. He initially tried to fire Mr. Cohen-Watnick earlier this year, only to be rebuffed by Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. But Mr. Kushner dropped his opposition this week, according to someone with knowledge of the decision. A fierce Trump loyalist, Mr. Cohen-Watnick drew attention when he and another White House official briefed Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on classified intelligence reports revealing that American intelligence agencies had conducted incidental surveillance of Mr. Trump’s transition team. The briefing was intended to bolster Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama ordered phones tapped at Trump Tower. Mr. Cohen-Watnick’s resignation was announced by the White House late Wednesday. “General McMaster appreciates the good work accomplished in the N.S.C.’s intelligence directorate under Ezra Cohen’s leadership,” a spokesman said in a statement. “He has determined that, at this time, a different set of experiences is best suited to carrying that work forward. General McMaster is confident that Ezra will make many further significant contributions to national security in another position in the administration.” His departure follows several others last month. Tera Dahl, the deputy chief of staff at the N.S.C. and a former writer for Breitbart News, which was run by Mr. Bannon before he joined the White House staff, left for a post at the United States Agency for International Development.

"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — A Taliban suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into a NATO convoy in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Wednesday, killing two American soldiers, the Pentagon said. Zia Durani, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar, said the convoy had come under attack while traveling in the area of Shorandam, which lies on the main road from Kandahar Airfield, one of the largest American bases in the country. “The area is cordoned off by the coalition forces,” he said. “We are not aware of their casualties.” An initial American statement said there had been casualties among the convoy. Later, a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, confirmed that two Americans had been killed. At the scene of the attack, at least four helicopters landed to evacuate those hurt, and firefighters arrived to extinguish one of the armored vehicles that was in flames. Local officials said two coalition force members had been killed and three wounded. “I heard a loud explosion and then saw one of the armored vehicles in flames,” said Janan Agha, who lives nearby. “Then the road was blocked and the helicopters arrived.” As Taliban violence has worsened around the country, the 8,700 American troops who remain in Afghanistan as part of the NATO mission have been trying to support Afghan security forces, which are increasingly in distress. Eight American soldiers have been killed by enemy fire this year. President Trump is mulling whether to send an additional few thousand troops. Kandahar, once the seat of Taliban power, had remained relatively quiet in recent years even as the Taliban made inroads in surrounding provinces. But in recent weeks, the insurgents have intensified their attacks in the province, inflicting heavy casualties on Afghan forces. In western Afghanistan, officials said the toll of a bombing Tuesday at a Shiite mosque had increased to 32 killed and 66 hurt. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, in the city of Herat, according to the group’s information agency. The attack was the fifth this year against Shiite places of worship. Four of those attacks have happened in Herat Province, which borders Iran, and one in Kabul. Two of them have been claimed by the Islamic State’s regional branch. “This attack deliberately targeting civilians at prayer can have no justification whatsoever,” said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the United Nations secretary general’s special representative for Afghanistan.

"To the Editor: Re “Police Criticize Trump for Urging Officers Not to Be ‘Too Nice’ in Handling Suspects” (news article, July 30): In a race to the bottom for immorality and unethical conduct, President Trump encouraged police officers to use brutal methods when apprehending suspected criminals. His comments, at a gathering of police officers on Long Island, provoked a firestorm of criticism from police chiefs across the country. The Suffolk County Police Department issued a scathing criticism of Mr. Trump’s comments: “As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners.” Really? I seem to recall the chief of police in Suffolk County being sent to federal prison last year for brutalizing a prisoner, and the Latino community on Long Island has been suffering untold abuse at the hands of police officers for years. One criminal defense attorney in Suffolk County is quoted in your article saying he may use the Trump video in future trials, because it “exemplifies the mind-set and today’s culture” in law enforcement on Long Island. Mr. Trump, all suspects are presumed innocent unless proven guilty. That is the foundation of our system of jurisprudence. In an effort to mitigate the public outcry, Mr. Trump said he was just joking. JAGJIT SINGH, LOS ALTOS, CALIF. "
"President Trump’s Justice Department has hardly been worthy of its name. It has retreated from meaningful police reform, argued on behalf of state laws that suppress minority voting rights, directed prosecutors to seek harsh sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, and extended the federal government’s power to seize the property of innocent Americans. Each of these steps disproportionately and systematically burdens people of color, denying them their constitutional rights and widening the racial divides that this country has struggled for so long to close. The Justice Department reportedly plans to open a new front in its assault on civil rights: higher education. According to a stunning document obtained by The New York Times, the department is seeking lawyers to oppose “intentional race-based discrimination” in college admissions. This is a signal that the administration could be preparing to attack affirmative action, although the Justice Department denies this is the case. If this tactic were to succeed, it would be a severe blow to racial justice. Affirmative action has proved to be one of the most effective tools for expanding opportunity and promoting diversity for students of color. Race-conscious admissions policies have made campuses across the country more representative of our society. In doing so, they have helped remedy inequality created by centuries of discrimination. "
"WASHINGTON — The end came quickly for one of the costliest covert action programs in the history of the C.I.A. During a White House briefing early last month, the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, recommended to President Trump that he shut down a four-year-old effort to arm and train Syrian rebels. The president swiftly ended the program. The rebel army was by then a shell, hollowed out by more than a year of bombing by Russian planes and confined to ever-shrinking patches of Syria that government troops had not reconquered. Critics in Congress had complained for years about the costs — more than $1 billion over the life of the program — and reports that some of the C.I.A.-supplied weapons had ended up in the hands of a rebel group tied to Al Qaeda further sapped political support for the program. While critics of Mr. Trump have argued that he ended the program to curry favor with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, there were in fact dim views of the effort in both the Trump and Obama White Houses — a rare confluence of opinion on national security policy. The shuttering of the C.I.A. program, one of the most expensive efforts to arm and train rebels since the agency’s program arming the mujahedeen in Afghanistan during the 1980s, has forced a reckoning over its successes and failures. Opponents say it was foolhardy, expensive and ineffective. Supporters say that it was unnecessarily cautious, and that its achievements were remarkable given that the Obama administration had so many restrictions on it from the start, which they say ultimately ensured its failure. The program did have periods of success, including in 2015 when rebels using tank-destroying missiles, supplied by the C.I.A. and also Saudi Arabia, routed government forces in northern Syria. But by late 2015 the Russian military offensive in Syria was focusing squarely on the C.I.A.-backed fighters battling Syrian government troops. Many of the fighters were killed, and the fortunes of the rebel army reversed. "

The newsletter originally published these personal stories last week. What is your earliest experience dealing with race? We partnered this week with Youth Radio, an award-winning news network based in Oakland, Calif., to ask that question of teenagers from across the country. They told us what happened to them, how they reacted and how the encounter changed them. Here are four such stories: Riley Lockett, 16, Youth Radio Oakland, Calif. Black About two months ago, I was walking to the BART station from school, sipping on soda and listening to a podcast when I noticed a blue uniform following me like a shadow. It was a white police officer. He scanned me as if he were the Terminator, trying to see if I posed a threat. I had never been stopped by a cop before. But I wasn’t scared or even nervous. I was prepared. My mother was always gearing me up for something: a good education, future job security and, most of all, institutionalized racism. Every time we passed a police car, she would drill my sister and me on what to do if and when a police officer stops us. We would begrudgingly repeat what our superior said: “Maintain eye contact, stand straight, speak when spoken to, no sudden movements.” As children, we never understood why she grilled us like that. Then, when I was 12, Trayvon Martin was killed. Even though it wasn’t a cop who killed him, I started to comprehend what she was preparing us for. Although we live in a quiet suburb of Oakland, we are in a city where a police officer is usually seen as more of a threat than a friend. As a young black man, I know an officer of the law can shoot me no matter where I am — and maybe especially in the middle of Orinda, the mostly white city where I was being stopped for the first time.

"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Wednesday said it was searching for Civil Rights Division lawyers to investigate a single complaint involving Asian-American students in a college admissions affirmative-action case. In a statement, the department sought to play down its recruitment of Civil Rights Division lawyers for what it had billed in an internal announcement as work on “investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions.” The Justice statement was responding to news articles on Tuesday about the project to scrutinize affirmative-action admissions policies that seek to maintain diverse student bodies by giving an edge to members of disadvantaged or underrepresented groups, like black or Latino students, over other applicants with comparable or better test scores. The New York Times first reported on an internal announcement for employees to be detailed to work on that project, framing it as apparently being about hunting for practices deemed to discriminate against white people. A Washington Post article about the project cited an unnamed official who also described the project in such terms. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, said on Wednesday that news media reports about the investigation were “inaccurate.” The department had refused to provide details about the project on Tuesday. Ms. Flores said the personnel announcement sought volunteers “to investigate one admissions complaint” filed on behalf of Asian-Americans who alleged racial discrimination in “a university’s admission policy and practices.” "
"Through its 114-year history, Harley-Davidson has taken on numerous contenders intent on dethroning it as the dominant American motorcycle maker. So far, it has a perfect record. But Harley now faces perhaps its most trying challenge in decades. Polaris, an established American company with manufacturing know-how and a revered motorcycle brand in Indian, is quickly making big strides. Polaris surprised the industry in January when it announced that it would shut its homegrown motorcycle brand, Victory, and focus entirely on Indian, a company it bought in 2011. So far, the move seems like a smart one. Indian’s sales grew 17 percent in the second quarter of this year, while Harley’s sales shrank nearly 7 percent. Overall sales for large-displacement bikes, the kind that Harley specializes in, shrank 9 percent in the second quarter of this year. Even with those results, Harley’s grip on the overall market remains strong, holding a market share that hovers around 50 percent for big bikes, handily eclipsing Indian’s single-digit slice. But the Indian surge is striking in that it counters the overall market’s downward drift. To some degree, the rapid rise is a result of lessons learned from 18 years of building the Victory brand. “That was the school of hard knocks,” said Scott Wine, chief executive of Polaris Industries. “Indian’s share of its segment is already higher than Victory’s was.” "
"Well, that look didn’t last long. After a very brief 10-day interlude of in-your-face bluster draped in Loro Piana tailoring courtesy of Anthony Scaramucci’s showmanship, which replaced Mike Dubke’s — well, what? Does anyone have any memory of his affect? Me neither. The White House communications team has reverted to a subtler, but no less notable, style. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was promoted to press secretary when Sean Spicer resigned because of Mr. Scaramucci’s appointment (neither Aaron — Spelling or Sorkin — could make this up), is now the de facto public face of the West Wing. Indeed, she has an evermore visible role now that she is out of the shadow of the Me First! Mooch, and on-camera press briefings have been reinstated. Instead of Mr. Scaramucci’s Breitling Avenger and mirrored women’s Oakleys (if you were designing the accessories of a character described as a “self-made nakedly ambitious and aggressive member of the wannabe 1 percent,” this is what you might choose), there is her no-loose-threads but equally no-logo, Crayola-colored persona. You could read the optics as the triumph of glossed-up accessibility over unabashed aspiration, but it’s probably more accurate to see the development as yet another example of what it means to dress the part in this administration, and why it matters. Take the distraction of Mr. Scaramucci out of the picture and Ms. Sanders still presents a very different image from her predecessor, who was ridiculed for his ill-fitting suits, frumpy ties and American flag pin discombobulation. Not that she put it that way exactly. “When speaking for the president you always try to look your best — some days you do better than others,” is what she emailed. With a smiley face. "
"The Trump administration is preparing to start a project involving “investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions,” according to a document obtained by The New York Times. It remains unclear how broad the effort will be. The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it was looking at a single complaint involving the treatment of Asian-American applicants by one university, but the internal document suggested that affirmative action programs at multiple colleges could be under scrutiny. Readers responded in droves on nytimes.com and across social media, including on The Times’s Facebook page, in Twitter posts and on Reddit. Some where aghast at what they perceived as a Trump administration attempt to target minorities, while others lauded him for exposing what they said were murky and unfair college admissions standards. The news provoked a fierce debate on Twitter when #AffirmativeAction became a national trending topic early Wednesday. Here are comments, some edited for length and clarity. Several minorities shared stories about what they perceived as common misconceptions about affirmative action and race-based admissions policies.

"To the Editor: “When Progressives Embrace Hate,” by Bari Weiss (Opinion, nytimes.com, Aug. 1), perpetuates a flawed narrative that is dangerous for many reasons, most fundamentally because it threatens to divide and distract progressives at a time when we need to stand united. It frames challenging discussions that our movement must continue to embrace — conversations about struggle and liberation, about inclusion and understanding — as hateful or taboo. Ms. Weiss is endorsing a sensational alt-right attack that aims to discredit the Women’s March movement and its leaders and to derail the progress we have made since January. Her article is a distraction at a critical moment when rights are being stripped from vulnerable communities every day. The election of Donald Trump was a wake-up call for so many; it revealed an American dystopia that communities on the margin have endured and fought against for generations. The Women’s March united millions around the United States and demonstrated the collective power of women to create transformative social change. You may not agree with one of us or any of us, and that’s O.K. But together we are weaving the social fabric so needed to protect us as the Trump agenda advances. The Women’s March has always been about coming together for one another’s collective liberation and not just showing up for issues that directly affect us. We are a movement made up of many people with different opinions, ideas and experiences. As a cis-heterosexual white woman new to feminist activism, I found that there were times in planning the January march that were uncomfortable, and times that even with as much empathy as I could muster, I couldn’t relate to someone else’s point of view. That is the nature of a movement as inclusive and intersectional as ours. Discomfort is often necessary for growth. It is because of these differences, not in spite of them, that I stand in solidarity with my fellow organizers Carmen Perez, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory. We are a movement grounded in love for all people, but especially for the vulnerable, the oppressed and the marginalized. For now, critics like Ms. Weiss are just critics from their seats. Until they get up, listen and do the work to understand those whose feelings have been shaped by injustices, they will remain apologists for the status quo, racist ideology and the white nationalist patriarchy.

"WASHINGTON — The Senate on Thursday gave final approval to legislation to finance the Food and Drug Administration, clearing the measure for President Trump and tapping drug manufacturers once again to help pay for the federal review of prescription drugs and medical devices. The 94-to-1 vote came just hours after the Senate passed a separate bill expanding access to experimental treatments for people with terminal illnesses. This bill, the Right to Try Act, will now go to the House, where more than three dozen lawmakers have endorsed similar legislation. Mr. Trump is expected to sign the bill reauthorizing user fees to pay for the review of medical devices, brand-name drugs, generic drugs and biosimilars, which are copycat versions of costly biologic drugs made from living organisms. The House approved the user fee bill by voice vote on July 12. The vote on Thursday capped an often frustrating seven months for Republicans, who had hoped to churn out reams of conservative legislation with their control of both chambers and the White House. Since the failure of the Senate’s health care repeal bill last week, lawmakers have seemed resigned to more incremental successes. “We’re passing critical legislation, we’re confirming nominees to important positions,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said from the Senate floor on Thursday, citing a series of veterans bills and the confirmation this week of a new F.B.I. director, Christopher A.

"WASHINGTON — As America’s stock markets have reached record highs, they have had few louder cheerleaders than President Trump. “Highest Stock Market EVER,” he said on Twitter on Monday. Before the stock exchanges’ opening bell on Tuesday, Mr. Trump pointed out in a tweet that the Dow Jones industrial index’s recent surge started just after he was elected. (He also lamented, incorrectly, that the press was downplaying that fact: “Mainstream media seldom mentions!”) And on Thursday, Mr. Trump made clear that he thinks he deserves credit for the latest record high, tweeting, “That doesn’t just happen!” The Dow Jones average closed at another record high Thursday. But it was not long ago that Mr. Trump, as a presidential candidate bent on casting the economy as a disaster, said that the stock market was a bubble that should make investors wary. In the early days of his candidacy, Mr. Trump assailed the economic recovery as a mirage and mused about a potential conspiracy that was being plotted between Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, and President Barack Obama. The theory was that she was keeping interest rates low so that the president would not leave office as another recession began. "

HYDERABAD, INDIA To the Editor: Attorney General Jeff Sessions is attempting to set the clock back to the 1950s. In Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court described education as “the very foundation of good citizenship.” The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of promoting a diverse student body as a compelling state interest. In the Grutter v. Bollinger (2003) decision, the justices noted, “Major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today’s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas and viewpoints.” Mr. Sessions should scrap his race-baiting proposal.

"TEHRAN — President Hassan Rouhani, endorsed by Iran’s supreme leader on Thursday with a nationally televised cheek-kiss, is starting his second term under newly intense pressure from both hard-line opponents and many of his own reform-minded supporters. His brother had to be bailed out from prison after a July arrest on corruption charges that some experts see as political payback for the president’s re-election. A key oil deal Mr. Rouhani negotiated with a French company has led to accusations that he is selling the country off to foreign interests. President Trump has just signed into law new sanctions that undermine the signature achievement of Mr. Rouhani’s first term, the nuclear agreement. Now, as Iran prepares for his second inauguration on Saturday, some of the forces that helped give Mr. Rouhani a 24 million-vote mandate in May are concerned he will not fulfill his promise of appointing women and young politicians to his 18-member cabinet, and instead is running nominations by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “We supported him during the campaign, but now there is no place for us,” said Jila Baniyaghoob, a women’s rights advocate, who said she was informed 10 days ago that there would be no female ministers in the cabinet. “Clearly, Mr. Rouhani does not believe in the capabilities of women,” she added. “This is so disappointing.” The reform-minded Mr. Rouhani has always occupied a precarious position leading a country that is governed both by a religious ruler and a democratically elected president and parliament. But experts say this is a particularly challenging moment. Closed in by rivals in Iran’s other centers of power — the supreme leader, influential clergy members and the judiciary — Mr. Rouhani can steer debate but not call the shots. Mr. Khamenei, who often publicly opposes the president but has supported him behind the scenes on key issues like the nuclear agreement and foreign outreach, is far more interested in economic growth than social change.

"When the Chicago Transit Authority chose a Chinese joint venture to build the city a new fleet of rail cars for $1.3 billion, the manufacturer’s vow to construct an assembly plant on the Southeast Side helped tilt the scale in its favor. “This is a classic win-win for Chicago,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said last year when he announced the contract and the 170 jobs that the factory would create, in addition to training programs and community hiring. To Bombardier Transit Corporation, the losing bidder, however, the hiring sweetener was proof of what it called a “rigged” and possibly illegal procurement process that denied “jobs to fellow Americans outside of Chicago.” In this case, it was referring to Americans who live in Plattsburgh, N.Y., and work at Bombardier’s sprawling assembly and test center there. Over the last decade, more and more cities, on the coasts and in the heartland, have tried to leverage their buying power to fuel economic development through local hiring provisions on public projects that favor veterans, residents and low-income workers. But these efforts have been bedeviled by political, economic and legal challenges that have divided business, union and political allies. Now the Trump administration may rescind an Obama-era initiative that allows hiring preferences on transportation and construction projects in states like New York, California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, a prospect that has alarmed advocates of such programs. “Why not let cities and states innovate to create the good American jobs that the administration has been clamoring for?” said Madeline Janis, the executive director of Jobs to Move America, a coalition of faith, labor and other groups that want transportation funding to benefit local communities. “I don’t understand why they would want to cancel the program.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump engaged in contentious telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in his early days in office, pressing them to make concessions to satisfy his own domestic political needs in exchanges so sharp that he said talking to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was more pleasant. Transcripts of his calls with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia confirm previous news reports of tension during the conversations in January, just a week after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and show a new president eager to fulfill campaign promises while developing relationships with foreign counterparts. The transcripts, assembled from the notes of aides listening to the calls, were obtained by The Washington Post, which posted them online on Thursday morning. With Mr. Peña Nieto, Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened to impose a stiff border tax to keep out Mexican products and complained about “pretty tough hombres” who were bringing so many drugs over the border that they had even made New Hampshire “a drug-infested den.” The biggest point of contention came as the president insisted that the Mexican president stop saying publicly that he would not pay for the wall that Mr. Trump had promised to build on the border between the two countries. “If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,” Mr. Trump said. The call with Mr. Turnbull was even more testy as the president complained about what he called “a disgusting deal” that Australia had sealed with President Barack Obama in which the United States agreed to consider accepting up to 1,250 economic refugees. Mr. Trump complained that he would look “so foolish” doing so after barring refugees from the rest of the world. "
"In June, Zack Exley, a political organizer and a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, published a report on “Black Pigeon Speaks,” a political commentator on YouTube. In Exley’s judgment, B.P.S. is emblematic of a marginal but ascendant sort of YouTube figure — a type that is becoming a meaningful force in the practice of politics online. B.P.S. has, by any objective standard, a significant and engaged audience; at the moment, he has about 215,000 followers, and his uploads have been viewed more than 25 million times. In an introductory video, he describes himself as something like a pundit or an analyst: “I attempt to make sense out of the increasingly nonsensical world we all share,” he says of his channel. “I try and be only as offensive as I need to be.” His videos are unhurried, heavy on explanation and argument, regularly stretching over the 10-minute mark. And, as Exley notes, his politics skew right. Hard right: Like its fellow mega-platforms Twitter and Facebook, YouTube is an enormous engine of cultural production and a host for wildly diverse communities. But like the much smaller Tumblr (which has long been dominated by lively and combative left-wing politics) or 4chan (which has become a virulent and effective hard-right meme factory) YouTube is host to just one dominant native political community: the YouTube right. This community takes the form of a loosely associated group of channels and personalities, connected mostly by shared political instincts and aesthetic sensibilities. They are monologuists, essayists, performers and vloggers who publish frequent dispatches from their living rooms, their studios or the field, inveighing vigorously against the political left and mocking the “mainstream media,” against which they are defined and empowered. They deplore “social justice warriors,” whom they credit with ruining popular culture, conspiring against the populace and helping to undermine “the West.” They are fixated on the subjects of immigration, Islam and political correctness. They seem at times more animated by President Trump’s opponents than by the man himself, with whom they share many priorities, if not a style. Some of their leading figures are associated with larger media companies, like Alex Jones’s Infowars or Ezra Levant’s Rebel Media. Others are independent operators who found their voices in the medium. To the extent that these personalities challenge their viewers, it’s to commit even more deeply to what their intuitions already tell them is true — not despite those opinions’ rejection from mainstream liberal thought, but because of it. Theirs is a potent and time-tested strategy. Unpopular arguments can benefit from being portrayed as forbidden, and marginal ideas are more effectively sold as hidden ones. The zealous defense of ideas for which audiences believe they’re seen as stupid, cruel or racist is made possible with simple inversion: Actually, it’s everyone else who is stupid, cruel or racist, and their “consensus” is a conspiracy intended to conceal the unspoken feelings of a silent majority. Trump has developed an intuition for this kind of audience cultivation; so have countless pundits, broadcasters, salespeople and politicians of different populist political stripes. But Exley, in his final analysis of B.P.S., points to an especially apt historical parallel: conservative talk radio. “Fixated as they are with Fox News,” he says, “liberals, scholars and pundits have failed to give talk radio — which is almost wholly conservative — its due, even though it’s now nearly three decades old and reaches millions each day. They now stand to miss a new platform that, so far, is also dominated by the right wing.” The radio comparison is a useful one. Talk radio’s growth followed decades of deregulation and disruptive opportunity: the rise of FM radio during the late 1960s and ’70s, the abandonment by music stations of the low-fidelity AM band and the 1987 revocation of the Fairness Doctrine, a rule through which the Federal Communications Commission attempted to regulate a sort of balance into content produced by licensed broadcasters. The subsequent rise of conservative talk radio, typified by superstars like Rush Limbaugh, had enormous influence and continues to attract millions of listeners a day, well into the internet era. Its style, once novel, is now familiar. There’s the casual, knowing rapport with listeners; the baggy, multihour shows, which double as news digests; the moralizing monologues that transition seamlessly into jokey rants and asides. But something about the medium seems to favor the right. Repeated, strenuous attempts by liberal broadcasters to replicate conservative talk radio formats have not fared well. Air America, which was launched in 2004 and shuttered in 2010, helped propel talent into other venues — Rachel Maddow to television, Al Franken to the Senate — but failed as a sustainable answer to combative conservative talk radio. AM opened a space for reaction, but seemed to have no room for the counterreaction. YouTube’s political context is similar in some notable ways: the value it places on personalities; its reliance on monologue and repetition; its isolation and immunity from direct challenge; its promise to let listeners in on the real, secret story. Both are obsessed with persuasion and conversion, combined with a giddy disbelief at the sheer stupidity of liberals, who — and this is part of the fun — aren’t listening. Comparing YouTube to talk radio is also a useful reminder of how potent a medium can become while still appearing marginal to those who don’t care for it or know much about it. For listeners of conservative talk radio — where right-wing populist rhetoric has flourished for decades, and where hosts can get away with authoritarian flirtations and xenophobic rhetoric that mainstream politicians can’t — the rise of Donald Trump was somewhat less of a surprise than it was for many others. The YouTube right may be comparatively marginal and ragtag, but it’s also comparatively young. If talk radio primed listeners for Trump’s style and anticipated the American right’s current obsessions, the YouTube right is acquainting viewers with a more international message, attuned to a global revival of explicitly race-and-religion-based, blood-and-soil nationalism. Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars, 35, is perhaps the archetypal YouTube-right vlogger; he has nearly a million followers, and his videos have been viewed more than 215 million times. He has in the last month published videos with titles including “Staged Video Shows ‘Refugee’ Fake Drowning,” “Finsbury Mosque Terror: What They’re NOT Telling You,” “The Truth about Refugees” and “Why Leftists Submit to Terror.” The scripts for these videos are straightforward nativist polemics, with a particular focus on Europe — Watson is from Northern England — delivered in a relentlessly insistent tone, and quite close to the camera. Watson posts extended “roasts” of his political villains, as well as rants that betray a peculiar blend of self-taught reaction: against pop culture, broadly, but also against “modern architecture” and “modern art.” If one video sums up what a receptive viewer might take from subscribing to his channel, it’s “Some Cultures are Better than Others.” Watson frequently suggests that ideologies like his represent a sort of new counterculture and boasts about the right wing’s dominance on the YouTube platform. “Twitter is a tiny echo chamber,” he tweeted earlier this year. “I’m not sure the left understand the monumental ass-whupping being dished out to them on YouTube.” And in terms of sheer numbers and visibility on the platform, the YouTube right is substantial. Among the wide range of pundits, ideologues and highly YouTube-specific personalities, a few archetypal examples appear. "
"WASHINGTON — In the first Kennedy Center Honors during the Trump administration, one awardee, Norman Lear, the television producer known for progressive political activism, said he would forgo the White House reception in advance of his award for lifelong artistic achievement. Another honoree, Gloria Estefan, the Cuban-American singer, said she would take a different approach and would attend the reception — as an opportunity to tell President Trump of the contributions immigrants have made to the nation. In an era of immigration crackdowns, racial tensions and budgetary battles over eliminating arts endowments, this year’s Kennedy Center honorees appear to be divided on how best to respond to the honor. The 40th annual award recipients also include the first hip-hop honoree, LL Cool J, the musician and record producer Lionel Richie and the dancer and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade. In keeping with tradition, Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, will host a White House reception in December for honorees before appearing alongside them at one of Washington’s red-carpet events, the Kennedy Center Honors gala. In an interview, Mr. Lear said he had already informed the Kennedy Center that he would forgo the White House reception, a rare move in the Honors’ 39-year history. "
"HUNTINGTON, W.Va. — Bragging about keeping his promises on immigration, the economy, the environment and crime, President Trump celebrated on Thursday with a raucous West Virginia crowd as the state’s Democratic governor announced that he will switch to the Republican Party. With Gov. Jim Justice by his side, Mr. Trump hailed stock market records and the growth of coal income in West Virginia. And he delivered a lengthy critique of the federal investigations of his campaign’s ties to Russia, calling the matter “a fake story that is demeaning to all of us.” His comments came just hours after reports that a grand jury had been impaneled in the Russia investigation and that subpoenas had been issued. “Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign; there never were,” Mr. Trump told the crowd in a midsize rural town that drew thousands of supporters from across Appalachia, a region that gave Mr. Trump some of the largest margins of his election. “We didn’t win because of Russia; we won because of you,” he said. “Are there any Russians here tonight? Any Russians?” The president also demanded that Congress pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, urging the crowd to call their lawmakers so they will have “the guts” to take a vote. He vowed to reduce taxes, continue to crack down on immigrants, and rebuild the country’s infrastructure. The crowd welcomed the announcements, cheering heartily when Mr. Justice officially abandoned the Democratic Party, and repeatedly applauding for Mr. Trump, waving “Women for Trump” and “Make America Great Again” signs. Mr. Justice said he would officially change his voter registration on Friday. “I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking, today I will tell you as West Virginians that I can’t help you anymore being a Democrat governor,” he said. He imagined his mother, who has passed away, saying, “Jimmy, it’s about damn time you came to your senses.” "
"SHANGHAI — Alibaba has been battling the perception that it is a marketplace for fakes for years. On Thursday, it made some headway, resolving a dispute with the luxury goods giant Kering. The companies said they had resolved their differences, and Kering, which owns brands including Gucci and Saint Laurent, said it would withdraw a 2015 lawsuit charging that counterfeit goods had been sold from the Chinese e-commerce giant’s website. They said in a statement that they would establish a task force to share information and work with law enforcement to protect Kering’s brands. The companies will also make use of Alibaba’s technology to seek out fakes. The resolution is a victory for Alibaba, which has been on a charm offensive outside China. The company’s founder, Jack Ma, hosted a conference in Detroit this year as part of efforts to enlist more American vendors for its platforms. Mr. Ma has also met with  President  Trump. Alibaba has long faced accusations that its sales platforms harbor vendors selling fakes, and it has worked hard to push against that depiction. The resolution of the suit with Kering is likely to be just one part of a broader effort by the company to remove itself from the list of “notorious markets” for counterfeit goods compiled by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The company had itself removed from the list four years ago, but was then added back last year. Kering sued Alibaba and its financial arm, Ant Financial, in 2015 over the prevalence of counterfeit goods on its sites. It also filed a short-lived lawsuit against Alibaba in 2014. Unlike Amazon, much of Alibaba’s e-commerce site is dominated by marketplaces run by third-party vendors. The company has argued that it can be tricky to perfectly police such a bewildering number of small online shops, selling all manner of goods. Its situation is also made difficult by the widespread prevalence of fake goods in China more generally. Alibaba has said it is using increasingly sophisticated technology, including artificial intelligence, to track down fakes. In a report submitted to the United States trade representative last year, the Chinese company said that its systems could scan 10 million product listings a day. These checks had led it to take down 380 million suspect listings, it said, in a 12-month period. Still, small- and medium-size businesses have said it can be hard to report fakes to Alibaba, and that its systems can be clunky and prone to errors. "
"Innovation comes at a price. Because of expenses incurred by various investments in its growth, Sotheby’s has seen its net income decrease by 14 percent to $76.9 million over the last three months, compared with $89 million for the same period a year earlier, this auction house announced in its earnings report on Thursday. At the same time, there was evidence that some of Sotheby’s changes have begun to pay off; revenues were up 5 percent for the quarter over the same period last year — to $314.9 million from $298.7 million — and 24 percent for the half. And Sotheby’s consolidated sales — which include artworks sold at auction, from inventory and in private transactions — were up 2 percent for the second quarter and up 4 percent for the first half of 2017. David Schick, the lead luxury analyst at Consumer Edge Research, who follows Sotheby’s, commended the auction house’s “clearer operational modernization.” The auction house’s focus on its private sales showed particularly encouraging results — up 34 percent to $333.8 million for the first half of 2017 over the prior year and up 52 percent from the first half of 2016. Moreover, Sotheby’s had more private-sales transactions in the first half of 2017 than it did during that period the preceding four years. Despite skepticism about its $85 million acquisition of the art advisory business Art Agency, Partners last year, Sotheby’s clients have since increased more than 20 percent. And in its new business of advising artists and artist estates, Sotheby’s said it has signed up 10 new clients. And amid uncertainty about what a Trump presidency would mean for the art market, American buying was up 26 percent over a year ago for the first half of 2017, displacing Asia as the largest purchasing region by dollar volume (Asia buying grew 3 percent). Continental Europe grew by 18 percent. Coming off a period in which auction houses struggled to secure top consignments as sellers were cautionary, high-priced lots made a comeback. The segment of artworks priced above $1 million increased 5 percent and the total average hammer price for those lots was up 17 percent. In addition, the number of buyers in that same $1 million-plus group rose 10 percent, with sellers up 13 percent. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said late Wednesday that it would not delay an Obama-era regulation on smog-forming pollutants from smokestacks and tailpipes, a move that environmental groups hailed as a victory. The Environmental Protection Agency decision came a day after 16 state attorneys general, all Democrats, filed a lawsuit challenging the delay with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It reversed a decision that Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, made in June to put off an Oct. 1 deadline for designating which areas of the country met new ozone standards. In announcing the ozone policy change, the agency appeared to leave the door open to extending the deadline again. But, officials said, the agency will work with states to help them deliver the needed information. “Under previous administrations, E.P.A. would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation,” Mr. Pruitt said in a statement. “We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously. We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously.” Ozone, a smog-causing gas that is formed when chemical emissions from power plants, factories and cars are exposed to heat and sunlight, has been linked to childhood asthma, lower infant birth weights and lung disease. Environmental advocates welcomed the agency’s policy shift on ozone but said they would continue to insist on vigorous enforcement of pollution laws. “Pruitt’s lawless attempt to delay stronger ozone-pollution protections would have put thousands of lives at risk,” said Lori Ann Burd, director of the environmental program at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “It’s disturbing how much pressure it took to get this common-sense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe.” In October 2015 the Obama administration set a new national standard for ozone of 70 parts per billion, down from 75 parts per billion. It was far less strict than manufacturers had feared, but industry leaders still criticized the rule as overly burdensome. Mr. Pruitt initially sought to delay for a year the requirement that states submit measurements of their 2015 ozone levels, citing a clause in the Clean Air Act that allows such a pause if the agency needs to collect more information. The agency argued it had to evaluate “a host of complex issues” before designating which states had met the standard. The move is one of several steps taken by Mr. Pruitt to relax or delay environmental regulations issued by the Obama administration under the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction is by Brooks Barnes, our Hollywood reporter based in Los Angeles. Reginald Nelson moved to Los Angeles in 2004 to become a star. Yes, his dream was a cliché. But he figured he had a better shot than most people. He had studied theater at Howard University with Taraji P. Henson, whose career was then taking off. While performing in Chicago, Mr. Nelson had become acquainted with David Schwimmer, the “Friends” alum and a founder of that city’s Lookingglass Theatre Company. Instead, Mr. Nelson ended up on Skid Row. “I was having a hard time getting attention in auditions,” Mr. Nelson said. “Then my mom got sick, and I was embarrassed to ask for help with the bills.” He added, “I slept on park benches and finally found the Union Rescue Mission, where I got some health care myself. By that point, I was clinically depressed.” That was 2014. Ready for the plot twist? In May, while still living at the mission, Mr. Nelson, 44, got a call on his cellphone from a former Howard classmate, Neil Lewis. They had not been in touch for years, but Mr. Lewis, who had found some traction as an actor, had unbelievable news. Remember that scripted podcast they created in 2010? BET wanted to buy it as source material for a possible TV series. Their old audio project, “The Primordials,” told the story of African deities living in contemporary New Orleans. Mr. Lewis and his lawyer confirmed the BET deal. A BET spokeswoman declined to comment. "
"As President Trump embraces a proposal to sharply cut immigration to the United States, supporters of the plan point to the example of Australia and its “merit-based” system for approving new immigrants. The plan Mr. Trump supports seeks to reduce immigration by curbing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country. As Mr. Trump told Congress earlier this year, “It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.” That approach — making sure new immigrants are not a burden on the country’s safety net and are able to prosper financially — is at the core of Australia’s immigration laws. Australia takes in more immigrants relative to its population than the United States. The country has two distinct systems: a points-based system, which favors people based on their English proficiency and the skills they have to fill needed jobs, and an employer-nomination system, which allows businesses to sponsor people for jobs. A White House official said on Wednesday that it had looked at both the Australian and Canadian immigration systems and “added things that made sense for America.” “One of the things I think is the most compelling about the Australian system is the efforts to make sure that immigrants are financially self-sufficient,” Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide, said in discussing the plan with reporters Wednesday.

"The Dow Jones industrial average has done it. The index has passed the 22,000 mark. And it has managed to do that in spite of disorder in Washington. “None of the soap opera in Washington matters,” said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty coatings and sealants like Rust-Oleum. “Nobody in business cares about who talked to who in Russia.” So what does Wall Street care about? Stronger global demand in heavy industries like mining, oil and gas, a weaker dollar and a light regulatory touch. Interest rates are still low and inflation is tame. And then there were strong earnings reports from the likes of Boeing and Caterpillar. Apple alone provided 49 points’ worth of ballast after a glowing earnings report sent its stock up 5 percent. President Trump anticipated that the Dow would cross that milestone on his preferred medium. But he didn’t set the record for biggest market gain among postwar presidents: Both George Bush and Barack Obama enjoyed bigger gains during the same periods of their administrations. Qatar Airways may have sought to gain a toehold in the United States by buying a 10 percent stake in American Airlines. The target company, spurning the approach, described the campaign as “puzzling at best and concerning at worst.” "
"What do the producers of “Game of Thrones,” Kathryn Bigelow and the painter Dana Schutz have in common? Each was recently at the center of a roiling controversy about what it means for white artists to make work about black people’s suffering. David Benioff and D. B. Weiss., the creators of “Game of Thrones,” recently announced their next project: a series for HBO called “Confederate,” which imagines life in the United States if slavery had never been abolished. The news triggered a firestorm on Twitter, with some people calling for the show’s cancellation. “Detroit,” a new film about racial oppression and police brutality during the 1960s, made by Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, has also caused controversy. When asked by Vanity Fair if she was the ideal person to tell this story, Bigelow said: “No. However, I’m able to tell this story.” Earlier this year, “Open Casket,” an impressionist rendering of the viciously beaten body of Emmet Till by the painter Dana Schutz, enraged some visitors to the Whitney Museum of American Art, where it was featured as part of the annual Biennial. And now protesters are calling for the I.C.A. in Boston to cancel a retrospective of Schutz’s work. Questions of who can tell stories about blackness, and specifically, black history and black pain, are being asked all over the place this summer, and we wanted to ask them, too. What right do these creators, who all happen to be white, have to tell black stories? And are these even black stories, or are they American stories? And what of artistic freedom and imagination? Are there instances when this work can be seen as a form of activism, or at the very least, a social good? Are there any criteria by which white creators can successfully make work about blackness? We may not have the answers, but we’re working our way toward some sense of clarity. From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.

"It seems impossible to imagine the most impoverished, backward communist regime in Asia, run by a madman and recovering from a crippling famine, should set out to build a long-range missile that could deliver a nuclear weapon all the way to the United States. And yet Mao Zedong’s China did it. In 1964, as today, Americans had trouble accepting the new reality of their vulnerability. United States officials were slow to realize that China was on the verge of testing a nuclear weapon that year, and later were surprised to learn that Beijing was not willing to settle for only short-range missiles that could strike neighbors like Japan. The scope of Mao’s ambition — to develop a thermonuclear weapon that could hit the United States — did not match American preconceptions of China. And so, collectively, we did not believe it. Over the past few years, North Korea has made every possible effort to indicate that, like Mao’s China, it was committed to developing a nuclear-armed intercontinental range ballistic missile. Starting in 2014, North Korea began testing missiles at a much faster pace than before. Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, began visiting defense industry plants all over the North, showing off newly built facilities and the new machine tools inside them. North Korea began releasing increasingly explicit pictures of its missile program, including some of new rocket engines and tests of the vehicle that would protect a nuclear weapon as it re-entered the atmosphere. North Korea hasn’t been coy. It showed off new types of intercontinental ballistic missiles in parades in 2012, 2013 and 2015. In March 2013, North Korean state media released pictures of Mr. Kim approving a nuclear targeting plan, illustrated with a graphic of the United States titled “Mainland Strike Plan.” A handful of targets were identified, including San Diego, Calif., where the Pacific Fleet is based; Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, where Air Force Global Strike Command is located, and Washington, D.C. In 2016, Mr. Kim posed with a shiny sphere, described as a North Korean nuclear warhead, placed next to an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. After each of these displays, the first question any reporter would ask me was, “What message do you think the North Koreans are trying to send?” "

President Trump has strained relations with a lot of people, but one group has never really wavered in its support: the leaders of the conservative movement. The White House has worked hard at cultivating and strengthening those ties, recognizing that it can’t afford to alienate a constituency that speaks for 36 percent of the electorate, according to Gallup. On Wednesday, the president gave his base something else to cheer about, embracing a proposal to halve legal immigration to the U.S. within a decade. Democrats and some Republicans quickly criticized the move. Discussion of the plan led to a fiery exchange between reporters and Stephen Miller, a policy adviser, at the White House news briefing. Watch it here. Separately, Mr. Trump signed legislation imposing more sanctions on Russia. But he said it included “clearly unconstitutional provisions,” leaving open the possibility that he might not enforce all of its measures. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump on Wednesday endorsed a proposal  to cut down on  legal immigration to the United States. The approach would favor admitting immigrants based on the merit of each applicant, the White House said. Jimmy Kimmel said the passage of sanctions against Russia is taking a toll on President Trump’s relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump has a new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, who served as secretary of homeland security. Seth Meyers said the president is trying to make a strong first impression — but maybe he’s trying a little too hard. The Justice Department announced that it would investigate policies deemed to discriminate against white applicants at universities.

"GALVESTON, Tex. — Adolfo Guerra, a landscaper in this port city on the Gulf of Mexico, remembers panicking as his co-worker vomited and convulsed after hours of mowing lawns in stifling heat. Other workers rushed to cover him with ice, and the man recovered. But for Mr. Guerra, 24, who spends nine hours a day six days a week doing yard work, the episode was a reminder of the dangers that exist for outdoor workers as the planet warms. “I think about the climate every day,” Mr. Guerra said, “because every day we work, and every day it feels like it’s getting hotter.” "
"For President Trump, 15 is the magic number. That’s the percentage at which he wants to cap the corporate tax rate, a steep cut from the current top rate of 35 percent and much lower than the ordinary income rates paid by many partnerships and small-business entities. When news reports indicated recently that the goal was more likely to be set at 20 percent, or even higher, the president swiftly doubled down on 15 percent in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. There’s no doubt that a cut to 15 percent would be big, bold and historic. It might even be the biggest cut ever in corporate tax rates, to use another superlative Mr. Trump is fond of invoking. It might do wonders for economic growth, level the competitive playing field, and encourage United States corporations to keep their headquarters in this country and invest trillions in cash currently stashed in offshore accounts. A 15 percent rate would take the United States from having the highest corporate tax rate among industrialized nations to having one of the lowest. Britain is moving to 17 percent, Canada’s federal rate has already gotten to 15 percent, and Ireland’s is at 12.5 percent. After last week’s collapse of health care legislation, many believe Republicans can’t afford to fail again, especially on what is widely considered their signature issue: taxes. As Scott A. Hodge, president of the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told me this week: “If the Republicans fail with tax reform, it would be truly catastrophic. It’s really all or nothing at this point.” "
"In the week since President Trump declared that transgender Americans would no longer be allowed in the military, some municipal officials have responded with an invitation: join our police force instead. Several cities — including Houston; Austin, Tex.; Aurora, Colo.; and Cincinnati — have encouraged transgender people to apply to their police departments. In Austin, San Diego, Seattle and other places, transgender officers already serve openly. “If you are dismissed from our military because of who you are, know that you are welcome in the city of Cincinnati and our police department,” Chris Seelbach, a city councilman, said at a protest last Wednesday in response to Mr. Trump’s announcement. Mr. Trump revealed his ban in a series of three tweets from 8:55 to 9:08 a.m. on July 26. By the evening, two cities in Texas — where state lawmakers have been engaged in a high-profile debate over whether transgender people should be allowed to use the public bathrooms of their choice — had declared themselves in opposition to the ban. Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, posted his own series of three tweets, inviting transgender people dismissed or rejected from the military to apply to the Austin Police Department. “If you’re qualified to keep our country safe you’re qualified to keep Austin safe,” he wrote, adding, “Austin is the safest big city in Texas partly because we know our differences make us a stronger community.” "

n the early spring of 1977, Larry Zottarelli, a 40-year-old computer engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, set out for Cape Canaveral, Fla., in his Toyota Corolla. A Los Angeles native, he had never ventured as far as Tijuana, but he had a per diem, and he liked to drive. Just east of Orlando, a causeway carried him over the Indian and Banana Rivers to a triangular spit of sand jutting into the Atlantic, where the Air Force keeps a base. His journey terminated at a cavernous military hangar. A fleet of JPL trucks made the trip under armored guard to the same destination. Their cargo was unwrapped inside the hangar high bay, a gleaming silo stocked with tool racks and ladder trucks. Engineers began to assemble the various pieces. Gradually, two identical spacecraft took shape. They were dubbed Voyager I and II, and their mission was to make the first color photographs and close-up measurements of Jupiter, Saturn and their moons. Then, if all went well, they might press onward — into uncharted territory. It took six months, working in shifts around the clock, for the NASA crew to reassemble and test the spacecraft. As the first launch date, Aug. 20, drew near, they folded the camera and instrument boom down against the spacecraft’s spindly body like a bird’s wing; gingerly they pushed it, satellite dish first, up inside a metal capsule hanging from the high bay ceiling. Once ‘‘mated,’’ the capsule and its cargo — a probe no bigger than a Volkswagen Beetle that, along with its twin, had nevertheless taken 1,500 engineers five years and more than $200 million to build — were towed to the launchpad. By T-minus two hours, a select few engineers, too nervous to sit down, stood at computers outside the high bay, overseeing the spacecraft telemetry. Elsewhere in the hangar, scientists, NASA brass from Washington and several dozen ‘‘nonessential’’ engineers — Zottarelli among them — huddled around TV monitors. At T-minus 30 seconds, the spacecraft’s engines roared to life, and many of the nonessentials took off running out of the room and toward the exit — ‘‘seven, six, five.’’ They burst out into the morning. Shielding their eyes, they peered across a flat expanse at smoke billowing on the horizon. Slowly and silently, the capsule rose out of the cloud, its rockets trailing flames. In an instant, there came a terrific boom as the sound waves from blastoff hit the hangar like a gong, ringing it as the spacecraft disappeared. Two weeks later, after the second launch, everyone headed home. The show was over — both spacecraft were performing flawlessly — but behind the scenes, the mission, on a tight budget, lagged in hiring the more than 200 computer engineers needed to shepherd the spacecraft through a planetary encounter. Many of those on the flight team were fresh out of college, running the most sophisticated electronics systems in the world. They had barely had a chance to jell, when, in April 1978, not yet halfway to Jupiter, Voyager 1 experienced a problem. Its scan platform, where the cameras and instruments are mounted, got stuck. "
"So much outcry about chaos at the White House. Who’s in? Who’s out? Yet we’ve failed to consider one important question. What happens to the Weeks? They’ve been such an administration highlight. Who can forget White House Infrastructure Week? Or Energy Week? Or the current American Dream Week, which the president celebrated by calling for a 50 percent cut in legal immigration? Reince Priebus was said to have been a big Week maven, and he’s been, um, disappeared. Which is why I’m sort of worried about the end of a great new national tradition. We still haven’t heard what the next Week is supposed to be. Do you think John Kelly got rid of them? That man cannot stop cleaning house. All modern presidents have promoted themes they want us to think about, but the current administration has been a pioneer in packaging things into Weeks and then staging lots of events to remind us about their topic. President Trump also generally proposes a bill on the same subject, which Congress promptly rejects. This happened even during Infrastructure Week — who among us doesn’t like infrastructure? But Trump hasn’t been able to get his act together on a package of projects, so he started the week off with a call for privatizing the air traffic control system, which the Senate commerce committee cheerfully vetoed.

"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — Right now, as you are reading this, Samuel L. Jackson is on a yacht in the Mediterranean, perhaps standing on the fantail, whacking golf balls into the deep, deep blue. “The golf balls are fish food, so they’re environmentally correct,” he said a few weeks ago, reassuringly. “And they fly great.” Each year, Mr. Jackson and his wife, the actress LaTanya Richardson, take a month to sail the Italian and French Riviera with a few close friends and a crew of 19. “We both get a chance to really just relax,” said one of those friends, Magic Johnson, calling in between clusters of meetings for his new job as president for basketball operations of the Los Angeles Lakers. “And if we want to hear the roar of the crowd, we get off the boat and walk around. It’s crazy to have both of us in Portofino. They don’t know who to start with.” In the Living Room at the Peninsula hotel here, Mr. Jackson, 68, didn’t inspire that sort of commotion. Dressed for a workout in blinding all white — ball cap, T-shirt, shorts, sneakers — he ordered a lobster roll but declined the bread plate. For decades, Mr. Jackson has been refining a delicate balance of working hard and hardly working. He is one of the highest-grossing box office stars ever, alongside Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman. His films include installments in the “Star Wars” and Marvel franchises, voice-overs in big-ticket animation, a political documentary, neo-kitsch action dramas and regular work in the ecosystems of Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino.

"Federal prosecutors are investigating Kushner Companies, the real estate firm owned by the family of Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, over its use of a program that grants visas to wealthy overseas investors. The authorities, in part, are looking into the role of Mr. Kushner’s sister, Nicole Meyer, according to a person familiar with the matter who confirmed the inquiry. The investigation centers on the real estate company’s use of the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to foreigners in exchange for a $500,000 investment. Critics say the program has weak oversight and lax rules. At a marketing event in May, Ms. Meyer promoted the company’s connections to the Trump administration as she courted Chinese investors for a pair of luxury apartment towers being built by the Kushner Companies in New Jersey. The project “means a lot to me and my entire family,” she told prospective investors at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing. Mr. Kushner gave up his role running the family company in January. He still owns a significant piece of the business. In a statement, Kushner Companies’ general counsel, Emily Wolf, said the company was cooperating with the authorities. "
"Faced with a new wave of asylum seekers crossing into Quebec from the United States, the Canadian authorities have opened a temporary welcome center with plenty of space to house them: Montreal’s Olympic Stadium. Refugees began arriving on Wednesday at the 56,000-seat stadium, where a public hall had been quickly transformed into a shelter with 150 cots and room for hundreds more, as well as internet service, locker room showers and concession stands for preparing food. The Quebec authorities said the number of asylum seekers crossing into the province skyrocketed in July, when around 1,500 arrived, up from 180 in July 2016. “We are stretched almost to the limit,” said Francine Dupuis, the spokeswoman for the Quebec government agency responsible for assisting new arrivals. The refugees are crossing at areas along the international border along Quebec, New York, Vermont and Maine. These are not official border crossings, which means they can skirt a 13-year-old agreement between the United States and Canada requiring asylum seekers to assert their claim in the country they arrive in first. Under the pact, the Safe Third Country Agreement, those who claim asylum at official border crossings must be denied refuge and sent back. But if they cross at unofficial entry points, the treaty does not apply, and they can seek asylum. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Here are today’s developments in the White House: President Trump blamed Congress for the country’s poor relationship with Russia, describing it on Twitter as “at an all-time & very dangerous low.” There was criticism from both parties over the immigration policy the White House announced its support for yesterday. It would cut legal immigration by half within a decade. And The Washington Post published transcripts of Mr. Trump’s contentious phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia after he took office. They were pieced together from the notes of aides listening to the calls. “This is the most unpleasant call all day,” he told Malcolm Turnbull of Australia during a Jan. 28 call, above. “Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.” And there was news about the inquiry into Russian election meddling. Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation, has issued subpoenas from a Washington-based grand jury, according to several lawyers involved in the case. "
"There’s a new game afoot. The federal government’s current emphasis on deporting undocumented immigrants — even those facing low-level charges — has, in effect, turned courthouses in New York State into arenas where practitioners of criminal law face off against enforcers of immigration law. In New York City, judges, defense lawyers and clients have been on high alert for months, watching to see if immigration enforcement officers, many in plain clothes, are in a courthouse. If a pair of people look suspicious, lawyers from the Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society send an internal email alert. Defendants duck into bathrooms or race to another floor. When officers for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, are thought to be in a courthouse, a sympathetic judge might reschedule a defendant’s appearance, or, in a seemingly perverse move, set bail that could send a defendant to Rikers Island — keeping the person out of ICE’s hands because the jail complex does not turn over undocumented immigrants to the agency. “I don’t want to be playing the cat and mouse game with federal authorities,” Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, said in an interview. State policy prohibits ICE officers from making arrests inside courtrooms. They must do their work in a hallway or outside a building. But on Thursday, Mr. Gonzalez and Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general, held a news conference to say that even that was too much and that ICE should treat courthouses as sensitive locations — like hospitals, houses of worship and schools — where it does not make arrests. They said immigration authorities were interfering with the criminal justice system, making witness and defendants afraid to appear in court. “I am asking ICE to reconsider their policy and treat the courthouse with respect,” Mr. Gonzalez said in the interview.

"Norman Lear created one of the great characters of American television on “All in the Family”: a blowhard from Queens who was practically unable to open his mouth without insulting women, minorities or some other group besides his own. So it’s both a perfect tribute and a bittersweet irony that he is finally receiving a Kennedy Center Honor during the administration of President Donald J. Trump. In Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O’Connor, the progressive Mr. Lear produced a classic reactionary antihero who fascinated America despite, or because of, his unfiltered outrageousness. Archie couldn’t even praise the Statue of Liberty without using ethnic slurs: It was a prescient creation and a volatile one. Mr. Lear identified what would be a political theme for decades, the splintering of blue-collar white men from the New Deal coalition. But if Mr. Lear hoped to lead America to a new liberalism with his humane outer-borough satire, reality had other plans. Plenty of viewers in the 1970s laughed with, not at, Archie’s political incorrectness. In 2016, plenty of their modern-day counterparts voted for Donald J. Trump’s. Now Mr. Trump sits at the Oval Office Resolute Desk like Archie in his favorite chair. But Mr. Lear will not come to his house. He plans to boycott the December reception at the White House, a rare snub. "
"With roughly three months till Election Day, Mayor Bill de Blasio has centered his re-election campaign on broad themes of progressive change and fighting the Trump administration, with barely a hint that a primary election would take place at all. He holds wide leads in the polls and in fund-raising: With more than $4.78 million in campaign contributions so far, the mayor’s campaign has raised 39 times as much as his next nearest Democratic opponent. Nevertheless, in a filing with the Campaign Finance Board, the mayor presented his main primary opponents, Sal Albanese, a lawyer and former councilman, and Robert Gangi, a criminal justice reform advocate, as something other than token opposition. The reason was simple: To receive more than $2 million in additional city funds for his re-election campaign in the primary, Mr. de Blasio must show he is not facing just “minimal opposition.” On Thursday, the board agreed with the mayor’s campaign, awarding in its first round of payments for the 2017 election the full six-to-one matching funds to Mr. de Blasio, or about $2.57 million in city funds. “I believe we need those resources to talk to people in this city about both what I’ve been doing but more importantly the vision for the future of the city,” Mr. de Blasio said Thursday when asked about the campaign funds during an unrelated news conference. As if to underscore the contested nature of a City Hall race that has presented few hurdles for the incumbent mayor, Mr. de Blasio took to his campaign Twitter account hours before the board’s ruling to announce that he would participate in a primary debate whether or not his opponents qualified for one under the campaign finance rules.

"Through Aug. 18. 303 Gallery, 555 West 21st Street, Manhattan; 212-255-1121, 303gallery.com. Karel Funk’s oil paintings remain unwavering in their concentration on well-made outerwear. At 303 Gallery, in his first gallery show in New York since 2010, Mr. Funk continues to meticulously render the heads and shoulders of subjects who have their backs to the viewer and are wearing bright nylon parkas with the hoods up, silhouetted against white. They are, in other words, complete mysteries, their distance intensified because the hoods evoke monks’ or nuns’ habits. As always, Mr. Funk’s art has an undercurrent of religious devotion, maybe even a touch of the medieval. Our lack of connection to the sitters is strange yet liberating for all concerned. They are cloistered, not displayed for the delectation of either painter or viewer. We, too, are slightly disembodied, free to examine these faceless yet somehow individualized portraits unwatched. Though, in the palpable silence, these figures might be listening, like confessors awaiting our revelations. There is much to look at, and think about, besides this disruption of the viewer’s dominion, including the smooth, knowing perfection of the garments and their high-tech designs; the additions of rougher textures, like Velcro strips and nylon straps; the tiny stitches of their welted seams; and their effulgent colors of yellow, green, red and purple. But each color is set in motion by the quietly unruly topography of creases, sags and folds, and further subdivided by light into a tremendous variety of tones and hues. There is something of the grandeur of landscapes, even mountains or peaks. The dark concave side of a gray hood might almost be a landslide. Finally, there is the conscientious, intimate care with which Mr. Funk achieves this level of realism. Like his subjects, he is unseen, but we feel the intensity of both, along with our own.

"President Trump held a rally Thursday night with some of his favorite people: West Virginians. As he often does, he praised coal and coal miners, and claimed credit for a turnaround in the industry. “We are putting our coal miners back to work,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ve ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. We’ve stopped the E.P.A. intrusion.” But many of the things Mr. Trump says about coal, climate change and the environment bear a strained relationship with the truth. He often cherry-picks facts that prove to be exaggerations when the broader context is considered. He has made inaccurate assertions many times; he is more likely to repeat than to retract. Here are five of Mr. Trump’s most prominent climate and environmental claims as president: “And very importantly for Pennsylvania, we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and we are putting our great coal miners back to work.” (April 29) Mr. Trump has cast his administration as a savior for the coal industry, and for coal miners in particular. He has repeatedly taken credit for the opening of a new coal mine in Pennsylvania. But the mine’s owner, Corsa Coal Corporation, announced the project well before the election and had been developing it for some time. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Newly obtained transcripts of telephone calls between President Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia show a new president eager to fulfill campaign promises — and also how quickly those calls turned contentious. Mr. Trump blamed Congress for the United States’ poor relationship with Russia, a day after he signed legislation to expand sanctions that he called “flawed” and “unconstitutional.” Despite the president’s strained relationships, one group has never wavered in its support: the leaders of America’s conservative movement. The White House has given the right much to applaud, including a policy that would slash legal immigration to the U.S. Discussion of that plan led to a fiery exchange between reporters and Stephen Miller, a policy adviser, at the White House news briefing. Watch it here. "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump chose Twitter last week to announce that he planned to ban transgender service members from the military, he said his decision would safeguard the readiness of the armed forces and was made on the advice of his generals. Now, a week after Mr. Trump’s Twitter statements, military policy experts say that years of study have not produced much evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claims that transgender service members make it harder for the American military to focus on “decisive and overwhelming victory,” as the president wrote. A group of 56 retired generals and admirals put out a statement this week saying that ejecting transgender service members would itself degrade military readiness. In true Washington form, the 56 were answering a letter from another group of 16 retired generals that said Mr. Trump’s proposed ban was necessary “to save the culture and war-fighting capacity of the U.S. military.” The White House has still not put forward a serving general or military adviser to publicly back Mr. Trump’s assertion. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has been quiet on the topic, and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military was not kicking out any service members until the White House sent specific guidelines. The commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, said on Tuesday that he would continue to support transgender troops under his command. The military readiness argument is a familiar one. It was used in 1948 when the issue was opening up the military ranks to blacks (impairing “the morale of the Army at a time when our armed forces should be at their strongest and most efficient,” warned Senator J. Lister Hill, Democrat of Alabama); in the 1990s, when the issue was allowing women into combat (“females have biological problems staying in a ditch for 30 days because they get infections,” said Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia); and in 2010, when the issue was allowing gays to serve openly in the military (it would “harm the battle effectiveness which is so vital to the survival of our young men and women in the military,” asserted Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona).

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump signed legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia, but he asserted that the bill, which also includes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, was “significantly flawed,” raising questions about how he would enforce it. Vice President Mike Pence, speaking in Montenegro, committed American support to eight Balkan nations and warned against Russian encroachment in the region. Russia, he said, is an “unpredictable country that casts a shadow from the east.” Separately, Mr. Trump voiced support for legislation that would overhaul decades of immigration policy — replacing a system that favors an immigrant’s family ties with one that favors skills and employability. And the White House admitted that Mr. Trump had not, as he claimed, received phone calls full of praise from the head of the Boy Scouts or the president of Mexico. "
"KABUL, Afghanistan — When the Afghan female robotics team, made up of teenage students from the western city of Herat, finally made it to a global competition in the United States, the cameras were focused on them. Here was a glimmer of hope from a place so often associated with bloodshed. The girls had made it against all odds, including being denied visas twice. With a big smile, Fatemah Qaderyan, 14, the team captain, illustrated just how far girls, even from a challenging place like Afghanistan, could go if given the opportunity. Crucial to that, she repeated, was the support of her parents. On Tuesday night, Fatemah’s father, Mohammed Asef Qaderyan, 54, was killed when suicide bombers targeted worshipers at a mosque near their home in Herat. Roya Mahboob, an Afghan technology entrepreneur who helped arrange the team’s trip to the United States, confirmed the death. Jailani Farhad, a spokesman for Herat’s governor, also said Mr. Qaderyan had been among those killed. The assault, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility, was the deadliest in a string of attacks this year against Shiite places of worship. It left at least 37 people dead and more than 60 others wounded. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump blamed Congress on Thursday for the United States’ poor relationship with Russia, a day after he signed sanctions legislation that he said was flawed and unconstitutional. In a Twitter message, Mr. Trump described America’s relationship with Russia as “at an all-time & very dangerous low.” The new law, which also includes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, limits Mr. Trump’s ability to change restrictions on Russia and is a reflection of bipartisan concern that Mr. Trump would ease punishments for the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea and meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In blaming Congress for the poor relations, Mr. Trump omits assigning responsibility to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his role in Crimea, for violating a landmark arms control treaty with the deployment of a new cruise missile and for interference in elections in the United States and Europe. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a strong supporter of the sanctions bill, disagreed with the president. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether there was any coordination between the Kremlin and Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers to influence the 2016 election to benefit Mr. Trump. The president has called the investigations a “witch hunt.” Russia had pre-emptively responded to the new sanctions by seizing two American diplomatic properties in Russia and ordering the United States to remove 755 members of its embassy staff stationed there. Mr. Trump has not publicly commented on the Kremlin’s response and did not invite the news media to cover the bill-signing event as he has for other laws. In a statement released on Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the law “significantly flawed,” and he said it included “a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.” Mr. Trump has said he wants to improve the United States’ relationship with Russia. He is not the first American president to bristle at Congress for interfering with the ability to set foreign policy. On Wednesday, the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, declared the “end to hope for the improvement of our relations” and mocked Mr. Trump as having been forced to sign the sanctions into law. “The Trump administration has demonstrated total impotence, handing over executive functions to Congress in the most humiliating way possible,” Mr. Medvedev wrote on Facebook. He added that “the American establishment has totally outplayed Trump” with the goal “to remove him from power.” The same day Mr. Trump signed the sanctions bill, Vice President Mike Pence was in the Balkan nation of Montenegro, reaffirming the United States’ commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Montenegro joined the alliance in June, a move that incensed Moscow. Mr. Pence’s tone on Russia was more assuring to NATO members than that of Mr. Trump, who once called NATO “obsolete” but has since praised the alliance. "
"Something unusual and important is happening in Congress: Republicans and Democrats are working together to improve the health care system. And they’re doing so in defiance of President Trump, who appears determined to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and the health insurance of millions of people. This surprising if modest burst of bipartisanship comes just days after the Senate failed to pass a Republican bill to repeal important provisions of the A.C.A., or Obamacare. On Monday 43 members of the House outlined a proposal to strengthen the insurance marketplaces created by the 2010 law. On Tuesday Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said they would hold hearings and introduce a bill to cut premiums and encourage insurers to sell policies on the marketplaces for 2018. It is, of course, impossible to know if such efforts will succeed. Even if they result in legislation, Republican leaders could refuse to bring it to the floor for a vote. Having treated Obamacare as a political piñata for seven years, Republicans might find it hard to actually help the program. Another danger is that Mr. Trump and his health and human services secretary, Tom Price, could try to pre-emptively weaken the marketplaces through administrative measures. Still, it’s good to see politicians actually doing their jobs. The sight of members of both parties working together in the public interest is uplifting, especially after the long partisan campaign to take insurance away from so many Americans. Contrary to Mr. Trump’s tweets, Obamacare is not collapsing. But it needs work, and some insurance markets are in trouble. Insurers have said they will no longer sell policies in 20 counties in Indiana, Nevada and Ohio, and many are proposing to raise premiums because of the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s threats. Experts say insurers could withdraw from even more counties, especially in rural and suburban areas, if the president sabotages the law. The biggest fear, one shared by Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray, is that Mr. Trump will stop subsidies authorized by the A.C.A. to make health care affordable to low-income people. The government pays these subsidies, about $7 billion this year, to insurance companies every month. In exchange, the companies reduce the deductibles and co-pays for people who earn between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty line, or $12,060 to $30,150 a year for a single person. "
"Just when it seems that there is absolutely nothing on which left and right can agree, along comes Delbert Hosemann, Mississippi’s Republican secretary of state, to tell Kris Kobach and his dangerous joke of an “election fraud” commission to “go jump in the Gulf of Mexico.” Mr. Hosemann, who added helpfully that “Mississippi is a great state to launch from,” was responding to a request from the so-called Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity for detailed information about the state’s voters. He was not alone in his negative response. A notably bipartisan — an unaccustomed phrase, that — group of elected officials in red and blue states is pushing back against Mr. Kobach, vice chairman of the commission (Vice President Mike Pence is the nominal head) on the grounds that the demand violates their constituents’ privacy and that how to conduct elections is the states’ business, not the federal government’s. The resisters suffered a legal setback last week when Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington refused to issue an injunction against the data collection. Ultimately, Mr. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and the leading propagandist for the false claim that hordes of fraudulent voters are threatening American democracy (“we may never know” who actually won the popular vote last November, he declared on MSNBC last month), may get the information he wants. But Anthony Scaramucci could offer Mr. Kobach and the administration he serves some free advice: Watch out what you wish for. No matter how it ultimately plays out, the episode has ignited something of a sagebrush rebellion uniting state officials across a deep ideological divide. It’s hard, in fact, to exaggerate how deep that divide was during the Obama years. It was only Republican states, nearly all of them, that pursued the Affordable Care Act in the federal courts. And only Republican states sued to block the Obama administration’s policy of shielding parents of young undocumented immigrants from deportation. That successful effort was led by Texas, which has long waged its own phony war against voter fraud and staunchly defends one of the country’s most restrictive voter-ID requirements. But even Texas is not exactly jumping on Mr. Kobach’s bandwagon. The federal commission is seeking not only names, addresses and birth dates of some 150 million registered voters but also voting history, party registration, military and criminal records, and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. The Texas secretary of state, Rolando Pablos, announced that while the state would hand over the same public information that it would make available to anyone, it would “protect the private information of Texas citizens” from the federal request. And Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted, “Texas is keeping private your private information.” "
"Donald Trump continues his savage assault on truth, honesty and candor. In two weeks’ time, one of Trump’s lawyers has been proven a liar for repeatedly claiming that Trump had not been involved at all in the drafting of the misleading statement that his son Donald Jr. issued about his now-infamous meeting with Russians in Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. As The Washington Post reported Monday: “Flying home from Germany on July 8 aboard Air Force One, Trump personally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr. said that he and the Russian lawyer had ‘primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children’ when they met in June 2016, according to multiple people with knowledge of the deliberations. The statement, issued to The New York Times as it prepared an article, emphasized that the subject of the meeting was ‘not a campaign issue at the time.’” Then, on Tuesday, the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that the elder Trump had played a role, saying, “The president weighed in, as any father would, based on the limited information that he had.” In short, this whole line of defense that the White House had maintained for weeks was a complete fairy tale, another blatant lie from the perpetual fountain of lies. During a July 25 interview with the Wall Street Journal editor in chief Gerard Baker, Trump said of his debased speech at the Boy Scouts’ Jamboree: “I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them.” The only problem is that, as Politico reported this week: “The Boy Scouts of America, however, apologized to its members after the speech and then said Wednesday that the organization was not aware of any calls between its leaders and Trump.” Monday, Trump said: “As you know, the border was a tremendous problem and they’re close to 80 percent stoppage. Even the president of Mexico called me — they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they’re not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment.” "
"Last week, when President Trump called on the police to use rough justice in dealing with violent Latino gangs, there was a clear method to his madness. Addressing patrolmen and officers assembled in the Van Nostrand Theatre on Long Island on July 28, Trump was fully aware that his remarks would prove incendiary: Underlying Trump’s defiance of law enforcement norms is a calculated strategy advocating the use of force, with the twofold goal of pushing liberals back on their heels and affirming the instincts of his most avid supporters. The same design underpins such recent actions as his endorsement of legislation to cut legal immigration in half and his administration’s apparent plans to pursue “investigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions” in opposition to affirmative action. Trump’s repeated attacks on liberal orthodoxy highlight how Democrats are themselves bound — hogtied is not too strong a word — by the conflicting needs and goals of the various constituencies in their multiracial, multiethnic coalition — a coalition that has been vulnerable to wedge issue attacks for 50 years. Trump’s Suffolk County speech came four days after the announcement by Democratic House and Senate leaders of their newest economic proposal “A Better Deal,” the recent attempt by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to recoup Democratic majorities lost in the 2010 and 2014 midterms. This “better deal” is explicitly designed to appeal to the “many American workers who have been left behind and left out of the economic recovery” — and to reduce the political salience of issues touching on ethnicity and race. In an attempt to target swing voters, the proposal calls for “a major infrastructure investment program, a national paid family leave program, rules to ensure fair work schedules” along with “apprenticeships and work-based learning programs” and “a New Tax Credit to Employers to Train and Hire New Workers.” "
"Following a contentious vote on Sunday that effectively set Venezuela on the path to outright dictatorship, the United States has imposed personal sanctions on President Nicolás Maduro, putting him in the rarefied company of sitting leaders like Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, whose rapacious greed for power has brought their countries to ruin. There is no longer any question that this is where Mr. Maduro belongs. No nation should have to suffer such a leader. And Venezuela, with possibly the world’s largest oil reserves, had the chance to be one of South America’s leading democracies. But overdependence on oil has led to political and economic turbulence, which became disastrous when Mr. Maduro sought to emulate his left-wing predecessor, Hugo Chávez, with lavish public spending that falling oil prices and chronic mismanagement rendered unsustainable. Today Venezuela is a basket case. The estimated inflation rate for 2017 is 720 percent; 80 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, suffering from malnutrition, illness and outright hunger, while corrupt politicians and their military allies shamelessly enrich themselves. Mr. Maduro’s response has been to assail spreading street protests with an iron fist and to erode the power of the National Assembly, in which his opponents have a majority. More than 120 people have died in several months of protests. The deadliest day was Sunday, when Mr. Maduro brought to a vote his transparently power-grabbing plan to elect a tame Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution that would tighten the government’s hold on power, and in the meantime allow the president to dismiss any branch of government deemed disloyal. The opposition boycotted the vote, allowing Mr. Maduro to claim victory despite what appeared to be a small turnout. Early on Tuesday, two opposition leaders already under house arrest were seized by state security agents. "
