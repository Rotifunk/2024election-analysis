"Email is dead; long live email. In his State of the Art column on Wednesday, Farhad Manjoo, the technology columnist for The New York Times, examines the controversy over Donald Trump Jr.’s email thread in which he was told that Russian government officials could provide dirt on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The emails have raised questions about just how much Russia influenced November’s election. The flap is also a reminder of the perils of email, and how messages can come back to bite you. Anything recorded is hard to eliminate — the messages can be forwarded or saved, and they are never truly deleted. So if you have something sensitive to discuss, an old-fashioned phone call or an in-person meeting might be the better way to go. Email should go the way of the dodo for secure communications, Farhad writes. Yet Farhad also reflects on what we would lose if email were to fade away. Because email is intimate and convenient, it has produced “an unmatched historical record of some of the most important stories in the world,” he writes. “It preserves time, location and state of mind, the what-when-where-and-who of every story we might want to dig up.” In other words, the transparency that email can provide will be sorely missed if everyone switches over to encrypted messaging apps and other secure communications channels for handling sensitive information. So long live email? Not exactly — but at least savor Donald Trump Jr.’s emails as email’s last hurrah. "
"Representative Steve Scalise, who was critically injured last month during a mass shooting that took place at a congressional baseball practice, was moved from the intensive care unit of a Washington hospital on Wednesday, a person with knowledge of his condition said. Mr. Scalise, a Republican congressman from Louisiana who serves as the majority whip of the House of Representatives, spent the past week in the intensive care unit and underwent surgery for the management of infection, his office said. His condition on Wednesday remained listed as serious. Mr. Scalise, 51, has been hospitalized at MedStar Washington Hospital Center since the shooting on June 14, when a lone gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, 66, opened fire at a practice field in Alexandria, Va. He shot Mr. Scalise and injured three other people, two of them members of Mr. Scalise’s security detail. The congressman has undergone several surgeries since the shooting and spent over a week in the intensive care unit when he was first admitted. He was the most seriously injured of Mr. Hodgkinson’s four victims. He was shot in the hip as he stood at second base and the bullet broke bones, ripped through internal organs and caused major internal bleeding as it moved through his body. Mr. Hodgkinson, who was said to be deeply upset by President Trump’s election, died after a shootout with the police. "
"In his first public speech as the nation’s top securities cop, Walter J. Clayton sought on Wednesday to send a message that he would not shy away from looking out for the interests of mom-and-pop investors. But the new Securities and Exchange Commission chairman offered few specific policy recommendations in his roughly 25-minute speech, beyond calling for the creation of an advisory board to review transparency in the bond market and a continued crackdown on stock swindles. The nomination of Mr. Clayton, a former Sullivan & Cromwell partner, by President Trump to be chairman of the S.E.C. drew criticism from many Democrats on Capitol Hill and investor advocates because his legal experience largely has come from representing big corporate clients. Critics said Mr. Clayton’s professional experience doing corporate work for big Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs Group and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, might cause him to put the interests of corporate America before those of ordinary investors. But in a lunchtime speech to the Economic Club of New York at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Clayton, who is known as Jay, tried to balance his concern for investor protection with reducing regulatory burdens that deter private companies from going public. “Investors should know the S.E.C. is looking out for them,” Mr. Clayton said. In a brief question-and-answer session after the speech, he said that he supported enforcement actions against companies that engage in foreign bribery to get contracts despite a paper he co-wrote in 2011 that questioned whether regulators and prosecutors had become too aggressive in pursuing actions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

"WASHINGTON — The likely defection of two Senate Republicans has left their leaders no margin for error as they move on Thursday to unveil another version of their bill to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act — without an assurance that they have the votes even to begin debate next week. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky flatly declared on Wednesday that he would not vote to take up the bill, which he said left too much of President Barack Obama’s health law in place. Senator Susan Collins of Maine has gone almost as far, saying that the bill cuts too much and that only major revisions could win her over. The loss of a single additional senator would doom, at least for now, the Republicans’ effort to make good on their seven-year promise to uproot the health law. Unity is proving elusive. A lunch meeting of Republican senators on Wednesday ended with no clear consensus. After scrapping plans for a vote last month, the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, wants to try again next week. But senators have shown few signs of substantial progress toward the needed 50 votes. Mr. Paul said on Wednesday that the revised version of Mr. McConnell’s bill was even worse than the original proposal. The new version, he said, provides more subsidies to insurance companies, and it keeps some of the taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act that the original bill would have repealed. "
"PARIS — President Trump will be in Europe on Thursday for the second time in less than a week, having accepted a rare outstretched hand from a leader on the Continent, where he is deeply unpopular. The invitation by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, might not only give Mr. Trump a brief respite from his domestic political woes, but also establish Mr. Macron’s standing as Mr. Trump’s primary point of contact in Western Europe. It’s a position Mr. Macron appears to have fallen into almost by default, as the British focus on their exit from the European Union; Germany’s chancellor expresses open disdain for Mr. Trump; and the southern Europeans remain in perennial fiscal difficulty. But it is also a role that Mr. Macron has assumed with relish: The whiz kid of French politics has a seemingly limitless confidence in his capacity for seduction. How the relationship will work with Mr. Trump remains to be seen. The invitation by Mr. Macron, at 39, France’s youngest president in modern times, to Mr. Trump, 71, the oldest person ever elected to the White House, is consistent with Mr. Macron’s developing hard-nosed pragmatism in global affairs. It is, however, an unlikely partnership, given Mr. Trump’s professed admiration for Marine Le Pen, the far-right populist Mr. Macron defeated in the May 7 election, and the gulf between Mr. Macron’s technocratic, pro-European and youth-oriented approach and Mr. Trump’s nationalistic, America-first message. On Syria, Mr. Macron has renounced the downfall of President Bashar al-Assad as a precondition of peace talks. He invited Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, to a meeting in France, where he challenged Mr. Putin with tough words on Syria and on gay rights. On Africa, he gave a sober — if impolitic — warning about high birthrates. Mr. Macron’s aides believe that working with America is inevitable and indispensable, and that for better or worse, it must be done through the current president. "
"WASHINGTON — The letters have come in to her office by the hundreds, heartfelt missives from college students, mostly men, who had been accused of rape or sexual assault. Some had lost scholarships. Some had been expelled. A mother stumbled upon her son trying to take his own life, recalled Candice E. Jackson, the top civil rights official at the Department of Education. “Listening to her talk about walking in and finding him in the middle of trying to kill himself because his life and his future were gone, and he was forever branded a rapist — that’s haunting,” said Ms. Jackson, describing a meeting with the mother of a young man who had been accused of sexual assault three months after his first sexual encounter. The young man, who maintained he was innocent, had hoped to become a doctor. In recent years, on campus after campus, from the University of Virginia to Columbia University, from Duke to Stanford, higher education has been roiled by high-profile cases of sexual assault accusations. Now Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is stepping into that maelstrom. On Thursday, she will meet in private with women who say they were assaulted, accused students and their families, advocates for both sides and higher education officials, the first step in a contentious effort to re-examine policies of President Barack Obama, who made expansive use of his powers to investigate the way universities and colleges handle sexual violence. How university and college administrations have dealt with campus sexual misconduct charges has become one of the most volatile issues in higher education, with many women saying higher education leaders have not taken their trauma seriously. But the Obama administration’s response sparked a backlash, not just from the accused and their families but from well-regarded law school professors who say new rules went too far. In an interview previewing her plans, Ms. Jackson, who heads the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights and organized Thursday’s sessions, made clear that she believes investigations under the 1972 law known as Title IX have gone deeply awry. A sexual assault survivor herself, she said she sees “a red flag that something’s not quite right” — and that the rights of accused students have too often been ignored. Hundreds of cases are still pending, some for years, she said, because investigators were “specifically told to keep looking until you find the violation” on college campuses even after they found none — a charge her critics strongly deny.

"The political news cycle is fast, and keeping up can be overwhelming. Trying to find differing perspectives worth your time is even harder. That’s why we have scoured the internet for political writing from the right and left that you might not have seen. Has this series exposed you to new ideas? Tell us how. Email us at ourpicks@nytimes.com. • James S. Robbins in USA Today: “These days, you don’t need a crime or a cover-up to trigger outsized political outrage, just a heavy dose of bad optics.” Mr. Robbins’s article reflects how many on the right have sought to defend Donald Trump Jr. and the administration after a week of bad press. He suggests that Mr. Trump’s meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya could have been a setup by Fusion GPS, a Democratic opposition research group. He also points to a Politico story from January that detailed the Ukrainian government’s efforts to help the Clinton campaign, calling it a “solid case” for “actual collusion.” Read more » _____ • Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review: “But the question is not whether collusion is a crime. It is whether collusion is a high crime or misdemeanor.” Mr. McCarthy bemoans the fact that many in the news media are not informed “about how our constitutional system is supposed to work.” Impeachment, he reminds his readers, is a political issue, not a legal one, and it is the main lever in the Constitution’s tool kit to respond to “egregious executive malfeasance.” Therefore, partisan “bickering” over crimes of collusion miss the point. Mr. McCarthy, who identifies as a reluctant supporter of the president, writes that our standard for executive leadership should extend way beyond the low bar of “nothing he has done is indictable.” Read more » "
"PARIS — As President Trump arrived to take his seat for a Beethoven concert at the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany, on the first night of the Group of 20 summit last week, applause erupted. The American smiled, assuming the praise was for him. That was a little presumptuous. The ovation, as interpreted by the German media, was intended for the young man sitting next to him. Donald Trump had his share of popular glory in Warsaw the day before, but in Western Europe the star is Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old newcomer whose election as president of France has turned the tables in democratic politics just as Mr. Trump’s election did, half a year earlier — in a totally different way. When Mr. Trump visits Paris on Thursday, it will be the fourth meeting between the two leaders in less than two months. Their relationship, though, is still a work in progress. Like new animals released in a pen, they have been sizing each other up. A study of body language between the two men at recent summit meetings in Brussels, Hamburg and Taormina, Italy, shows a budding rivalry, with the younger, charismatic leader of a midsize power in a playful “Look, I’m here” attitude toward the much maligned, much senior president of the allied superpower. There have been tales of competing alpha males, slightly ridiculous handshakes and ostentatious pats on the back. And there has been a daring invitation, from the French president to an American leader who is not welcome even in London, to stand beside him at the Bastille Day military parade. In May, Mr. Macron hosted and lectured Vladimir Putin at Versailles. In July, he wants Donald Trump on the Champs-Élysées. Mr. Macron’s taste for Versailles has inevitably evoked references to Louis XIV, the Sun King. More serious commentators have compared the president with Napoléon Bonaparte and Charles de Gaulle, both of whom succeeded in reforming France as newcomers to politics, and even to Machiavelli. Emmanuel Macron has chosen as his model none other than Jupiter, king of the gods. In an interview with the French weekly Challenges back in October, he criticized President François Hollande for “not believing in a Jupiterian presidency.” “I, personally, don’t believe in a normal presidency,” he said in a stab at Mr. Hollande, who had said while campaigning five years earlier that he wanted to be “a normal president.” Unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Macron is a careful student of history; he is convinced that the way the French look at the presidential office is “linked to the monarchic trauma” — the overthrow and beheading of Louis XVI during the French Revolution. “I am not saying we should bring back the king,” he told Challenges reassuringly. But he advocates a “new form of democratic authority,” based on meaning, symbols and a sense of history. The “Jupiterian” model has inspired new pomp in the exercise of power at the Élysée Palace; no doubt Mr. Trump will be given a taste of it on Bastille Day. On the home front, both men see themselves as transgressional leaders at a time of popular insurrection against the media, political and economic elites. They ran for election pledging to overturn the traditional political system in their countries. Neither held elected office before becoming president, and each took office as head of a powerful executive branch, benefiting from a strong presidential system, unlike those of most European countries.

"A new peripheral character in the Trump universe stepped into the spotlight this week: the entertainment publicist and former tabloid reporter Rob Goldstone. This is the man who facilitated a meeting last year between Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer and Moscow insider, with the promise of information that “would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia.” Mr. Goldstone, who runs the public relations company Oui 2 Entertainment, contacted Donald Trump Jr. by email on behalf of his client, Emin Agalarov, a Russian pop star whose father, Aras, is a real estate tycoon. Aras Agalarov worked with President Trump and Mr. Goldstone to take the Miss Universe contest to Moscow in 2013. On Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr. posted images of his email exchanges with Mr. Goldstone on his Twitter account after learning that The New York Times planned to publish them. The meeting, details of which were first reported by The Times, took place on June 9, 2016, on the 25th floor of Trump Tower and was attended by Donald Trump Jr.; his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner; Paul Manafort, President Trump’s campaign manager at the time; and Mr. Goldstone. When asked for comment this week by The Times, Mr. Goldstone said he thought Ms. Veselnitskaya was a “private citizen.” In an email to Donald Trump Jr. last summer, however, he called her a “Russian government attorney.” He also said he did not know that Aras Agalarov, who has ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, had any involvement in setting up the meeting. His emails showed a different story. Mr. Goldstone is not exactly a savvy political operative. He was born in Manchester, England, and lives in New York. He is currently on what he has termed a “gap year,” during which he is traveling around the world. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “If it’s what you say I love it.” That was Donald Trump Jr.’s response to an intermediary’s offer of dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow’s support for the Trump campaign. The exchange of emails led to the June 2016 meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump’s eldest son, along with two top advisers, and a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer. Here’s a timeline of the events. We obtained Donald Trump Jr.’s email exchange with the intermediary, a former British tabloid journalist. We asked Donald Trump Jr. to comment, but he pre-empted us by posting the emails on Twitter. The Miss Universe pageant of 2013 in Moscow became an unexpected focal point in the murky circumstances that led to the meeting. Now, people close to the president are anonymously blaming one another for disclosures to the news media. "
"Iraq’s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, and Iraqi security forces deserved to celebrate after re-establishing control over Mosul, which the Islamic State occupied for three years in its bloody quest for a caliphate. The celebration should be brief. There is still plenty of urgent work to be done — by Iraqis, the United States, regional neighbors and others — to stabilize Iraq and Syria while also working to counter ISIS’ insidious ideology. And a new report about the high civilian casualty rate demands that President Trump and the Pentagon rethink how the war is being fought. The focus among ISIS’ foes has been killing the terrorists in Iraq and in Syria, where American-backed Syrian forces are closer to recapturing ISIS headquarters, in Raqqa. The longer-term challenge will be addressing the complex factors that have created conditions for the group to thrive, including destructive rivalries between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, corruption and the failure of governments to meet their citizens’ economic and security needs. In Mosul, there are pockets of resistance and residual threats from ISIS sleeper cells, suicide bombers and houses rigged with explosives. Any satisfaction over the military success must be tempered by the high death toll, with perhaps over 1,000 Iraqi soldiers and hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians killed in nine months of fighting. ISIS used civilians as human shields, while Iraqi and the American-led coalition forces could have done more to protect civilians, says a new report by Amnesty International. Mosul residents have been left traumatized by the psychological, sexual and physical violence suffered during three years of ISIS control. The city has been devastated, including the iconic Al Nuri mosque and much of the rest of its religious and cultural heritage. At least $1 billion is needed for reconstruction so that thousands of displaced Iraqis can return home. The coalition of nations that joined with America to fight ISIS has raised funds through the United Nations to rebuild Iraq and Syria; some are meeting in Washington this week to decide on future steps. The obvious question is, what comes next? The Trump administration has so far failed to put forward a comprehensive strategy to deal with postwar reconstruction in Mosul and other challenges. The White House is reportedly debating whether to get involved in Iraq’s long-term recovery, the kind of overseas venture Mr. Trump disparaged during the election campaign. His proposal to greatly reduce the State Department aid budget would limit what America could do. Iraqis bear the primary responsibility for stabilizing their country, but they cannot do it without help. "
"This is the first of a weekly column. A few weeks back, some old friends invited me to appear on their podcast. They are two stand-up comedians in their mid-30s — I know, the podcast comes as a shock — and their show is a kind of micro focus group, investigating how to be better straight white dudes by picking the brains of guests who don’t fit that description. They want to know what people like me, for instance (fat, female, feminist) need from people like them (plausible extras in a Buffalo Wild Wings commercial). It’s sweet and, I think, encouraging. “How to build a better white guy” is a conversation that could turn academic fast, replete with all the jargon that the sneering class finds so tedious: intersectionality, emotional labor, systemic oppression, the dreaded “privilege.” But when I sat down with my friends, only one question sprang to mind, and it was personal, not pedantic. “Do you ever stick up for me?” That question has been quietly nagging at my friendships with men since last fall when the “Access Hollywood” tape tore through the news cycle. The sound of Billy Bush snickering as Donald Trump talked about women in the most dehumanizing terms was devastating in its ease, and in how little it surprised me. I know that my male friends are privy to those kinds of conversations, even if they don’t take part. I also know that some of them do take part. I know that they consider themselves to be good people who fundamentally care about women’s safety and equality. So, if you care, how often do you say something? Maybe you’ll confront your close friends, but what about more powerful men, famous men, cool men, men who could further your career? "
"To the casual observer, Israel has never looked more secure and prosperous. Its Arab neighbors are in disarray. Iran’s nuclear program has been mothballed for a while. The Trump team could not be friendlier and the Palestinians could not be weaker. All’s quiet on the Tel Aviv front. … Look again. In fact, the foundations of Israel’s long-term national security are cracking. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Israel is overstretching itself by simultaneously erasing the line between itself and the Palestinians — essentially absorbing 2.5 million Palestinians, which could turn Israel into a de facto Jewish-Arab binational state — and drawing a line between itself and the Jewish diaspora, particularly the U.S. Jewish community that has been so vital for Israel’s security, diplomatic standing and remarkable economic growth. Netanyahu is setting himself up to be a pivotal figure in Jewish history — the leader who burned the bridges to a two-state solution and to the Jewish diaspora at the same time. I won’t waste much time on Bibi’s deft manipulation of President Trump to shift all the blame onto the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas for the absence of progress in the peace process. Bibi masterfully distracted Trump with a shiny object — a video of extreme statements by Abbas (with no mention of extremist actions by Israeli settlers). It worked perfectly to deflect the U.S. president from pressing the relevant questions: “Bibi, you win every debate, but meanwhile every day the separation of Israel from the Palestinians grows less likely, putting Israel on a ‘slippery slope toward apartheid,’ as former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak recently warned. Where is your map? What are you going to do with 420,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank? Where is your imagination for how to reverse this trend that will inevitably lead to the end of Israel as a Jewish democratic state?” But now an even bigger threat looms. In recent weeks, Netanyahu collaborated with the Orthodox Jewish parties in his right-wing ruling coalition to deal a double blow to the non-Orthodox Jewish diaspora living around the world, particularly in America. There are roughly six million Jews in Israel, six million in the U.S. and four million spread elsewhere. About 75 percent of the 10 million diaspora Jews are non-Orthodox, mostly followers of the Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. The story of the moment is Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting last year with a Russian lawyer who, he was told, had information that could damage Hillary Clinton. He agreed to the meeting in an email exchange that’s now been made public. He’s retained a lawyer of his own. And the president’s son is not this lawyer’s first colorful defendant, as Conan O’Brien and Jimmy Kimmel explained on Tuesday. Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah each insisted that the latest developments should settle the question of whether the Trump administration colluded with Russia. Mr. Colbert held up a smoking gun. Mr. Noah went with a somewhat different metaphor. "
"I was worried you were never going to call. I was just on the phone talking to a dear friend of mine, saying that I feel that I’m working on my forgetfulness and it’s getting better, and then, right in the middle of that conversation, I got a text message from my publicist asking me if I called you yet. It’s O.K. How are you processing your forgetfulness? I get confused about trying to preserve my ‘‘freshness,’’ my inner child and wanting to honor my free spirit. I have a personal confusion where you’re either a free spirit or you are uptight and controlled by iCal. One of the things that stops me from being a full adult is that I don’t take the extra step to do things like make a schedule or honor my own personal time. I’m just starting to realize that this is something I need to change. Do you think it’s a kind of self-sabotage? Yes. I needed it for a while because it was easier for me to think of myself as an underdog or not completely in control. I have the appetite to live more directly now. People confuse you with many of the characters you seem to play, often young, insouciant single women in the big city. But you are clearly very driven. There’s a discipline to getting to that place where you can be free. You can be a weirdo! But you have to be aware of structure and having a diligence as an artist to make something free and new. You’re often grouped with actresses like Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer of ‘‘Broad City,’’ and Lena Dunham. Does that feel accurate? It’s lovely to be put into a group with these women. I also don’t think that we’re very similar other than that we’re women and we all have vaginas and we don’t seem to be very scared of that. It’s annoying to be oversimplified. "
"WASHINGTON — Republicans are failing at governance. And they know it. Their senatorially painful decision announced on Tuesday to sacrifice some of lawmakers’ usually sacrosanct August recess was a public confession that they have not gotten the job done even while controlling the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. In deciding to forgo at least the first two weeks of their regular summer getaway, Senator Mitch McConnell and his colleagues essentially admitted that they could not afford to go home to face constituents without making a concerted effort to pass contentious health care legislation and put some other points on the board. “It is time to get results for the American people,” said a group of 10 Republican senators who had pressed Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, to force the Senate to stick around. Legislative results have been in short supply for unified Republican government as first the House and now the Senate have gotten badly bogged down in trying to overhaul the Obama administration’s health care law — a top priority of Republicans since 2010. The stalemate has been ugly, preventing Republicans from moving ahead on long overdue budget, spending and tax priorities and leaving Mr. McConnell and Senate Republicans frustrated and doubting their abilities. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, was perhaps the most blunt when he said on Twitter over the weekend that the 52 Republican senators should “be ashamed that we have not passed health reform by now.” He added, in all caps for emphasis: “WE WONT BE ASHAMED WE WILL GO FROM MAJORITY TO MINORITY.” Leadership vows to cut off recess are a staple of congressional theater, used as a ploy to force lawmakers to address an issue or face the prospect of seeing their overseas fact-finding trips canceled. But the threats usually produce some action and are very rarely acted upon. The fact that Mr. McConnell felt compelled to actually abbreviate the recess, just days after Republicans were snickering at the very idea, underscored the seriousness of his party’s plight. "
"WILLIAMSTON, S.C. — The high-resolution image had been captured by a bank’s surveillance camera, and when Phillip Clardy saw it on the local news, it left no doubt in his mind: The big, bald bull of a man robbing the place — the man who had, strangely, not even bothered to wear a mask — was Richard Inman, the town’s former police chief. Mr. Inman had been forced to resign as head of the Williamston Police Department in 2011 after Mr. Clardy, a former mayor, brought to light the racially provocative jokes that Mr. Inman had posted on his Facebook page. Mr. Inman turned in his badge with little drama or complaint. And that seemed to bring the story to a close. But now here was Mr. Inman, six years later, captured on the surveillance camera at the Bank of America just up Highway 25 in Simpsonville, his expressionless face offering no clues about the gears churning behind it. The police accused Mr. Inman 48, of walking into the bank on the morning of June 24 in a pair of khaki shorts, giving the teller a note that stated he was armed and fleeing with an undisclosed amount of cash. Mr. Inman was arrested two and a half hours later in Franklin County, Ga. He remains in custody at the Greenville County Detention Center. And so, this working-class town of 4,000 people was moved to ponder how, exactly, their former chief’s mug shot ended up in a $1.50 scandal sheet, The Jail Report, on sale at the Sav Way filling station. Had Mr. Inman’s Facebook transgressions snared him in a professional purgatory from which he could not escape? Did all of this have something to do with the brain surgery Mr. Inman underwent while in office — the one some said had affected his personality? Was it something more complicated? Something less? “It’s like he didn’t even care,” said Sydney Lawson, 26, an employee of a storefront cash-loan business, marveling that a former lawman would neglect to wear a mask to a bank heist.

"For the past five years, Oscar Health has sought to portray itself as a new kind of health insurer, taking an approach that set it apart from its more traditional competitors. Now, Oscar plans to work with one of those rivals on a new venture. The start-up announced on Wednesday that it would work with Humana, one of the biggest insurance companies in the United States, on a venture for small-business health insurance in Nashville. The venture is just one partnership in one metropolitan region. But it highlights Oscar’s efforts to expand beyond the individual plans it has sold since its inception into plans for small businesses. Founded in 2012, Oscar pitched itself as an insurer steeped in technology and friendlier to customers. That helped the company raise more than $720 million from investors, including the venture firm of the co-founder Joshua Kushner, the younger brother of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. Oscar’s pitch has gained converts, allowing the company to expand into several states, including California, New York and Texas. But for much of its existence, it has lost money, including $124.1 million in New York State last year. Its overall individual-plan membership fell to 90,171 as of March 31, from 106,000 in 2016. (The company disclosed in May that its overall loss in the first three months of 2017 had narrowed by 47 percent from the same time last year, to $25.8 million.) "
"For one day, tech companies big and small united on a common cause: to protest the government’s rollback of rules for the internet. Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and hundreds of smaller tech companies coordinated a huge online protest on Wednesday against the Federal Communications Commission’s plan to scrap net neutrality rules, which guarantee that broadband service providers treat all internet traffic equally. The tech companies want the rules to remain to protect them from unfair treatment by broadband providers like Comcast or AT&T, which could create faster delivery lanes for some websites and not others. Silicon Valley approached this fight against the Trump administration’s plans its own way — by taking to the internet. Some of the biggest users of internet lanes were at the forefront. Netflix, which depends on free and open internet lanes to transmit its streaming video, had a small banner ad on its home page reading “Protect Internet Freedom. Defend Net Neutrality. Take Action,” which linked to the net neutrality information page of its trade group, the Internet Association. (The banner didn’t appear on the app for television viewers.) Twitter promoted the hashtag topic #NetNeutrality on its home page and app and posted a link to a blog post with an explainer on the issue and a direct link to comment on the F.C.C. website. Those who use Reddit, the online forum, were greeted with a pop-up promotion that gave its take on why net neutrality is important. Amazon’s gaming site Twitch also promoted its protest of the F.C.C. plan with a banner ad on its site, a post on Twitter, and an electronic letter to users explaining the issue. Expedia, the online travel company, had banners across all its sites, including Expedia.com, VBRO.com, Hotels.com, and HomeAway.com. Some tech companies did not make their displeasure as overt on their home pages. On Amazon’s home page, the company placed a “Net Neutrality? Learn More” ad between promotions for a streaming Starz show and Amazon’s Prime Music service. Google, one of the biggest supporters of net neutrality, also was not in-your-face with the issue. The company posted a link to a blog on Twitter warning that the rules were in danger and that people should make their voices heard by telling the F.C.C. to stop its rollback. Facebook didn’t promote the issue on its site but chose to speak through its leaders, with posts by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Some smaller websites were among the most vocal in online protests. Etsy, the online market for crafts, had a major promotion on its home page with a tool that let visitors directly send comments to lawmakers and the F.C.C. "
"Though its political implications are yet unclear, the publication of an email chain in which Donald Trump Jr. arranged a June 2016 meeting with a lawyer peddling the Russian government’s help for his father’s presidential campaign ought to inspire some pretty obvious tech advice: Step away from the inbox, stupid! That’s not a partisan slight. I said pretty much the same thing last year about the emails of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, whose inbox emptied across the internet after he clicked on a link he shouldn’t have. What was most notable about the Podesta stash — not to mention earlier releases from the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton’s own server — was the Clinton campaign’s apparent slavishness to email. No thought appeared too big or too small to escape documentation and discussion over a fundamentally insecure communication channel invented more than 50 years ago, and meant for subjects far less weighty than a campaign for the presidency. The Democrats’ email troubles suggested how thoroughly email had seduced us, and how deeply we’d all overcommitted to it — and how desperately we all needed to move to something more secure. The younger Mr. Trump’s emails only underline that point. But they also suggest what we’ll lose when, inevitably, the world does move on to something better than email — an unmatched historical record of some of the most important stories in the world. Precisely because it’s inescapable, insecure and irresistibly convenient, email provides an almost uncomfortably intimate view into the historical record. It preserves time, location and state of mind, the what-when-where-and-who of every story we might want to dig up. The last two decades, email’s high-water era, have thus been a bounty for anyone wishing to understand exactly what was happening in the inner circles of powerful organizations — for journalists, historians and prosecutors of white-collar crime, among others. If common sense prevails, Mr. Trump’s email thread may serve as the final nail in the coffin of email as the universal office communicator. People in business and politics are already moving on to other methods, from cloud-based business tools like Slack to apps like Signal, which promise the discretion of a spymaster. These tools allow for auto-deletion and encryption; they’re not perfectly secret (nothing is), but they’re a fortress compared with email. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “If it’s what you say I love it.” Donald Trump Jr. reacted enthusiastically last year to the possibility of Russian government help for his father’s presidential campaign, according to emails he released on Tuesday. The emails discussed an offer of incriminating material about Hillary Clinton and led to a meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. Read the exchanges here, and catch up with a video recap. The emails undercut President Trump’s line of defense in the inquiry into Russian election meddling, which he has dismissed as a “total hoax,” our White House correspondents write. One of our investigative reporters explains how she uncovered details of the meeting at Trump Tower, and our writers in Russia profiled the lawyer who was there. "
"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher It was Tuesday morning. The New York Times had emails between Donald Trump Jr. and a trusted intermediary about setting up a meeting to discuss information that “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” The reporters working on the article called Donald Trump Jr. for comment, telling him that he had until 11 a.m. to comment. An hour before that deadline, he gave a statement — on Twitter and to the world. On today’s episode: • Matt Apuzzo, one of the reporters who has been investigating the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, discusses unearthing Donald Trump Jr.’s emails and demystifies the term “collusion.” • We hear from Rukmini Callimachi and her producer, Andy Mills, as they travel through the streets of Mosul in the hours after the Iraqi government declared victory over Islamic State militants.

"ALBANY — Even before it began, the so-called summer of hell seemed to be causing trouble for at least one New Yorker: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. According to a poll released on Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, nearly a quarter of New York City residents give the governor a failing grade when it comes to his handling of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The authority oversees the subways and regional railroads, both of which have been plagued by problems in recent months. The poll was largely conducted before Monday’s official beginning of the “summer of hell” — a phrase Mr. Cuomo himself coined to describe how commuters would be confronted by reduced service across the region caused by intensive track repairs at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. But to many New Yorkers, the problems caused by Penn Station run second to the crisis in the city’s subway system, which has been plagued by delays and breakdowns. Only 4 percent of city dwellers gave him an A, according to the poll, a rating echoed in other parts of the state. Statewide, 17 percent give the governor an F, and half of respondents give him either a B or a C. Those middling scores on the M.T.A. seem to also be affecting the governor’s overall approval rating statewide, which slipped to 46 percent from the 52 percent approval found in a late March poll from the university. Since then, the governor has presided over a late budget and a prolonged legislative session, which included the appointment of a new leader for the authority, Joseph J. Lhota. Over all, 38 percent of the state’s voters disapprove of the governor’s performance; his support is much weaker outside New York City and its suburbs. "
"Oscar Health has made a name for itself as an upstart health insurer with a technological bent, focusing on areas that traditional rivals have neglected. On Wednesday, the start-up will announce that it’s teaming up with one of those competitors on a new venture. Oscar is working with Humana, one of the biggest insurance companies in the United States, on a small-business health insurance project in Nashville. It’s one partnership in one metropolitan area, focused on small businesses. But Oscar has made no secret of wanting to expand beyond individual health care insurance offerings into employer-sponsored plans. “The individual market was a good starting point,” Mario Schlosser, Oscar’s chief executive, told The New York Times. “But it was clear from the beginning that the majority of insurance in the U.S. is delivered through employers.” For Humana, working with Oscar means joining with a start-up that’s trying new things. “Humana has been an organization that’s willing to test and learn over the years, and we’re not afraid to partner with companies thinking outside the box,” Beth Bierbower, the president of the employer group segment at Humana, told The Times.

Here in America I’ve been doing without the precious stuff since Nov. 9, first because Kentucky and Tennessee voted for Mr. Trump and later because the senators representing those states have all toadied up to the man.

"WASHINGTON — In private, President Trump sometimes addresses his adult children as “baby,” a term of endearment tinged with a New Yorker’s wisecracking edge. And now that Mr. Trump’s babies have been swept into the vortex of his storm-tossed presidency, he is taking it personally. The fierce criticism of a meeting between Mr. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Kremlin-linked lawyer in June 2016 has left the president by turns angry, defensive and protective but ultimately relieved that for now, the worst appears to be over, people who spoke to him said Wednesday. For Mr. Trump, who has faced a barrage of questions about his own dealings with Russia, watching his closest family members come under harsh scrutiny for things they are accused of doing to help his presidential campaign has marked an uncomfortable turn in the foreign entanglement that has shadowed him since he took office in January. The latest disclosures also focused renewed attention on Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who attended Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting last June with the Russian, Natalia Veselnitskaya. And they came on the heels of a much-criticized decision by his daughter Ivanka to sit in her father’s vacated chair at a summit meeting in Germany. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump discarded pleas from advisers to avoid wading into the tempest over Donald Trump Jr., and posted a fusillade of tweets defending him. He denounced reports of the meeting — to collect incriminating information about Hillary Clinton — as part of “the greatest Witch Hunt in political history” and even embraced the theory that his son might have been “the victim” in the case. “He was great,” Mr. Trump told people about his son’s appearance on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program the previous evening. "
"WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, delivered an upbeat message on the state of the American economy to Congress on Wednesday, highlighting the strength of job growth and indicating that the Fed remained on course to begin reducing its bond holdings in the fall. Ms. Yellen added, however, that the Fed was paying close attention to the recent weakness of inflation. While emphasizing that she expected prices to start rising more quickly, she said persistent weakness could lead the Fed to raise interest rates more slowly. “It’s premature to reach the judgment that we’re not on the path to 2 percent inflation over the next couple of years,” she said. “We’re watching this very closely and stand ready to adjust our policy if it appears the inflation undershoot will be persistent.” Ms. Yellen’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee lifted stock prices and lowered bond yields on Wednesday. Investors tend to celebrate any sign that the Fed might slow the pace of its interest-rate increases. Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who heads the committee, gave Ms. Yellen an unusually warm reception for the opposite reason, applauding the Fed for moving ahead with rate increases and describing the Fed’s plans to start reducing bond holdings later this year as “more good news.” These biannual hearings can be combative, but steady economic growth and the Fed’s commitment to a retreat from its stimulus campaign have drained some of the tension from recent sessions. The sharpest exchanges on Wednesday were about regulatory issues, with Republicans complaining that the Fed was unfairly constraining the banking industry to the detriment of economic growth. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief. In some ways, they could not be more different. On one coast, there is Jerry Brown, the governor and a California fixture, a leader of the Democratic opposition to the Trump White House. On the other side of the country is Michael Bloomberg, the former Republican New York mayor, a billionaire businessman and philanthropist who has arguably been as active outside of Gracie Mansion (or more precisely City Hall; Mr. Bloomberg declined to live in Gracie Mansion) as he was when he was in political power. In combining forces on climate change, these two men have sought to present themselves as a high-profile team in opposition to President Trump on this issue. On Tuesday, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bloomberg announced they would lead a group of states, cities and businesses in pledging to adhere to standards set by the Paris climate pact — after Mr. Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the agreement. In truth, these two men are not as dissimilar as they might appear. Mr. Brown is 79; Mr. Bloomberg is 75. Both can be, shall we say, irascible. And both won considerable support by being viewed as something of a free spirit: playing by some rules of politics, while happily flounting others. Mr. Bloomberg, who doesn’t exactly fit the profile of what most people might consider a Republican, left the party to become an independent as he thought about running for president. "
"MAO MOUNTAIN, China — Far from the smog-belching power plants of nearby cities, on a hillside covered in solar panels and blossoming magnolias, Yang Shihua speaks of the need for a revolution. Mr. Yang, the abbot of Mao Mountain, a sacred Taoist site in eastern China, has grown frustrated by indifference to a crippling pollution crisis that has left the land barren and the sky a haunting gray. So he has set out to spur action through religion, building a $17.7 million eco-friendly temple and citing 2,000-year-old texts to rail against waste and pollution. “China doesn’t lack money — it lacks a reverence for the environment,” Abbot Yang said. “Our morals are in decline and our beliefs have been lost.” Hundreds of millions of people in China have in recent years turned to religions like Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, seeking a sense of purpose and an escape from China’s consumerist culture. Now the nation’s religious revival is helping fuel an environmental awakening. Spiritual leaders are invoking concepts like karma and sin in deriding the excesses of economic development. Religious followers are starting social service organizations to serve as watchdogs against polluters. Advocates are citing their faith to protest plans to build factories and power plants near their homes. "
"Donald Trump Jr.’s 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer who promised damaging information via the Russian government has again engulfed President Trump in questions about whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. The younger Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that pursuing material that could prove useful against a political opponent is standard practice in campaigns. But while opposition research is part of modern presidential campaigns, it normally does not come from representatives of a hostile foreign power. Here is how the peddling of opposition research — or oppo, as political professionals and reporters call it — typically works. One of President Bill Clinton’s favorite Arkansas political sayings was, “If you see a turtle on a fence post, it didn’t get there by accident.” Many campaign accusations and revelatory news stories about a candidate or elected official are the fruits of what is euphemistically called the research division of campaigns and political parties, where low-profile aides search for dirt.

"WASHINGTON — Christopher A. Wray, President Trump’s nominee to be F.B.I. director, sought at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday to show lawmakers that he could protect the bureau’s independence and resist pressure from the White House. On a day when Mr. Trump again called the Russia investigation “a witch hunt,” Mr. Wray said he disagreed, told senators that no one at the White House had asked him to pledge loyalty to the president and vowed to resign should the president ask him to do anything illegal. Mr. Wray’s expected confirmation is seen by many F.B.I. agents as a chance to stabilize an institution shaken by the events of the past year, including Mr. Trump’s dismissal of its previous director, James B. Comey, and subsequent revelations about the president’s attempts to influence Mr. Comey. Mr. Wray, dressed in a pinstripe suit and purple tie, calmly reassured senators that he could rebuff any overtures from Mr. Trump. “I will never allow the F.B.I.’s work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law and the impartial pursuit of justice. Period,” Mr. Wray told senators. The hearing was a chance for Mr. Wray, 50, a private lawyer and former top Justice Department prosecutor, to demonstrate that he was the person to lead the nation’s premier law enforcement agency under extraordinary circumstances. Many of the questions from senators centered on how he would deal with Mr. Trump, referring to Mr. Comey’s tense interactions with the president. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked what Mr. Wray would do if the president requested that he take any steps that Mr. Wray believed were illegal. "

"After years of trying to break through internationally, the Russian singer Emin Agalarov has finally crossed over into the United States. Unfortunately, it wasn’t his music that did it. Emin, who is known in entertainment by a single name, found himself thrust into the American spotlight this week not for his schlocky Europop dance tracks or his Las Vegas-indebted crooning of the standards, but because of his leading role in arranging Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer thought to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rob Goldstone, a publicist for Emin, said that he handled the logistics of the sit-down at Trump Tower last year at the behest of the pop singer, 37, who is the son and business partner of the billionaire real estate tycoon Aras Agalarov. The Agalarov and Trump families were friendly because of past business collaborations, most notably in bringing the Miss Universe contest — then owned by Donald J. Trump — to Moscow in 2013. Plans to build a Trump Tower in the Russian capital were tossed around as well, though they fell through. The connections don’t end there. President Trump was also a public booster of Emin’s music career, booking him for a golf course opening, the singer said, and even appearing in his 2013 music video for the song “In Another Life” to deliver the “Apprentice” catchphrase “You’re fired!” "
"BEDMINSTER, N.J. — Danielle Kang’s first L.P.G.A. victory was long overdue, coming in her 144th start, at the Women’s P.G.A. Championship early this month. In the two weeks since, she has been racing to keep her life running on time. On Wednesday at Trump National Golf Club, she sprinted to the 10th tee with her arms spread like wings and flung herself into the embrace of Michelle Wie, who had stood patiently waiting for more than five minutes. Still out of breath, the 24-year-old Kang proceeded to tee up her ball and hit an errant drive. “Oh, my gosh,” she said. “That’s terrible.” Wie, one of Kang’s best friends, chided her in mock exasperation. “You can’t just run up to the tee and hit,” Wie said. After hitting a second drive that found the fairway, Kang hit two approach shots. The second, from deep rough, grazed Wie’s mother. She had barely noticed that she had been hit by the time she was swallowed in a hug from Kang, who had rushed over to apologize. Kang’s smile seems to magnetically attract the cameras, but on the eve of the United States Women’s Open here, her usual effervescence fell a little flat as she finished tuning up for what she hopes will be her second major championship in two starts.

"WASHINGTON — At 6:14 p.m. on June 7, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. clicked the send button on an email to confirm a meeting with a woman described as a “Russian government attorney” who would give him “information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia.” Three hours later, his father, Donald J. Trump, claimed victory in the final primary races propelling him to the Republican presidential nomination and a general election contest against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In his victory speech, Mr. Trump promised to deliver a major address detailing Mrs. Clinton’s “corrupt dealings” to give “favorable treatment” to foreign governments, including “the Russians.” The White House said the timing was a coincidence. The younger Mr. Trump said this week that he never told his father about the meeting with the Russian lawyer, and the president said on Wednesday that he did not know about it until a few days ago. But the time frame raised questions that investigators will presumably examine as they try to piece together who knew what, and when, last year during what American intelligence agencies have called a Russian effort to influence the presidential election. The meeting with the Russian lawyer came at a crucial stage in the elder Mr. Trump’s against-the-odds campaign as he pivoted toward taking on Mrs. Clinton, who was widely seen as the front-runner for the presidency. With Mr. Trump’s party still divided, his team was eager for information that could be used against his Democratic opponent, just as any nominee would be at that stage. The difference was that the Kremlin, according to intelligence reports, was eager to play a role in the campaign, and was in the midst of unleashing an operation to damage Mrs. Clinton. The younger Mr. Trump said the meeting with the Russian lawyer yielded no useful information about Mrs. Clinton, and instead turned into a discussion about a Russian-American diplomatic dispute. By happenstance or not, in the days and weeks after the meeting with the Russian lawyer, emails purloined from Democratic computers were made public, which investigators tied to Russian hacking. "
"WASHINGTON — It won a near-unanimous vote in the Senate, involves a hostile foreign power that interfered in the election last fall and now shadows the president. And it is now before a House Republican majority that has long placed a hawkish approach to Russia at the center of its foreign policy. So why is it taking so long for Congress to clear legislation that would punish Moscow for election meddling and military aggression? “Pass it, for Christ’s sake,” said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. On Wednesday, the case of the stalled sanctions took a new turn as House Republicans and Democrats battled behind the scenes over the details of the bill, and the White House continued to press Republican lawmakers to hold out for changes. Now, weeks of delays, both procedural and substantive, have left the measure’s fate in limbo even as the cloud of Russia-tinged scandal darkens over President Trump. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the delays were “doing nothing but helping Russia.” White House officials say the legislation would handcuff the president by depriving him of the power to unilaterally ease or lift the sanctions if he sees fit. They are insisting on removing language that gives Congress the ability to block such action. On Capitol Hill, however, Republicans chafe at any suggestion that they have gone soft on Russia, and blame procedural snags on Democrats while offering a series of justifications for why the bill is problematic.

"WASHINGTON — The tough lessons are piling up for Republicans as they struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but one stands out as a harbinger of things to come: Tax cuts for the rich, paired with reduced services for the poor, are a politically unpalatable combination. Unable to get the first version of their health care bill off the ground, Senate Republicans are expected to release a revised bill on Thursday that would keep two of the taxes on the wealthy that were imposed by President Barack Obama’s health law: the 3.8 percent tax on investment income and the 0.9 percent surcharge on Medicare taxes, both imposed on high-income earners. Republicans have long said that these taxes are killing jobs and strangling economic growth, but the juxtaposition of repealing hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes for the wealthy and cutting deeply into Medicaid has become untenable. That Republicans may now preserve these taxes could bode poorly for their hopes of introducing deep tax cuts later this year that analysts say could disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans. “It’s not necessarily the cutting taxes on the rich; it’s the cutting taxes on the top end and offsetting that with spending reductions,” said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a research group. “Republicans need to realize how challenging it is to do that.” The Republican plan to overhaul the tax code continues to be a work in progress, with legislation not expected to emerge until September after a succession of delays and setbacks.

"As the Trump administration dismantles the federal government’s efforts to respond to global warming, the natural world has come calling with a reminder: An iceberg the size of Delaware broke off Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf in recent days, yet another indication of the rapid change now occurring on the world’s iciest continent. This is the third floating ice shelf in recent years in Antarctica’s Weddell Sea to fully or partly break up, the first two subverted by warming ocean waters and air temperatures. The Larsen A broke up in 1995. Seven years later, after months of unusually warm temperatures, the Rhode Island-size Larsen B shelf became riddled with meltwater ponds, then fell apart virtually overnight, shattering into millions of pieces. Now a 120-mile-long chunk of the Larsen C has calved, forming one of the largest icebergs ever observed. The ice shelf has been floating in the frigid waters on the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula for at least 10,000 years. It was in the Weddell Sea that Ernest Shackleton’s ship, Endurance, became trapped in ice in 1915, forcing him and his crew to abandon ship in an epic battle for survival. Now a region that not long ago saw only snow and ice is experiencing — at least in its northern reaches — rain in summer. Talk to scientists who have worked in the Arctic, Antarctic or the world’s glacial zones for decades, and what they keep coming back to is that they have witnessed monumental physical changes in these once-frozen regions within their professional lifetimes. Last year the Arctic experienced exceptionally warm weather that has continued into 2017, as sea ice shrinks to near-record lows. Temperatures last fall were as much as 36 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over parts of the Arctic. Both the extent and thickness of Arctic summer sea ice have decreased sharply since satellite remote sensing began in 1979. Few climate scientists doubt that within a decade or two the cap of ice that has covered the Arctic Ocean for tens of thousands of years, acting as a giant planetary air conditioner, will largely disappear in summer, replaced by heat-absorbing open ocean. One more physical feature that has characterized our planet for ages will have vanished in a matter of decades. "
"WASHINGTON — Two Democratic Party donors and a former party staff member have filed an invasion of privacy lawsuit against President Trump’s campaign and a longtime informal adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., accusing them of conspiring in the release of hacked Democratic emails and files that exposed their personal information to the public. The case was organized by Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group run by former Obama administration lawyers. It filed the claim just short of a deadline under a one-year statute of limitations for privacy invasion lawsuits: WikiLeaks published the first archives of stolen Democratic National Committee emails, which intelligence agencies say Russia hacked to harm Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and help Mr. Trump, last July 22. Mr. Trump and his political advisers, including Mr. Stone, have repeatedly denied colluding with Russia, and the 44-page complaint, filed on Wednesday in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, does not contain any hard evidence that his campaign did. But it is seeking to depose witnesses and obtain campaign emails and other documents during the discovery process that is a standard part of lawsuits. If a judge permits the case to reach that stage, the lawsuit would become a new and independent fact-finding investigation into the Trump-Russia issue — one that is overseen by a judge rather than by congressional Republicans, like the oversight inquiries conducted by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, or by the Trump administration, like the criminal inquiry led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. “These plaintiffs are using the law and the American civil justice system the way it was intended: to vindicate important rights and values, such as the right to privacy and the right to participate in the political process; and to deter others who might consider colluding with a foreign government for political gain,” said Ian Bassin, the executive director of Protect Democracy. “They want to ensure that what they have gone through does not become something we accept as part of our democracy.” A spokesman for Mr. Trump’s outside legal team did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Stone called the lawsuit meritless and said he expected it to be “quickly dismissed.” "

There’s no scientific consensus over whether global warming is to blame, but there is agreement that it may be a preview of what’s to come as Antarctica heats up. _____ "
"Only in Trumpland can Gary D. Cohn be considered a suitable Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is a current White House adviser, is said to be the leading contender to replace Janet L. Yellen, according to Politico. Though not a trained economist, Mr. Cohn’s years in finance put him ahead of President Trump’s other cabinet picks who notably lack relevant résumés. But a Wall Street trader’s temperament makes a bad match for the staid central-bank job. The registered New York Democrat did not have a government background when he became director of the National Economic Council. Still, he had honed his finance skills during more than 25 years at Goldman, and he quickly hired White House staff members with complementary experience. His operation contrasted with those of cabinet members like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who struggled to answer basic questions about school curriculums in her confirmation hearing. Choosing Mr. Cohn as head of the central bank would be an unconventional pick. Over the last 40 years, Fed chiefs have been economists and have also served at least two four-year terms. Ms. Yellen will have served only one if Mr. Trump does not renominate her. The last one-term, noneconomist Fed chairman was G. William Miller, who had been the chief executive of Textron before President Jimmy Carter tapped him. At a time of high inflation, his policies tanked the dollar and he lasted just over a year. Mr. Cohn spent much of his time at Goldman as a trader. He joined its J. Aron commodities unit and became the head of the divisions for fixed income, equities and global securities before he became the company’s president. Goldman is known as the most alpha of the investment banks, and the hard-charging job fit Mr. Cohn’s personality. Running the central bank is a more sedate affair. The staff consists of number crunchers with doctorates in economics who pore over various models to analyze growth and employment. News conferences after meetings by the interest-rate-setting committee are carefully scripted. Ms. Yellen, like her forebears, chooses her words carefully, knowing any hint of surprise can rattle markets. Her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, learned that in 2013, when he said the central bank would no longer be purchasing bonds, causing United States Treasury yields to surge in what became known as the “taper tantrum.” Mr. Cohn, a blunt talker, may find such restrictions suffocating. Markets will prefer a more boring choice. "
"The turquoise and fuchsia weavings of the indigenous people of the Guatemalan village spoke to me. “Make us into a pair of jeans,” they said. I shouldn’t have listened, because the first night I wore them out in Manhattan those jeans made me look like a wall hanging. We all have our fashion regrets, whether from overzealous sample-sale shopping or impulse buying at a market abroad. A new Rizzoli book, “I Actually Wore This: Clothes We Can’t Believe We Bought,” includes my regrettable jeans and the cringe-inducing garments of a runway of notables including Roz Chast, Yvonne Force Villareal, Molly Shannon, Chris Burch, Nick Wooster, Gary Shteyngart and Linda Fargo. It was written by Tom Coleman, with photography by Jerome Jakubiec. Ms. Fargo, the Bergdorf Goodman creative doyenne with a new boutique that bears her name, models the Twizzler-red 3.1 Phillip Lim pantsuit she wore to a fashion event filled with people in black (the New York color of festivity), inspiring ungenerous texts and social media mockery. “But I always like to scare myself a little,” she said at a party in the spring. Hers is not the kind of boldface name, however, to attract universal scorn. While many dodged that bullet at the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Gala in May, with its avant-garde dress code in honor of Rei Kawakubo, years past have not been as kind to Sarah Jessica Parker or Rihanna, whose pooling yellow dress in 2015, a.k.a. the Omelet, was the equivalent of sartorial egg on the face. Other great moments of regrettable red-carpet display include the infamous derriere-showing Scaasi pantsuit Barbra Streisand wore for the 1969 Oscars and Bjork’s swan dress from 2001. "
"To the Editor: Re “Emails Disclose Trump Son’s Glee at Russian Offer” (front page, July 12): It is easy to see why Donald Trump Jr. would love any help Russia might give to his father’s campaign, but while we question his obliviousness to the issues this help raises, we should also consider why the Russians wanted Donald J. Trump to become president. It wasn’t to make America great again. JAMIE BALDWIN, REDDING, CONN. To the Editor: Here’s a hypothetical: Suppose the Russian government indeed had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Suppose that the Trump campaign had accepted and used this information (as at least Donald Trump Jr. was clearly eager to do: “I love it”) to help the senior Mr. Trump win the 2016 election. Wouldn’t President Vladimir V. Putin then have had blackmail material that could have been used against Mr. Trump as long as his presidency lasted? None of the people who were willing to discuss the Russian offer of information — Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, the campaign manager, and Donald Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner — seem to have had the slightest awareness of this rather obvious danger. JESSE LARNER, NEW YORK To the Editor: If Jared Kushner lied by omission in his responses on his top-secret security clearance forms about meetings with Russians and Russian contacts, why in the world isn’t that security clearance being taken away from him? The intentional dishonesty, lack of accountability and mystifying absence of consequences for wrongdoing in this administration is mind-boggling. It’s hard to imagine the extent and lasting repercussions of the damage to the trust between the American people and our elected government being caused by the Trump administration.

Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump jumped to the defense of his son, denouncing reports about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer to gain incriminating information about Hillary Clinton as part of “the greatest witch hunt in political history.” The younger Mr. Trump and his allies argue that pursuing material to use against a political opponent is standard practice. While opposition research is indeed part of modern campaigns, it normally does not come from a hostile foreign power. Here is how the peddling of opposition research — or oppo, as political professionals and reporters call it — typically works. _____ "
"To the Editor: Re “The Challenges After Mosul” (editorial, July 12): The Iraq war has left millions of civilians displaced and without food. Farming and food production are always a casualty of war. For peace and reconstruction we must provide emergency food aid and agricultural rehabilitation. We must be the leader in this recovery effort. That is why President Trump’s proposed elimination of the Food for Peace program is ill advised. We need to be increasing our food aid budgets to help feed war victims in Iraq and elsewhere. WILLIAM LAMBERS, CINCINNATI The writer partnered with the United Nations World Food Program on the book “Ending World Hunger.” "
"Following the revelation that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer connected with the Russian government, defenders of the president’s eldest son have offered a familiar argument: Hillary Clinton’s actions were more egregious. President Trump alluded to these comparisons in a Twitter post on Wednesday morning: “Why aren’t the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!” But the same standards don’t apply to the cases surfaced by Mr. Trump’s supporters, experts agreed. Here is an assessment. “Is this Hillary Collusion?” Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, asked in a tweet on Tuesday linking to a WikiLeaks post from February of an email thread between Clinton campaign officials and supporters regarding a meeting with the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai. Mr. Cui “wants to have an informal, private, off-the-record get-together with a few of us to discuss the next year and the current state of U.S.-China affairs,” Kurt Campbell, the former assistant secretary of state for East Asia under President Barack Obama, wrote to John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, and others in January 2016. The replies do not indicate whether the get-together ever took place, though a meeting to discuss foreign policy is common, former diplomats said. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump had promised that his mix of tax cuts, deregulation and reductions in wasteful spending would spur economic growth and cure America’s ailing fiscal health. On Thursday, an independent government analysis of those proposals effectively said, “Not so much.” The Congressional Budget Office cast Mr. Trump’s inaugural budget as overly optimistic, expressing doubt about his promises to balance the federal budget. The budget projected that by 2027, the economy would achieve a small budget surplus. But according to the budget office, the deficit would remain at $720 billion, or 2.6 percent of gross domestic product. The assessment comes after the Trump administration was criticized in May for releasing a budget that economists said relied on overly rosy growth estimates. It was also panned for using questionable math and offering minimal detail about the president’s tax plan, a central component in Mr. Trump’s plans for improving the economy. One of the biggest reasons the Trump budget fell short is that the budget office did not agree that its proposals would generate as much economic growth as the White House has suggested. It said that the average gross domestic product growth over 10 years is currently 1.8, and that under Mr. Trump’s plan it would be 1.9 percent — far lower than the 3 percent the administration assumes. The lack of specifics in Mr. Trump’s plans was also a problem for the Congressional Budget Office. It said that in many cases where Mr. Trump’s policy initiatives lacked details, its analysts had to use place-holder figures. "
"It was a crowded and fiercely competitive season for late-night talk shows, but this year, “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” the topical TBS satire hosted by that “Daily Show” alumna, was one of six to earn an Emmy Award nomination Thursday in the variety talk series category. “Full Frontal” picked up seven nominations in total, including one for its online work and four for its “Not the White House Correspondents Dinner” special, which was held in Washington in April. On Thursday afternoon, Ms. Bee spoke about her nominations and the joy of not having to cover a big news story during a vacation week. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. [ Emmy Interviews: Samantha Bee | Millie Bobby Brown | Claire Foy | Samira Wiley | Evan Rachel Wood ] You had the experience, many times over, of seeing “The Daily Show” receive Emmy nominations. Is it different when it’s your own program being recognized? It’s a whole different ballgame. This is pretty new to me, as it pertains to my own show. It’s totally gratifying. Do you have a strategy for how you handle the nomination announcements? Do you want to watch them as they’re happening? "
"WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders, shaken by last month’s shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice and a spike in threats to their members, want to be able to use campaign funds to tighten lawmakers’ home security. The Federal Election Commission, after some debate, said on Thursday that given the threats, it would approve that use, so long as the improvements were “nonstructural.” The commission unanimously authorized the use of campaign funds to pay for only the installation or upgrade, and the monitoring costs, of cameras, sensors, distress devices and similar security devices in and around lawmakers’ residences. Lawmakers will be required to report those expenses to the commission, but it did not set a cap on how much a lawmaker could spend on the security systems. The commission had previously approved the use of campaign funds for security systems in a few cases, and then only where they said specific, credible threats warranted the expense. But after a gunman opened fire on the baseball team last month as it practiced in nearby Alexandria, Va., the House sergeant-at-arms wrote to the commission requesting it extend the ruling broadly. The shooting has left members of Congress deeply rattled and grappling anew with the risks of being a public official in a time of heightened political tension around the country. Investigators found a list with the names of six members of Congress in a pocket of the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson. In a June 21 letter seeking the commission’s opinion, the sergeant-at-arms, Paul D. Irving, referred to the shooting and said that House lawmakers had received 950 threats in the first six months of 2017. They received 902 in all of 2016. "
"This year’s Emmy nominations were announced on Thursday. James Poniewozik, the chief TV critic for The New York Times, and Margaret Lyons, TV critic for The Times’s TV recommendation site Watching, conducted a brief conversation about this year’s snubs, surprises and most deserving nominees. MARGARET LYONS Do you want to start with the dumbest nomination? “Modern Family”? Just to get that out of the way quickly? There is absolutely no reason “Modern Family” should be nominated ever, ever again. JAMES PONIEWOZIK Let me give the standard TV-critic disclaimer that I have not seen every episode of every season now airing. Maybe Liev Schreiber found new depths in Ray Donovan this year. But Dumbest Nomination is a competitive category. Agreed on “Modern Family” — which was solid, eons ago — but “House of Cards,” always a disposable drama in prestige clothing, crossed straight into unintentional-comedy territory this season, but kept its lifetime pass. LYONS Oh, agreed; “House of Cards” is basically running a scam on us. It’s particularly disheartening in a year — several years — where TV is, you know, really good. When lesser shows take up air on awards shows, I feel ripped off. How can someone watch “The Leftovers” and “House of Cards” and think, “Hm, I prefer ‘House of Cards.’” Wake up, sheeple! "
"KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait — Weary after failing to resolve a bitter dispute among regional allies, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson left the Middle East on Thursday, contrasting the “fragmented” decision making of the United States government with that of Exxon Mobil, the “highly structured” company he once ran. The last stop in his effort at shuttle diplomacy was in Doha, the capital of tiny, gas-rich Qatar, where he consulted on Thursday with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir, about his meetings the day before with the Saudi-led coalition behind the embargo of Qatar — an action that threatens a variety of United States priorities in the region. A meeting Wednesday at the royal airport lounge in Jidda with Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir of Saudi Arabia gave some hope of progress, as the two men huddled for a long talk and then sat nearly knee to knee and simultaneously consulted their cellphones. But Mr. Tillerson left Jidda Wednesday night without even attempting the usual tight-smiled announcements of incremental progress. “I’m tired, I’m tired, been a long trip,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters on his plane after leaving Doha on Thursday. Asked what most surprised him in his new job, he said, “Well, it is a lot different than being C.E.O. of Exxon because I was the ultimate decision maker. That always makes life easier.” He spoke fondly of the discipline that marks the oil giant’s decision-making process. “That allows you to accomplish a lot, to accomplish a lot in a very efficient way,” he said.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Rights advocates around the world are mourning Liu Xiaobo, China’s most prominent political prisoner and a Nobel peace laureate. He died Thursday, still silenced and under guard at a government hospital, his writings still banned. His fate reflects how human rights issues have receded in Western diplomacy with China. Mr. Liu, who kept vigil at Tiananmen Square in 1989 to protect protesters from soldiers and initiated the Charter 08 petition for democracy, had been jailed since 2009. “Even if I am crushed into powder,” he wrote his wife before his trial, “I will embrace you with ashes.” She remains under house arrest. _____ • Tributes to Mr. Liu are pouring out around the world. He is in the pale blue shirt in the photograph above. It was taken at Tiananmen Square on June 3, 1989, just hours before government forces opened fire on the student-led protests. "
"WASHINGTON — The climate-warming influence of greenhouse gas emissions rose more quickly last year than it has in nearly three decades, an increase scientists attributed in part to a strong El Niño weather pattern, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported this week. The Annual Greenhouse Gas Index also shows that the warming ability of global emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily driven by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity, increased 40 percent between 1990 and 2016, a significant measure of man’s influence on the climate. Unlike most news releases accompanying the index during the Obama administration, NOAA’s announcement this year does not directly link human activity to emissions. “The role of greenhouse gases on influencing global temperatures is well understood by scientists, but it’s a complicated topic that can be difficult to communicate,” NOAA officials said in releasing the index. That is a notable shift from last year’s release, in which NOAA declared that “human activity has increased the direct warming effect of carbon dioxide.” In 2014 the agency, which is housed in the Commerce Department, said “the warming influence from human-emitted gases continues to increase.” "
"WASHINGTON — The American economy is doing well enough that senators largely ignored the subject as they questioned Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, for two hours on Thursday morning. Instead, her appearance before the Senate Banking Committee was devoted mostly to regulatory issues. Republicans sought Ms. Yellen’s support for proposals to loosen or eliminate some strictures imposed on financial institutions after the 2008 financial crisis. Democrats pressed her to affirm the importance of those regulations. Ms. Yellen, who has played a crucial role in rebuilding the regulations, made it clear that she was proud of her work. “I believe we have done a great deal since the financial crisis to strengthen the financial system and to make it more resilient,” she told the committee. Asked whether some of the rollbacks proposed by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans might increase the chances of a new crisis, she said, “Some of them, yes.” At the same time, Ms. Yellen was carefully conciliatory, repeatedly agreeing that some rules might be too strict, and expressing a general willingness to consider changes. She also reiterated her support for reducing the regulation of community banks, a popular idea among members of both parties, though specifics are hard to come by. "
"WASHINGTON — Hundreds of people nationwide, including dozens of doctors, have been charged in health care fraud prosecutions, accused of collectively defrauding the government of $1.3 billion, the Justice Department said on Thursday. Nearly one-third of the 412 charged were accused of opioid-related crimes. The health care providers, about 50 of them doctors, billed Medicare and Medicaid for drugs that were never purchased; collected money for false rehabilitation treatments and tests; and gave out prescriptions for cash, according to prosecutors. Some of the doctors wrote more prescriptions for controlled substances in a single month than entire hospitals wrote in that time, the acting director of the F.B.I., Andrew G. McCabe, said at a news conference in Washington of federal law enforcement and health care officials who announced the prosecutions. “This event again highlights the enormity of the fraud challenge we face,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. Arrests were made nationwide over the course of the last week, the Justice Department said, as part of a Medicare fraud task force established in 2007. The more than 400 prosecutions, a record for the task force, covered years of activity and were spread across more than 20 states. In one case, prosecutors said, the owner and operator of a drug-treatment center in Delray Beach, Fla., recruited addicts to aid him in his schemes, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and visiting “crack motels” to persuade people to move to South Florida to help him. He offered kickbacks in the form of gift cards, plane tickets, trips to casinos and strip clubs as well as drugs. "
"Claire Foy received her first Emmy nomination on Thursday for a role that she’s already done playing. The British actress originated the role of Queen Elizabeth II in “The Crown,” the Netflix drama that earned 13 nominations, including Ms. Foy’s for best lead actress in a drama series. Shooting has finished on Season 2, which will debut later this year, and any later seasons will feature a new actress in the role as the character ages. “It’s still very much like it’s part of my life because it hasn’t aired yet and there’s still some postproduction,” Ms. Foy said Thursday. “When I start my next job I’ll kind of go, ‘Aww.’ That will be the moment it’s over and I know I’ll never play her again.” Ms. Foy called from London to discuss the nomination, Season 2 of the drama and what Queen Elizabeth II has in common with James Bond. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

"BEIJING — Liu Xiaobo, China’s only Nobel Peace Prize laureate, catapulted to fame in 1989, when the Communist Party’s violent crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square created an international uproar. Now, nearly three decades later, Mr. Liu has died of cancer while in state custody, a bedridden and silenced example of Western governments’ inability, or reluctance, to push back against China’s resurgent authoritarians. Mr. Liu’s fate reflects how human rights issues have receded in Western diplomacy with China. And it shows how Chinese Communist Party leaders, running a strong state bristling with security powers, can disdain foreign pleas, even for a man near death. “It’s certainly become more difficult,” said John Kamm, an American businessman and founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, who for decades has quietly lobbied China to free or improve the treatment of political prisoners. He said his attempts to win approval for Mr. Liu to leave China for treatment, as Mr. Liu and his wife requested, got nowhere. “I tried my best. I did everything I could,” he said before Mr. Liu died. “Things are pretty difficult right now. It’s hard for me to get the kinds of responses I need.” These days, major Western governments struggle to get responses from China about prisoners and conditions in Tibet and Xinjiang. Many Western politicians have also become less willing to dwell on human rights problems when other issues — North Korea, trade and investment, terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity — fill their meetings with Chinese officials, said rights advocates and experts.

"To the Editor: Re “Israel to U.S. Jews: You Just Don’t Matter” (column, July 12): Thomas L. Friedman claims that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has burned bridges with American Jews. Never mind that he just ordered the accelerated expansion of a pluralistic prayer space at the Western Wall and has consistently demonstrated his passionate commitment to strengthening Israel’s relations with Jewish communities around the world. Mr. Friedman claims that Prime Minister Netanyahu “is setting himself up to be a pivotal figure in Jewish history — the leader who burned the bridges to a two-state solution.” Never mind that the Palestinian leadership turned down repeated offers for statehood, has refused to meet for direct negotiations for nearly a decade, pays terrorists hundreds of millions of dollars each year and continues to call for the disappearance of Israel. Mr. Friedman claims that Prime Minister Netanyahu used “manipulation” in showing President Trump a video of Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. Never mind that the video shows Mr. Abbas himself encouraging violence saying, “We welcome every drop of blood spilled for Jerusalem.” Lastly, Mr. Friedman claims that “runaway Jewish nationalism threatens to meld Israel with the Palestinians in the West Bank.” Never mind that the Palestinians could have had a state of their own in 1937, 1947, 2000 or 2008; instead, they continue to prefer trying to destroy our state rather than build their own.

"At the opening night of the downtown New York discothèque the Electric Circus in June 1967, celebrities including the writer Tom Wolfe, the conductor Seiji Ozawa and members of the Kennedy family danced to throbbing beats under flashing lights. Once described as “part aphrodisiac, part narcotic and part hallucinogen” — and featuring rock bands alongside trapeze artists, puppet shows and a coffee bar called the Think Tank — the Electric Circus welcomed both bohemians and socialites, an eclectic mix of the Andy Warhol and Leonard Bernstein crowds. But few on the ballroom floor at the opening knew that they were frugging to what would become a seminal work of electronic music: the avant-garde composer Morton Subotnick’s “Silver Apples of the Moon,” the 50th anniversary of which will be celebrated with live performances at the Lincoln Center Festival from Thursday, July 20, through Saturday, July 22. “I was dumbfounded when they all danced to it,” Mr. Subotnick said recently, with a laugh. Seated on the deck of his home in Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., a woodsy hamlet an hour north of Manhattan, the composer reflected on that heady period a half-century ago. Back then, he worked late nights at the Electric Circus while developing groundbreaking electronic music at a studio on Bleecker Street once frequented by members of the Grateful Dead and the Velvet Underground. Now 84, he was gregarious and loquacious in an interview: A single question elicited a 20-minute response that invoked Beethoven, Albanian funeral laments, birdsong and Donald J. Trump. Soon after the Electric Circus opened, the label Nonesuch released “Silver Apples of the Moon,” which became a milestone as the first electronic work conceived specifically for the LP medium. The anniversary performances at the Lincoln Center Festival will also include the premiere of Mr. Subotnick’s “Crowds and Power,” a new collaboration with his wife, the vocalist and composer Joan La Barbara, and the video artist Lillevan. The production company Waveshaper Media is raising funds on Indiegogo to complete “Subotnick,” a documentary film. Mr. Subotnick’s long career in electronic music, which influenced artists as disparate as Paul McCartney and Kraftwerk, began with an epiphany. While studying composition in the late 1950s as a graduate student at Mills College, he played regularly as a clarinetist with the San Francisco Symphony. “I was a divided person,” he recalled in a 2008 essay of his separate roles as composer and performer.

"LONDON — They couldn’t agree on whether the baby feels pain. They couldn’t agree on how badly his brain has been damaged. They couldn’t even agree on the size of his head. Lawyers for opposing sides in the case of Charlie Gard, a British infant with a rare genetic disease whose plight has attracted the notice of Pope Francis and President Trump, clashed repeatedly in a London courtroom on Thursday. Charlie’s parents want to allow him to be treated with an experimental therapy pioneered by a neurologist in the United States. The London hospital that is treating Charlie and several courts have found that he is suffering, cannot be saved and should be allowed to die with dignity. Charlie’s parents at one point stormed out of the courtroom, visibly frustrated at the resistance to their bid to keep their son alive. At various points, Connie Yates, his mother, who works with disabled children, shook her head defiantly while her husband, Chris Gard, who works in a company mail room, clasped Charlie’s toy monkey and stared plaintively at the ceiling. Justice Nicholas Francis of the High Court — who in April ruled that the hospital could take the baby off life support, and whose ruling has been repeatedly upheld — appeared frustrated at having to revisit the case. The hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital, asked him to do so, although its position on the case had not changed. He expressed dismay that the two sides could not agree on the size of Charlie’s head — a crucial question, since, medical experts said, brain circumference can indicate damage to the brain. “It is absurd that the science of this case is being infected by the inability to measure a child’s skull,” he said.

"To the Editor: “The Way Forward on North Korea” (editorial, July 5) points out that to call on China to rein in North Korea is a Big Ask. But that does not mean that China would refuse to respond if the United States offered more than appreciation and vague trade deals in exchange. The Big Ask calls for a Big Give. China has a great interest in gaining assurances that if the North Korean regime collapses and the two Koreas are uniﬁed, the United States will not move its troops to the border with China. This is a no-cost or low-cost “give” for Washington because once the North Korean nuclear program folds or the regime collapses, the United States would have little reason to move its troops north. Similarly, the United States could promise to remove the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense missile defense system, which it is installing in South Korea. We do not need this system if the North Korean nuclear program is ended. In addition, the United States might agree to stop the almost daily reconnaissance ﬂights up and down China’s coast lines, which Beijing ﬁnds very troubling and are of little strategic value. Providing China with strong incentives to curb North Korea is a not a substitute for direct talks, which you favor. On the contrary, it will make them more likely to succeed. "
"To the Editor: Re “Rule Could Let Consumers Sue Financial Firms” (front page, July 11): The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s adoption of a new rule prohibiting mandatory arbitration in consumers’ disputes with banks and other financial institutions adds to the growing recognition that regulation is needed to ensure that contracts enhance, rather than restrict, individual liberty. Since Emancipation in the 19th century, American courts have viewed the act of entering into a contract as synonymous with liberty. Yet, by the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish accepted that society needs safeguards around contracts because liberty “requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals and welfare of the people.” Absent the assurance of legal rights, contracts can be used to abuse one party’s dominance over another. By mandating arbitration of claims brought by individual consumers, corporations have used contracts to sidestep the rule of law. The new rule is an important first step in reclaiming the potential of contracts to expand opportunity and freedom. TAL KASTNER, NEW YORK The writer is acting assistant professor at New York University School of Law. To the Editor: Your article about a new rule by the nation’s consumer finance watchdog quotes Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, as saying, “In the last election, the American people voted to drain the D.C. swamp of capricious, unaccountable bureaucrats who wish to control their lives” — a stunning example of Orwellian Newspeak. In other words, although we thought that the Trump “drain the swamp” mantra referred to getting rid of the special interests that rule Washington, according to Mr. Hensarling it means getting rid of the regulators who keep them in check.

"After Hurricane Sandy ravaged the Rockaways in 2012, the coastal neighborhood in Queens underwent a renaissance of sorts. The federal government replenished more than 3.5 million cubic yards of beach sand, enough to fill the Empire State Building two times over, and the city planted six miles of sand dunes. A reinvigorated local food scene has sparked an economic revival. And this spring, the final slab of concrete was laid on a new five-and-a-half-mile boardwalk, with Mayor Bill de Blasio proclaiming its completion a symbol of the area’s resiliency. “This boardwalk is planted firmly, and it will withstand whatever Mother Nature throws at it,” Mayor de Blasio said on a windy Friday in May. But the government’s most ambitious plan to shelter Rockaway from the elements is far from assured. An Army Corps of Engineers project that includes flood walls and levees, and that would significantly enhance the peninsula’s lines of defense against rising sea levels and devastating storms, would cost $4 billion, a hefty price that many observers believe leaves the plan’s future in doubt. An estimated $400 million has been secured so far, Army Corps engineers said. But that money cannot be used until the agency gives the project the final approval. "
"A group of six girls from western Afghanistan will be able to attend an international robotics competition for which they had spent months preparing after the United States this week reversed a decision to deny them entry to the country. The team, from Herat, the third-largest city in Afghanistan, is expected to lead a procession of teams from 157 countries into Constitution Hall in Washington on Sunday night, according to the event organizers. The girls, who are ages 14 to 16, had twice been denied visas, according to Joe Sestak, the former Pennsylvania congressman and Navy admiral who now is president of First Global, the nonprofit organizing the event. But thanks to the help of officials in Washington and, reportedly, the intervention of President Trump, they were ultimately able to secure entry. Another team, from Gambia, was also approved this week after an earlier denial. “Every team has now gotten through, whether it’s Iran, Libya, and even after the reinstitution of the executive order on travel, we still got Yemen and Syrian refugees through,” Mr. Sestak said, referring to the president’s ban on most visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries, including Yemen and Syria but not Afghanistan. Kawsar Roshan, a 15-year-old member of the Afghan team, said she had been working on robots for two years, making multiple machines, including a tricycle and a train. The team began its work at the start of the year and applied for visas in May and June, according to the team’s mentor, Ali Reza Mehraban. Over the past couple of years, as more Afghans have joined an exodus intensified by the country’s insecurity and economic uncertainty, obtaining visas has become much more difficult because of concerns that visitors would seek asylum. Many young Afghans, particularly those on student and visit visas, also cross the border to Canada, knowing that the asylum process is much easier there than in the United States. "
"On Friday, President Trump will celebrate Bastille Day in Paris to reaffirm “America’s strong ties of friendship with France.” More than two centuries ago, the storming of the Bastille was commemorated when the Marquis de Lafayette, then a French government official, gave President George Washington the main key to the demolished fortress — a gift Washington kept without asking for Congress’s permission. Indeed, other early presidents followed this tradition of accepting gifts from other nations without ever seeking congressional consent. This practice is one that Mr. Trump’s legal adversaries ignore as they attempt to redefine the meaning of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause. Federal courts should not allow them to create a new legal restriction on the president’s conduct. The Foreign Emoluments Clause requires those who hold an office of profit or trust under the United States to seek congressional approval before accepting gifts from foreign states. As understood at the time of the framing, only appointed officers hold such positions. In contrast, elected officials do not hold office under the United States, and thus the president is not bound by the clause. If new constraints are to be imposed on the president, they should come from the electorate and Congress, not from the judiciary. The framers of our Constitution gave the president important authority over foreign affairs, including the power to nominate ambassadors, negotiate treaties and receive foreign ambassadors. From the earliest days of the Republic, other nations sought to reciprocate their appreciation by giving presents to the American chief magistrate. In 1791, for example, Washington received, accepted and kept a valuable gilt-framed full-length portrait of King Louis XVI from the French ambassador to the United States. Here too, Washington did not seek congressional consent for this gift. Washington’s conduct was not unique. President Thomas Jefferson received a bust of Czar Alexander I as a diplomatic gift from the Russian government. Likewise, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark returned from their great trek with various diplomatic presents from foreign Indian nations. Jefferson received, accepted and kept these gifts, all absent any congressional consent. Jefferson had fierce political adversaries, but there is no evidence that he was criticized (much less sued or impeached) for continuing the tradition that had been established by Washington. "
"The Trump administration has yet to broker the “toughest deal of all” — that between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Chances seem slim. But Jason Greenblatt, the president’s Middle East envoy, did announce some welcome news at a press conference Thursday in Jerusalem: The Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians will be cooperating on a large water infrastructure project, which will provide billions of gallons of new water supplies for each of the three parties. That project — first announced in December 2013 — will take water from the Red Sea, near Israel’s southernmost city of Eilat, and use gravity to carry the water 137 miles via the kingdom of Jordan to the southern part of the Dead Sea, adjacent to Israel’s Arava desert. There it will be desalinated, with the brine deposited in the shrinking Dead Sea and the fresh water transferred into Israel for still-to-be-built desert farms. In exchange, a water pipeline will be built from Israel into Jordan’s capital, Amman, and Israel will augment the already significant amount of water it provides to the Palestinians in the West Bank, particularly in the Hebron area. The strategic genius of the plan is that it weaves vital economic interests of these sometimes-antagonists together. Even should Jordan or the West Bank someday fall to radical rejectionists, it would be nearly impossible for those leaders to entirely break the water ties established here without creating substantial hardship for their populations. But the biggest news out of the press conference isn’t what amounts to an update on the Red Sea-Dead Sea project. It is that senior water officials from Israel and the Palestinian Authority shared a stage and warmly engaged with each other. It is, so to speak, a high-water mark in Israeli-Palestinian history regarding this precious resource. Following its victory in the 1967 war, Israel took control of the local water infrastructure and administration of the West Bank, as it did nearly all other aspects of civilian life. That changed with the Oslo Agreement of 1995, which created both the Palestinian Authority and a Palestinian Water Authority, the latter being responsible for overseeing water projects in the West Bank and Gaza. Another transformative feature of the 1995 agreement was to alter the balance of power by giving Israel and the Palestinians veto power over each other’s water projects in the West Bank. That encouraged cooperation and led to a steady improvement of water infrastructure for both Israeli settlements and every Palestinian city and town. "
"It seems safe to assume that nobody read Donald Trump Jr.’s damning emails with a Kremlin-connected lawyer more closely than Robert Mueller. Mr. Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, will surely be looking into the now infamous meeting, including the president’s son; the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his campaign chairman at the time, Paul Manafort. As he does, will Mr. Mueller be able to build a case that goes all the way to the top? That could depend on what lessons he learned from overseeing the task force that investigated one of the biggest fraud cases in American history: the collapse of the energy giant Enron. In December 2001, Enron filed what was then the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history. Just weeks later, Mr. Mueller, then the F.B.I. director; Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson; and the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, Michael Chertoff, formed the Enron Task Force, an elite team of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors assigned to investigate and prosecute crimes related to the Houston-based energy trader. Andrew Weissmann, who recently joined Mr. Mueller’s Russia team, later led the task force. The Enron team was patient and learned from its investigative and trial mistakes. After its yearslong run, it set a high-water mark for complex, high-profile financial inquiries, successfully indicting and imprisoning almost all of the company’s top executives. Early on, the Enron team also won a jury conviction of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, Enron’s auditor, on an obstruction-of-justice charge. That experience could prove valuable as the Russia team investigates — among many possible routes — whether President Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director. "
"Shortly after President Trump arrived in France on Friday for an official visit, he took a moment to tell the country’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, what he thought of her physical appearance. “You’re in such good shape,” Mr. Trump told Mrs. Macron, who was standing in a grand marble hall with her back to a camera that recorded the incident. He then turned to the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, and said, “She’s in such good physical shape.” “Beautiful,” Mr. Trump said, turning to the first lady of France. She appeared to grab Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, by the arm and take a step backward. Mrs. Trump stood next to her, smiling. The encounter happened during a tour of the Hôtel National des Invalides, a museum complex in central Paris that houses the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was broadcast live on a Facebook video stream on Mr. Macron’s official Facebook account. A clip of the episode soon spread widely online and in the news media. Mr. Trump has repeatedly commented publicly on the physical appearance of women he has encountered either as a presidential candidate or as president — including the comedian Rosie O’Donnell and, now, the first lady of France. Last month, Mr. Trump was criticized by members of both parties for attacking the cable news host Mika Brzezinski in a string of tweets, describing her as “low I.Q. Crazy Mika” and claiming that at a past meeting she had been “bleeding badly from a facelift.” Earlier in June, Mr. Trump interrupted an Oval Office phone call with the prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, to comment on the physical appearance of Caitriona Perry, a Washington correspondent for Ireland’s national broadcaster. “And where are you from?” Mr. Trump said to Ms. Perry. “Go ahead. Come here, come here. Where are you from? We have all of this beautiful Irish press.” After Ms. Perry introduced herself, Mr. Trump told Mr. Varadkar, “She has a nice smile on her face so I bet she treats you well.” Mr. and Mrs. Trump are in France to celebrate Bastille Day, the French national holiday, and to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the American entry into World War I, a conflict largely fought on French soil.

"The following are excerpts, as prepared and released on Thursday by the White House, from a conversation aboard Air Force One between President Trump and members of the press corps as they flew to Paris on Wednesday night. The conversation was initially thought by the journalists to be off the record. However, the White House changed the terms of the exchange after Mr. Trump asked the pool reporter, who works for The New York Times, why it was not covered and she informed him that the journalists believed they were not allowed to use the material.

When were you last in France? THE PRESIDENT: So I was asked to go by the President, who I get along with very well, despite a lot of fake news. You know, I actually have a very good relationship with all of the people at the G20. And he called me, he said, would you come, it’s Bastille Day — 100 years since World War I. And I said, that’s big deal, 100 years since World War I. SO we’re going to go, I think we’re going to have a great time, and we’re going to do something good. And he’s doing a good job. He’s doing a good job as President. On North Korea, China, and trade: THE PRESIDENT: A big thing we have with China was, if they could help us with North Korea, that would be great. They have pressures that are tough pressures, and I understand. And you know, don’t forget, China, over the many years, has been at war with Korea — you know, wars with Korea. It’s not like, oh, gee, you just do whatever we say. They’ve had numerous wars with Korea. "
"The Breakdown puts a selection of Australia’s daily news into context. Today’s picks: • Senator Scott Ludlam resigns after learning that he has New Zealand citizenship. • A former prime minister defends President Trump. • The debate on cybersecurity and crime continues. • Analyzing an age-old feud on Australia’s roads. How’s this for a Friday surprise: Scott Ludlam, the longtime Greens senator from Western Australia, resigned this afternoon after realizing he was ineligible to serve under the Constitution. Why? Because he’s a dual citizen of Australia and New Zealand. Mr. Ludlam, who was the Greens’ deputy leader, made a name for himself with his stirring, viral-bound speeches and stern antinuclear campaigning. One of his last acts as a member of Parliament was speaking before the United Nations plenary in a week in which it adopted a historic nuclear weapons ban. “It’s not a bad way to go out,” Mr. Ludlam wrote on Facebook. Commenters responding to the announcement were quick to draw comparisons between Mr. Ludlam and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who has long dismissed rumors that he also held British citizenship when he was first elected to Australian Parliament in 1994. Senator Derryn Hinch of Victoria has previously said that Mr. Abbott should produce a dated British citizenship revocation. Late this afternoon, he did. "

"If Robert James Ritchie — also known by his rap-rock moniker, Kid Rock — is running for the United States Senate in Michigan, he hasn’t informed the Michigan Republican Party. Of course, he could be running as a Democrat. But that would be a strange turn, given that Kid Rock endorsed then-candidate Donald J. Trump and then paid him a memorable visit at the White House after Mr. Trump won the election. So what to make of Mr. Ritchie’s new website, “Kid Rock For Senate,” which he said in social media postings on Wednesday was “real” and would be followed by “a major announcement in the near future”? The website currently features a photo of Mr. Ritchie sitting in a chair next to a deer. The bottom of the site has a phrase: “Kid Rock for US Senate 2018.” But it is the center of the site that is most curious: A “Buy Now” link (stashed next to a widget flashing phrases like “Pimp of the Nation” and “Born Free”) which takes viewers to a Warner Bros. Records website that sells merchandise related to a Kid Rock-for-Senate run. Late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Ritchie posted a statement on his website offering little clarification about his intentions.

"WASHINGTON — Senate Republican leaders on Thursday unveiled a fresh proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, revising their bill to help hold down insurance costs for consumers while allowing insurers to sell new low-cost, stripped down policies. Those changes and others, including a decision to keep a pair of taxes on high-income people and to expand the use of tax-favored health savings accounts, were intended to bridge a vast gap between the Senate’s most conservative Republicans, who want less regulation of health insurance, and moderate Republicans concerned about people who would be left uninsured. But Republican leaders will have to battle for votes ahead of a final showdown they hope will come next week. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate, and Rand Paul of Kentucky, a conservative, said they were not swayed — even on a procedural motion to take up the bill for debate. Several others, from both sides of the party’s ideological spectrum, expressed misgivings. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a strong conservative, said, “The new Senate health care bill is substantially different from the version released last month, and it is unclear to me whether it has improved.” But more moderate members were upset by cuts to Medicaid, the health program for low-income people. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia and a moderate voice, expressed “serious concerns about the Medicaid provisions” in the latest draft, and Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, expressed similar concern.

"Chuck Blazer, a Falstaffian figure who helped develop soccer in the United States and then became central to the scandal that exposed widespread international corruption in the sport, died on Wednesday at a hospital in New Jersey. He was 72. His death was confirmed by his lawyer, Mary Mulligan. No cause was given, but Mr. Blazer had rectal cancer and heart disease in recent years. Mr. Blazer was a large man with voracious appetites, not all of them in accordance with the law. On Nov. 25, 2013, as part of a wide-ranging federal investigation into soccer-related improprieties that had started with his own failure to file a personal income tax return, he secretly pleaded guilty to 10 counts of corruption that included racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering. The investigation reached the highest levels of FIFA, soccer’s international governing body; ended the career of its disgraced president, Sepp Blatter; and burst into wide public view in 2015 when surprise arrests were made in Switzerland, where FIFA has its headquarters. A onetime soccer dad who coached his son’s team in New Rochelle, N.Y., Mr. Blazer moved from the local and regional ranks of soccer to become a power broker at its upper levels. With a mane of hair and an unruly beard, he lived an eccentric, extravagant lifestyle. Sometimes he carried a parrot on his shoulder. He was said to have kept two apartments in Trump Tower in Manhattan, one for himself and another mostly for his cats. He was executive vice president of the United States Soccer Federation from 1984 to 1986, and was the second-ranking official in the governing body for soccer in the North American, Central America and Caribbean region, known as Concacaf, from 1990 to 2011. He served as a member of FIFA’s executive committee from 1997 to 2013, a period in which the organization was severely lacking in ethical restraint. "
"Down the road from Declan Varley’s office in Galway, Ireland, is a statue of Pádraic Ó Conaire, a prolific Irish essayist and author. He is regarded as the first great fiction writer in the Irish language. Among his most noted works is the short story “M’asal Beag Dubh,” or “My Little Black Donkey.” It was that story which gave Varley his idea. Though he lives on Ireland’s picturesque, windswept west coast, Varley describes himself as an “avid” fan of Arsenal Football Club in London. A few years ago, Varley, long since accustomed to spending his summers “grasping at every little snippet” of transfer speculation about his team, was scouring the internet for whispers as to which player Arsenal’s manager, Arsène Wenger, would bring to the club. As a journalist — Varley is now group editor at The Galway Advertiser — he found the entire experience frustrating. During the two months of the transfer window, he would spend hours sifting through articles laced with anonymous sources and stripped of verification, all purporting to reveal the identity of Arsenal’s next big signing. “It was all Messi to Arsenal, that sort of thing,” he said. “Based on sand.” Only a handful of the reported moves ever came to pass. The miasma of misinformation prompted Varley to indulge in what he calls “a social experiment,” though others might identify it more accurately as a hoax. He decided he wanted “to see how far a phantom could travel.” So in the summer of 2008, he invented a player. He would be a promising 16-year-old from Moldova, a country distant enough that his fictional roots might not easily be exposed. And his name would come straight from the statue of Ó Conaire. After all, the plot of his short story centers on a character who “knows his donkey is useless, but tries to sell it to the highest bidder,” Varley said. “So there is a correlation with the transfer market.” His player would be a phonetic rendering of Ó Conaire’s title: Masal Bugduv. Long before the ascension of President Trump made the phrase unavoidable, soccer provided the most fertile ground imaginable for what we have come to call “fake news.” "
"Long before the federal government roused itself, individual state governments were fighting to bring discipline to an unruly and untrustworthy corner of the educational market — for-profit schools that saddle students with crushing debt in exchange for degrees that are essentially useless. The states are still fighting the good fight: In a lawsuit filed last week in Federal District Court in Washington, attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia served notice that they will resist any attempt by the Trump administration to weaken or ignore hard-won regulations that protect students and taxpayers from predatory schools. One such attempt has already been identified. This spring, the Education Department abruptly suspended federal rules that allow students who have been defrauded by colleges to have their federal loans forgiven. The state coalition, led by Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts, says that in so doing the department broke the law. The suit asks the court to declare the action illegal and to order the department to implement the rule without delay. The idea of compensating borrowers when schools mislead or defraud them dates back to the 1970s, when federal officials saw that some colleges were looting the federal student aid program while giving students nothing in return. In 1993, Congress ordered the secretary of education to develop a process allowing defrauded students to seek loan forgiveness. The Obama administration streamlined the process after the collapse and bankruptcy, in 2014, of the giant for-profit chain Corinthian, which left thousands of students mired in debt and without degrees. The Obama administration took other important steps. It required schools to provide students with clear information about whether their graduates were earning enough money to pay down their loans. Most crucially, it made sure that schools — not taxpayers — would foot the bill for discharging the loans of students who had been defrauded. The rules were completed last fall, after years of negotiations and a review of more than 10,000 comments from students, colleges, government officials and consumer advocates. But shortly after the Trump administration took office, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos put the most important changes on hold. Ms. DeVos said she was responding to a suit filed by an association representing for-profit colleges, which have fought to block the rules. But the attorneys general believe the move is a natural extension of the department’s new open-door policy toward the for-profit industry. The Department of Education is free to change these rules, but only if it writes new ones in a process laid out in federal law that could take a year or more to run its course. Meanwhile, the court should require the department to enforce the rules that are already on the books. "
"President Trump just concluded a second overseas trip to further advance America’s interests and values, and to strengthen our alliances around the world. Both this and his first trip demonstrated the resurgence of American leadership to bolster common interests, affirm shared values, confront mutual threats and achieve renewed prosperity. Discussions with world leaders highlighted extraordinary potential: vast supplies of affordable energy, untapped markets that can be opened to new commerce, a growing number of young people seeking the chance to build better futures in their homelands and new partnerships among nations that can form the basis for lasting peace. At every opportunity abroad, President Trump articulated his vision for securing the American homeland, enhancing American prosperity and advancing American influence. Meetings in Poland and at the Group of 20 summit conference in Germany focused on building coalitions to get the best possible outcomes for America and for our allies. The United States cannot be a passive member of international organizations. We are working with friends to confront common threats, seize mutually beneficial opportunities and press for solutions to shared problems. In Warsaw, President Trump spoke to the Polish people and reiterated our commitment to mutual support and defense of Poland and our NATO allies against common threats. He affirmed that a “strong Poland is a blessing to Europe” and that “a strong Europe is a blessing to the West and to the world.” He also met with 12 leaders of the Three Seas nations and pledged America’s commitment to expanding access to affordable and reliable energy in the Baltic States, Central Europe and the Balkans. Helping countries diversify their energy sources strengthens economies, creates jobs and prevents adversaries from using energy to intimidate or coerce. During a dinner President Trump hosted with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Hamburg, the leaders agreed on a common strategy to confront the threat of North Korea and ensure the security of Northeast Asia and the United States.

"The biggest lie that President Trump and other Republican leaders have been repeating about the Affordable Care Act for years is that it is collapsing, imploding or exploding. The truth is that the law is actually working reasonably well, and even the part that has shown the most weakness — the health insurance marketplaces — has been stabilizing. Insurers that sell policies to individuals and families are doing better financially than in the first two years of the A.C.A. They are also doing better than they were before the federal and state governments opened the marketplaces in 2014, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report published on Monday. The data showing improvement confirms earlier reports by Standard & Poor’s, the Congressional Budget Office and research groups that were based on 2016 numbers. While there are still problems in marketplaces in some states, the A.C.A., or Obamacare, is hardly coming undone. Yet Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration continue to peddle horror stories about the A.C.A. as they try to gather the votes for repeal of major provisions of the law. To that end, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, says he will present a new version of his health care bill on Thursday. His earlier proposal would take health insurance away from 22 million people and raise premiums for millions of others, according to the C.B.O. There is no indication that the changes he has in mind will meaningfully improve that dreadful legislation. Many Americans who do not get health insurance through employers have been frustrated with the marketplaces. The launch of HealthCare.gov by the Obama administration was disastrous. And the insurance policies have high deductibles and premiums that are unaffordable to many people, because the law did not provide enough subsidies to middle-income families. Insurers did a poor job designing their policies and suffered big losses initially, forcing them to raise premiums even more. Republicans also weakened the markets by repealing provisions meant to stabilize them and by filing a lawsuit to reduce federal subsidies. Despite these challenges, more than 10 million people have bought policies on the marketplaces. Most have been protected from big premium increases through subsidies. Insurers suffered big losses in the early years, in part because many families who had not had comprehensive health insurance for years signed up and needed more care than the average family. Now, the medical costs for people with marketplace plans are more in line with those for people insured through employers. "
"Nobody can talk about anything but Donald Trump Jr. and his Kremlin connections. You probably have some questions. Fire away. If Donald Jr. got convicted of a crime, do you think his father would pardon him? When the latest story about adventures with the Russians first appeared, the president did seem uncharacteristically reserved. He announced, through a spokeswoman, that his son “is a high-quality person,” which sounded as though Junior was a washer-dryer on sale at the mall. It made you wonder if Dad was trying to distance himself a bit. However, Trump finally took to Twitter and announced: “This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!” That sounded much more sympathetic, unless you want to note that the finale of most witch hunts is not executive clemency. Who do you think is Worst Trump Child? Junior has certainly rocketed into the lead. Although frankly, if the president is playing Godfather in this particular drama, all the grown sons are Fredo. That includes son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was in on the meeting with that Russian attorney who was supposed to be bearing dirt on Hillary Clinton. Which Kushner neglected to mention on disclosure forms he filled out when he went to work at the White House. As senior adviser on Middle East peace, reorganizing government, combating drug abuse, China and Mexico. Eric gets credit for keeping a low profile. Really, he hasn’t said anything very strange since he compared waterboarding to a fraternity hazing. Except for the time he said nepotism was “a beautiful thing.” "
"For a year, the refrain from the Trump camp has been a defiant mix of “Lock her up,” “but the emails” and “fake news.” Now it turns out that what was fake wasn’t the news but the Trump denials, that the truly scandalous emails were in the Trumps’ own servers and that the person who may have committed a felony is actually Donald J. Trump Jr. The writer Stephen King put it this way: “The news is real. The president is fake.” The question is where this goes next. I suggest two directions. First, look beyond Donald Trump Jr. to Jared Kushner and to President Trump himself. Second, explore how Trump Jr.’s attempt at collusion with Russians may relate to the bizarre effort by Kushner to set up a secret communication channel with the Kremlin. To back up, just in case you’ve been stuck on a desert island, here’s what you missed this week. Donald J. Trump Jr. received an email in June 2016, eight days after his father clinched the Republican nomination for president, that said the Kremlin had “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary. … This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” In 1960, the Kremlin made a similar offer to support the candidacy of John F. Kennedy against Richard Nixon, but the Kennedy campaign rebuffed it. Likewise, when the Al Gore campaign in 2000 received confidential materials relating to the George W. Bush campaign, it called the F.B.I. "
"What befalls a country riven by a dynasty of deception and disrepute? What comes of a country being forced by its puerile “president” to retreat from its world leadership, set to a soundtrack of world mockery? What to make of an enterprise of corruption that Trump calls a family when they abandon any semblance of propriety and all things we once found appropriate? The America that I know and love is hanging by a thread, and Trump’s scandalous camarilla is playing with the shears. The latest shoe to drop is that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort (campaign chairman at the time) met last summer in Trump Tower with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer because, according to emails released by Trump Jr., he was told that he would receive dirt on Hillary Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support” for his father. Trump Jr.’s response: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.” This is clear evidence of collusion and pushing disturbingly close to the possibility of other crimes including treason, although not quite there yet, from what is publicly known at this point. This may well be the clearest link so far between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but it is far from the first act of misconduct. The entire Trump political era has been an extended exercise in misconduct. Trump is president by a combination of the most despicable factors: a Russian cyberattack, voter suppression, racial anxiety and rampant sexism. People will struggle to explain it in other terms, and some will do so with dazzling language that apes the tone and tenor of intellectualism, but at its base an explanation that ignores those factors is a lie. It is a lie that covers a cyst. It is a lie that shields a sickness. It is a lie that excuses the inexcusable. "
"The election of President Trump has coincided with a reaction among Republican voters against open-mindedness, open borders and an open society in general — not to mention a growing hostility to cognitive elites. Take a recent survey showing a fundamental shift in the attitude of Republicans toward the value of higher education. Between 2010 and 2017, the Pew Research Center asked voters whether colleges and universities have a positive or negative effect “on the way things are going in the country.” From 2010 to 2015, solid majorities of Republicans and Democrats agreed that institutions of higher learning had a positive effect on America. In 2010, Republicans were 58-32 positive and Democrats 65-22. For Democrats, this pattern grew stronger over time, reaching 72-19 in the most recent polling in June. That was not the case for Republicans, who flipped from positive to negative on college education. In a survey that was conducted from Aug. 23 to Sept. 2, 2016 — a month after Trump accepted his party’s nomination — Republicans’ positive assessment of colleges and universities fell to 43 percent, while negative assessments rose to 45 percent. By June of this year, 58 percent of Republicans had a negative view of higher education and 36 percent a positive view. Wariness toward homegrown cognitive elites now parallels suspicion of foreign-born entrepreneurs, including those who generate jobs and wealth for Americans. "

John Oliver, the host of the comedy-news show “Last Week Tonight,” is on a two-week vacation.

He expressed a particular bafflement at Donald Trump Jr.’s apparent indifference in the face of a growing scandal. Mr. Oliver said that his team’s old off-air jokes about the Trump administration were proving prescient. President Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning to assure his supporters that he was not spending too much time watching TV — something that made Stephen Colbert a little uneasy. That tweet may have been a response to Politico’s report this week that Mr. Trump “is using his relatively light schedule to watch TV and fume.” "
"PARIS — President Trump on Thursday defended his eldest son’s decision last June to meet with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer during the election campaign, saying “most people would have taken that meeting” and “nothing happened from the meeting, zero happened from the meeting.” “My son is a wonderful young man,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference in Paris with President Emmanuel Macron of France. “He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Not a government lawyer; a Russian lawyer.” Mr. Trump came to Paris at the invitation of Mr. Macron to take part in Bastille Day celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of America’s entry into World War I. As the two leaders, an odd couple on the international stage, faced the news media after a private meeting at the Élysée Palace, they sought to play down sharp differences over trade, immigration and climate change. Mr. Macron looked on as the president defended his son in the scandal over possible links between Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government. Mr. Trump said Donald Trump Jr. had merely been responding to a person offering opposition research on his opponent, Hillary Clinton — a common practice in presidential campaigns. “Politics is not the nicest business,” he said, noting that he had received similar offers.

"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Watata Mwenda’s family had it good. There was no electricity in their village in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but Mr. Mwenda, an itinerant salesman of cattle, gold and other commodities, could afford a battery to power a television. They lived in a brick-and-mortar house, with enough room for his nine children and then some. There was always food on the table. “Ah, we lived well in the Congo,” Mr. Mwenda, 60, said this week in French, one of the languages he learned in his travels. But eight years ago, six militiamen invaded the family compound, murdered his oldest son and his son’s wife and briefly kidnapped Mr. Mwenda. The family left everything behind, and after four days of travel by foot, car and dinghy made it to safety in a refugee camp more than 1,000 miles away in Malawi. This month, they were again lucky to make a skin-of-their-teeth escape, when an International Organization for Migration vehicle pulled into the camp and transported them to an airport, with one-way tickets to the United States. That made them one of the last refugee families without close relations in the country to be allowed in before President Trump’s moratorium took effect. Beginning Thursday, only refugees who have a “bona fide relationship” with a close relative or entity in the United States will be eligible to enter for the next 120 days, following a June 26 Supreme Court order that allowed part of Mr. Trump’s travel ban to proceed.

"Few, if any, literary philosophers have had as much influence on American business and politics as Ayn Rand, especially now that Donald J. Trump occupies the White House. President Trump named Rand his favorite writer and “The Fountainhead” his favorite novel. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has cited “Atlas Shrugged” as a favorite work, and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, said the book “really had an impact on me.” As Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, put it in a recent essay, “her books pretty well capture the mind-set” of the Trump administration. “This new administration hates weak, unproductive, socialist people and policies,” he wrote, “and it admires strong, can-do profit makers.” In business, Rand’s influence has been especially pronounced in Silicon Valley, where her overarching philosophy that “man exists for his own sake, that the pursuit of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose, that he must not sacrifice himself to others, nor sacrifice others to himself,” as she described it in a 1964 Playboy interview, has an obvious appeal for self-made entrepreneurs. Last year Vanity Fair anointed her the most influential figure in the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs. But lately, many Rand devotees have been running into trouble. Travis Kalanick’s abrupt departure as chief executive of Uber, the Internet-based ride-hailing service he built into a private corporation worth $50 billion or more, is the latest Icarus-like plunge of a prominent executive identified with Rand. The hedge fund manager Edward S. Lampert, who some say has applied Rand’s Objectivist principles to the management of Sears and Kmart, has driven those venerable retailers close to bankruptcy. "
"A federal appeals court on Thursday overturned the 2015 corruption conviction of Sheldon Silver, once the powerful speaker of the New York State Assembly, saying the judge’s jury instructions were in error in light of a United States Supreme Court decision that has since narrowed the legal definition of corruption. Mr. Silver was convicted on charges that he had obtained nearly $4 million in illicit payments in return for taking a series of official actions that benefited others. But in the jury instructions, the judge’s explanation of an official action was too broad, the appeals court found, because it swept in some conduct that the Supreme Court’s decision would now exclude. Federal prosecutors quickly vowed to retry the case, noting that the appeals court said that the evidence against Mr. Silver was legally sufficient to support a conviction. The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, was nonetheless a startling development that buttressed Mr. Silver’s reputation as a man whose resilience and influence in New York once seemed boundless. The panel cited the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision involving Bob McDonnell, a former Republican governor of Virginia, that came seven months after Mr. Silver was convicted. Mr. McDonnell had arranged meetings for and attended events with a benefactor who had provided the governor and his wife with gifts worth more than $175,000. The Supreme Court ruled that official action must involve formal and concrete government actions or decisions, like holding a hearing or filing a lawsuit, and not routine political courtesies. The McDonnell ruling has had a broad ripple effect, with defense lawyers raising it in corruption cases around the country. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Hollywood depictions of the drug trade have commonly focused on the East Coast — think “Scarface” in Miami or “The Wire” in Baltimore. Now comes a television drama created by John Singleton, best known for “Boyz N the Hood,” that explores crack cocaine’s infiltration of South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s. His show, “Snowfall,” had its series premiere last week on FX and airs Wednesday nights. We caught up with Mr. Singleton, 49, who grew up in South Central, by phone. Some excerpts: Q. What was South Central like before crack hit? A. No bars on the windows. Not a lot of people fenced in their homes. A lot more kids played in the street. You could go to different neighborhoods, make friends in different neighborhoods. Then once this went down, it was just totally different. It wasn’t about going into Watts and hanging out with some friends because, you know, they were in business. It became about business. What misconceptions do people have about the crack epidemic? The biggest misconception is that the urban population came up with the idea for crack. It wasn’t something that started in the urban community. But they were the most affected by it. "
"SHANGHAI — At an ocean research center on Hainan Island off China’s southern coast, officials routinely usher visitors into a darkened screening room to watch a lavishly produced People’s Liberation Army video about China’s ambitions to reassert itself as a great maritime power. As enormous, new naval vessels plow through high seas, a deep male voice intones: “China’s oceanic and overseas interests are developing rapidly. Our land is vast, but we will not yield a single inch to foreigners.” The 2015 video is one of many signs that China is seeking to emulate the United States’ 19th-century policy of taking exclusive control of security in the Western Hemisphere by excluding foreign powers from the region. Without officially saying so, China hopes to impose a modern version of the Monroe Doctrine on its surrounding oceans. As formulated in 1823 by John Quincy Adams, then secretary of state to President James Monroe, the Monroe Doctrine said the United States would not accept further colonization by European powers of countries in the Western Hemisphere. Over the succeeding decades, the doctrine came to be interpreted more broadly, culminating with the idea in the early 20th century that the United States regarded the Americas as its exclusive sphere of interest, meaning that it reserved the right to intervene in neighboring countries and would not allow European nations to project power in the region. What China’s leaders have said amounts to easily decipherable code language for their own version of this policy. On the one hand, they say Asia should be governed by Asians. On the other hand, they say that since time immemorial the South China Sea has belonged to and has been controlled by China. This means that “outside” powers should butt out, leaving China with its disproportionate size, wealth and might to reign supreme over its entire neighborhood. Beijing has backed up its coded language with actions that have agitated its neighbors. It has built up military outposts on islets in disputed waters in the South China Sea, while dismissing other countries’ territorial concerns out of hand and ignoring international law. These actions have confronted the United States Navy with the choice between somehow enforcing longstanding international law governing maritime territorial claims and conduct or accepting Chinese control of these seas as a fait accompli.

"WASHINGTON — When President Trump addressed employees of the Department of Homeland Security, just five days after being sworn in, he essentially had one issue on his mind: cracking down on illegal immigration. Absent from the speech was any mention of the department’s other responsibilities, like protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure, including computer systems, ensuring airline passenger safety or even protecting the president himself. The address in January, critics said, reflected the president’s nearly single-minded priority for the Department of Homeland Security, which employs nearly 250,000 people in seven agencies. “It’s all immigration, it’s the wall and it’s enforcement,” said Juliette Kayyem, a Homeland Security official in the Obama administration. “Nothing about FEMA or cyber or counterintelligence,” she added, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Just immigration all the time.” Homeland Security officials reject the idea that the agency is too focused on immigration. Officials noted that Mr. Trump signed an executive order on cybersecurity and has proposed adding money and staff to the agency’s cybersecurity efforts. The officials add that the president appointed Brock Long, an experienced emergency management official, to head FEMA. Mr. Long was confirmed, 95 to 4, by the Senate. "
"Britain appears to be going the extra mile to land Saudi Aramco’s blockbuster initial public offering. The Financial Conduct Authority, a British financial regulator, unveiled potential new rules on Thursday that would make it easier for state-owned companies to list on the London Stock Exchange. There’s one very big Middle Eastern oil concern that is preparing an initial public offering: Saudi Aramco, the behemoth that powers Saudi Arabia’s economy. The kingdom is seeking to list about 5 percent of Aramco, at a valuation of some $2 trillion. (Bankers say the figure should be a lot lower.) Exchanges worldwide have been competing hard for the listing, which would come next year. London’s biggest rival, according to analysts, is probably the New York Stock Exchange. What the F.C.A. proposes is to create a category of premium listing specifically for state-owned companies. The twist: Interactions between these corporations and their sovereign controlling owners won’t be treated as related-party transactions, meaning they won’t require approval by other shareholders. Here’s what the regulator’s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, had to say: Google has scored a victory in one of its European legal battles. A French court said on Wednesday that the technology company did not have to pay $1.3 billion in back taxes. The case had focused on whether Google had avoided taxes in France by routing five years’ worth of sales there through a subsidiary in Ireland. The court ruled that the Irish unit was not taxable in France. "

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • A new era in medicine. A Food and Drug Administration panel unanimously recommended on Wednesday that the agency approve the first gene therapy in the U.S. to fight cancer. The treatment, for a type of leukemia, genetically alters a patient’s cells, transforming them into what scientists call “a living drug” that bolsters the immune system. The F.D.A. is likely to accept the recommendation, and other gene therapies are expected. •  Conspiracy or coincidence? News about a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer has raised additional questions about interference in the 2016 election. Here’s a rundown of events over a two-month period last year. Mr. Trump had been promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton via the Russian government. Campaign opposition research is standard, but not from hostile nations. We introduce you to two unlikely players in the events: an entertainment publicist and a Russian pop star. "

t was a freakishly warm evening last October when a maintenance worker first discovered the water — torrents of it, rushing into the entrance tunnel of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a storage facility dug some 400 feet into the side of a mountain on a Norwegian island near the North Pole. A storm was dumping rain at a time of year when the temperature was usually well below freezing; because the water had short-circuited the electrical system, the electric pumps on site were useless. This subterranean safe house holds more than 5,000 species of essential food crops, including hundreds of thousands of varieties of wheat and rice. It was supposed to be an impenetrable, modern-day Noah’s ark for plants, a life raft against climate change and catastrophe. Local firefighters helped pump out the tunnel until the temperature dropped and the water froze. Townspeople from the village at the mountain’s base then brought their own shovels and axes and broke apart the ice sheet by hand. A few Norwegian radio stations and newspapers reported the incident at the time, but it received little international attention until May, when it was becoming clear that President Trump was likely to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. Suddenly the tidings from Svalbard were everywhere, in multiple languages, with headlines like “World’s ‘Doomsday’ Seed Vault Has Been Breached by Climate Change.” It didn’t matter that the flood happened seven months earlier, or that the seeds remained safe and dry. We had just lived through the third consecutive year of the highest global temperatures on record and the lowest levels of Arctic ice; vast swaths of permafrost were melting; scientists had recently announced that some 60 percent of primate species were threatened with extinction. All these facts felt like signposts to an increasingly hopeless future for the planet. And now, here was a minifable suggesting that our attempts to preserve even mere traces of the bounty around us might fall apart, too. The seed vault is perhaps the best-known project in a growing global campaign to cache endangered phenomena for safekeeping. Fortunately — the leak snafu notwithstanding — scientists, governments and even private companies have become quite good over the last decade at these efforts to bank nature. The San Diego Zoo’s Frozen Zoo cryogenically preserves living cell cultures, sperm, eggs and embryos for some 1,000 species in liquid nitrogen. Inside the National Ice Core Laboratory, in Lakewood, Colo., a massive freezer contains roughly 62,000 feet’s worth of rods of ice from rapidly melting glaciers and ice sheets in Antarctica, Greenland and North America. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington maintains the world’s largest collection of frozen exotic-animal milk, from mammals large (orcas) and small (critically endangered fruit bats), in order to help researchers figure out how to nourish the most vulnerable members of any species: babies. An international project called Amphibian Ark engages in ex situ conservation by relocating amphibians, the most endangered class of animal, indoors for safekeeping and sperm collection. It seems to be a human impulse to collect things just as they’re vanishing. During the Renaissance, wealthy merchants and aristocrats exhibited their personal compendiums of mastodon bones, fossils and all manner of dried, pickled and stuffed creatures in what were called cabinets of curiosity. Some anthropologists believe their discipline emerged when Europeans began to experience a sort of nostalgia for the native populations they had wiped out with their diseases and guns. That feeling sent them scurrying off to gather up ethnographies, dying languages and sometimes even living subjects. Zisis Kozlakidis, the president of the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories, an organization that represents some 1,300 biobanks containing specimens like viruses and the reproductive cells of clouded leopards, told me a collecting rush is underway, which he likened to an international space race. “There is,” he said, “a very intense feeling that we’re losing biodiversity quicker than we can understand it.” "
"• “Saturday Night Live” and “Westworld” lead the pack with 22 nominations each. • HBO leads all the networks with 111 nominations and Netflix comes in second with 91 nominations. • Streaming services scored four of seven Best Drama nominations, with Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” “The Crown” and “House of Cards” and Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” all getting recognized. • The awards show will be held Sept. 17 at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. Stephen Colbert will host the ceremony, which will be broadcast by CBS. At least by the standards of this sometimes relentlessly predictable awards show, this will be a year of change at the Emmy Awards, with many first-time nominees populating several major categories.
