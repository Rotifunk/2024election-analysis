"On CNN, the legal journalist Jeffrey Toobin was in red-alert mode, denouncing President Trump’s firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, as “a grotesque abuse of power” and “the kind of thing that goes on in non-democracies.” Over on Fox News, the mood was more sanguine — even celebratory. “This was overdue, and everyone in Washington knows that,” Tucker Carlson declared at the top of his broadcast before introducing a series of guests who echoed his excitement. The nation’s political divide has been on full display in the news media in the hours since Mr. Comey’s abrupt ejection from his post on Tuesday evening — and the lines are brighter than ever. By Wednesday, the left-leaning HuffPost featured a one-word, all-capital headline: “Nixonian.” The right-leaning Breitbart News approvingly declared Mr. Trump’s move “the latest in a political outsider’s crusade against entrenched Washington.” In an interview that dominated its home page on Wednesday, Breitbart quoted a former assistant director of the bureau, James Kallstrom, saying of Mr. Comey, “He threw the reputation of the F.B.I. under the bus.” Mr. Kallstrom was also a guest on Fox News on Tuesday, telling the anchor Martha MacCallum that Mr. Comey “danced with the devil.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s stunning firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, injected another volatile ingredient into the partisanship already engulfing the capital and threatened to overwhelm Republican efforts to convert their government control into legislative success. The decision to oust Mr. Comey also increased the prospect of another confirmation fight in the Senate, as Mr. Trump promised to move quickly to replace Mr. Comey, who had overseen the inquiry into Russian meddling in the election. And the White House’s handling of the dismissal — and apparent failure to anticipate the severe backlash it would generate — renewed questions about the competence of administration officials and their ability to navigate Washington. After the House finally managed to pass a Republican health care proposal last week, divisive as it was, congressional Republicans suddenly found themselves trying to explain how Mr. Trump was within his rights in jettisoning Mr. Comey. Democrats quickly coalesced around a push for a special prosecutor to take control of the Russia inquiry, saying the leadership of the Justice Department could not be trusted with the job after the termination of the F.B.I. chief on what they considered spurious grounds. “Clearly, the time is now for an independent prosecutor,” Senator Christopher Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Wednesday. “The Senate, designed by the founding fathers as the guardian of democratic norms, must now rise to meet the gravity of this moment.” To emphasize that gravity, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, summoned his colleagues to sit at their desks as the Senate convened Wednesday morning to take in whatever the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, had to say about the firing.

"As Tom Price, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, headed to a meeting at the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston on Tuesday, a reporter from the Public News Service trailed after him in a hallway. The reporter, Dan Heyman, wanted to ask about the health care legislation the House passed last week to replace the Affordable Care Act. With his Android smartphone in hand to use as an audio recorder, Mr. Heyman said in an interview on Wednesday, he reached over some of the staff and security members surrounding Mr. Price. According to an audio recording Mr. Heyman provided, he asked whether domestic violence was going to be a pre-existing condition under the new legislation. “Do you think that’s right, or not?” he called out. He asked twice more and when there was no response, Mr. Heyman said: “You refuse to answer? Tell me no comment.” Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, was with Mr. Price, and at one point in the recording, a man’s voice is heard saying: “Do not get close to her. Back up.” "

"GALVESTON, Tex. — Inside a bungalow under renovation, Jonathan Scott, one half of the squeaky-clean Property Brothers, was yanking a toilet out from the floor. “Let’s do it one more time,” said a producer, watching from a nearby monitor. Mr. Scott walked into the small bathroom again, acting surprised as he spied the toilet. Then he pulled it from the floor. The scene was being shot for the fifth season of “Brother vs. Brother,” the HGTV program in which the highly competitive Scott brothers use equal sums of their own money (in this case $600,000) to buy, renovate and then sell houses in the same town. All proceeds go to charities like Habitat for Humanity. This Galveston season will make its premiere on May 31. Mr. Scott, who is a perfect mix of rugged and well coifed, a man who gets his work boots dirty even as his hair stays untousled, went for a house that could be considered a major fixer-upper. His identical twin brother, Drew, who is as handsome if not quite as hair-sprayed, and favors suits and ties over Timberlands, opted for a ramshackle heap that was larger and had better access to some of the island’s canals. “He’s desperate to win,” said Jonathan, who has won on the last two seasons of the show. “I was also born first, so I also won that competition,” he said, a joke typical of the brothers’ repartee both on- and offscreen.

"WASHINGTON — These are not happy times at the F.B.I. Morale at the country’s premier law enforcement agency plummeted months ago, after James B. Comey, its director, revived the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server in October and plunged the bureau back into the political maelstrom just before the election. Then President Trump fired Mr. Comey on Tuesday, saying he had mishandled the Clinton investigation, and the mood darkened again. Agents said they were stunned that Mr. Trump would fire Mr. Comey in the midst of an F.B.I. investigation into whether any of the president’s associates had conspired with Russia to swing the election in favor of Mr. Trump. Some said in interviews that news of the firing felt like a gut punch. Others wondered whether they would be able to continue the inquiry. One senior F.B.I. official said that the president had severely damaged his standing among agents, many of whom are conservative and supported Mr. Trump as a candidate. Agents were angered by the way Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey, who learned of his dismissal from television reports while he was in Los Angeles. They called it disrespectful. "
"President Trump’s firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was both highly unusual for a president and highly consequential, according to a panel of governance experts surveyed by The Upshot. To help put Mr. Comey’s dismissal into context, we asked the panel to rate its normality and its importance, as we did about events during President Trump’s first month and first 100 days. The consensus is that the dismissal was the most significant action so far in this presidency, and among the most abnormal. The closest event to this one in aggregate was Mr. Comey’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the presidential election. Removing Mr. Comey was highly unusual, though not without precedent, the experts said. F.B.I. directors generally serve 10-year terms, but President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions in 1993 because of ethical lapses. However, Mr. Comey’s firing was more unusual and important because he was overseeing the Russia investigation, they said. Questions about what will happen with that investigation now that he is gone are the main reason they said his firing is likely to be highly significant, with long-term ramifications for policy and government. F.B.I. directors’ 10-year terms are in place “precisely to avoid undermining the directors’ independence in investigating high officials,” said Erica Chenoweth, a professor of international studies at the University of Denver.

"To the Editor: Re “What Is the Antiquities Act, and Why Does the President Want to Change It?” (news article, April 27): America’s public lands are under threat from a variety of extractive industries. Some narrow-minded people want to privatize all Western lands; others wish to rescind the protections on beloved national monuments and parks. President Trump’s hypocritical executive order to review the national monument designations in the name of overturning a “massive federal land grab” is part of a thinly disguised recycling of the rhetoric of the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s and 1980s in support of the fringe right and its agenda to appropriate or sell off public land and resources. Their goal is succinct: They want to take down the signs that read “Welcome to Your Public Lands” and replace them with new ones that read “Private Property: No Trespassing.” It is questionable if this action would even temporarily increase the fortunes of extractive industries in Western states. It would certainly impoverish all Americans through the degradation of fragile landscapes and the disposal of the public domain. ROBERT CRIFASI, BOULDER, COLO.

"The director of the Census Bureau announced Tuesday that he would be retiring next month, an abrupt departure that will leave the agency without a leader as it negotiates a funding shortage in the lead-up to the 2020 census. John H. Thompson, who had served at the bureau since 1975 and became its director in August 2013, will step down on June 30, according to a statement released by the Department of Commerce on Tuesday. The commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, thanked Mr. Thompson for his decades of public service in a statement, saying that “a complete and accurate census is an important and monumental task, and your experience will be greatly missed.” His successor has not been named. Mr. Thompson’s announcement comes as funding issues have delayed field tests at the bureau, and led experts to express concern about the 2020 census, as well as a comprehensive field test scheduled for next year. Representative José Serrano, a New York Democrat and the ranking member on the House Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, signaled his unease about Mr. Thompson’s retirement in a statement on Tuesday. “We need robust funding for the Census Bureau in order to have to a successful and accurate operation in 2020,” he said. “Without strong leadership at the Bureau, this vital mission will be imperiled.” "
"Jessica Colotl embodied the debate over illegal immigration when she was locked up for 37 days and nearly sent back to Mexico after an Atlanta-area police officer caught her driving without a license in 2010. To supporters, including her sorority sisters, the president of her college and the immigrant advocates who publicized her case, hers was an example of police overreach and the need to safeguard ambitious young students from deportation. To others, she was an illegal immigrant, plain and simple, who also was abusing the system by attending a public college at discounted tuition. She returned to college — paying full price, because of a new Georgia law inspired by her case — completed her degree and qualified for a program started by President Barack Obama in 2012, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which protects some undocumented youth from deportation. “Since then, I have been working and doing well for myself,” Ms. Colotl, now 28, said in an interview this week. “I thought that all the legal battles were behind me.” That was until Ms. Colotl, who was brought to the United States by her parents as a child, learned Monday that her DACA status had been revoked, thrusting her into the national immigration debate anew. With a new president in the White House, she is once again facing deportation. Dustin Baxter, Ms. Colotl’s lawyer, on Tuesday requested that a federal judge in Atlanta intervene and reinstate her DACA protection. "
"In my roughly 20 years working in the federal policy arena, few things have become clearer to me than the importance of data. If something is not counted, it is neither seen nor understood. For all intents and purposes, it does not exist. That’s why the Trump administration’s decision not to collect data on the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans threatens these communities in ways that are both symbolic and practical. It was announced Tuesday that the United States Census Bureau director, John H. Thompson, had abruptly stepped down from his job, drawing national attention to the agency. But I and others in the L.G.B.T. community have been focused on the bureau’s work for months — for reasons related not to its leadership, but to the collection of information. In March, when it published a list of planned subjects for data collection that included a proposed question on these topics, many of us were optimistic. After years of advocating this very change, there was a possibility that we might be more fully counted. But that cheer was to be short lived. The Census Bureau quickly clarified that it had “inadvertently listed sexual orientation and gender identity as a proposed topic” and made changes to the online document within hours. During the same month, the Department of Health and Human Services eliminated questions about L.G.B.T. people from drafts of two critical surveys: the National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants, which helps inform social and nutritional support programs for seniors; and the Centers for Independent Living Annual Program Performance Report, which helps inform programs designed to allow people with disabilities to live independently. This is concerning, because sound policy relies on good data, which in turn relies on robust data collection. The federal government needs to understand the American public if it is to devise policy that directly affects it. Such understanding is impossible without data collection. That’s why the U.C.L.A. School of Law’s Williams Institute think tank and SAGE, an organization dedicated to improving the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender older adults, have called for better data on older L.G.B.T. people.

"WASHINGTON — In a surprising victory for President Barack Obama’s environmental legacy, the Senate voted on Wednesday to uphold an Obama-era climate change regulation to control the release of methane from oil and gas wells on public land. Senators voted 51 to 49 to block consideration of a resolution to repeal the 2016 Interior Department rule to curb emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming greenhouse gas. Senators John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine, all Republicans who have expressed concern about climate change and backed legislation to tackle the issue, broke with their party to join Democrats and defeat the resolution. The vote also was the first, and probably the only, defeat of a stream of resolutions over the last four months — pursued through the once-obscure Congressional Review Act — to unwind regulations approved late in the Obama administration. It also could worsen the Trump administration’s problems on Capitol Hill, where there are signs the president’s grip on his party is loosening. “People of America and people of the world can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. In anticipation of Republican defections, President Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence to the Senate floor to break a tie vote. But with three members of his own party breaking away, Mr. Pence could do nothing. "
"WASHINGTON — Days before he was fired as F.B.I. director, James B. Comey asked the Justice Department for more prosecutors and other personnel to accelerate the bureau’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the presidential election. It was the first clear-cut evidence that Mr. Comey believed the bureau needed more resources to handle a sprawling and highly politicized counterintelligence investigation. His appeal, described on Wednesday by four congressional officials, was made to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, whose memo was used to justify Mr. Comey’s abrupt dismissal on Tuesday. It is not yet known what became of Mr. Comey’s request, or what role — if any — it played in his firing. But the future of the F.B.I.’s investigation is now more uncertain than at any point since it began in late July, and any fallout from the dismissal is unlikely to be contained at the bureau. Two separate congressional inquiries into Russian meddling are relying on evidence and intelligence being amassed by the F.B.I., and if the bureau’s investigation falters, the congressional inquiries are likely to be hobbled. Perhaps for this reason, Mr. Comey’s firing appears to have imbued the Senate Intelligence Committee with a renewed sense of urgency. "
"Like so many entrepreneurs who have opened vaping shops lately, Stephen D’Angelo was a heavy smoker who finally kicked nicotine after switching to electronic cigarettes, which he viewed as a healthier — and less smelly — alternative. Mr. D’Angelo runs a 500-square-foot store on a suburban corner in Hartsdale, N.Y., and, after seven months in business, has just started to turn a profit. But now his future — and those of thousands of other vaping entrepreneurs who have gotten into the business recently — is cloudy, since new Food and Drug Administration regulations seem poised to clamp down on e-cigarettes for health reasons. The regulations, which the agency imposed in August 2016 and are set to go into full effect in August 2018, require costly testing of all vaping products, and offer new guidelines on manufacturing, sales, packaging and advertising of e-cigarettes. The agency said it would begin to review the health risks of all e-cigarettes introduced since early 2007, and potentially ban products it deemed harmful. Some people anticipate that President Trump, with his oft-stated pro-business stance, will slow the regulations or stop them from going into effect. But that is small comfort to those whose livelihoods depend on e-cigarettes and who credit vaping with turning their lives around. “Before I quit smoking, I was coughing like crazy,” said Mr. D’Angelo, whose mother, a three-pack-a-day smoker, died of emphysema at age 69. Vaping, he said, “really helped me get off cigarettes.” “Now if I can help someone stop smoking and add five or six years to their life,” he added, “I’ve accomplished something.” "

"Once again, Donald Trump has done something that no president before him dared to do. This time, he has fired an F.B.I. director engaged in an active and continuing investigation of his own campaign. The decision reflects President Trump’s most autocratic instincts, showcasing his contempt for the independence of federal investigators as well as for the basic search for truth. Given his frequent calls to prosecute Hillary Clinton for using a private email server, the anger he directed at the F.B.I. director, James Comey, for giving her a “free pass,” and reports that he directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to find a reason to fire Mr. Comey, it’s hard to believe the president’s claim that he made his decision out of concern for Mr. Comey’s harsh treatment of Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. But if Mr. Trump actually hopes to shut down or limit the F.B.I. investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia, he may well be disappointed. History suggests that his decision is likely to backfire, producing new leaks and heightened inquiries that will be more difficult to control than he imagines. President Trump may think he has sent a stern warning to leakers and independent bureaucrats unwilling to toe the White House line. Instead, he may well have incited an internal rebellion. That’s what happened in 1972, when President Richard Nixon suddenly found himself in a position to replace J. Edgar Hoover, the long-serving and infamous F.B.I. director. Suspicious of the F.B.I.’s independence, Nixon tried to appoint a successor who would bring the bureau under White House influence. To his surprise, he set in motion the events that led to the Watergate scandal — and ultimately to his own resignation. Nixon did not fire Hoover. Indeed, no president had the chutzpah to fire Hoover, who took office in 1924 under Calvin Coolidge and went on to serve seven other presidents — four Democrats and three more Republicans. According to popular myth, Hoover achieved this astonishingly long tenure by blackmailing politicians with tidbits from his secret files. In truth, though he was hardly above arm-twisting and gossip-mongering, much of his power came from more mundane sources, including his skill at promoting the F.B.I.’s nonpartisan image. "
"WASHINGTON — What a day for President Trump’s first face-to-face meeting with a top Russian official. Only hours after dismissing James B. Comey as director of the F.B.I., amid an investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russian officials, the president met with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, at the White House. The Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak — best known to many Americans as the man who discussed lifting sanctions on Russia with Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser — was also in the Oval Office for the meeting. The world’s only glimpse of this session came from the Russian news agency Tass, which distributed photos of the meeting, with a grinning Mr. Trump shaking hands with the two visitors. No reporters were allowed in to ask questions — though they were ushered in minutes later for Mr. Trump’s session with Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state. And, at the State Department, there was no briefing on an earlier meeting between Mr. Lavrov and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Tillerson is famously reluctant to talk with the press. So that left the field clear for Mr. Lavrov, who has now sat opposite four American secretaries of state and knows how to work the news media well, to describe the conversations. And he did exactly that, inviting reporters to the Russian Embassy in Washington while Mr. Tillerson said almost nothing. The firing of Mr. Comey was the main subject from the start: When Mr. Tillerson greeted his Russian counterpart in the diplomatic reception room on the seventh floor of the State Department, a reporter shouted a question about whether Mr. Comey’s dismissal “cast a shadow” on the meeting.

"When American Tomahawk missiles slammed into the airfield from which Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad launched chemical weapons against his own people, it was a new twist in the seemingly endless Syrian civil war. New, at least in this conflict — and new to the neophyte administration of President Trump. But by no means was it new to those familiar with interventions by the United States and its Western allies into other conflicts across the Middle East and South Asia. Few have witnessed those conflicts more closely than Rod Nordland, the international correspondent at large and Kabul, Afghanistan, bureau chief for The New York Times, who has worked as a reporter in more than 150 countries and conflict locales including Baghdad, Cairo and Beirut. Back in the mid-1980s the 16-inch guns of the battleship New Jersey bombarded Druze and Syrian gun batteries in Lebanon as America was drawn into that country’s own protracted civil war. In 2001, after Sept. 11, airstrikes helped to break the Taliban’s stranglehold on Afghanistan, allowing the Afghan military, helped by American special forces on the ground, to take city after city and eventually the capital, Kabul. In 2003, nightly bombing raids on Iraq helped to topple Saddam Hussein’s regime, allowing United States soldiers and Marines to enter Baghdad just three weeks after the war began. But toppling regimes, taking cities or stopping large-scale insurgent attacks on a city or a military position is one thing. Holding onto cities and countries in the face of insurgent attacks is another, especially when the very airstrikes that prove so effective in the initial phase of the war becomes a liability in the aftermath because they kill civilians as well as combatants.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s abrupt dismissal of the F.B.I. director roiled Washington on Wednesday and deepened the sense of crisis swirling around the White House. Republican leaders came to the president’s defense, and Mr. Trump lashed out at Democrats and other critics, calling them hypocrites. On Capitol Hill, at least a half-dozen Republicans broke with their leadership to express concern or dismay about the firing of James B. Comey, who was four years into a decade-long appointment as the bureau’s director. Still, they stopped well short of joining Democrats’ call for a special prosecutor to lead the continuing investigation of Russian contacts with Mr. Trump’s aides. At the White House, Mr. Trump shrugged off accusations of presidential interference in a counterintelligence investigation. He hosted a surreal and awkwardly timed meeting in the Oval Office with Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. Mr. Kislyak’s private meetings with Mr. Trump’s aides are a key part of the sprawling investigation. White House officials denied American reporters permission to witness the Oval Office meeting or take photographs, but Russian state news outlets published images taken by their official photographer of a beaming Mr. Trump shaking hands with the envoys. The pictures quickly spread on Twitter. Stunned by the sudden loss of their leader, agents at the F.B.I. struggled throughout the day to absorb the meaning of Mr. Comey’s dismissal, which the White House announced Tuesday evening. Veteran agents and other F.B.I. employees described a dark mood throughout the bureau, where morale was already low from months of being pummeled over dueling investigations surrounding the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump is weighing going to the F.B.I. headquarters in Washington on Friday as a show of his commitment to the bureau, an official said, though he is not expected to discuss the Russia investigation. "
"President Trump’s firing of James Comey, the 7th director of the F.B.I., was an abuse of power. Republicans — Republican lawmakers and especially the congressional leadership — need to say so. But that is hardly enough. Words must be followed by actions. At a minimum, Republicans must insist on a congressional select committee or independent commission to investigate Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election and any collusion between the president, his associates or campaign officials and Vladimir Putin’s Russia. What is now in the shadows needs to be brought into the light. Among the reasons we can confidently conclude that the president abused his power is that the White House’s explanation for the expulsion of Mr. Comey was transparently false, even ludicrous. The reason the Trump administration gave for firing Mr. Comey this year is the exact same reason for which Mr. Trump praised Mr. Comey last year: the former F.B.I. director’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server. Based on his repeated public comments lacerating Mrs. Clinton and praising Mr. Comey for reopening the investigation in October, there is no disputing the fact that Mr. Trump personally rejects the core arguments that his aides are now giving for his firing of the F.B.I. director: that Mr. Comey overstepped his role; that he disclosed information critical of Hillary Clinton in July when the F.B.I. closed its investigation; and that he overstepped again when he reopened and re-closed the investigation right before Election Day. In fact, Mr. Trump’s animus toward Mrs. Clinton was so deep that he endorsed the “lock her up” chants from his supporters and declared that “she has to go to jail.” The president wanted Mr. Comey fired all right, but for reasons other than the one that was publicly stated. It does not require great detective skill to see that there is something else is going on here and that the something else involves the F.B.I.’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Indeed, in his letter informing Mr. Comey that he was fired, the president did not mention Mr. Comey’s handling of Mrs. Clinton’s email, but he did mention that Mr. Comey has told him personally not once, not twice, but three times that he wasn’t the subject of the F.B.I.’s investigation. (In fairy tales this is known as “the power of three.”) Like so much else about the Russia story, this is meant to forestall whatever storm is coming. For the record, it was in March that Mr. Comey confirmed in a congressional hearing that the F.B.I. was investigating links between Trump associates and the Russian government. It was at this same hearing that Mr. Comey testified that he had “no information” to support Mr. Trump’s claim that Barack Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped. In retrospect it’s amazing that Mr. Comey lasted as long as he did. "
"ANTAKYA, Turkey — Turkey’s president and his top aides sharply criticized the Trump administration on Wednesday over its decision to arm a Syrian Kurdish militant group in the battle against the Islamic State, and they urged the White House to reverse it. The criticism, while not necessarily unexpected, was striking coming from Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States. The militant group, the People’s Protection Units, known by the Kurdish abbreviation Y.P.G., is fighting alongside Syrian Arab forces against the Islamic State and is intending to expel the jihadist organization from its de facto capital in Raqqa, Syria. But Turkey considers the Y.P.G. a terrorist organization and asserts that it is closely linked to the P.K.K., a Kurdish separatist group that has waged an insurgency against the Turkish government. “I want to believe that Turkey’s allies will side with us, not with terrorist organizations,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in remarks quoted in Turkish news media in reaction to the Trump administration’s decision, which was announced on Tuesday. “I hope this mistake will be reversed as soon as possible,” Mr. Erdogan said. The Turkish leader also said he would convey his concern directly to President Trump in a visit to Washington next week. Mr. Erdogan’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, also denounced the American decision, telling reporters in Ankara, the Turkish capital, “It is not possible for us to accept an initiative that would mean direct or indirect help to P.K.K.” "
"PABRADE, Lithuania — If a shooting war ever breaks out between Russia and the NATO alliance, it could well be in a place like Pabrade, a little town near the edge of a little nation. But a different sort of conflict, waged with bytes rather than bullets, is already being fought here. Jim Mattis, the American secretary of defense, visited this Lithuanian town on Wednesday to see how NATO is faring in that fight, and his guide was a German officer who has been a target in that war, falsely accused of being a rapist and a Russian spy. “What’s the spirit of your troops?” Mr. Mattis asked, walking past camouflaged tanks as soldiers with green-painted faces stood at attention. He was assured by his guide, Lt. Col. Christoph Huber, commander of the German battalion that recently took up station here, that morale could not be higher. Colonel Huber and his soldiers have been the subjects of two recent cyberattacks: false claims of wrongdoing that officials believe were put in circulation by an increasingly aggressive Russian intelligence operation that is meant to sow doubts and resentment of NATO’s growing presence in the Baltics. The first attack came on Feb. 14. Emails sent to the president of the Lithuanian Parliament and various local news media outlets falsely claimed that German soldiers had raped a girl. The story rippled through the country before the police determined that it was untrue. "
"The French insurance group Axa says it is planning an initial public offering of its United States operations. Axa plans to sell a minority stake in a company that would house its American life insurance operations as well as AllianceBernstein Holding, its asset management business, the group said Wednesday. The combination of the Axa unit and AllianceBernstein would have a book value (assets minus liabilities) of $14 billion to $15 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. It is not clear what kind of market capitalization the publicly traded entity would have. Axa aims to raise billions of dollars in the first half of next year through the listing. The proceeds would be reinvested in the company’s main business or returned to shareholders, it said. AllianceBernstein has had its troubles recently: • Peter Kraus, then the chief executive, was fired at the end of April, along with most of the board. • Like many active investment managers, the company has come under increasing competition from lower-cost, index-tracking funds.

"LONDON — A remarkable party was held last Nov. 24 at the Ritz Hotel here in honor of Nigel Farage, the politician who did more than any other to create the conditions for last June’s referendum vote on Britain’s membership in the European Union. While Mr. Farage had already stepped down as leader of the populist U.K. Independence Party, this was his moment. President-elect Donald Trump had just tweeted that he would do a “great job” representing “Great Britain as their ambassador to the United States.” This was seen as payback for Mr. Farage’s support during the Trump campaign: He spoke at a rally in Jackson, Miss., and frequently appeared on Fox News, where he was bafflingly introduced as the “leader of the British opposition.” Today, less than six months after that evening at the Ritz, the party Mr. Farage led to triumph in the Brexit vote is on the point of collapse. In local elections across Britain last week, the “people’s army” of UKIP was routed, losing 145 council seats, gaining just one. According to the BBC, the party’s share of the vote in England collapsed to just 5 percent from 22 percent in the last such election in 2013. UKIP goes into next month’s general election in disarray and with no hope of securing even a single seat in Britain’s Parliament. How could the party have fallen so fast? The short answer to that question was supplied by Douglas Carswell, a former Conservative member of Parliament who joined UKIP in 2014, and was re-elected as the party’s sole representative in the House of Commons. After last week’s catastrophic election results, he declared the party, which he had recently quit, to be finished. “As UKIP’s first — and last — M.P., I am far from despondent,” he wrote. “In fact, I am elated. Why? Because we have won.” To translate, UKIP was formed to achieve Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. With that done, it has no reason to exist — except that it will continue to have a half-life in the one institution where the party still has significant representation: the European Parliament, which it despises. The collapse of UKIP was hastened by the repositioning of the Conservatives as the party of Brexit. Theresa May was a reluctant Remainer during the referendum campaign, but emerged last July as the now pro-Leave party’s leader, succeeding David Cameron as prime minister. She wants the Tories to become the party of “ordinary working families,” of those who are “just about managing,” and she swiftly fired or demoted many of Mr. Cameron’s closest allies, the well-connected, metropolitan “chumocracy.” No liberal globalizer or free market ideologue, Ms. May believes in social cohesion and a strong state, as well as in reducing immigration. Her language is strikingly communitarian and softly nationalist. Ms. May is Britain’s first post-liberal prime minister. "
"GALLOWAY, N.J. — After months of a campaign fought largely in town halls and mailboxes and on scattered commercial airwaves, the candidates for governor of New Jersey met here at Stockton University on Tuesday for the first televised primary debates. And while the Republican candidates sparred over tax policy and achievements, the Democratic candidates found themselves largely in agreement. Voters looking for a substantive debate about the many issues plaguing New Jersey — including critically underfunded pension and school systems, record property taxes and a transportation network on the brink of failure — were treated largely to candidate indictments of Gov. Chris Christie’s stewardship of the state. In a Democratic debate that was more peaceful than acrid, the candidates transitioned from making biting opening statements to standing in unison in support of legalizing marijuana, supporting alternative energy sources such as wind turbines, paying for the entire school funding formula, investing in the state’s failing infrastructure and countering President Trump. One of the few divisive moments in the Democratic debate came as Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and ambassador to Germany who is leading comfortably in early polling, offered his proposal of a public bank, run by the state, as a method to combat unemployment. John Wisniewski, a state assemblyman, countered: “A state bank for New Jersey would be a disaster. If Mr. Murphy wants to create a state bank, maybe he should go back to Wall Street.” Jim Johnson, a former undersecretary of the United States Treasury, said, “We cannot adopt Wall Street gimmicks to address Main Street problems.” "
"Listen and subscribe from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher As director of the F.B.I., James Comey was known for two major investigations that shaped the presidential election.

"MEDIA, Pa. — As Ralph Neary waited for a hot dog outside the Delaware County courthouse here on Wednesday, he chewed over the big surprise out of Washington: President Trump’s firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. Mr. Neary, a 61-year-old county maintenance man, had voted for Mr. Trump and liked his “vision for America.” But now his mind raced back to his youth, and to the dark days of Richard M. Nixon. “Tricky Dick,” Mr. Neary called him, dredging up memories of how Nixon “lied to the American people.” “If it’s found true that President Trump is covering up,” Mr. Neary said flatly, “then I think he should be impeached.” The man serving up his frankfurter, Augie Pantellas, a onetime prizefighter, could not have disagreed more. Mr. Pantellas, 73, said Mr. Comey needed to go, plain and simple, for failing to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton last year in the investigation of her use of a private email server while secretary of state. “I really believe — you might think I’m going overboard — she was probably one of the biggest criminals in American history,” Mr. Pantellas said. Delaware County, like the Philadelphia suburbs as a whole, has trended blue in recent years, but it remains Republican-controlled, and Media itself is steeped in Republican lore: Ronald Reagan rallied supporters here in 1984, and John McCain and Sarah Palin drew throngs in 2008.

"Facing allegations that he sexually abused minors in the 1980s, Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle said this week that he would not seek re-election. Flanked by about two-dozen colleagues and family members, Mr. Murray, the city’s first openly gay mayor, announced his decision at a news conference on Tuesday. He said he would step down after one term because he did not want a scandal to dominate this year’s mayoral campaign. “The allegations against me paint me in the worst possible historic portrait of a gay man,” said Mr. Murray, who has staunchly denied any wrongdoing. “The allegations against me are not true, and I say this with all honesty and with the deepest sincerity.” Last month, Delvonn Heckard, 46, filed a lawsuit accusing Mr. Murray of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager. At least three other men have gone public with similar allegations. Mr. Murray’s lawyers have pointed out that all four people who have made accusations against Mr. Murray have criminal records. Mr. Murray has been mayor since 2013. Before the lawsuit was filed, he had been expected to win a second term. Instead, he will step down after his current term ends in December. "
"WASHINGTON — By the end, neither of them thought much of the other. After President Trump accused his predecessor in March of wiretapping him, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, was flabbergasted. The president, Mr. Comey told associates, was “outside the realm of normal,” even “crazy.” For his part, Mr. Trump fumed when Mr. Comey publicly dismissed the sensational wiretapping claim. In the weeks that followed, he grew angrier and began talking about firing Mr. Comey. After stewing last weekend while watching Sunday talk shows at his New Jersey golf resort, Mr. Trump decided it was time. There was “something wrong with” Mr. Comey, he told aides. The collision between president and F.B.I. director that culminated with Mr. Comey’s stunning dismissal on Tuesday had been a long time coming. To a president obsessed with loyalty, Mr. Comey was a rogue operator who could not be trusted as the F.B.I. investigated Russian ties to Mr. Trump’s campaign. To a lawman obsessed with independence, Mr. Trump was the ultimate loose cannon, making irresponsible claims on Twitter and jeopardizing the bureau’s credibility. The White House, in a series of shifting and contradictory accounts, first said Mr. Trump decided to fire Mr. Comey because the attorney general and his deputy recommended it. By Wednesday, it had amended the timeline to say that the president had actually been thinking about getting rid of the F.B.I. director as far back as November, after he won the election, and then became “strongly inclined” after Mr. Comey testified before Congress last week. For public consumption, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump acted because of the “atrocities” committed by Mr. Comey during last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email. But in private, aides said, Mr. Trump has been nursing a collection of festering grievances, including Mr. Comey’s handling of the Russia investigation, his seeming lack of interest in pursuing anti-Trump leaks and the perceived disloyalty over the wiretapping claim. "
"WASHINGTON — Before President Trump was even sworn into office, congressional Republicans made a pledge: They would be a check on executive power, they said, often making the independence of the legislative branch a centerpiece of their own election campaigns last year. But on Wednesday, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, sought to give the beleaguered administration significant cover, strongly defending the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, and resisting calls to challenge Mr. Trump and support a broader inquiry of Russian interference in the election. “Today we’ll no doubt hear calls for a new investigation,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor as most Senate Democrats looked on, “which can only serve to impede the current work being done.” Democrats exerted as much pressure as they could on their Republican colleagues on Wednesday, moving to shut down Senate committees, using procedural moves available to the minority to block or delay hearings on Russia, cybersecurity, presidential nominees and several other matters. Democrats’ efforts to thwart Republicans quickly became clear. When Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, asked for unanimous consent to permit a scheduled meeting of the Special Committee on Aging, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, objected because, he said, “we have no path forward on the horrible and momentous events of last night.” Ms. Collins, clearly angry, said: “This makes no sense whatsoever. This is an example of the dysfunction of the Senate.” The committee operates in a bipartisan manner, she added, and the hearing, on the health and well-being of older Americans, had nothing to do with the F.B.I.

"ISTANBUL — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey lost his first major political battle with the Trump administration, which is arming the Syrian Kurds who the Turks consider enemies. The question now is what Mr. Erdogan, a headstrong leader, will do next. The White House made the move to arm the Kurdish fighters, despite vociferous objections from Turkey, because it considers them an effective military proxy in the fight against the Islamic State. But doing so comes at a cost. Angering Turkey risks a rupture with an important NATO ally that is being courted by Russia, and could have an unpredictable impact on the battle against the Islamic State and the wars in Syria and Iraq. Mr. Erdogan and his aides have warned for months about taking more aggressive, though unspecified, actions against Kurdish militants — though in a different stronghold, Iraq. And analysts say such a plan would make some strategic sense. On Wednesday, Mr. Erdogan’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, added another warning: that arming the Kurds could have “consequences” for the United States and a “negative result.” He did not go into detail, promising only that Mr. Erdogan would elaborate when he meets President Trump at the White House next week. Mr. Erdogan also sharply criticized the Trump administration’s decision in remarks quoted by Turkish news media, and said he hoped it would be “reversed as soon as possible.” "
"WASHINGTON — Before he was confirmed last month as deputy attorney general, the nation’s No. 2 law enforcement official, Rod J. Rosenstein was cast as an evenhanded career prosecutor who had transcended partisan politics. “Political affiliation is irrelevant to my work,” Mr. Rosenstein said at his confirmation hearing in March, pledging to impartially handle the Justice Department investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, which he would oversee. “It’s my job to make sure that all investigations are conducted independently.” Now, Mr. Rosenstein, a former United States attorney in Maryland who served under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, has been thrust into the center of a bitter political firestorm over his pivotal role in President Trump’s decision on Tuesday to fire James B. Comey as director of the F.B.I. Mr. Rosenstein wrote a three-page memo that Mr. Trump cited as the basis for the ouster, and he met with Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday and discussed “reasons for removing the director,” according to the White House. People close to Mr. Trump said the president had been openly talking about firing Mr. Comey for at least a week. It was unclear Wednesday what had prompted Mr. Rosenstein to write the memo, which enumerated ways in which Mr. Comey had done “substantial harm” to the reputation of the F.B.I. Mr. Rosenstein did not respond to inquiries. "
"Some groups on the religious right are complaining that President Trump’s executive order on religion didn’t go far enough. That’s interesting, but what really has me worried is the tepid response from the mainstream. It makes me wonder whether the post-inauguration predictions that Donald Trump would eventually be “normalized” are coming to pass: the warnings that even the president’s harshest critics, worn down by the endless barrage of unpredictable antics emanating from the White House, would inevitably adapt, greeting with relief actions that fall short of the breathtakingly outrageous. (That bar obviously was cleared by the president this week with his firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey.) True, the May 4 order, entitled “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty,” didn’t live up to its scary advance billing. It did not endorse faith-based discrimination against gay people. Nor did it order the Internal Revenue Service, in so many words, not to enforce the statutory prohibition against electioneering by tax-exempt churches. But do those omissions make it “a Trump executive order to shrug at,” an “empty, symbolic act,” as Professor Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School wrote for Bloomberg View? Does it mean that the executive order “turned out to be a big nuthin’,” as Professor Marty Lederman of Georgetown University Law Center wrote on the new and very useful Take Care blog? Here is what the executive order did, admittedly in convoluted language that almost defies direct translation into English: First, it told the secretary of the Treasury (in whose domain the I.R.S. resides) not to single out for “adverse action” any “individual, house of worship, or other religious organization” for speaking about “moral or political issues from a religious perspective.” The order defines an adverse action as one that “makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or benefit.” Second, under the heading “Conscience Protections With Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate,” it told the heads of three cabinet departments — Treasury, Labor and Health and Human Services — to “consider” repealing the regulatory requirement that employers with religious-based objections to birth control nonetheless have to provide, or arrange for their employees to obtain, insurance coverage for contraception. Third, it instructed the attorney general to “issue guidance interpreting religious liberty protections in federal law.” "
"WILLINGBORO, N.J. — It took a moderate Republican from New Jersey to wrestle a compromise out of his party’s hard-right naysayers and resuscitate the House health care plan. And for that, he may pay dearly. Less than a week after Representative Tom MacArthur helped legislation that would repeal the Affordable Care Act clear a gridlocked House, he faced hundreds of outraged constituents and protesters on Wednesday in his district’s Democratic stronghold. He has to defend the measure bearing his name that would undermine protections for patients with pre-existing conditions. The so-called MacArthur amendment wooed the conservative House Freedom Caucus by allowing states to receive waivers from certain federal insurance requirements in the Affordable Care Act. With a waiver, a state could permit insurers to charge higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions who allowed their coverage to lapse. But that amendment drove a wedge between Mr. MacArthur and members of the caucus of moderate Republicans he leads, the Tuesday Group. It forced vulnerable Republicans from swing districts to vote on a bill that would erode one of the most popular parts of President Barack Obama’s health care law. And it offered powerful ammunition to a Democratic Party eager to reclaim the House next year. For more than three years, Mr. MacArthur has largely made his name by fighting for the federal government to fulfill its responsibility to victims of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. That endeared him to constituents who are still struggling to rebuild their lives. Sandwiched between the Philadelphia suburbs and the retirement communities of the Jersey Shore, his district was hit hard by the storm, which left tens of thousands of buildings damaged or destroyed. On Wednesday, though, protesters lined up for hours in the late afternoon sun to vent their frustrations with Mr. MacArthur. Some held signs that bore his likeness with the words “I took your health care” emblazoned on his forehead — right where Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, had warned Republicans their plan would be “tattooed.” "
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump met with top Russian officials in the Oval Office on Wednesday, White House officials barred reporters from witnessing the moment. They apparently preferred to block coverage of the awkwardly timed visit as questions swirled about whether the president had dismissed his F.B.I. director in part to squelch the investigation into possible ties between his campaign and Moscow. But the Russians, who have a largely state-run media, brought their own press contingent in the form of an official photographer. They quickly filled the vacuum with their own pictures of the meeting with Mr. Trump, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergey I. Kislyak, Moscow’s ambassador to the United States. Within minutes of the meeting, the Foreign Ministry had posted photographs on Twitter of Mr. Trump and Mr. Lavrov smiling and shaking hands. The Russian embassy posted images of the president grinning and gripping hands with the ambassador. Tass, Russia’s official news agency, released more photographs of the three men laughing together in the Oval Office. The White House released nothing. The result was a public relations coup of sorts for Russia and Mr. Lavrov in particular, who not only received a collegial Oval Office welcome from the president, but the photographic evidence to prove it. By contrast, when Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson traveled to Moscow last month, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia kept him waiting for hours before granting him an audience at the Kremlin. Then, too, Mr. Tillerson left his American press contingent behind. Mr. Kislyak has figured prominently in the furor surrounding the Trump team’s contacts with Moscow. It was conversations between the ambassador and Michael T. Flynn, the president’s former national security adviser, that ultimately led to Mr. Flynn’s ouster in February, ostensibly because he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about whether the two had discussed United States sanctions on Russia. The White House had not divulged that Mr. Kislyak was to be present at Wednesday’s meeting. "
"The White House, in its efforts to defend the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, has alleged Democratic hypocrisy over the decision and cited a letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to justify it. Mr. Rosenstein noted that Mr. Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server had earned bipartisan criticism and was out of step with Justice Department protocol. But these arguments are not new, leading many to question what exactly prompted Mr. Comey’s dismissal. Here’s an assessment of the White House’s responses to that question. NO EVIDENCE The deputy attorney general does oversee the F.B.I. and its director, but there is no evidence that it is typical for a new deputy to conduct a review. The Justice Department does not list a routine review of the F.B.I. — or any other oversight protocols — on its website detailing the duties of the deputy. Former prosecutors told The New York Times they were not aware of such reviews’ happening under other new deputy attorneys general. “What is most certainly not routine is for the deputy attorney general to take on the role of investigating contested allegations of misconduct by D.O.J. personnel, let alone the director of the F.B.I.,” said Lauren Ouziel, a law professor at Temple University and an expert in institutional dynamics in investigations. “That job falls to the D.O.J.’s Office of Inspector General.” "
"I
spent a few days with the federal budget process in Canberra this week but rather than making comparisons to Washington D.C. — or sharing which American politicians I’d love to see endure an hour of Question Time, which is tempting — I figured I’d turn this issue over to readers. Many of you emailed us about my last newsletter, sharing your own experiences with race and class in Australia and the divide that I described in Sydney, or arguing I had it all wrong. Some readers (Clancy McDowell, Vlaho Stef) pointed out that there are not two Australias but rather three — Indigenous Australia being the third. A few of you also made clear (correctly, of course) that even three was too far limited. “There are an infinite number of Australias, just like there are multiple ‘USAs,’” Erica Potts wrote. A few readers resisted the idea that the divide was racial in any way; in their view, wealth created cultural distance, nothing more. But others told me they identified with what I’d observed. “Your piece on the two faces of Australia really struck a chord,” Aparna Balakumar wrote. “As someone born in Australia to Indian migrants who arrived with $20 in their pockets thirty years ago, I’ve never been assumed ‘Australian’ by a stranger in my life. And yet, that is how I define myself.” Hilary Webster pointed me to a more uplifting example — the school where she teaches in Bankstown, a southwestern Sydney suburb. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Until two days ago, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, had an enviable reputation as a straight-shooting law-enforcement official respected by members of both parties. Then he decided that he was willing to help President Trump tamper with an investigation into his presidential campaign. Now Rosenstein’s reputation is permanently damaged, as it deserves to be. In that damage is a lesson for other subordinates and allies of Trump. When Rosenstein accepted his job at the Justice Department, many observers hoped he would be the adult who would moderate the excesses of Trump and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. But it is enormously difficult to resist pressure, persuasion and incentives from one’s bosses, especially when those bosses are running the country. Rosenstein’s moral test arrived after just a couple of weeks on the job. He failed it, evidently without putting up much of a struggle. He was willing to be “exactly the mouthpiece Trump needed,” as Slate’s Leon Neyfakh put it. Rosenstein wrote a memo that claimed James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, was fired for his handling of the Hillary Clinton inquiry that Trump and Sessions had once praised fulsomely. And Rosenstein, who was supervising the probe into the Trump campaign’s Russian ties, wrote the memo only a few days after Comey had come to him and requested more money for it, The Times reported. Rosenstein has also enabled Sessions to violate his own recusal from that Russia investigation. Throughout the rushed process of firing Comey and looking for his replacement, Sessions has remained central — as if the Russia inquiry and Comey’s status were separate issues. The notion that Rosenstein is overseeing that investigation has become laughable. I’ve said previously I hope that good people already working in the executive branch remain in their jobs and that smart, principled Republicans come to staff many jobs in the Trump administration. I still hope so. But Rosenstein’s abandonment of the basic principles of ethical government should remind everyone of the risks of joining Team Trump. Once you do, avoiding Trumpian behavior becomes very hard. Adopting it starts to seem normal, even honorable. Remember, though: There is no job, not even at the highest levels of government, that is worth your reputation. As Peter Wehner, a longtime Republican aide, writes in today’s Times: “The Republicans who have so far stood in lock step with Mr. Trump, defending him at every turn, need to ask themselves whether they want to continue to be complicit in this institutional assault. By now it should be clear to them that having Donald Trump’s back will cost them their integrity.” "
"NEW ALBANY, Ohio — As the fallout from President Trump’s sudden firing of  James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, consumed Washington on Wednesday, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, wandered through an Ohio packaging plant admiring innovations in fish bait technology and smiling at workers as they stuck labels on soap wrappers. Brushing off questions about the latest drama that threatened to stall the Republican agenda, Mr. Ryan tried to stay focused on a subject that is dear to his heart and his party’s goals: tax cuts. “We have a tax system that penalizes job creation, economic growth, saving,” Mr. Ryan, tieless with his white shirt sleeves rolled up, said during a round-table discussion with local business leaders and lawmakers outside Columbus. “We want to fix that so we have more of the things we need in this country.” Mr. Ryan’s optimism that the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code in 30 years would be accomplished this year stood in stark contrast to the chaos he left behind in the capital. That turmoil intensifies the challenge he faces in trying to sell ambitious pieces of legislation in a country that is increasingly polarized and distracted by White House intrigue. Some analysts warned on Wednesday that the way Mr. Comey was fired was a sign that a tax overhaul could be too big of a lift for lawmakers in this political environment. “The Comey firing does not kill tax reform,” analysts at the financial services firm Keefe, Bruyette and Woods wrote to clients. “But it does reinforce our view that the Trump administration is not operating as effectively and efficiently as it could be, and that it has been slow to learn important political lessons in the past four months.” "
"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security is considering banning laptops and other large electronic devices from carry-on bags on flights from Europe to the United States, a department spokesman said on Wednesday. The action would extend a limited ban that was put in place in March. At that time, the United States and Britain barred passengers traveling through airports in 10 Muslim-majority countries from carrying laptop computers, tablets and other devices larger than cellphones aboard direct inbound flights. The larger items were to be stowed with checked luggage. The ban was put in place after intelligence showed that the Islamic State was developing a bomb that could be hidden in portable electronic devices. David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency had not decided whether to extend the ban. “We’ll likely expand the restrictions,” he said. John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary, is to brief senators on security topics on Thursday, according to a Senate aide. Officials did not say when a new ban might be imposed. A senior official with a United States airline said that carriers had been in talks with government officials for weeks about the possibility of an expanded ban, mainly over the logistics of carrying it out. The particular problem is passengers connecting in Europe from flights originating in the Middle East and Africa. "
"Two hours before news broke of James B. Comey’s firing — before the F.B.I. director was blindsided while addressing bureau employees in Los Angeles, before President Trump’s letter arrived at F.B.I. headquarters in Washington, before congressional Democrats led a renewed push for an independent special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the presidential election — the front page of Wednesday’s New York Times began its diurnal life as it always does: as a simple hand-drawn pencil sketch, made on lime green paper. At 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, when Tom Bodkin, The Times’s creative director, commenced his ritual of drawing up the page at the A1 print meeting, the day’s top news had a different focus: President Trump, despite strong objections from Turkey, had approved a plan to arm Syrian Kurds. As the would-be lead of Wednesday’s paper, the story was given prime placement (at the top right) in Mr. Bodkin’s layout of the front page; alongside it would run an accompanying four-column photograph. The rest of the page grew from there: Above the fold would be stories on the South Korean election, the effects of cyberattacks on the recent French election, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s plans to toughen rules on prosecuting drug crimes. There was no mention of the F.B.I. or its director. A few hours later, that plan was scrapped. The Times first learned of Mr. Comey’s firing at 5:41 p.m. (By luck, a Times correspondent was at the White House at the time, and he heard of Mr. Comey’s firing directly from Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.) Seven minutes later, at 5:48 p.m., the developing story was posted to nytimes.com. Meanwhile, in New York, as the news rippled through the Times building, Mr. Bodkin made his way back to the newsroom and tore another sheet of green paper from his pad. It was time to redesign the front page. The original plan was to feature a large portrait of Comey — a “conventional treatment,” Mr. Bodkin said. “And we had a pretty nice portrait of him, too.” "
"Betsy DeVos went to Bethune-Cookman University on Wednesday, knowing her first commencement address as secretary of education could get ugly at the historically black institute of higher education. It did — fast. Over sporadic heckling, and at some points to the backs of gown-clad graduates refusing to face her, Ms. DeVos implored: “One of the hallmarks of higher education, and of democracy, is the ability to converse with and learn from those with whom we disagree. And while we will undoubtedly disagree at times, I hope we can do so respectfully. Let’s choose to hear each other out.” The crowd obliged only a handful of times during her roughly 20-minute-speech. Since squeaking through Senate confirmation on the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Mike Pence, Ms. DeVos has appeared at times to carry the weight of every Trump administration controversy on her shoulders. She was turned away by a handful of protesters at her first school visit as secretary. She was goaded into an Ohio public school visit by an antagonist, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten. And in the days before her address at Bethune-Cookman, in Daytona Beach, Fla., opponents made it clear with petitions and protests that she would not be all that welcome. The school’s president, Edison O. Jackson, had to pause the ceremony about one minute into Ms. DeVos’s address to tell the crowd of students, “If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you.” Above the jeers, Ms. DeVos delivered the standard exhortation to graduates to live a life of service, with courage and grace in the spirit of their school’s namesake.

"The Kushner real estate family, whose scion Jared Kushner is President Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, has run into more turbulence in Jersey City, where it has placed a major bet on development. The Kushners have six projects under development in Jersey City — with square footage equivalent to two Empire State Buildings — the once blue-collar town that sits a mile across the Hudson River from Manhattan. Now, after making the highest offer last year for a 95-acre waterfront parcel that would have been their seventh project, the Kushners said they have dropped out of the bidding for the site, where a Honeywell factory once stood. Kushner Companies, which is led by Jared’s father, Charles Kushner, had bid as much as $125 million for the Honeywell site, which had been contaminated by chromium, with plans to build 3,000 apartments catered to Orthodox Jews who are being priced out of the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn. Honeywell suspended the sale last year to obtain environmental approvals from the state and expects to resume negotiations later this year. “A decision was made late last year not to pursue the project,” James Yolles, a spokesman for the Kushners said Wednesday, “because the company was not persuaded by the economics of the deal.” "
"With Donald Trump, the tells are always easy. When the president says, “I’m, like, a smart person,” you know he nurses deep insecurities about his intelligence. When he says, “I’m really rich,” you know that he knows that you know that, really, he probably isn’t. And when he writes, as he did in his letter to the now-former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, that “while I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation,” you know what keeps him up at night, too. That wasn’t the only tell in Trump’s Comey canning. First there was its abruptness. Rod Rosenstein, deputy attorney general as of two weeks ago, delivered his memorandum detailing Comey’s misfeasance in the Hillary Clinton email saga on Tuesday. Trump fired the director the same day. Come again? This is the same administration that waited 18 long days to fire a national security adviser profoundly vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Why? Because, as Press Secretary Sean Spicer explained earlier this week, the White House felt it owed Michael Flynn an “element of due process.” For Comey, not so much. He learned of his dismissal from a TV screen, while delivering a speech to bureau employees. Firings on “The Apprentice” had more class and ceremony than this. Then there is Rosenstein’s memo, which makes a solid case that Comey bungled nearly every aspect of the Clinton investigation — a revelation to nobody in Washington, left or right, except perhaps Comey himself. Nor was there any mystery about any of this when Trump gave the director his very public blessing at a White House ceremony in January, resisting the advice of prominent conservative voices to fire him back then.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A day after President Trump’s sudden firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey, Washington was still reeling from the decision and its implications. Congressional officials revealed that days earlier Mr. Comey had requested additional resources for the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the election. Democrats said the timing of his dismissal suggested the president was trying to derail the investigation. The White House denied that it was linked to the Russia inquiry. And Mr. Trump took to Twitter to accuse Democrats of hypocrisy, noting that they had criticized Mr. Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation. Above, a White House aide gave reporters copies of Senator Chuck Schumer’s past statements on Mr. Comey. _____ "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s abrupt firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director stunned Washington and prompted bipartisan concerns that Mr. Trump was interfering with the independence of the agency. Nonetheless, the episode was only one of several moments that, in a more conventional administration and during less tumultuous times, would be seen as political intrusions in matters of law enforcement. Here’s a look at other such instances during the first four months of the Trump administration: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House deputy press secretary, said on Wednesday that “I don’t think there’s a necessary need” for the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor. Justice Department decisions are supposed to be entirely independent from the White House. Comments like these raise the specter that the White House is trying to influence the department’s decisions. This would be true in any case but is especially so in an investigation with direct implications for the White House. Ms. Sanders said there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign — the very thing that the F.B.I. is investigating. She said she hoped the F.B.I. investigation would end. “Let’s put it behind us, let’s move on and let’s focus on what we need to do to turn our country around,” she said. The White House, in administrations from both parties, has normally sidestepped questions about F.B.I. investigations, particularly those that are politically charged. When presidents have waded into such commentary, it has been at their peril. President Obama invited the wrath of Republicans and many in the F.B.I. when he commented on the investigation of Hillary Clinton and downplayed its seriousness. Ron Hosko, a former senior F.B.I. official who is now the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, criticized those comments and similarly said that Mr. Trump should stay out of continuing F.B.I. matters. “I’m troubled by any comments that could be seen as prejudging a case,” Mr. Hosko said on Tuesday, hours before Mr. Comey was fired.

"BEIJING — South Korea wants to discuss unease about an American antimissile system on its soil. Taiwan is eager to buy weapons. The Philippines hopes to find out whether the United States plans to challenge China in the South China Sea. Leaders across Asia are looking to Washington for guidance on a variety of pressing diplomatic issues. But President Trump’s erratic approach to policy making and his focus on one issue — North Korea’s nuclear weapons program — are creating anxiety and confusion in the region. In South Korea, Mr. Trump has angered the public with several remarks, including his suggestion that the country, an ally for over six decades, pay for an antimissile system built by the Americans to deter North Korea. Moon Jae-in, who was elected president on Tuesday, has vowed to seek a more conciliatory approach with the North, setting up a potential rift with American policy. In other parts of Asia, including the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, Mr. Trump’s willingness to bend to China is fueling worries that the United States will stop trying to counter China’s growing influence in the region. Washington has been the main critic of China’s efforts to build fortresses atop reefs, rocks and islands in the South China Sea. But the Trump administration, apparently wary of angering Beijing, recently decided to suspend patrols of islands and reefs claimed by China. “The South China Sea is now China’s lake,” said Carlyle A. Thayer, an emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia. "
"Buy the dip. Be it stocks, bonds or more complex derivative bets, investors following this Wall Street maxim have reaped robust rewards in recent years. Such buying has been evident in the shares of large American companies since March 2009, when the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index touched a low of 666. (It closed on Wednesday at 2,399.63.) It also appeared when investors piled into European stocks after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union last summer. And the phenomenon has been amply illustrated by the wagering that the VIX index, a measure of how sharply investors think stocks will shoot up and down, will continue to move lower as it has done in recent weeks. Yet as stock markets hit record highs and the yields on volatile junk and emerging market bonds plunge, this view that market corrections should be seen as a buying opportunity, as opposed to a warning to be heeded, has begun to worry investors. The fear is that each subsequent rebound will embolden excessive risk taking and inflate richly valued stock and bond markets. "
"I feel as if we are being conditioned to chaos by a “president” who abhors the stillness of stability. Every day we awake to a new outrage. We now exist in a rolling trauma — exhausting and unrelenting. Yet even in that context, some things spike higher than others. Donald Trump’s firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey, is one of those things. This should shock the whole of America out of its numbness. This is outrageous and without precedent, unless of course we count (as many have) the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre in which “President Richard M. Nixon ordered the firing of Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor looking into the so-called third-rate burglary that would eventually bring Nixon down,” as The New York Times put it. But Cox was just a special prosecutor; Comey was head of the F.B.I. If you have been even mildly conscious over the past 36 hours, there is little new that I can tell you about this case, but here is the wrap-up: In his termination letter to Comey, dated May 9, Trump writes that he concurs with “the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.” That judgment came in two letters, one from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and another from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, both dated May 9, the same day as the termination letter. (Take a minute here to recall that it took Trump 18 days to fire the national security adviser Michael Flynn, after he was warned by then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates that he could be compromised by the Russians and susceptible to blackmail. Interesting, isn’t it?) "
"WASHINGTON — For Hillary Clinton, the sudden fall of James B. Comey is wrapped in multiple layers of irony. Mrs. Clinton blames Mr. Comey for tilting the presidential election against her in the closing days of last year’s campaign by announcing that the F.B.I. might reopen its investigation of her email practices while she was at the State Department. Yet her satisfaction at seeing him lose his job, friends said, is offset by worries that it could derail the F.B.I.’s investigation of ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Mrs. Clinton, these people said, puts no stock in President Trump’s stated rationale for dismissing Mr. Comey as the F.B.I. director — that he mishandled the bureau’s investigation of her email case — even though she fundamentally agrees with that damning assessment. One person who spoke with Mrs. Clinton after the White House’s announcement said she has a “mixed mind” about his firing. While Mrs. Clinton believes that Mr. Comey interfered with the election, this person said, “taking him out of his job at this point only reinforces the point that he was on to something.” Mrs. Clinton has said nothing publicly about the F.B.I. director’s dismissal. In her most recent Twitter post, on May 7, she celebrated the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France’s presidential election, which she said was a “defeat to those interfering w/democracy.” "
"WASHINGTON — What outraged Democrats about James B. Comey last year — namely, his decision to disclose the conclusions of an F.B.I. investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server and then revisit it days before the presidential election — now pales in comparison to their aghast fury at his firing this week. To President Trump, they are “phony hypocrites.” But Democrats drew a clear distinction between their intense criticism of Mr. Comey’s handling of the investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton had mishandled classified emails, and his abrupt firing as he was overseeing another criminal investigation — one into possible collusion between Mr. Trump’s advisers and the Russian government during the presidential election. In a barrage of Twitter posts on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said Democrats only “PRETEND to be aggrieved” over his dismissal of Mr. Comey. As evidence, the president singled out a statement by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who declared in November that he had lost confidence in Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump also posted a compilation of video clips featuring prominent Democrats criticizing Mr. Comey and even urging his resignation. "
"WASHINGTON — My email to my Washington bureau colleagues contained just two, urgent words: “Comey fired.” A few minutes earlier, I had arrived at the White House just in time to meet the 6 p.m. deadline to turn in my passport and visa applications for President Trump’s first foreign trip next week. I walked through a mostly-deserted press briefing room — news was pretty slow at that moment — and into the cramped office known as Lower Press, where White House press aides sit. There, I saw Sean Spicer, the press secretary, huddled over a computer, with all his assistants crowded around him. They looked up at me and gruffly suggested I leave. “I have to drop off my passport,” I mumbled. One of them grabbed the envelope and told me to close the door on my way out. Something was clearly going on. After a few minutes, Mr. Spicer opened the door and announced to me and the half dozen other reporters who were nervously waiting that something important would be in our inboxes momentarily. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump Fires Comey Amid Russia Inquiry” (front page, May 10): Regarding President Trump’s outrageous and precipitous firing of James Comey, the F.B.I. director: If Mr. Trump has nothing to hide, why is he is working so hard to suppress any real investigation of himself and his cohort? The notion that Mr. Comey was fired so summarily because of his mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email affair is belied by the timing of the move. This just doesn’t pass the straight-face test. Congress must move quickly to do three things: 1) An investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Comey’s firing must be started immediately. 2) The Senate must refuse to confirm any new F.B.I. director unless that person is absolutely above reproach, not beholden to the Trump administration or either political party, and willing and able to stand up to any pressure from the White House and its minions. 3) A special counsel must be appointed with broad independent powers to investigate any ties between the Trump administration and Russia. This is a time of great peril to the Republic. All citizens must do everything in their power to protect the core values of American democracy from this demagogue. RICHARD S. PETRETTI, NEW YORK To the Editor: Until today James Comey was a villain to the Democrats and the liberal media, No. 1 of the excuses for why Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election. Now that Mr. Comey has been fired, he is portrayed by these same Democrats and liberal media as a hero, a victim of the Trump administration, an Archibald Cox to President Trump’s Nixon, someone who had to go as part of the Trump administration’s cover-up of its collusion with the Russians. It is sometimes said that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. That aptly describes why Mr. Comey has gone from villain to new best friend of the Democrats and the liberal media. DONALD NAWI, SCARSDALE, N.Y. To the Editor: With Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, arriving for a visit with President Trump, the firing of James Comey looks awfully like a gift to cement a relationship. "
"Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday used a news conference announcing the expansion of one of his signature education programs to defend his education policies as a whole and to sweepingly dismiss those of previous leaders of the school system. Mr. de Blasio, appearing at a school in Brooklyn, said that he would add 69 schools to the Community Schools Initiative, which provides services like counseling, dental care and vision screening in school buildings, bringing the total to 215. The program has decreased absenteeism in many schools but has not yet led to major academic gains. And then he took aim at previous administrations. “I think we were all sold a bill of goods in the past — for generations — that there was a serious effort to create equity in our school system,” Mr. de Blasio said. “There wasn’t.” The mayor said his initiatives — including expanding early childhood education and putting reading coaches in elementary schools, with the goal of having all children reading on grade level by third grade in 2026 — were finally narrowing the gaps between historically good and bad schools. “Anyone who doesn’t understand it’s transformative isn’t looking very hard,” he said. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, and the schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, have said they would soon release a plan to decrease segregation in the city’s schools. In answer to a question about segregation, the mayor suggested that there was not much he could do. “We cannot change the basic reality of housing in New York City,” he said. The announcement about the Community Schools Initiative highlighted some of the challenges facing the mayor on education. Among his biggest departures from the approach of his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, was his pledge to avoid widespread school closings, which are strongly opposed by the teachers’ union. Instead, he created what he called the Renewal Schools program to turn around a group of 94 of the most troubled schools, through a combination of academic support and social services. "
"WASHINGTON — The script should be familiar by now. President Trump takes action that stuns the country, eliciting indignation and disbelief from Democrats and leading them to conclude that the vitality of American democracy is under assault. Yet among those who are sympathetic to the president — a minority, to be sure, but somewhere around 40 percent of the country, according to recent polls — the outrage is that Mr. Trump is again being held to an unfair standard set by the very people and institutions that tried to stop his election in the first place: Democrats, resentful Republicans and, perhaps most of all, the news media. That has certainly been the divide as the country absorbed the news that Mr. Trump had fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director. The move was widely hailed by conservatives online, on talk radio, on Fox News and among the president’s allies in Washington: the universe in which views of Mr. Trump quickly harden in the right’s collective consciousness. More clearly than other recent Trump-induced uproars, the reaction to the Comey firing illustrated how many conservatives now justify their defense of the president as part of a fight against a rising tide of overreaction and manufactured hysteria by the left. Mr. Trump, who has long understood the political power of demonizing his opponents as crazed and irrational, has helped stoke those resentments. “In a word, they see him as their voice,” said Frank Luntz, the Republican consultant and pollster. “And when their voice is shouted down, disrespected or simply ignored, that is an attack on them, not just an attack on Trump.” "
"You have seen them on high, scurrying with great urgency between columns of marble, the clicks of Armani-heeled favor seekers never far behind. You have heard them in the past few days, saying they are “troubled” or “disappointed” about the latest assault on democracy from the White House. They know enough history to get this: Donald Trump is the first president in history whose campaign has come under F.B.I.-initiated investigation for collusion with a hostile foreign power. And now the person heading that investigation, the F.B.I. director, has been fired. We’re looking for a few good men and women in Congress to understand the gravity of this debasement. We don’t need more parsing about the bad “optics” or “timing” of Trump firing the man who could have ended his presidency. We need a Republican in power to call it what it is: a bungled attempt to obstruct justice. And the tragic part is that Trump is likely to succeed, at least in the short term. The person he chooses for F.B.I. director will never assemble a prosecutable case of treason that leads to the doorstep of this White House. The courts can do only so much. They can block orders that violate the Constitution. But they can’t be real-time truth seekers in a moment of real urgency. As for Ivanka Trump, the supposed sane person in an insane White House, she has only so many whispers into Daddy’s ear that will be listened to. Thus, it falls to a half-dozen or so Republicans to heed the words of a man whose statue they pass every day in the Capitol. “Even if you’re on the right track,” said Will Rogers, Oklahoma’s gift to American gab, “you’ll get run over if you just sit there.” "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The fallout from President Trump’s abrupt firing of James Comey, the F.B.I. director, dominated a Senate hearing about the biggest security threats facing the United States. Andrew McCabe, the acting F.B.I. director, rejected the White House’s claim that Mr. Comey had lost the support of his colleagues, and pledged to resist any attempt to hobble the investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. We also learned that Mr. Trump had pressed Mr. Comey to promise loyalty to him at a private dinner in January, but Mr. Comey promised him only “honesty.” Our reporter Michael Shear gave us an inside look on how he broke the news of Mr. Comey’s firing. And his colleagues offer analysis of Mr. Trump’s decision in this video. "
"President Trump’s unconscionable decision to fire the director of the F.B.I. in the middle of his investigation of the Trump team’s tangled web of Kremlin dealings prompted calls for the deputy attorney general to appoint an independent prosecutor. The Russia inquiry should certainly continue. But the deputy, Rod Rosenstein, may be the last person — besides Trump himself or Attorney General Jeff Sessions — who should appoint a prosecutor to lead it. And the need for independent investigation has moved far beyond the Russia connection, right into the heart of the unfolding ethical and constitutional disaster that is the Trump administration. Trump’s firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director seems at this early stage like a huge abuse of executive power aimed at derailing an investigation that was coming too close to the White House. And the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to defeat Clinton is now inextricably snarled up with the firing of Comey. In its frantic efforts at damage control following that firing, the administration has attempted to put the blame on Rosenstein, who supposedly considered resigning over being singled out as the fall guy. (He should have quit, if he was not part of the plot.) But the White House’s claim that Trump acted only after Rosenstein came up with idea of firing the F.B.I. director all by himself was transparent nonsense from the start. Comey’s comments about the Clinton email investigation have been a matter of public debate for a year. What changed was Comey’s request for more resources to step up his investigation. "
"Several years ago, the Census Bureau began to predict that the United States would become a majority-minority nation by the 2040s — that African- and Asian-Americans, as well as Latinos, would outnumber non-Hispanic whites. Last year the census underlined its prediction by announcing that non-Hispanic white babies under the age of 1 were already in the minority. These numbers have become a handy data point for whites fearful that they are being threatened and overwhelmed by a growing tide of darker-skinned people. In this way, the census may have unintentionally increased white racism, thereby justifying the longstanding Republican strategy of turning itself into a whites-first party. White fears probably even helped Donald Trump win the 2016 election. Nonetheless, the “minority-majority” forecast, as it is commonly interpreted, is likely to be proven wrong. Not only could whites remain a majority well past midcentury, but they will retain political, economic and cultural control of the country long after that. Simply put, the demographers have not taken into account how the perception of race is likely to change in the coming years. For example, whites are already seeing the descendants of some Asian and Latino immigrants as being similar to them. Consequently, whites treat them as white. This “whitening” process will only increase in the future. The census prediction is based on at least five mistakes, all of them correctable. In an article last year in The American Prospect, the sociologist Richard Alba showed how the first three mistakes underestimated the likely growth of the population that views itself as white. Mistake No. 1 The Office of Management and Budget requires the census to count people of white-Latino, white-Asian and white-black ancestry as nonwhite and, in its minority-majority prediction, the census counts all of these populations as minorities. In reality, however, a number of these so-called mixed-race people, especially from the first two populations, identify themselves as white. "
"To the Editor: Re “After Rocky Start, Smooth Sailing on Intrepid for Trump and Turnbull” (news article, May 5): I am an Australian citizen with a special and unreserved regard for the people of the United States. But President Trump’s treatment of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been abysmal, even putting aside reports of his hanging up on a telephone conversation with Mr. Turnbull, which the president later described as “fake news.” Keeping the Australian prime minister waiting for several hours when he had flown halfway around the world to meet President Trump at a long-scheduled meeting, merely so the president could gloat and grandstand on a narrow victory in Congress on health care, is a measure of the man and the disrespect he holds for the relationship between his country and my own. There can be no other interpretation. If this is the way that President Trump treats the representative of one of his country’s most enduring allies, I fear for the future of the American-Australian alliance. MICHAEL J. GAMBLE

"More than two years into the American-led campaign against the Islamic State, freeing the cities of Mosul, in Iraq, and Raqqa, in Syria, is within reach. But since the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared the establishment of its caliphate from the pulpit of a mosque in Mosul in 2014, the Islamic State has claimed at least eight “provinces” in countries across the globe. Countries in North Africa account for some of the largest portions of the nearly 40,000 foreign fighters who have flocked to join Mr. Baghdadi’s murderous cult, as well as the Qaeda affiliate in Syria. Recent worrying trends in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia should make the American government focus on countering the Islamic State’s global expansion and asking: What is the United States’ strategy for ensuring that the current progress in Iraq and Syria is not simply the opening act of a more far-reaching drama involving the Islamic State? Egypt and Libya, in particular, could represent tipping points for the Islamic State and its global presence. In Egypt, the group appears to be employing the sectarian playbook used by its predecessor, Al Qaeda, in Iraq. An uptick in attacks against Christian minorities in Egypt, including twin bombing attacks on Coptic churches on Palm Sunday, mirror the Qaeda group’s campaign of terrorism against Shiite communities in Baghdad that was intended to intimidate locals and bolster its own recruiting. The United States should be especially concerned about a repeat of this approach in Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country, which is already on edge thanks to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s strongman tactics against journalists, political opponents and human rights groups. For the past few years, the United States’ approach has been to provide carefully calibrated security cooperation while clearly condemning Mr. Sisi’s authoritarian actions. For example, the Obama administration supported Egypt’s fight against insurgents in the strategically vital Sinai region, yet withheld certain military sales and was outspoken about America’s concerns over Egypt’s human rights record. Arguably, this balance wasn’t perfect; perhaps it might have been more effective to couple the condemnation for Mr. Sisi’s increasing authoritarianism with even greater counterterrorism assistance. In any case, American silence about the Sisi administration’s human rights record is not the answer. After all, Al Qaeda traces its roots to Cairo’s prisons under Egypt’s earlier repressive regimes. In that context, we must hope that both the threat from the Islamic State and the problem of the Egyptian government’s repressions were part of the conversation in the Oval Office last month when President Trump met Mr. Sisi. An encouraging sign of a more productive relationship was the diplomatic back channel that reportedly resulted in Egypt’s release of an Egyptian-American aid worker. "
"To the Editor: Re “A Letter to the Deputy Attorney General” (editorial, May 11): Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s letter — cited by the White House as the basis for firing James Comey as F.B.I. director — undoubtedly reflected Mr. Rosenstein’s honest appraisal of Mr. Comey and in theory could have been a proper basis for Mr. Comey’s removal. But it clearly was not the real basis for the firing. What is difficult to comprehend is how Mr. Rosenstein could have failed to see how his memo would be used by President Trump to lie about and cover up why Mr. Comey was fired. Mr. Rosenstein was “played” by the president to promulgate false information about the firing and to hide the president’s determination to quash an investigation of his associates and himself, which in my book should be sufficient grounds for impeachment. STEVEN Y. WINNICK, WASHINGTON To the Editor: Both your editorial and David Leonhardt’s column (“Rod Rosenstein Fails His Ethics Test,” nytimes.com, May 11) appeal to Mr. Rosenstein’s concern with preserving his own reputation. That may be, calculatingly, the best way to spur some action on his part. Whose historical bed do you want to lie in? But it also reveals, distressingly, the decline of moral compass in our Trumpian society. We should expect Mr. Rosenstein to naturally do the right thing, precisely because it is the right thing, rather than have to appeal to his historical vanity. MARC KAGAN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Your cautionary letter to the deputy attorney general makes as clear as can be that the president puts his own interests ahead of the nation’s. It also makes clear that the president is looking for anything to distract attention from the investigation of his administration’s possible collusion with the Russians to influence the last election. The ultimate distraction would be military confrontation with another nation. No president in his right mind would precipitate a conflict to postpone an investigation. But I wouldn’t put it past this president. Military leaders must have confidence that the public will have their back if they feel the need to question orders that serve no strategic interest, but risk American lives.

"In the United States, we have long valued the freedom of the press as an additional check on the power of the government and as a way to raise public awareness of issues of national importance. Yet, even as the right to a free and independent press endures, it has created tension for presidents and government leaders who want to influence the public and shape political messages. Presidents have routinely communicated directly with the public, often making use of new technology to do so. At the same time, they have relied on traditional outlets like the news conference and the White House press corps to share policy and answer questions from the media, using journalists as a conduit of information and a stand-in for the American people. This lesson uses articles, speeches and videos to help students analyze past presidents’ interactions with journalists and to explore President Trump’s own particularly fraught relationship with the news media. _________ Ask students to look closely at a front page of The New York Times.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump offered a new version of his decision to fire James B. Comey, saying on Thursday that he would have dismissed the F.B.I. director regardless of whether the attorney general and his deputy recommended it. It was just the latest in a series of statements, some of them contradictory, to whiplash Washington over 48 hours that began with Mr. Comey’s firing on Tuesday evening. And it was unusually harsh: Mr. Trump castigated Mr. Comey as “a showboat” and “a grandstander,” suggesting that his issues with the F.B.I. director went beyond any previously stated concerns. Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he had not relied solely on the advice from the Justice Department’s top two leaders in making his decision. And, for the first time, he explicitly referenced the F.B.I.’s investigation into his administration’s ties to Russia in defending Mr. Comey’s firing. “And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,’” Mr. Trump told Lester Holt of NBC News. “It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.” Earlier, the White House had said that Mr. Trump acted only after Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, came to him and recommended that Mr. Comey be dismissed because of his handling of last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email. In his Tuesday letter terminating Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said he had “accepted their recommendation.” And Vice President Mike Pence, talking to reporters, echoed his boss. "
"WASHINGTON — Some critics of President Trump have accused him of obstruction of justice in his firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, amid the bureau’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia. Here is a look at the complex legal concept. What is obstruction of justice? Several federal statutes criminalize actions that impede official investigations. While some examples of illegal ways to thwart the justice system are specific — like killing a witness or destroying evidence — the law also includes broad, catchall prohibitions. For example, Section 1512 of Title 18 makes it a crime if someone corruptly “obstructs, influences or impedes any official proceeding,” even if the proceeding was not yet pending at the time of the act. A conviction under that provision can be punished by up to 20 years in prison. Could that cover firing the F.B.I. director? In theory. Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches criminal law at Duke University, said statutes like Section 1512 were “drafted broadly to cover all possible means of obstruction of justice,” because there are so many ways to thwart the legal system. So in theory, he said, firing an investigator could fit. But there would be significant practical obstacles to bringing such a case. Did Mr. Trump have lawful authority to fire Mr. Comey? Yes. But courts have ruled that otherwise lawful acts can constitute obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions. Mr. Buell pointed to a 1998 case in which a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of a lawyer who had filed legal complaints and related motions against a government agent who was investigating an illegal gambling operation. The court ruled that the defendant’s “nominally litigation-related conduct” was unlawful because his real motive was “to safeguard his personal financial interest” in the corrupt enterprise. Would there be impediments to charging Mr. Trump? Yes, and not just that the Justice Department reports to Mr. Trump and is therefore unlikely to prosecute him for anything. Obstruction of justice cases often come down to whether prosecutors can prove what a defendant’s mental state was when he or she committed the act, legal specialists said. It is not enough to show that a defendant knew the act would have a side consequence of impeding an investigation; achieving that obstruction has to have been the specific intention. "
"WASHINGTON — The acting director of the F.B.I. contradicted the White House on two major issues on Thursday: the support of rank-and-file agents for the fired F.B.I. chief James B. Comey and the importance of the agency’s investigation into Russian election interference. In a striking repudiation of official White House statements, the acting director, Andrew G. McCabe, said the inquiry was “highly significant” and pledged to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the F.B.I. would resist any attempt to influence or hobble the investigation. “Simply put,” he said, “you cannot stop the men and women of the F.B.I. from doing the right thing.” That Mr. McCabe felt compelled to assert the F.B.I.’s independence was itself remarkable, a byproduct of the unusually public effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to take focus off the investigations into Russia’s election meddling. He also said the F.B.I. investigation had the resources it needed, partly disputing an account that Mr. Comey had sought more aid. Mr. McCabe did not hesitate to make clear where Mr. Comey stood in the eyes of F.B.I. agents and employees. “Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the F.B.I. and still does,” he said, adding that “the vast majority of F.B.I. employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.” "
"President Donald Trump’s abrupt dismissal of James B. Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on May 9 truncated what is typically a 10-year term, the length of which is meant to protect the bureau from political pressures. The implications of the move are being debated: Some have praised the decision, while others have questioned its timing — the F.B.I. is in the middle of investigating whether any Trump associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election. These books offer context by providing insight into the institution’s history, as well as an account of what it’s like to be on the inside. THE BUREAU
The Secret History of the F.B.I. (2002)
By Ronald Kessler
496 pp. Ronald Kessler, a longtime reporter on the F.B.I., recounts the organization’s history since its creation in 1908, when Theodore Roosevelt proposed the idea of a national police force to a dubious Congress. At the time, Congress expressed concern that a secret bureau would merely carry out the mandates of whoever was in office. Still, the “special agent force” began work with 34 agents, and its power and influence expanded relatively quickly. Kessler investigates the relationship between F.B.I. directors and sitting presidents and also includes exclusive interviews with Robert Mueller, who led the F.B.I. in the period immediately after 9/11.

"WASHINGTON — Soon after the Trump administration took office this year, the National Security Agency secretly briefed its new overseers at the White House that they had inherited a problem with the agency’s warrantless surveillance program. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was delaying its annual reauthorization because the N.S.A. had discovered widespread violations of a rule for how analysts could handle Americans’ emails collected under the program. Now, the agency director, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, was proposing to solve the problem by significantly reducing an important type of surveillance undertaken through the program. President Trump’s new national security team, recalled Thomas P. Bossert, Mr. Trump’s homeland security adviser, decided to bless the N.S.A.’s proposal. The move increased the risk that the program might miss something important it otherwise would have collected, but removed a cloud at a time when the law on which the program is based, the FISA Amendments Act, is about to expire unless Congress extends it. “We decided to act on that, rather than getting into a conflict with the court, and struck a balance to protect the country without getting into Americans’ privacy,” Mr. Bossert said in an interview. He added, “We want to confine the program in a way that focuses on security and minimizes concerns about Americans’ domestic collection.” Mr. Bossert spoke about the sequence of events leading up to the program’s contraction, the outlines of which came to light last month, as the government on Thursday declassified and made public a lengthy ruling by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s presiding judge, Rosemary Collyer. The ruling provided more details about what happened. Since 2008, when Congress legalized the warrantless surveillance program under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, the court has annually reauthorized the program under its oversight. In October 2016, the opinion showed, as Judge Collyer was weighing whether to do so again, the government notified her about a study by the N.S.A.’s inspector general that uncovered the problems. "
"After being in a boy band, Harry Styles was a blank slate. Speaking recently about recording his debut solo album — which has, for years, felt like a foregone conclusion, given his status as the most breezily winning member of One Direction — the floppy-haired 23-year-old Mr. Styles said: “When we started, I didn’t know what it was going to sound like, or what I wanted it to sound like.” Where he landed, while not entirely predictable, considering the beat-driven pop sounds of the day, was close to home: “Pink Floyd, Beatles, Stones, Fleetwood — all the stuff I grew up listening to,” Mr. Styles said. And as unlikely as that may sound, it’s true: His self-titled LP is a paean to classic rock and its English progeny (Oasis, Blur), built around fingerpicked acoustic guitars, McCartneyesque jangle and lyrics about one-night stands with devilish women. “She’s all over me, it’s like I paid for it/I’m gonna pay for this,” Mr. Styles, who is not running from his essential Jaggerness, sings on “Kiwi,” a sleazy-sounding number with grown-up references to cigarettes and cocaine. Softer and more broadly sensitive are the first single, “Sign of the Times” (a homage to Prince in title, and Bowie in practice), and the more believably adult closing track, “From the Dining Table,” which begins: “Woke up alone in this hotel room/Played with myself/Where were you?” Yet, for all the earthbound introspection and insistent maturity, Mr. Styles, who was discovered, along with his former group, by Simon Cowell on “The X Factor,” remains as slippery in conversation as any megafamous pop star who’s been dodging tabloids since he was 16. On the phone from London this month, he insulated his vagueness with polite deflection and generalities while declaring that his new album was his most open work to date. “I just realized that I find writing to be very therapeutic — I think it’s when I allow myself to be most vulnerable,” Mr. Styles said. “It’s exciting to kind of share a piece of me that I don’t feel like I’ve really put out there before.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The fallout from President Trump’s abrupt firing of the head of the F.B.I. dominated a Senate hearing about the biggest security threats facing the United States. Andrew McCabe, the acting F.B.I. director, above, rejected the White House’s claim that James Comey had lost the support of his colleagues, contradicting the president’s latest explanation for the dismissal. Mr. McCabe also said that the firing had not affected the Justice Department’s investigation of Russia’s meddling in the presidential election. Our reporter Michael Shear gave us an inside look on how he broke the news of Mr. Comey’s firing. And his colleagues Peter Baker, Maggie Haberman and Matthew Rosenberg offer analysis of the decision in this video. "
"On Thursday, The Times editorial board published an open letter to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who wrote the memo that President Trump cited in firing James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. It urged Mr. Rosenstein to appoint a special counsel to investigate the Trump campaign’s ties with Russia. In response, readers offered their own advice in the comments of the editorial. Below is a selection of letters, edited for clarity and brevity. Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, I would rather have you inside than out. I would rather have you speak up and be fired than to acquiesce. I expect you to bring all your experience to bear on our current troubling problems and do that which is right according to constitution and law. Fran Murphy Dear Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: Wrong is wrong, and who is president and which political party is in office should have nothing to do with your decision. Russia’s role in our elections needs to be thoroughly investigated by independent people with integrity. Some believe that President Trump’s efforts to stonewall the investigation only heighten suspicions that he is directly involved and that his links to Russia are more damaging than we know. Perhaps President Trump is innocent, as he maintains, but only a credible investigation can clear the air and restore confidence in this government’s commitment to justice, truth and accountability. PB Dear Mr. Rosenstein: I write as the spouse of a whistle-blower and a whistle-blower myself. I won’t go into the details, but suffice it to say we each observed unethical colleague behavior, involving vulnerable students and the welfare of future students. In each case, we made the decisions together, discussing the issues, the ethical/legal concerns and the potential for blowback and professional harm. We did everything we could to rectify situations and to try and ensure that our concerns were taken to the highest levels we could access. "
"President Trump had another busy day on Thursday: He received his daily intelligence briefing, signed two executive orders, posed for photographs in the Oval Office and was interviewed at the White House by NBC News. He also found time to reignite his decade-long feud with the comedian Rosie O’Donnell. Mr. Trump shared a message on Twitter by Ms. O’Donnell from December in what appears to be his latest attempt to prove that even his critics truly support his decision to fire the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. The president has highlighted past criticism by Democrats about Mr. Comey and noted on Thursday afternoon that even his longtime foe once wanted the F.B.I. director gone. Ms. O’Donnell wrote on Dec. 20, “FIRE COMEY.” Mr. Trump shared her tweet and added, “We finally agree on something Rosie.” If his comment was intended to be an olive branch to Ms. O’Donnell, she did not receive it that way. She replied to him, “U don’t even realize the kind of trouble u r in — comeys people believe in him — for real — they have the proof — u r a sadistic man #USA”. Mr. Trump and Ms. O’Donnell have traded barbs since 2006. That year, she was a co-host on “The View” and criticized Mr. Trump on the show, mocking his haircut and mentioning his bankruptcies and record of not paying contractors. He responded by threatening to sue her and telling “Entertainment Tonight” that she was “disgusting” and “a slob” with “a fat, ugly face.” After the advent of Twitter, they took their attacks to social media. In a presidential debate between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton in September, he unexpectedly brought up his feud again. “Somebody who has been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,” he said.

"AMUDA, Syria — At long last, those of us struggling to maintain a fledgling democracy in Northern Syria have been buoyed by the announcement from the Trump administration that the American military will begin to directly arm the Kurdish men and women who make up the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Those forces have been America’s most valued and effective allies in the war against the Islamic State. This is something we’ve asked for repeatedly during the nearly three years our militias have been fighting the Islamic State and winning, victories achieved despite tough odds and a lack of heavy weapons. We’ve steadily driven the jihadists back hundreds of miles to the brink of defeat at Raqqa. The Islamic State won’t give up its self-styled capital easily. This military aid will be crucial in finishing the job. But as President Trump prepares to meet next week with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey — no friend to the Kurds in Syria or in his own country — we ask the American president and people to be mindful of the enormous sacrifice the Kurdish people have made in this fight, and the importance of the unique democratic system we have worked hard to build in the area of Northern Syria known as Rojava. We’re fighting the Islamic State because it’s the right thing to do, but we’ve paid dearly for our victories. We have already lost many thousands of our young men and women in battle, and we know many hundreds more will die in Raqqa. Once we win that battle, will America cave in to Turkish pressure and abandon us, despite this sacrifice? In recent weeks, Turkey has conducted cross-border airstrikes, killing dozens of our fighters whose mission was to resist the Islamic State, and causing American forces who are here to help us to head to the border in a show of solidarity and to keep the peace. But what happens when Raqqa is liberated and the United States moves on? Will America stand silently by if Mr. Erdogan makes good on his threats to overrun the border and decimate Rojava simply because his regime cannot tolerate a pluralistic democracy that includes the Kurds right next door?

"President Trump is perhaps the world’s most powerful television addict. And like any TV fan, he has strong opinions about what he watches. In a series of caustic criticisms this week, Mr. Trump laced into on-air stars like the CNN news anchor Don Lemon and Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show” on CBS. He insisted that he had tuned out networks like CNN and MSNBC, but he proceeded to comment in detail about those networks’ coverage of his administration. Speaking at the White House with reporters from Time magazine, Mr. Trump derided Mr. Lemon as “perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting” and called Chris Cuomo, the CNN morning anchor, “a chained lunatic.” “He’s like a boiler ready to explode,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Cuomo. “The level of hatred. And the entire, you know, the entire CNN platform is that way.” The president went on to lament the plight of Jeffrey Lord, his stalwart on-air defender on CNN, saying: “Poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he’s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of.” CNN’s public-relations team issued a blunt riposte to Mr. Trump on Thursday: “His comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.” "
"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — It is still uncertain whether Republicans in Congress will succeed in undoing the Affordable Care Act, but the debate over repealing it may have already done in Midwestern Nice. It was Tuesday evening, and inside a community college gymnasium, the jeers were hailing down on Representative Rod Blum, a Republican from northeastern Iowa, as he defended his vote for a bill that would reshape health care and repeal much of President Barack Obama’s biggest domestic accomplishment. “Be an adult!” “Hey, shut up!” “Answer our question!” Few Republicans are holding in-person town hall events in the wake of the bill’s narrow passage in the House last week, but Mr. Blum’s constituents were not giving him any credit for showing up. They waved red sheets of paper to signal their disapproval and hurled down a chorus of criticism over health care, President Trump’s taxes, the investigations into Russian meddling in the presidential election and the latest bombshell: the firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. “I’m not going to over-shout you, so if you want to keep interrupting,” Mr. Blum started to say. “Booo!” “It’s kind of sad that politics has come to this,” he began again. “Booooo!” Iowans in the crowd said the stakes of the Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and deeply cut Medicaid were worth shouting about. To some, it was life and death. To conservatives, it was freedom versus a failing bureaucracy. "
"WASHINGTON — The House Republican campaign arm is increasingly at odds with the White House over how best to retain the party’s congressional majorities and, more broadly, who is in charge of the midterm campaign effort as Republicans spend millions of dollars in special elections to retain House seats in conservative-leaning districts. President Trump’s decision to tap four House Republicans for top administration posts forced the National Republican Congressional Campaign to defend open seats amid a fierce backlash against the president from energized liberals. Two of those races, in Georgia and Montana, have been surprisingly competitive, and as Republicans scramble to hold the seats, senior Republican officials have begun sniping. The friction came into view this week after Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, told The New York Times that he had lobbied the White House to appoint some House Democrats from Republican-leaning districts to the cabinet or ambassadorial posts, in hopes that the party could flip the seats. “They have not availed themselves of those opportunities,” Mr. Stivers said of Mr. Trump’s administration. After reading the Times article, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, complained angrily to associates that Mr. Stivers was not treating the White House with respect and should not have publicly shared his request, according to three Republicans directly familiar with Mr. Priebus’s criticism.

"Roger J. Stone Jr., the subject and star of “Get Me Roger Stone,” struts through this documentary with peacock feathers fully fanned. He’s first heard from a perch in some luxury digs, dressed in a tailored chalk-stripe suit with an olive martini at the ready. “My name is Roger Stone,” he says, “and I’m an agent provocateur.” The scene suggests James Bond cosplay, although it’s worth mentioning that the definition of an agent provocateur isn’t a supercool British fantasy spy but someone who persuades others to do wrong. So, who is Mr. Stone persuading? It’s an inevitable question given his relationship with President Trump and how Mr. Stone’s name just keeps popping up in the news churn. In a May 5 article in The New York Times, for starters, Mr. Stone confirmed that he was one of what the report called “high-profile Trump campaign associates” who’d been asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee “to hand over emails and other records of dealings with Russians as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election.” Mr. Stone said that he was “eager, indeed anxious, to testify in full public session, have requested no immunity and am ready to go.” Skip to this Tuesday, when President Trump fired James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., noting his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Mr. Stone, 64, a giddily freewheeling Twitter user, greeted this news with a series of tweets, including one with a GIF of Mr. Trump stamped “You’re Fired!” and another that reads “Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling.” On Wednesday, CNN reported that Mr. Stone had recommended that Mr. Trump fire Mr. Comey. The president responded via Twitter: Whatever else, this is killer timing for Netflix, which is releasing “Get Me Roger Stone” on Friday in theaters and via streaming. That’s especially true because in any other year and perhaps under any other administration, this documentary — the directors are Daniel DiMauro, Dylan Bank and Morgan Pehme — might have disappeared into the ether. But topicality is all or at least a large part of the movie’s draw. A sometimes illuminating, often slapdash and frustrating affair that mixes on-the-scenes bits, found material and original interviews (with the likes of Jeffrey Toobin), it opens with Mr. Trump accepting the presidential nomination in July 2016 and ends soon after his election. Much of the rest is a chronological march through Mr. Stone’s life, which is studded with scandal and boldfaced names like Roy Cohn. As it maps the road to Trumpville, the movie offers glimpses of Mr. Stone’s youth, including an oft-repeated story about a light-bulb encounter with Barry Goldwater’s book “The Conscience of a Conservative.” An ideological true believer is born who backs legal pot and has a few Nixon-theme bongs that he likes to show off along with his other Nixonian paraphernalia. After a brush with Watergate, Mr. Stone pokes around here and there; works for both of Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaigns; and helps establish a firm that grew into Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, one of a number of companies that earned the nickname “the torturers’ lobby” for repping countries condemned as human-rights abusers. The documentary also sketches a political family tree that could be its own movie and that has Cohn, the chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy, at its head and branches out to include Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone wasn’t yet 30 when he met Cohn in 1979. (At the time, Mr. Stone was helping to run Reagan’s presidential campaign.) Cohn served as Mr. Trump’s lawyer for years and, by many accounts, assumed the role of mentor. It was Cohn who introduced Mr. Stone to Mr. Trump; Mr. Stone decided that Mr. Trump was presidential material and, years later, has become identified as one of the president’s outside advisers. "
"HUGER, S.C. — Safely stationed in the control pulpit, Chris St. Amand is watching the pot boil. Working the day shift at the sprawling Nucor Steel plant along the Cooper River here, Mr. St. Amand monitors a four-foot-wide lasagna noodle of steel as it is dunked into a molten broth of protective shimmering zinc. He tracks every step of this galvanization process — from the caldron’s 865-degree temperature to the line speed — on a bank of flashing screens. Except, that is, for the screen at the bottom right. “I watch our stock and the Dow Jones on that one,” he said. Mr. St. Amand, whose pay package includes profit-sharing, likes what he sees. Since Election Day, Nucor is up 13 percent. Across the steel industry, stock prices — and spirits — have been on the rise, lifted by President Trump’s vow to protect American manufacturers against cheaper imports and invest as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure over the next decade. “If you could design a perfect administration from the perspective of the steel industry, this would be it,” said Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, ticking off the president’s promises to hack away regulations and lower taxes, while fending off foreign competitors and embarking on a “Buy America” building program. Even before a single presidential vote was cast, American steel makers had been buoyed last year by record automotive sales and a series of penalties slapped on foreign producers like China for illegally dumping subsidized steel in the United States. “We expect our sheet and plate steel mills will benefit from trade actions taken over the last year,” said John Ferriola, Nucor’s chief executive.

"Dear Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: It’s rare that any single person has to bear as much responsibility for safeguarding American democracy as you find yourself carrying now. Even before President Trump’s shocking decision on Tuesday to fire the F.B.I. director, James Comey, a dark cloud of suspicion surrounded this president, and the very integrity of the electoral process that put him in office. At this fraught moment you find yourself, improbably, to be the person with the most authority to dispel that cloud and restore Americans’ confidence in their government. We sympathize; that’s a lot of pressure. Given the sterling reputation you brought into this post — including a 27-year career in the Justice Department under five administrations, and the distinction of being the longest-serving United States attorney in history — you no doubt feel a particular anguish, and obligation to act. As the author of the memo that the president cited in firing Mr. Comey, you are now deeply implicated in that decision. It was a solid brief; Mr. Comey’s misjudgments in his handling of the F.B.I. investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email server were indeed serious. Yet you must know that these fair criticisms were mere pretext for Mr. Trump, who dumped Mr. Comey just as he was seeking more resources to investigate ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. You must also know that in ordering you to write the memo, Mr. Trump exploited the integrity you have earned over nearly three decades in public service, spending down your credibility as selfishly as he has spent other people’s money throughout his business career. We can only hope that your lack of an explicit recommendation to fire Mr. Comey reflects your own refusal to go as far as the president wanted you to. In any case, the memo is yours, and that has compromised your ability to oversee any investigations into Russian meddling. But after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from these matters, because of his own contacts during the campaign with the Russians, the power to launch a truly credible investigation has fallen to you, and you alone.

Here’s what you need to know: • Washington is still reeling from President Trump’s sudden firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey. Mr. Comey had requested additional resources for the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election just days earlier. The White House denied a link, and Mr. Trump accused critics of hypocrisy.

"Well before the House voted last week to replace Obamacare with President Trump’s American Health Care Act, Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia who is up for re-election in 2018, met with the president. By his own account, Manchin told Trump: During the campaign, Trump appeared to fully grasp Manchin’s point. Trump declared that “there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid” and added that “the middle class has to be protected.” Safety net commitments were crucial to Trump’s appeal to white working-class voters, the constituency that put him over the top in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In Manchin’s West Virginia, Trump swept every county, carrying the state with 67.9 percent of the vote compared with Hillary Clinton’s 26.2. Even after he won the presidency, Trump maintained his pro forma commitment to social insurance. What in fact would the Trump-backed measure passed by the House last week actually do? The bill cuts spending by Medicaid by more than $800 billion over ten years. This enormous cut endangers continued coverage for millions of struggling voters who cast ballots for Trump. The bill also includes starkly regressive tax provisions. By 2022, when the provisions of the AHCA would be fully effective, those in the bottom two quintiles would pay higher taxes, up to $160 annually, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Those in the middle of the income distribution would get an average annual tax cut of $240; those in the fourth quintile, a cut of $510; and those in the top 20 percent, an average tax cut of $2,830. The distributional impact of the tax provisions is most apparent in the highest income brackets: those in the top one percent, whose household income is more than $770,000, would get an average tax cut of $37,220. Those in the top 0.1 percent, who make $4 million or more, would get an average reduction of $207,240. "
"President Trump recently sat for a long interview with The Economist magazine in which he discussed his economic agenda. One exchange was particularly attention-grabbing for those who could remember their high school history, or who paid vague attention to the debates over stimulus during the last recession. Explaining why he seeks tax cuts even if they risk expanding the budget deficit, President Trump said that they might increase the deficit temporarily, but that “we have to prime the pump.” “Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?” the president said. Yes, the interviewer — who, again, is an editor of The Economist — confirmed. “Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven’t heard it. I mean, I just … I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good.” Hoo boy. Let’s unpack this. What is Mr. Trump talking about? “Priming the pump” is a common metaphor for using government tax and spending to try to boost the economy into a higher level of functioning. The origin of the metaphor refers to pumps used to extract water from wells, which were more widespread before most people had indoor plumbing. The basic idea was to pour a bit of water into a mechanism to make it possible to pump water out. Here’s a video! "
"Shortly after President Trump fired F.B.I. Director James B. Comey, New York Times readers expressed optimism, outrage and skepticism across nytimes.com, Facebook and Twitter. Mr. Trump said he fired Mr. Comey over the F.B.I. investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, but in his letter to Mr. Comey, the president hinted that he was also concerned about the investigation into his own administration’s ties to Russia. That article received more than 6,500 comments approved by moderators, who review nearly every one before they are published on The Times’s digital platforms. Thousands more readers weighed in on The Times’s Facebook page. Here are excerpts from the comments, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Readers believed Mr. Comey was doomed once he admitted that there was an investigation into the Trump administration’s dealings with Russia. Days before he was fired, Mr. Comey had asked for funds to continue that inquiry. “It wasn’t hard to see this coming; the investigation into possible Trump campaign dealings with Russia’s intelligence network has been a sharp sword hanging over the President’s head. Being an opportunist, [Trump] just saw an opportunity to replace Comey with a more compliant F.B.I. director who will make the investigation go away.” — Nick Wright in Halifax, Nova Scotia "
"Two memoirs about parents feature among our selections this week: the poet Patricia Lockwood’s lively account of her father, a Catholic priest (long story), and the novelist Richard Ford’s reckoning with the lives of his father and mother, which leads him to a reckoning with himself. Lesley Nneka Arimah’s debut short-story collection walks the line between magical and psychological realism, and a cult classic Taiwanese novel from the 1990s explores the far reaches of intimacy and obsession.

The poet Lockwood’s memoir is fueled by a great character: her father, a rare married Catholic priest, a big bear of a man fond of guns, cream liqueurs and pork rinds. The book is “consistently alive with feeling,” our critic Dwight Garner wrote, “and I suspect it may mean a lot to many people, especially the lapsed Catholics among us. It is, for sure, like no book I have read.” THIS FIGHT IS OUR FIGHT: The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class, by Elizabeth Warren. (Metropolitan/Holt, $28.) In this tough-minded manifesto, the Massachusetts senator rails against income inequality and its consequences, and discusses how it can be reduced through public policy. Warren lays out a position of “enlightened populism” (as our reviewer, Paul Krugman, calls it), and makes good use of the autobiographical mode, contrasting her stories of modern hard times with the opportunities her generation had in a less unequal era. LAST HOPE ISLAND: Britain, Occupied Europe, and the Brotherhood That Helped Turn the Tide of War, by Lynne Olson. (Random House, $30.) Olson, in her fourth book about World War II, argues that the people of occupied Europe and the expatriate leaders did far more for their own liberation than historians have realized. Books and films have dramatized individual stories of the resistance, but the scale of the organization she describes is breathtaking. WHAT IT MEANS WHEN A MAN FALLS FROM THE SKY, by Lesley Nneka Arimah. (Riverhead, $26.) Originality and narrative verve characterize the stories in this first collection by a British-Nigerian-American writer. A witty and mischievous storyteller, Arimah can compress a family history into a few pages as she moves between comic distancing and insightful psychological realism. She is especially interested in the cruelty and losses brought about by clashes between women, particularly girls. DEMOCRACY: Stories From the Long Road to Freedom, by Condoleezza Rice. (Twelve, $35.) The promotion of democracy should shape America’s foreign policy in the 21st century, the former secretary of state writes in this important new book, even though she recognizes that it’s “really, really hard.” It remains, she insists, both an inescapable moral responsibility for the United States and the only policy that, long-term, has the potential to safeguard American security.

"It’s called the “Working Families Flexibility Act,” but it would accommodate only employers and could cheat families. The bill, which the House recently passed, would supposedly let employees who work overtime choose paid time off rather than time-and-a-half wages. But the time off would come at the convenience of employers, who would have 13 months to schedule it. This is not allowed under current law, for good reason: Most employers would prefer to postpone pay whenever possible, and employees are likely to go along with their boss’s wishes regardless of their own. Current law avoids any such coercion by requiring overtime to be paid in the pay period it’s earned. The Republican bill would not only make employees vulnerable to wage delays, but to wage theft. An employer could deny a time-off request by deeming it “unduly” disruptive — a vague standard that basically gives employers total control over when the time off is taken. If an employee tires of waiting and asks, instead, for the pay, employers could take up to 30 days to honor the request. If any employee quits or a company goes out of business, unpaid overtime could be difficult or impossible to extract from the employer. Besides, current law already allows for flexibility in workers’ schedules. Employers can let employees vary their start and end times, or schedule four 10-hour workdays with an extra day off each week, or nine-hour workdays with a day off every other week. Supporters of the bill point out that public workers already have the options it provides. But those workers are often unionized and a government employer does not have the profit incentive that might tempt a private-sector employer to coerce workers into delaying their overtime pay. In the past 16 years, House Republicans have introduced bills like the Working Families Flexibility Act seven times, but the Senate has remained lukewarm, and in 2013 President Barack Obama said that he would veto a similar bill if it ever reached his desk. This time around, President Trump has already said he will sign it if it comes to him. That would be a raw deal. And it would be fraudulent, because it would purport to help working people while doing no such thing. "
"Moon Jae-in was not president-elect for long. He won the South Korean election on Tuesday and was in office on Wednesday. Normally, he would have had a two-month transition period, but his impeached predecessor, Park Geun-hye, is in jail facing corruption charges. But then, it could be argued that no amount of time could fully prepare Mr. Moon for what lies ahead as he and his fellow liberals take charge after years of conservative rule. The many South Koreans who took part in the street protests over the corrupt status quo that preceded Ms. Park’s fall are impatient for thorough economic and political reforms. On the North Korean front, the steady escalation of tensions could become worse over potentially sharp differences on strategy between Mr. Moon and President Trump, with his fast-shifting views on North Korea. Mr. Moon’s conservative predecessors generally shared America’s approach to North Korea, which is basically to pressure the North through sanctions and other measures to abandon its nuclear program. Mr. Moon is closer in outlook to his late friend and ideological ally Roh Moo-hyun, who as president from 2003 to 2008 pursued a “sunshine policy” of seeking to engage North Korea through dialogue, aid and joint projects. Though much has changed since then — including the rise of Kim Jong-un, the third ruler of the Kim dynasty, and the relentless development of nuclear weapons in the North — the liberals Mr. Moon leads believe sanctions alone have failed to deter North Korea, and are wary of being drawn into a struggle between the United States and China. An immediate source of friction with Washington is a potent antimissile system the United States has deployed in South Korea, which the liberals opposed. The opposition has been intensified by China’s furious reaction, including a boycott of South Korean brands, and President Trump’s statement last month — promptly pulled back — that Seoul should pay $1 billion for the battery. Mr. Moon has said he will review the deployment, though he insists he will fully consult with the United States before making any decision on this or any other North Korean matter. "
"The federal agency that administers the nation’s presidential libraries criticized a viral tweet sent by the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum that appeared to poke fun at President Trump and his decision to fire James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. The tweet, posted Tuesday, sought to snidely distinguish between Mr. Trump’s decision to dismiss the person leading an investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia and President Richard M. Nixon’s decision in 1973 to accept the resignations of the attorney general and deputy attorney general, who had refused to fire the prosecutor investigating Nixon. “FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian,” the post said. By Wednesday night, the message, which some saw as a bizarre jab at Mr. Trump, had been retweeted more than 38,000 times and liked more than 53,000 times. It had not been deleted. The response prompted the National Archives and Records Administration to issue a statement. “As a federal government agency, the National Archives does not condone or engage in partisan or political conversations,” the statement said. “The Nixon Library and Museum posted a tweet Tuesday, May 9, that was not representative of the policies of the Library or the National Archives.” The statement continued, “The National Archives is examining the training provided to employees who post to official social media channels as well as reviewing work flows and approval processes to ensure that our social media efforts engage the public in constructive conversations in line with agency policies.” The presidential library system is made up of 14 libraries overseen by the Office of Presidential Libraries, which is a component of the National Archives. In an email to The New York Times, James B. Pritchett, a spokesman for the National Archives and Records Administration, said Wednesday that agency officials knew who had posted the message, but would not comment on whether or how that person might be disciplined. He said that the archives and the presidential libraries received federal funding, and that the agency had not been contacted directly by Mr. Trump or any administration officials. In January, Mr. Trump spoke by telephone with the acting director of the National Park Service to ask why someone from the agency had shared a Twitter post that provided an unflattering comparison between the size of Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowd and that of former President Barack Obama. The Park Service apologized for having retweeted that post and one other, after stopping its Twitter activity altogether for several hours. "
"SEOUL, South Korea — The leaders of South Korea and China moved on Thursday to mend ties that have been strained by the deployment of an American missile-defense system in South Korea. During a congratulatory call from President Xi Jinping of China to Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s newly minted president, Mr. Moon revealed his plans to send a delegation to Beijing to resolve the dispute over the system, which China views as a threat to its security, Mr. Moon’s office said. Mr. Xi also asked him to visit Beijing, Mr. Moon’s office said. Mr. Moon, a liberal, has criticized the system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad. His conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, agreed to its deployment, saying it was needed to protect South Korea from a growing ballistic missile threat from the North. Thaad is one of the thorniest diplomatic issues the new South Korean leader faces. If he asks the United States to withdraw the defense system, which became operational last week, he risks rupturing South Korea’s close alliance with the United States and looking as if he is succumbing to Chinese pressure. Despite Thursday’s overture, it will not be easy for Mr. Moon to reverse the decision on Thaad, especially since it has already been deployed, analysts said, including those who worked as policy advisers for Mr. Moon when he was a candidate. Rather, they said, Mr. Moon will try to persuade China that it should help rein in North Korea’s provocative behavior until both the South and the United States decide the system is no longer necessary.

"We’re following major developments in the markets throughout the day. Check below for the latest updates. Snap shares were down in after-hours trading last night, and they are down in real trading today. Katie Benner explains why: More trouble in the traditional retail sector: Macy’s shares fell sharply when trading opened on Thursday, as the department store giant reported worse-than-expected quarterly results. As online shopping giants like Amazon have combined with changing shopping habits, shopping mall operators and department stores have found themselves squeezed. Macy’s was no exception — it cited high inventories and a ninth straight quarter of falling sales. The French bank Crédit Agricole said on Thursday that its profit more than tripled in the first quarter, driven in part by strong fixed-income trading by clients in the first three months of the year and strong performance in LCL, its French retail banking business.

"Whole Foods, once an organic retailing pioneer, is facing perhaps the greatest crisis of confidence in its 37-year history. Its response has been to get defensive. The American company has been under pressure from the hedge fund Jana Partners and the money manager Neuberger Berman, which have both been pushing for change. Whole Foods had already offered to accept two of Jana’s proposed board nominees on the condition that the activist investor refrain from publicly agitating for change. Jana refused. On Wednesday, Whole Foods announced a sweeping overhaul: • Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive (who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times) is the new chairwoman. • Keith Manbeck, a former vice president of Kohl’s, will be the new chief financial officer. • Five members of the board were replaced. “We pay attention to what our shareholders tell us,” John Mackey, a founder and the chief executive of the retailer, said in an interview.

"In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Francine Prose and Thomas Mallon suggest reading that suits the current moment and tells us what we can expect from it. By Francine Prose Jane Mayer’s “Dark Money” explores the roots of the intense class divisions and gross inequalities that beset us. Jane Mayer’s harrowing “Dark Money” should be required reading for anyone who wants to know how our country got into the mess we’re in. Mayer shows how the intense class divisions and gross inequalities that beset us now were neither inevitable nor accidental, but carefully orchestrated by a handful of billionaires determined to transform the United States into a cash machine from which only the wealthiest citizens could withdraw. Beginning in the 1970s, alarmed by Richard Nixon’s tough new restrictions aimed at protecting the environment, these oil, banking and industrial moguls spent fortunes working behind the scenes, fighting against anything that would increase their costs or decrease their profits. Perhaps the most famous of these Wizard of Oz-like figures are Charles and David Koch, but there are others (among them the family of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos) whose stories Mayer tells: tycoons who silenced whistle-blowers, intimidated rivals, sued and blackmailed their own siblings, and whose plans for us involved polluting our air and water, lowering taxes for the wealthy, and drastically decreasing the amount we spend on education, health and welfare. To implement their agenda, they started foundations, think tanks and university programs; they financed libertarian political campaigns and the Tea Party movement, all the while using these “charitable” donations as loopholes to avoid paying taxes. According to Mayer, President Obama never stood much of a chance against the power of his opponents’ money, determination and resistance — and their untiring and ultimately successful efforts to turn the Republican Party into the “party of no.” Greed isn’t pretty, and “Dark Money” won’t make you feel differently about the deadly sin that is currently ruling our society. But the book answers some questions. In its final paragraph David Koch tells us everything we need to know about what motivates him and others like him. When, as a child, he was asked to share a treat, he would say, “I just want my fair share — which is all of it.” "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Washington, still reeling. A sense of crisis deepened in the capital on Wednesday after President Trump’s abrupt dismissal of the F.B.I. director, James Comey. Here’s the latest: • Days before he was fired, Mr. Comey requested more resources for the bureau’s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. We look at the state of the various inquiries, including a Senate committee subpoena of Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser. • In a video, three of our reporters discuss the firing. How, why and what’s next? • We looked back at the deterioration of ties between the president and the F.B.I. director: Mr. Trump thought there “was something wrong” with Mr. Comey, who in turn thought the president was “outside the realm of normal.” • “I will be fine.” Read Mr. Comey’s farewell letter to the F.B.I., where agents are wondering about the future of the Russia inquiry. • We’re tracking how every member of Congress has responded to the dismissal, and we collected reactions from the right and the left. Follow our live briefing for further developments. • An awkwardly timed meeting. President Trump met face to face for the first time with top envoys of Moscow on Wednesday, receiving the foreign minister and the  Russian ambassador in the Oval Office. "

Stephen Colbert said that President Trump’s firing of James Comey as F.B.I. director seemed so blatantly political that it showed that the president did not care about keeping up appearances. The news of Mr. Comey’s firing was all over the late-night shows on Wednesday. Jimmy Kimmel had this to say: On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah said Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey seemed like the work of a paranoid, cheating lover. "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Thursday named Kris W. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on undocumented immigrants, to a commission investigating vote fraud, following through on his unsubstantiated claim that millions of “illegals” voted for his Democratic rival and robbed him of victory in the national popular vote. Mr. Kobach, who has championed the strictest voter identification laws in the country, will be the vice chairman of the commission, which will be led by Vice President Mike Pence and is expected to include about a dozen others, including state officials from both political parties, said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday creating the commission, which Ms. Sanders said would have a broad mandate to review policies and practices that affect Americans’ confidence in the integrity of federal elections. Marc E. Lotter, Mr. Pence’s spokesman, said that voter suppression would be among the topics studied by the commission, which he said would take a wide-ranging look at problems at the state and national levels. But the order makes no mention of suppression or voting restrictions, specifying only “improper” or “fraudulent” registration and voting as issues to be explored. Democrats and civil rights groups condemned the panel as a taxpayer-funded witch hunt, and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a legal request to the White House for records showing “concrete evidence” of fraudulent voting that would warrant the creation of such a commission. “President Trump is attempting to spread his own fake news about election integrity,” said Dale Ho, the director of the A.C.L.U.’s Voting Rights Project. “If the Trump administration really cares about election integrity, it will divulge its supposed evidence before embarking on this commission boondoggle.” The commission was created at a tumultuous time in the White House, after Mr. Trump’s abrupt firing on Tuesday of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, who had been leading an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. United States intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to sway the election to Mr. Trump. "
