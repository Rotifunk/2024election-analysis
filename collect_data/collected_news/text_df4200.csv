"SHANGHAI — President Trump is looking to President Xi Jinping to “do something” about America’s opioid epidemic, for which he blames China. That won’t be easy. Buying opioids from China, despite legal prohibitions, remains as easy as providing money and a shipping address. A drug bazaar thrives on Chinese websites, providing one-stop shopping for users around the world. On Weiku.com, a website based in the eastern city of Hangzhou, close to 100 Chinese companies say they sell fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. Vendors on one Beijing-based website, Mfrbee.com, sell chicken nuggets, basketball jerseys and carfentanil, the elephant tranquilizer that is 10,000 times as potent as morphine. A Shanghai-based chemical company, Shanghai Kaiwodun Biochemical, says it offers the designer drug U-47700 for $1,450 a pound. A Kaiwodun sales agent said over a Skype text message that the company had many customers in the United States and time-tested methods for shipping, sending photos of brown sugar and monosodium glutamate packets and a fuel filter. Weiku removed the search results for fentanyl on its website after The New York Times called the company for comment. A Weiku representative, Liu Congjuan, said that the company banned the advertising of fentanyl on its website but that sellers circumvented the prohibition by making slight tweaks to the forbidden search term. A representative for Mfrbee.com said the company was unaware of the listing and would delete it if it was illegal. Kaiwodun did not immediately respond to questions sent via email and Skype text. "
"The long take has a special mystique, the most famous examples (“Touch of Evil,” “Goodfellas”) being among the most celebrated moments in movie history. But as with any ostentatious technique, the challenge is to incorporate it alongside the other elements without breaking the spell of the story. “Mr. Robot” solved that dilemma this week by making a take seemingly last an entire episode — there were camouflaged edits throughout — in effect making its spell and the story’s one in the same. From the opening moments with Elliot and Angela in the elevator to the final one when they reunited, after a very busy 43 minutes or so for each of them, the camera tracked an unbroken path through an E Corp headquarters thick with skulduggery, rioting and panic. The result was one of the year’s most electric episodes of television. While some of its tricks have fallen flat, “Mr. Robot” has a pretty good track record when it comes to long takes. The first season included evocative sequences like Elliot’s dark and woozy morphine withdrawal fantasy. A few weeks ago a four-plus minute shot took Elliot and Darlene down into the hacker Olympics and a Dark Army confrontation, a descent that carried viewers along with Elliot into the underworld he’s been trying to negotiate since. Similarly, though the camera moves and choreography Sam Esmail and the director of photography Tod Campbell dreamed up for this week’s episode were technically stunning, the approach succeeded because it added new layers to the story. Long takes stress out the audience by withholding the cutaways our minds crave, making us feel the anxiety wracking the characters. On Wednesday this intensified the show’s radically subjective perspective in an episode in which both Elliot and Angela were not only under the gun, but were so in opposition to one another. Their race to the hardware security modules — with Elliot aiming to prevent the destruction of the recovery building, and Angela trying to ensure it — was apparently won by Angela, though the emotional costs were substantial. The nervy visuals also brought to full boil a number of subplots that have been simmering all season or longer. The scope of Elliot’s conflict — with not just Mr. Robot and the Dark Army but also Wellick and Angela — finally came out into the open. Angela was forced to prove herself to her Dark Army overlords, and also face the fact that she is in league with killers, her protestations about building evacuations notwithstanding. (R.I.P. Lydia Riley, probably.) "
"ASBURY PARK, N.J. — Philip Dunton Murphy bounded onto the stage here in early November amid rapturous cheers, though they were not all for him. His good friend, Jon Bon Jovi, had just blitzed through a three-song set, mixed with a brief endorsement of Mr. Murphy spoken over the chords of “Who Says You Can’t Go Home.” For Mr. Murphy, it was a note-perfect moment: irrefutable testimony of his New Jersey bona fides and of his progressive, working-class roots from a native son revered as a balladeer of the New Jersey working stiff. But over more than 500 days of relentless campaigning, such moments did not always come easily or naturally for Mr. Murphy, whose setting for much of his professional life has been rarefied corporate boardrooms and ornate European salons rather than rowdy campaign scenes. As he prepares to take office in January as New Jersey’s next governor, Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, is propped up by a fragile coalition unsure of a man who is largely unknown to most residents. His task is to convince a wary Democratic electorate that he is more than what his resume proclaims — a wealthy, longtime establishment political donor whose insider connections helped him land an ambassadorship — and that his brand of pragmatic-yet-progressive politics is both sincere and able to yield results. With his election, Mr. Murphy becomes the first Democrat to occupy the governor’s office in eight years, further cementing New Jersey’s shift to a decidedly blue state and giving a man who spent years on the periphery as an influential financial contributor his first chance at the political spotlight. He takes over a state where many are disillusioned and angry at the way the outgoing Republican governor, Chris Christie, has left New Jersey, riddled with debt, schools bereft of funding, exorbitant property taxes and a dismal public transit system. Politically inexperienced (his only other foray into elected office was a failed attempt at a seat on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange) and irrepressibly social (his tenure as the American ambassador to Germany was chronicled as much by the local tabloids as by Foreign Policy magazine), Mr. Murphy was able to take himself from banking executive to the doorstep of Drumthwacket, as the governor’s mansion is called, thanks in part to a family finely attuned to Democratic politics.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Voters delivered a forceful rebuke of President Trump and his party on Tuesday, with Democrats winning the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey and making inroads in suburban communities that once favored the Republicans. Here’s a roundup of results, the key takeaways, and a look at the challenges facing Bill de Blasio, who won a second term as mayor of New York. New Jersey rejected Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and the Chris Christie administration, electing Philip Murphy. He’s a political newbie with progressive roots, our  profile shows. Ralph Northam, who kept the governor’s seat blue in Virginia, told supporters, “We will not condone hatred and bigotry.” • Our analysis of the  Virginia race looks at the perils of a Trumpist platform. “We now know what a lot of us in the party already knew: The Trump message is a big loser in swing states,” one Republican strategist said. • Devin Kelley, the gunman who killed 26 people in a Texas church, once escaped from a psychiatric hospital but was able to buy weapons later.

"Great wealth in America primarily comes from two sources: entrepreneurship and inheritance. In any age, how people work and create great wealth and how others put to use money they inherited, sometimes many generations removed, speak to the complicated feelings people have around wealth. Entrepreneurs range across every industry, from the esoteric to the fascinating. For a time, tech entrepreneurs who took industry-changing ideas hatched in their dorm rooms and rode them to vast and quick wealth were lionized. Now many in that group are seen as selfishly fixated on the wealth itself. Society’s view of inheritors has always been complicated. Some have been president, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, George and George W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. Other inheritors have used their great wealth to endow museums, universities or charities, like the Whitneys, Vanderbilts and Rockefellers. Some, of course, have just had tremendous fun with their inheritance, not always to society’s approval. To better understand how the sources of wealth might change one’s view of it — and life — I reached out to the multimillionaires Blaine Vess, 36, an entrepreneur, and Mitzi Perdue, 76, an inheritor, who bring equally complicated views to their wealth. In August, Mr. Vess sold the online study-aid company he founded, Student Brands, in his college dorm to Barnes & Noble for $58.5 million in cash. His dorm was at San Jose State University, not Stanford or Harvard. It took him 17 years to build the company. And during that time it was always profitable, growing from $60,000 in revenue when he graduated in 2004 to over $20 million in 2016. He also owned an estimated 80 percent of the company. Last year, he started a second company, Solve, an airport concierge service, and this fall sold it to Blacklane, a global chauffeur service. At age 26, Mrs. Perdue and her siblings inherited Ernest Henderson’s controlling stake in Sheraton hotels, which he had founded during the Great Depression. In 1968, the family sold the company to the conglomerate ITT. She had already lived a privileged life, growing up in Boston, traveling widely and attending Radcliffe College, formerly the all-women’s college at Harvard University. She has had a career as a science writer and public speaker. While her first marriage ended in divorce, her second to Frank Perdue, the chicken king, lasted until his death in 2005. It also gave her great insight into another publicly known but private family dynasty. The result is a recently published book on family business, “How To Make Your Family Business Last.” Here are edited and condensed excerpts from my interviews with them.  What did you want do when you were young? "
"FUQING, China — Cao Dewang saw his impoverished mother nearly die of starvation more than 50 years ago, during a famine driven by Mao’s mismanaged push to industrialize China. Today, Mr. Cao is a billionaire auto glass magnate, and he wants to give back. He has given a large chunk of his fortune toward construction of an enormous public library near his hometown and numerous Buddhist temples. He has paid for the medical care of distant relatives of employees who fall seriously ill. He entreats his fellow Chinese billionaires to give as well. “I started from the very bottom of society, so I understand the wants and needs of those at the very bottom,” said Mr. Cao in an interview this year. “We should take care of the needs of our employees as part of a family.” Now, in a factory with roughly 2,000 workers in Moraine, Ohio, 7,600 miles away, Mr. Cao’s paternalistic attitude is facing a deep test. Workers at the plant — owned by Mr. Cao’s company, Fuyao Glass — began two days of voting on Wednesday on whether to unionize. Officials at the United Automobile Workers union say that frustration with highhanded and arbitrary treatment by supervisors has generated support for a union. “They have been very arrogant to the workers,” said Rich Rankin, the U.A.W.’s director for the region. He added that the environment remained challenging, but that organizers had seen rising enthusiasm for their efforts since a rally late last month. "
"BEIJING — [Read more on Joe Biden selecting Antony Blinken as Secretary of State.] Amid the pomp that President Xi Jinping of China is bestowing upon his visiting American counterpart, President Trump, it’s hard not to see two leaders — and two countries — heading in very different directions. Mr. Xi emerged from last month’s Communist Party Congress the undisputed master of the Middle Kingdom. “Xi Jinping Thought” was enshrined in the party constitution — an honor previously granted only to Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Breaking with precedent, Mr. Xi neglected to anoint a successor — a big hint that he feels emboldened to extend his rule beyond the second five-year term he has just begun. The Economist heralded Mr. Xi with an honorific usually reserved for America’s president: the world’s most powerful man. Mr. Trump stepped off Air Force One in Beijing on Wednesday with historically low job-approval ratings, just hours after suffering a shellacking in off-year elections. His credibility is cratering abroad — polls have shown a drop in confidence in American leadership. As the personal trajectories of Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi diverge, so too does the focus of their leadership. While Mr. Trump is obsessed with building walls, Mr. Xi is busy building bridges. At the World Economic Forum in January, Mr. Xi proclaimed China the new champion of free trade and globalization. His “One Belt, One Road” initiative — with funding from the made-in-Beijing Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank — will invest $1 trillion in linking Asia with Europe through a network of sea routes, roads, railways and, yes, bridges. China will gain access to resources, export its excess industrial capacity and peacefully secure strategic footholds from which to project power. While Mr. Trump shuns multilateralism and global governance, Mr. Xi increasingly embraces them. The Trump administration has belittled the United Nations, withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, jettisoned America’s commitment to the Paris climate accord, tried to renege on the nuclear deal with Iran, questioned America’s core alliances in Europe and Asia, disparaged the World Trade Organization and multicountry trade deals, and sought to shut the door on immigrants.

"By any measure, Tuesday was a big night for Democrats, especially in Virginia, where they swept the top offices, including governor, and made strong gains in the General Assembly. Here are some key takeaways from the biggest election night since President Trump’s victory a year ago. It was largely a suburban rebellion, where more moderate voters rejected Mr. Trump and embraced Democrats. Be it New Jersey, Virginia or Charlotte, N.C., Democrats rode a miniwave of victories that will give them energy for candidate recruitment and fund-raising heading into the midterm elections next year. In addition to winning the top races, for governor of New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats also captured the mayoral post in Manchester, N.H., the State Senate in Washington, along with other important victories in statehouse elections.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert highlighted recent reports that Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s golf resort in Florida, received government permission to hire 70 immigrant workers. Mr. Trump has criticized companies that don’t “hire American.” On “Late Night,” Seth Meyers pointed out some questionable hiring practices within Mr. Trump’s administration — specifically in the Department of Agriculture. The Trump ally Sam Clovis recently withdrew from consideration for the job of chief scientist within the department — a job Mr. Trump had nominated him for — after he was linked to the Russia election-meddling scandal. Mr. Clovis is not in fact a scientist. Conan O’Brien is filming his shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem this week, and he’s trying to reclaim his former identity as a New Yorker. Jon Stewart showed up to keep him honest with a “citizenship test,” administered with some help from Andy Richter. Somehow, Mr. O’Brien passed with flying colors. He turned the crowd against himself with this exchange: But won them back with this: "
"Donald Trump has been trying to celebrate his one-year anniversary as president, and all he gets is terrible political news. His party got skunked in Tuesday’s elections, his associates keep getting tied to the Russians and the Republicans in Congress are flailing around like a bunch of panicked gerbils. Hehehehe. In the latest episode of Cabinet Members off the Rails: the sorrows of Wilbur Ross Jr. A new investigative report detailed connections between Ross and a shipping group linked to Vladimir Putin’s son-in-law. Even worse, Forbes announced it was taking Ross off its list of richest Americans, concluding that most of the $3.7 billion Ross told the magazine he owned was fictional. Something must be done. If there is anyone who doesn’t belong in the top levels of American government, it’s a guy pretending to be a billionaire when he really isn’t. The Trump campaign adviser Carter Page made quite a splash with his rambling, six-hour-plus testimony before a congressional committee that demonstrated not only that he had been in contact with Russians during the campaign, but also that the man Trump picked to be one of his top coaches on foreign policy issues is … sort of nuts. “I am not a smooth Russian speaker. Maybe you could say that about my English as well,” explained the former college lecturer with a doctorate from the University of London. One committee member described the whole performance as “really eccentric behavior.” And then came the elections! The biggest race was for governor of Virginia, where Trump had done robocalls and tweeted for the Republican, Ed Gillespie. When his candidate got trounced, Trump quickly and supportively announced that it was Gillespie’s own fault for having failed to “embrace me or what I stand for.” "
"On Oct. 22, 2016, Donald J. Trump made his own history in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he was holding a campaign rally just weeks before his election. “AT&T is buying Time Warner, and thus CNN,” he told his audience, calling the proposed merger an example of a media “power structure” that was working to suppress his vote and the voices of his supporters. It was, he said, “a deal we will not approve in my administration.” He specifically cited media concentration. But his singling out of CNN in the context of an alleged plot against him was lost on no one. Now, CNN is at the heart of a dispute between the Justice Department and AT&T and Time Warner. Three people from the companies said Wednesday that the department insisted that AT&T divest either CNN’s parent company, Turner Broadcasting, or its valuable DirecTV service in return for approval. This raised the chilling possibility that Mr. Trump was making good on his threatening statements in Gettysburg. Adding to the chill was the lack of a compelling legal justification for the department’s conditions, which appeared to come out of the blue. Asking AT&T to divest DirecTV seems to be a non-starter, given how essential DirecTV is as a satellite distributor of content, and the Justice Department had to know that. So in effect, AT&T’s only choice would be to jettison Turner. "
"RICHMOND, Va. — The American suburbs appear to be in revolt against President Trump after a muscular coalition of college-educated voters and racial and ethnic minorities dealt the Republican Party a thumping rejection on Tuesday and propelled a diverse class of Democrats into office. From the tax-obsessed suburbs of New York City to high-tech neighborhoods outside Seattle to the sprawling, polyglot developments of Fairfax and Prince William County, Va., voters shunned Republicans up and down the ballot in off-year elections. Leaders in both parties said the elections were an unmistakable alarm bell for Republicans ahead of the 2018 campaign, when the party’s grip on the House of Representatives may hinge on the socially moderate, multiethnic communities near major cities. “Voters are taking their anger out at the president, and the only way they can do that is by going after Republicans on the ballot,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. The Democrats’ gains signaled deep alienation from the Republican Party among the sort of upscale moderates who were once central to their coalition. Democrats not only swept Virginia’s statewide races but neared a majority in the House of Delegates, a legislative chamber that was gerrymandered to make the Republican majority virtually unassailable. They seized county executive offices in Westchester and Nassau Counties, N.Y., and carried bellwether mayoral elections in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Manchester, N.H., all races that appeared to favor Republicans only months ago. In Washington State, Democrats won a special election to take control of the State Senate, establishing total Democratic dominance of government on the West Coast. Democrats took council seats in vote-rich Delaware County, Pa., in the Philadelphia suburbs, a perennial congressional battleground. "
"It seemed like a match made in media heaven. AT&T is a telecommunications giant whose reach stretches to millions of people all over the country, and Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros., has content galore. Together, the two companies would create a colossus straddling the worlds of internet access, news and entertainment. Until last week, AT&T’s pending $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner seemed destined to close by the end of the year. On Wednesday, however, tensions between the Justice Department and executives at the two companies spilled out into the open. Now it seems possible that the Justice Department and AT&T will end up battling each other in court. The ongoing negotiations have also demonstrated how the Trump administration may regulate big-ticket mergers and acquisitions, representing the first major test for the government’s antitrust strategy. A central component of the dispute, according to people from both companies and the Justice Department, is CNN — the network that Mr. Trump has frequently attacked as a purveyor of “fake news.” Late last week, AT&T called the Justice Department to request a meeting between top antitrust officials and AT&T’s chief executive officer, Randall L. Stephenson. On Monday, at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, Mr. Stephenson and AT&T’s general counsel, David McAtee, met with Makan Delrahim, the new assistant attorney general for the department’s antitrust division, and other Justice Department officials. In one account of the meeting, Justice Department officials called on AT&T to sell Turner Broadcasting — the group of cable channels under the Time Warner banner that includes CNN — as a potential requirement for gaining government approval, according to three people from the companies involved, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because of the delicacy of the negotiations.

Mollie Hemingway in The Federalist: Ms. Hemingway acknowledges that “everything went Democrats’ way” in the Virginia election.

"WASHINGTON — China has been a tricky economic partner for the United States, offering both lucrative opportunities for collaboration and a minefield of security risks. That tension was on display this week as President Trump arrived in Beijing with a coalition of American industry leaders who plan to announce new deals with Chinese companies. At the same time, a group of bipartisan lawmakers in Washington introduced legislation on Wednesday that would subject Chinese investments to greater scrutiny through a significant expansion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a panel that reviews foreign mergers and acquisitions for potential threats to national security. The dual approach highlights the challenge facing the Trump administration as it tries to articulate a clear strategy for dealing with China. Mr. Trump campaigned on a get-tough approach to China — a view that is shared by many Republican and Democratic lawmakers who see the country as a growing threat — but he must now balance that position with preserving the business ties that much of the United States economy depends on. On Wednesday, Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, introduced legislation that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced on Wednesday by Representative Robert Pittenger, a Republican from North Carolina. The legislation is aimed at preventing China from taking advantage of the United States’ open approach to foreign investment to access sensitive technology. Policymakers and lawmakers in the United States have grown increasingly skeptical of China’s investments in advanced technology industries like robotics, self-driving vehicles and artificial intelligence. Beijing has explicitly laid out a strategy for its companies, called Made in China 2025, of acquiring foreign technologies to build homegrown giants. Chinese investment in the United States and elsewhere has surged in recent years as the Chinese government encouraged companies to acquire technology and know-how abroad, and as Chinese companies and wealthy individuals sought safer refuges for their money.

"In 2006, the endowments of Indiana University and Texas Christian University invested millions of dollars in a partnership, hoping to mint riches from oil, gas and coal. The partnership was formed by the Houston-based Quintana Capital Group, whose principals include Donald L. Evans, an influential Texan and longtime supporter of former President George W. Bush. Little more than a year earlier, Mr. Evans had left his cabinet position as commerce secretary. Though the group had an impressive Texas pedigree, presidential cachet and ambitions for operations in the United States, the new partnership was established in the Cayman Islands. The founders promised their university and nonprofit investors that the partnership would try to avoid federal taxes by exploiting a loophole called “blocker corporations,” which are typically established in tax havens around the world. A trove of millions of leaked documents from a Bermuda-based law firm, Appleby, reflects some of the tax wizardry used by American colleges and universities. Schools have increasingly turned to secretive offshore investments, the files show, which let them swell their endowments with blocker corporations, and avoid scrutiny of ventures involving fossil fuels or other issues that could set off campus controversy. Buoyed by lucrative tax breaks, college endowments have amassed more than $500 billion nationwide. The wealth is concentrated in a small group of schools, tilting toward private institutions like those in the Ivy League and other highly selective colleges. About 11 percent of higher-education institutions in the United States hold 74 percent of the money, according to an analysis in 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. "
"WASHINGTON — A Senate hearing on nominees for two top environmental posts on Wednesday quickly turned testy over the Trump administration’s ambivalence on climate change science. Andrew R. Wheeler, a lobbyist for Murray Energy, which is owned by Robert E. Murray, an Appalachian coal mining magnate and prominent backer of President Trump, has been nominated to be the deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Kathleen Hartnett White, a former Texas environmental regulator who has described belief in global warming as “a kind of paganism,” has been tapped to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Democratic members of the Environment and Public Works Committee focused much of their hostility on Mrs. White, a fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the former chairwoman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Democrats assailed her past writings on climate change, including articles in which she called carbon dioxide “the gas of life” and described renewable energy as parasitic. “Your positions are so far out of the mainstream, they are not just outliers, they are outrageous,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. “You have a fringe voice that denies science, economics and reality.” "
"BEIJING — China on Wednesday released fresh details about a new financial regulatory body intended to calm a financial system that in recent years has endured a stock market crash, a huge exodus of money outside the country and the rapid accumulation of debt. But the details may raise more questions than they answer, and could disappoint those looking for a strong hand to rein in the financial system underpinning the world’s second-largest economy. Official Chinese media reported late Wednesday that a new Financial Stability and Development Committee had held its first meeting, nearly four months after President Xi Jinping ordered its creation. It said the meeting was led by Ma Kai, a 71-year-old vice premier. At the meeting, Mr. Ma stressed that China’s financial system should serve the real economy, according to the official Xinhua news agency — namely, making money available to businesses that need it. He also stressed financial security, the report said. The new committee’s mission appears to fall short of what many in China has expected. Many had speculated that Mr. Xi might combine the country’s central bank with the agencies regulating securities, banking and insurance to create a financial superregulator. Previous problems, like a stock market crash two years ago, were worsened by lack of coordination among different government agencies. But the commission that emerged seemed more a minnow than a whale. None of the current agencies disappeared, and the commission was merely assigned a small office in a corner of the central bank. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Wednesday tightened the economic embargo on Cuba, restricting Americans from access to hotels, stores and other businesses tied to the Cuban military. A lengthy list of rules, which President Trump promised in June to punish the communist government in Havana, came just as Mr. Trump was visiting leaders of the communist government in Beijing and pushing business deals there. Wednesday’s announcement was part of the administration’s gradual unwinding of parts of the Obama administration’s détente with the Cuban government. Americans wishing to visit Cuba will once again have to go through authorized tour operators, and tour guides will have to accompany the groups — making such trips more expensive. People who already have booked and paid for a trip on their own will be allowed to go, and transactions with businesses on the barred list can be completed, the administration said. The new rules, which go into effect Thursday, apply only to future travel and commerce. Eighty-three hotels are on the banned list. While the rules will discourage some travel and business dealings between the countries, they do not ban them. Indeed, much of Mr. Obama’s opening to Cuba remains in place, including diplomatic ties. In a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said the new rules were intended to direct money and economic activity away from the Cuban military and security services, and toward businesses controlled by regular Cuban citizens. Officials said the widespread practice of renting rooms and eating meals in private homes in Cuba would continue to be allowed, as would renting cars from private citizens. "
"Two years after his 24-year-old girlfriend was shot and killed on live television, a Virginia Democrat on Tuesday defeated an opponent who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association for a seat in the State Legislature. Chris Hurst, a former news anchor whose girlfriend and colleague, Alison Parker, was killed on air in 2015, overtook Joseph Yost to win the 12th House District seat in the state’s Legislature. He will be one of two Democrats to represent the state’s deeply conservative southwest region in the House. In an interview Wednesday morning, Mr. Hurst, 30, described himself as humbled and awe-struck by his victory. He said that before Ms. Parker’s death, he had not had political aspirations. “Our campaign has really tried not to focus on what happened to me,” he said. “Only inasmuch as I needed to explain to voters why I was running and leaving a good-paying job and a career that I loved.” Though the victory was still fresh, he said that he had briefly considered what Ms. Parker might have thought of his new career. “I think that she would be very proud,” he said. “And I continue to be proud of her.” Ms. Parker and a cameraman, Adam Ward, were filming a live news segment when they were fatally shot by Vester Lee Flanagan II, who had been a reporter at the station where they worked, WDBJ in Roanoke, Va. The graphic footage was widely viewed, rocketing around social media after Mr. Flanagan, who later shot and killed himself, posted it on Facebook. "
"For decades, Saudi Arabia was a stable and reliable economic and strategic partner of the United States. That country no longer exists. The Saudi Arabia that preferred caution to confrontation in international affairs, that emphasized stability at home and that kept royal family disputes private, has been disassembled by the ambitious young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has seized control of all instruments of policy and power in the kingdom. With a flurry of arrests of princes and business tycoons over the weekend, the crown prince jettisoned the longstanding practice among Saudi rulers of seeking consensus, or at least acquiescence, from all branches of the family and from the country’s business elite. Can the consensus of the family and the business leadership that they forged survive? If the Saudis are looking at their own history, they should be worried. After the 1953 death of the country’s founding king, Abdul-Aziz al-Saud, Saudi Arabia was crippled for a decade by a power struggle between his successor, the profligate King Saud, and Crown Prince Faisal, a leader respected for probity and self-discipline. Surrounded by sycophants, King Saud emptied the national treasury while a frustrated Prince Faisal sought to rally other princes to his side; critical development projects were put off. King Saud’s ruinous reign ended when the family forced him into exile in 1964 and Faisal took over. The ruling family learned harsh lessons from that experience. From then until now, it has kept family differences inside the family. In fact, in the years when he was governor of Riyadh before becoming king in 2015, Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud was known as the mediator and conciliator of family disputes. "
"In May 2016, a Facebook page called Heart of Texas urged its nearly 254,000 followers to rise up against what it considered to be an urgent cultural menace. A mosque in Houston had opened up a new library, and Heart of Texas planned to protest. “Stop Islamization of Texas,” it warned. Word of the protest spread quickly, but supporters of the mosque were also ready to mobilize. “Bigots are planning to intimidate through weaponized fear this Saturday at noon,” one of them wrote on Reddit. The post linked to a Facebook page for United Muslims of America, a group that said it was planning a counterprotest for the same time and place. By now you might be able to guess the punch line here. Heart of Texas wasn’t a real group, as Business Insider later reported. United Muslims of America is a real organization, but the Facebook page promoting the counterprotest was not run by the actual group, as The Daily Beast found. Instead, according to documents made public last week by the Senate Intelligence Committee, both the pro- and anti-mosque protests had been planned and promoted by Russian trolls. We may never know for certain if Russia’s campaign to influence American society through social networks changed the course of history in big ways — if it altered the election results, say. But it is already clear that Russia’s efforts did change the world in countless small ways. A few dozen real Americans did protest that Saturday in Houston. Videos of the protest show real emotion — people on opposite sides of the street screaming, swearing and truly angry to have to share the country with the bozos on the other side. As I watched these videos recently, I had an epiphany about the Russia influence campaign. The Houston protest videos depicted a bunch of Americans duped into fighting each other in public, all at the whim of an unseen force that, through expert and surreptitious cajoling, had gotten them to lose control of themselves on camera. I’d seen this show many times before, and you probably have, too. It’s called “The Bachelor.” "
"“Poetry Reading, 6 p.m.,” read the sign taped outside the doorway of the Bethune Street townhouse where Otis Kidwell Burger, 93, has lived for nearly 60 years. Inside, from a rocker cushioned with red velvet, Ms. Kidwell Burger presided over the dozen or so poets gathered in her parlor, a cozy haven with Oriental rugs, a working fireplace and shelves of old books and general clutter. Ms. Kidwell Burger, a writer and sculptor, lives with her two cats in the 1836 building that she and her then-husband, the late literary agent Knox Burger, bought in 1959. Its upper floors served as a rooming house, with rooms starting at $8 per week, she said. “It was full of strange folks,” she said. The room next to the magician was rented as a writing space by the author and activist Jane Jacobs, who worked on her seminal book “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” there, Ms. Kidwell Burger said. “Jane lived around the corner on Hudson Street, but she had a house full of teenagers and it was quieter here,” said Ms. Kidwell Burger, who joined forces with Ms. Jacobs in the ’60s to resist projects threatening the small-town character of the neighborhood. She recalled being with Ms. Jacobs at a 1968 public hearing for Robert Moses’s plan to build a downtown expressway. "

President Trump’s critics and admirers have both often wondered whether most of the normal rules of politics apply to him. Trump, in his own graphic way, may have summarized the view best: “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, O.K.?” But it turns out that the normal rules of politics do indeed apply to Trump. With his approval rating at a paltry 38 percent, Trump’s Republican Party took a whupping. It’s not just that the Democrats easily won the highest-profile race — the Virginia governorship. Democrats enjoyed a stunningly good night across the country. Consider: • Defying virtually all expectations, Democrats flipped more than a dozen of the 100 seats in Virginia’s house of delegates and, pending final vote counts, may have won control of it. • They won full control — legislature and governorship — in both New Jersey and Washington State. • Maine’s Republican governor has repeatedly vetoed Medicaid expansion. Maine’s voters effectively overrode his veto, by referendum, in a landslide. • Democrats won two traditionally Republican legislature seats in special elections in Georgia. • Last night’s results continue a trend. Democrats have done startlingly well in special elections this year, often in conservative districts. As significant as all these wins are in their own right, they will also help shape the political future. Already, multiple House Republicans have announced their retirement, including two more yesterday. Idaho and Utah may now follow Maine and hold referendums on expanding Medicaid. Progressives will be energized to find candidates to run in traditionally Republican areas. "
"BEIJING — Three U.C.L.A. men’s basketball players, including LiAngelo Ball, the brother of the Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball, will not play in an exhibition game on Friday in Shanghai. Multiple news media accounts said the players were detained on suspicion of shoplifting. Coach Steve Alford announced the decision to bench the players, but would not elaborate on the nature of the circumstances. Both U.C.L.A. and the Pacific-12 Conference used the term “situation” to describe what was going on with the players. “We are aware of a situation involving U.C.L.A. student-athletes in Hangzhou, China,” U.C.L.A. said in a statement. “The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time.” Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said: “Yesterday in Hangzhou, China, U.C.L.A. student-athletes were involved in a situation, and U.C.L.A. is cooperating fully with local authorities. We are directing all inquiries about the specifics of this matter to U.C.L.A. We are very disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about. Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation.” The other players involved were Cody Riley and Jalen Hill. All three are freshmen. Ball’s father, LaVar, who is in China, told ESPN that he was “going to wait until I get more intel on what’s going on” before making a comment. The Ball family is being followed by a reality television crew for the Facebook Watch program “Ball in the Family.” "
"HONG KONG — China does not allow its people to gain access to Facebook, a powerful tool for disseminating information and influencing opinion. As if to demonstrate the platform’s effectiveness, outside its borders China uses it to spread state-produced propaganda around the world, including the United States. So much do China’s government and companies value Facebook that the country is Facebook’s biggest advertising market in Asia, even as it is the only major country in the region that blocks the social network. A look at the Facebook pages of China Central Television, the leading state-owned broadcast network better known as CCTV, and Xinhua, China’s official news agency, reveals hundreds of English-language posts intended for an English-speaking audience. Each quarter, China’s government, through its state media agencies, spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy Facebook ads, according to a person with knowledge of those deals, who was unauthorized to talk publicly about the company’s revenue streams. China’s propaganda efforts are in the spotlight with President Trump visiting the country and American lawmakers investigating foreign powers’ use of technology to sway voters in the United States.

"Good morning on this nippy Wednesday. Mayor Bill de Blasio cruised to a second-term victory yesterday. (And Philip D. Murphy, a former Wall Street banker, will replace Chris Christie as New Jersey governor.) Among Mayor de Blasio’s promises in the next four years: the creation of thousands of affordable housing units, a friendlier police force, and free, full-day preschool for 3-year-olds. We asked New York Today readers: What do you want our next mayor to accomplish in the next four years? Here’s what a few of your neighbors said: “Focus on making New York City a place where all residents can safely walk, bike and use fast and reliable transit anywhere in the city.” — Avinoam Baral, 24, Manhattan “Improve the subway system, it’s really frustrating.” — John White, 27, Brooklyn “Improve the traffic flow in Manhattan and ease the congestion.” — William J. Fleming, 78, the Bronx “Support a congestion pricing plan that’ll charge drivers, taxis and ride-shares entering Manhattan’s busiest district (south of 59th Street), and toll bridges and tunnels appropriately.” — Brennan Ortiz, 25, the Bronx “New York is a hard city to live in without money, and the next mayor needs to continue policies in education, housing, access to health care, and the minimum wage to ensure it becomes the highest ranking city in America for economic mobility, which is how we measure the American dream.” — Eóin Cunningham, 37, Brooklyn "
"The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience. We have asked our standards editor, Phil Corbett, to explain our use of honorifics. Readers occasionally express concern about articles referring to the president as “Mr. Trump.” They believe it is disrespectful to call him “Mr.” rather than “President” Trump, and some suggest that our doing so is a sign of political bias. “It’s President Trump, not Mr. Trump,” wrote one reader who uses the name Batman (you read that right) in the comments section. “If we’re really going to bad mouth the President of the United States, why don’t we at least learn his title.” The complaint isn’t new to me. For years, we got complaints that our references to “Mr. Obama” betrayed our disrespect for him. And before that, “Mr. Bush” made some readers suspect that we were showing our disdain for that president. I’m not sure whether one of my long-ago predecessors got similar complaints about The Times’s references to “Mr. Lincoln.” But I can assure readers that we have been consistent for many years in how we refer to an incumbent president: It’s “President Trump” (or President Obama, or President Bush) on first reference, and “Mr. Trump” or “the president” (lowercase) thereafter. No disrespect is intended. In fact, most news organizations dispense with the “Mr.” altogether and simply call the president “Trump” after the first reference. The Times is among the few outlets still using courtesy titles like “Mr.” or “Ms.” (with exceptions in our sports coverage and a few other areas). Some readers (me included) like the tone of civility and seriousness the titles convey; others find them old-fashioned and stodgy. And still others are just confused. "
"After a year of high-profile moral victories in special congressional elections, Democrats finally got actual victories on the board, and more. They won big in Virginia, took full control of state government in New Jersey and Washington State, prevailed on an important ballot measure in Maine, and generally posted strong results across the nation. Together, it was the clearest sign yet that college-educated white voters’ unhappiness with President Trump would jeopardize suburban Republicans in next year’s midterm elections. But the biggest difference between Tuesday’s Democratic wins and the earlier Republican wins is deceptively simple: This time, elections were held on neutral or even Democratic-leaning terrain. For that reason, it is not obvious that Tuesday’s performance represents a significant improvement over the Democrats’ showings earlier in the year. In 2018, they won’t always get the luxury of competing in such favorable districts. To take the House next November, they might have to do even better than they did on Tuesday. Make no mistake: The results Tuesday are fully consistent with a so-called wave election, like the ones that brought Democrats to power in the House in 2006 and back out in 2010. All of the conditions for a 2018 wave are in place. The president’s approval rating is stuck in the mid-to-high 30s. The Democrats hold nearly a double-digit lead on the generic congressional ballot. The president’s party nearly always struggles in midterm elections. "
"PONCE, P.R. — Almost two months after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, there were more signs of how unsettled the situation remains here and how grievous the toll of the storm was. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said that it was finalizing extraordinary plans to fly about 3,000 residents of Puerto Rico still living in shelters to New York and Florida. “Transportation assistance is something that I don’t think we have done previously,” Will Booher, a FEMA spokesman, said. “But this is unique to what’s going on in Puerto Rico.” The agency said the relief effort was being undertaken at the request of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. FEMA regularly finds housing for hurricane victims, often at hotels or motels nearby. But because there is so little available lodging on the island, and no easy way to get people from shelters to safe housing, the agency is arranging charter flights for residents, beginning with those still in shelters. On Wednesday, Puerto Rico officials, facing increasing questions about the accuracy of the official death toll from the storm, acknowledged for the first time that 472 more people died this September compared with the same month last year. The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. The government’s official death toll is 55. The numbers confirmed what had been speculated for weeks: After the waters receded and the roads were cleared, people here continued to die at rates far beyond normal. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Xi Jinping of China showered President Trump with hospitality, leading him on a tour of the Forbidden City on Wednesday, but experts say the personal contact may not alter their divisions on pressuring North Korea.

Our reporters in China and Washington note that business deals are likelier outcomes than policy shifts, and our video team tracks how Mr. Trump has shifted over time from targeting China’s trade policy to praising Mr. Xi.

"BERLIN — Germans normally wait about six weeks after an election for a government to be sworn in. That benchmark quietly came and went a week ago, an indication of the challenge facing a politically weakened Angela Merkel. Since her party won just 30.2 percent of the vote in the Sept. 24 election, the chancellor has found herself struggling to bridge a yawning gap between prospective coalition partners, rendering a normally painstaking process even more protracted and difficult. The four parties in the talks — her conservative Christian Democrats; their Bavaria-only sister party, the Christian Social Union; the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens — span the political spectrum. This week the chancellor set a deadline of next Thursday for the parties to decide whether they can make a government work — and these are just the preliminary talks. Should the parties decide to move to the next step, only then will they start hammering out what could be the longest, most detailed coalition agreement Germany has seen to date. One analyst, Uwe Jun, a professor of political science at the University of Trier, gave the four-way coalition talks a 2-to-1 chance of success. That’s better than the odds given by some involved in the negotiations. Such a coalition is untried at the federal level and only recently attempted in two of the country’s less populous states. The chancellor’s governing partner of the past four years, the center-left Social Democrats, have vowed to remain in the opposition. So if Ms. Merkel’s search for new partners fails, Germans would be forced to hold another election. "
"The N.F.L., the $14 billion-a-year sports juggernaut that dominates TV ratings as well as the national conversation most Sundays, has ascended to its position of supremacy in recent years with an ownership group that often works in lock step. The men and women who control the league’s 32 teams might disagree sometimes, but rarely do they publicly reveal any discord. Now the league, already wobbling under the strain of presidential and public aggravation over players’ kneeling during the national anthem, is coping with what amounts to an all-out war between one of its most powerful owners and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, who has been rewarded for the N.F.L.’s success with annual compensation that has topped $40 million. Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, has escalated a feud with Goodell, threatening to sue the league and some fellow team owners over negotiations to extend Goodell’s contract, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation. Jones told the six owners on the league’s compensation committee last week that he had hired David Boies, the high-profile lawyer under fire in the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment case, according to the people, who declined to speak publicly about internal league matters. Through a team spokesman, Jones declined to comment. An N.F.L. spokesman declined to comment, and a spokesman for Boies’s law firm referred all questions to the Cowboys. The dispute between Jones and Goodell stems from Jones’s anger over the commissioner’s suspending of Ezekiel Elliott, the Cowboys’ star running back, who was accused of domestic violence by his former girlfriend. Goodell gave Elliott a six-game suspension, though no charges were filed in the case. "
"What goes around comes around, and on Tuesday, karma came for President Trump and his Republican acolytes. From Washington to Maine, New Jersey to North Carolina, Trumpist ugliness was met and vanquished, sometimes by the very targets of right-wing scorn. In January, a local New Jersey Republican politician, John Carman, mocked the anti-Trump Women’s March by asking on Facebook whether the protest would be “over in time for them to cook dinner.” That so upset Ashley Bennett, a 32-year-old health care worker, that she challenged Mr. Carman for his seat on the Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders. “Elected officials shouldn’t be on social media mocking and belittling people who are expressing their concerns about their community and the nation,” she said during her campaign. If Mr. Carman does it again, it will be as a private citizen. Ms. Bennett defeated him on Tuesday. In Hoboken, N.J., Ravi Bhalla became the state’s first Sikh mayor by triumphing over an ethnic smear campaign using fliers with his turbaned image and the message, “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our town!” Plagued by division over a law that restricted transgender people’s access to public restrooms, and anger over the police shooting of a black man named Keith Lamont Scott, Charlotte, N.C., elected Vi Lyles, a 66-year-old former city administrator, as its first black female mayor. In New York, Nassau County Republicans have seen their fair share of corruption and controversy, but Jack Martins was unable to overcome that legacy with race-baiting tactics in which he accused his Democratic opponent for county executive, Laura Curran, of wanting to “roll out the welcome mat” for the vicious MS-13 gang. Ms. Curran will be only the third Democrat in 80 years to hold the post. "
"Fresh off a decisive re-election victory, Mayor Bill de Blasio strode into the ceremonial Blue Room of City Hall on Wednesday with a message aimed at New Yorkers and elected officials in Albany: I have a mandate. A mandate. Mr. de Blasio repeated the word several times during a 36-minute news conference, brandishing it as a kind of rhetorical cudgel to beat back critics of his progressive agenda and potential opponents to it in the state Capitol. He used the opportunity to reiterate the themes of his campaign, newly ratified by voters, and for the first time declare that his energy in the second term would be principally focused on issues of education. He said his next four years would be dedicated to creating greater “fairness,” a focus that has long shaped his view of policy. “Yesterday, the people of New York City delivered a message loud and clear and delivered a mandate, a mandate for fairness, to make this the fairest big city in America,” Mr. de Blasio said at the start. Mr. de Blasio got 66 percent of the vote on Tuesday, far more than his Republican opponent, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who received about 28 percent. Turnout was low, similar to the election four years ago that swept Mr. de Blasio to City Hall. The mayor said that opposition in New York to President Trump energized voters in the city and helped propel his victory. “I say with humility, I have been a leading anti-Trump voice,” he said. "
"WASHINGTON — The election results in Maine and Virginia have energized supporters of expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in several holdout states. After months of battling Republican efforts to repeal the law, they now see political consensus shifting in their direction. Groups in Idaho and Utah are already working through the process of getting Medicaid expansion initiatives on next year’s ballots, hoping to follow Maine’s path after failing through the legislative route. And the outlook for legislative approval has brightened in Virginia after Democrats picked up at least 15 seats in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates and could potentially control the chamber once all the votes are counted. Advocacy groups are also hoping the decisive victory in Maine, and exit polls suggesting health care was the top issue in Virginia, will add momentum to efforts in Kansas and North Carolina. “The results from Maine and Virginia send a very clear signal that the public is interested in moving past the type of obstruction we’ve seen from policymakers in some states,” said Katherine Howitt, associate director of policy at Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group. The expansion debate in many states has been a political stew, with opposition a mix of fiscal concerns, philosophical resistance and stiff political opposition to Obamacare, which made Medicaid expansion possible. But many advocates hope growing public support for expansion and the fading of the Obama era will mean a softening of opposition among some governors and legislators who have long resisted the idea. Expanding Medicaid was a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, meant to ensure that all Americans below or somewhat above the federal poverty line would qualify for government health insurance. But a Supreme Court decision in 2012 made the choice to expand coverage optional for states. Before Election Day, 31 states and the District of Columbia had chosen to accept federal funding to expand coverage. "
"After all the postcard-writing parties, the back-porch fund-raisers and the sidewalk and door-to-door volunteer work, there was always the nagging doubt: What if this wasn’t enough? What if all this suburban anger toward President Trump still couldn’t unseat Republicans in the New York suburbs? On Wednesday, after a nearly clean sweep of races from Long Island to northern New Jersey, doubt among local Democrats had been replaced wholesale by optimism. Now nearly nothing is off the table in the 2018 midterm elections. Republican congressional seats once thought to be almost unassailable are now being examined for signs of vulnerability, with their ties to Trump-backed policies a telling guide. In New York, Democrats have focused on unseating six Republican members of the congressional delegation, with an emphasis on Representatives Chris Collins of western New York and Tom Reed, who represents a large portion of the Southern Tier, for their support of the Republican tax plan that would do away with the deduction for state and local taxes. In New Jersey, the northern suburbs have traditionally been Republican, and are key bases of support for Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance. With Philip D. Murphy’s victory in the race for governor on Tuesday, however, that support began to fracture: Mr. Murphy outperformed expectations in the region, Republican incumbents were ousted and candidates in otherwise fairly safe districts had some of the closest elections of their careers. And in Albany, the election results heightened pressure to dismantle the Independent Democratic Conference, the coalition of rogue Democrats who have partnered with Senate Republicans to help give them control of that chamber, despite the Democrats’ numerical majority. But, one perennial question remained: How much capital would Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City invest in those efforts? "
"If what people do is any reflection of who they are, then Devin P. Kelley, who slaughtered 26 churchgoers on Sunday in Texas, surely was a madman. Before the atrocity, he had attempted to sneak weapons onto an Air Force base after making death threats to his superiors, according to a local police report. In 2012, he had escaped from a mental hospital in New Mexico to which he had been sent after assaulting his wife and fracturing his stepson’s skull. A video of the church killing reportedly shows Mr. Kelley working his way methodically through the aisles, shooting some parishioners, even children, at point-blank range. “I think that mental health is your problem here,” President Trump told reporters on Monday. It is true that severe mental illnesses are found more often among mass murderers. About one in five are likely psychotic or delusional, according to Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of 350 mass killers going back more than a century. The figure for the general public is closer to 1 percent. But the rest of these murderers do not have any severe, diagnosable disorder. Though he was abusive to his wife, Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub, had no apparent serious mental illness. Neither did Stephen Paddock, who mowed down 58 concertgoers from a hotel window in Las Vegas. Ditto for Dylann Roof, the racist who murdered nine African-American churchgoers in South Carolina in 2015, and Christopher Harper-Mercer, the angry young man who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon the same year. "
"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, under pressure to pass a sweeping tax rewrite before year’s end, are expected to unveil legislation on Thursday that would eliminate the ability of people to deduct state and local taxes but would stop short of fully repealing the estate tax, according to lobbyists and other people familiar with the bill. The Senate plan is taking shape as Republicans digest the drubbing they suffered on Tuesday night in affluent suburbs across the country, many of them represented by Republicans in the House. Those areas are stocked with well-off voters who would be disproportionately hit by the elimination of state and local tax deductions. But in the Senate, those high-tax areas are often represented by Democrats, which puts less pressure on Republican leaders to keep the state and local deduction, in any form, in their version of the bill. Each of the bills reflects delicate political and fiscal calculations as Republican leaders seek to deliver on President Trump’s campaign promises to cut taxes on the middle class and on businesses — but also find the money to pay for them. Eliminating the state and local tax deduction would increase tax receipts and therefore lessen the overall cost of the legislation, which by congressional budget rules cannot exceed $1.5 trillion over the next decade if it is to pass without Democratic support. After the elections, Republicans understand they have to pass a tax bill in order to show a significant accomplishment. Big losses in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday exposed their vulnerabilities going into next year’s midterm elections. But in the Senate, the emerging bill suggests party leaders are less concerned with the potential fallout of eliminating breaks that benefit upper-middle-class taxpayers in high-tax states such as New York and California.

arrived in Manus on Tuesday morning, and within an hour I’d met a handful of the refugees who have been stuck on this sweltering, remote island in Papua New Guinea for nearly five years. To many, it feels like an eternity in limbo. I met one man from Iran who got on a boat at age 20 to flee political persecution and now wonders if he’ll be able to study, work or leave Papua New Guinea before he’s 30. I met another who is 29 and who has come to accept that Manus may have to become his lifelong home. Australia exiled these men to Manus and an even more distant island, Nauru, to keep them and others from trying to reach Australia by boat, and the boats have mostly stopped. But there are other long-term consequences that have yet to be fully understood. Both the refugees (and their families) and this island (and this country) have been forever changed because of Australia’s detention policy. I’ll explain more in a coming story, and I’d love to hear what you think I should be looking into while I’m here, which is why I’m keeping this introduction shorter than usual — to maximize on-the-ground reporting time.

"Five countries: Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Eleven days — no, make that 12; the trip was extended by a day at the last minute. And for me and other news photographers, countless chances to capture one of the most famous faces in the world in new settings. President Trump and his entourage went wheels-up from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Friday, Nov. 3, making a stop in Hawaii before heading to Tokyo. The days have been long. Reporters and photographers covering Mr. Trump have generally started work early in the morning, finishing around 10 at night. Then there was that morning in South Korea when we were told to be ready at 5:45 for a mystery-shrouded venture. But the destination — the DMZ at the border with North Korea — turned out to be shrouded, too. In fog. So the trip was canceled. The president left the Philippines on Tuesday to return to Washington.

"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats pressed Kirstjen Nielsen, President Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, during her confirmation hearing on Wednesday about her inexperience and how she would carry out his immigration agenda. But she faced a mostly deferential Senate Homeland Security Committee, a sign that she is likely to be easily confirmed as the sixth person to lead the agency. Ms. Nielsen pledged to be tough on border security but acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall across the entire southern border was unrealistic. “There is no need for a wall from sea to shining sea,” she said, adding that, as the secretary, she would push for technological solutions and consult the Border Patrol and other agencies about where a wall made sense. Ms. Nielsen would be the permanent replacement for John F. Kelly, who was homeland security secretary until he left in July to serve as the White House chief of staff. Elaine C. Duke, his deputy, has held the post in the interim. Ms. Nielsen was Mr. Kelly’s top aide at the Department of Homeland Security, and he brought her to the White House to serve as deputy chief of staff. The harshest lines of questioning Ms. Nielsen faced at Wednesday’s hearing came from Democrats. Senator Thomas Carper of Delaware asked Ms. Nielsen about her lack of experience leading a department that employs 240,000 people and is responsible for border and aviation security, counterterrorism, immigration and recovery from natural disasters.

"During the nearly five years that I was secretary of defense, 2,621 immigrants serving in the United States military became naturalized citizens while deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. More than 100 immigrant troops have made the supreme sacrifice in combat during those wars. In that same period, from 2006 to 2011, a total of 45,700 immigrants who wore the uniform of the American military all across the world became American citizens. I was honored to serve alongside all of them, and humbled by their sense of duty, by their willingness to risk life and limb for a country they yearned to call their own. I attended a number of naturalization ceremonies for these soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors. At one ceremony, in October 2008 at Fort Bragg, N.C., 41 immigrant service members, men and women from 26 countries, became citizens. I told them it was one of the true glories of our country that when it comes to being an American, you don’t have to be a descendant of the founders or the colonists who came on the Mayflower. What counts is whether you believe in America’s ideals, follow its laws and pitch in for the common good. Quoting Abraham Lincoln, I said that immigrants can read the phrase “all men are created equal” in the Declaration of Independence and feel that “they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration.” The United States faces extraordinary security challenges that are placing growing pressure on our armed forces. Those forces are stronger when they embody the nation’s diversity, drawing from a large pool of willing young people able to adapt to changing threats. That is why we need legislation that will provide a pathway to citizenship for those immigrants who, among other attributes, are serving or have served in the military, whether they are in America legally or were brought here illegally as children. That kind of policy will help the military recruit new service members and improve readiness. "

"WASHINGTON — It is an unwritten rule that if a former Treasury secretary has nothing nice to say about one of his successors he does not say anything at all. But in the nation’s capital these days, the rules of political comity are meant to be broken. Raising eyebrows in economic circles, Lawrence H. Summers, the mercurial Treasury secretary for President Bill Clinton, has leveled a barrage of increasingly personal criticism at the current Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. In podcasts, blog posts, op-eds and on Twitter, Mr. Summers, the former president of Harvard and a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, has accused Mr. Mnuchin of damaging the credibility of Treasury by making “irresponsible” economic assessments of the administration’s tax plan and acting as a “sycophant” to President Trump. The attacks have alternately amused and angered those who run in economic circles, with some saying it is Mr. Summers who is damaging the credibility of the office by leveling public attacks on a sitting Treasury secretary. “For me we have a tradition for people who have been in the position not to criticize current secretaries,” said Paul H. O’Neill, who served as President George W. Bush’s first Treasury secretary. “That doesn’t mean we don’t have an opinion, but we don’t tell people what we think.” But, he added: “Larry is his own guy.” While Treasury secretaries have all had varying degrees of success and influence, those who have held the job generally agree that heckles from predecessors are not helpful.

"Federal prosecutors are looking into the role played by Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, in advising the Trump administration on regulatory issues that had the potential to affect the finances of a company he owns. Mr. Icahn stepped down as an unpaid adviser to President Trump in August, after scrutiny from members of Congress about whether he was influencing regulations on ethanol to benefit his financial investments. One of Mr. Icahn’s main investment companies, Icahn Enterprises, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had served a subpoena seeking information about “Mr. Icahn’s activities relating to the renewable fuels standard and Mr. Icahn’s role as an adviser to the president.” The filing said Icahn Enterprises was cooperating with the prosecutors’ demand for information. When Mr. Icahn took on the advisory position this year, critics complained that it was a conflict of interest because he owns a big stake in an oil-refinery business called CVR Energy. Indeed, The New York Times reported in March that Mr. Icahn was pressing for a change in a requirement that refiners be held responsible for ensuring that corn-based ethanol is mixed into gasoline. The Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees that renewable fuels standard, ultimately decided not to make changes that might have benefited CVR and other small refiners. Mr. Icahn could not be reached for comment Wednesday. In the filing, Icahn Enterprises said prosecutors working for Joon Kim, the acting United States attorney for Manhattan, had “not made any claims or allegations against us or Mr. Icahn.” A spokesman for Mr. Kim’s office declined to comment. Mr. Icahn’s role as a special adviser was amorphous. Aside from working on ethanol policy, he met with some candidates for top regulatory posts, including Jay Clayton, who became Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. "
"If the 2016 presidential election reflected a primal roar from disaffected white working class voters that delivered for President Trump and Republicans, Tuesday’s results showed the potential of a rising coalition of women, minorities, and gay and transgender people who are solidly aligning with Democrats. A black transgender activist, Andrea Jenkins, was elected to the Minneapolis City Council. A Hispanic woman won the mayor’s race in Topeka, Kan. A Sikh man was elected mayor in Hoboken, N.J. Latina, Vietnamese and transgender female candidates won state legislative races. Black candidates were elected lieutenant governor in New Jersey and Virginia. A Liberian refugee in Helena, Mont., was elected mayor. Mark Keam, a Korean-American Democrat who was re-elected on Tuesday to his seat in Virginia’s House of Delegates, said the wave of first-time minority candidates was a direct response to feeling snipped out of the American picture by Mr. Trump’s policies and divisive language. “In Trump’s America, people are getting screwed and those getting screwed more than others are people who’ve never had a voice in the government,” Mr. Keam said. “Those are motivations a white guy wouldn’t have.” Some are skeptical of reading too much into one off-year election. And even Democrats have had heated disagreements over whether identity politics help the party or drive people away. But David Ramadan, a Republican who served in the Virginia General Assembly from 2012 to 2016 said the warning for his party was clear. "
"BERKELEY, Calif. — Jaron Lanier is the most unusual person I’ve ever met. And I’ve met a lot of unusual people. A barefoot Buddha with dreadlocks, perched in a crazy fun house in the leafy hills of Berkeley, Mr. Lanier is a founding member of the digerati. The 57-year-old computer scientist, musician and writer has been christened the father of virtual reality. “I’m a professional illusionist,” he says. “In some ways, I might know more about making illusions than anybody.” Mr. Lanier is one of the few prophets who admits that the spawn of Silicon Valley could become evil, but he tries to stay on the sunny side. It helps that he avoids all social media. “The popular ones are designed for behavior modification,” he says, wearing his usual black T-shirt and black pants. “It’s like, why would you go sign up for an evil hypnotist who’s explicitly saying that his whole purpose is to get you to do things that people have paid him to get you to do, but he won’t tell you who they are?” At this moment when dark clouds loom over Silicon Valley, Mr. Lanier is able to talk about the Lords of the Cloud with affection yet candor, as he worries that these tech gods creating new worlds may be getting “high on their own supply.” "
"A cold driving rain could not put out the candles in the wind. They looked real as they flickered on the steps of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, for the black-tie benefit for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. The weather and the fact that it was election night could dampen spirits only so much. “We live in strange times,” said Elton John, sighing, who arrived in an embroidered Gucci dinner jacket. “But you have to be an optimist, because if you aren’t hopeful, you lose everything.” It seemed an appropriate sentiment from the singer of “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” and “I’m Still Standing.” And never mind “Rocket Man.” The gala celebrated the foundation’s 25th anniversary, attracting a starry crowd that included Judith Light, Marina Abramovic and John Waters, who, with others, recalled his despair over last year’s elections. But this event, which raised $4.4 million, was more about uplift than anything else. “There’s always hope,” Billy Joel said during the cocktail hour. “Even when sometimes that’s all there is.” Since Mr. John (or as some would say, Sir Elton because he was knighted) started his foundation at a kitchen table in Atlanta in 1992, it has raised almost $400 million. And while AIDS deaths have declined among white gay men, many populations are still at risk, including minorities, drug addicts and people in developing countries. “But there is nothing we can’t achieve when we bring good people together,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo told the crowd of 700 over dinner in a speech that seemed campaign ready. Former President Bill Clinton gave a tribute as well. He said the impressive charity work of Mr. John and his husband, David Furnish, was like a beautiful song. “All our lives are like candles in the wind,” he said, adding that what matters is “what they’re burning for.” He sat at the head table with Governor Cuomo, Sting, Lily Safra, Lynn Wyatt and Donna Karan, and gamely posed for selfie requests throughout the night. There was plenty of turbo-mingling, of course. Glenn Close in a black velvet dress chatted with Mike Ovitz at one table, Susan Lucci and Nelson DeMille at another. During the live auction, when gubernatorial election results were being checked on phones, Alec Baldwin encouraged upward bidding with an imitation of both Mr. Clinton and President Trump. And even though Neil Patrick Harris, as master of ceremonies, did his best to move things along, Mr. John didn’t finish a final, teary speech until late into the night. “We need more humanity, more love,” he told the crowd. Close to 11, Aretha Franklin, who has battled illness recently, took to the stage in an embroidered dress and white stole. Although she seemed a little fragile, she prevailed, singing in sweet, straining and soulful tones about troubled waters, prayer and hope. "
"To the Editor: Re “Democrats Score Two Big Victories in Trump Rebuke” (front page, Nov. 8): I awoke Wednesday morning on the anniversary of the worst day in American political history, immediately grabbed The Times, turned on the television and broke into my happy dance! In the first major election since Donald Trump was elected, the Democrats stormed back, not only in Virginia and New Jersey, but in races all across the country. One of the most striking examples of this tsunami was the erasing of a 32-seat Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates. These results were a stunning rebuke of the president, and a signal to all potential Democratic candidates, donors and voters to redouble their efforts toward the 2018 midterm elections. This was also a wake-up call to all Republican members of Congress that they may not have to follow or be loyal to Mr. Trump, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. With the new facts exploding every day about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, there is a great new hope for the Democratic Party to take back control of Congress and the White House, and reverse the horrible debasement of our democracy initiated by Donald Trump. HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Fool me once, shame on me. But fool me twice? That will never happen. I generally vote for any and all Republicans, except Donald Trump. However, on Tuesday I voted a straight Democratic ticket in Virginia. Why? First and foremost, because I do not like the debased and degraded tone that President Trump has set for our nation and the Republican Party. Second, and very important, because I never thought that I would see the day when Republicans sold out their loyal, hardworking blue-collar workers, salary earners and white-collar professionals in favor of corporate interests and the uber-rich. The lock step Republican support and enthusiasm for President Trump’s shameful, proposed tax plan — a plan that undercuts every single class except the 1 percent and corporations — are incomprehensible. What became of the party of lower taxes and fiscal responsibility? While I dislike the rifts of identity politics, and I do not like increased taxes, if the Republicans are going to tax me more in any case, then I might as well receive the Democrats’ safety net and social services.

"To the Editor: Re “In a Democracy, There Can Be No Bystanders” (Op-Ed, Nov. 7): If Jeff Flake truly believes that “to have a vital democracy, there can be no bystanders,” then he and other Republican senators who hold similar views on the dangers of Donald Trump should change their party affiliation to independent and caucus with the Democrats, placing that party in control of the Senate and giving the Democrats the power to restrain President Trump. Mr. Flake and other Republicans could make a deal with the Democrats to use that change not to undermine their conservative beliefs; instead, by changing their affiliation, they would act to defend “the things we hold dear”: democracy itself. Mr. Flake, action, not just words — as brave as they are — is required. BILL MITCHELL, NEW YORK "
"To the Editor: Re “Slouching Toward War,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, Nov. 5): If people are complacent about a high chance of a war in which there would be 300,000 predicted deaths in the first few days if nonnuclear, and a million in the first day if nuclear, then we have reached a state of madness. Many are concerned about the state of mind of our president, who has control of the nuclear arsenal. You will hear little from organized psychiatry on this matter, because of the warning to its members that it is unethical to state a professional opinion about the president’s behavior without a personal examination or his consent. Most of my fellow psychiatrists are not aware that there is an exception to this ethics code: the extended analyses of world leaders under controlled conditions of scholarship. Jerrold Post founded the Central Intelligence Agency’s personality analysis center, and I witnessed him speak at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, where he said it is unethical for mental health professionals not to contribute during these perilous times. Earlier this year, Dr. Post, who studied Kim Jong-un and his father, warned in a Washington Post article that Kim’s capacity for brutality and his apparent spontaneity could be compounded by President Trump’s own impulsive acts. Common sense suggests that a small, impoverished country should not be allowed to cause a nuclear war and that the world powers can together use their heads and find a way to prevent this — that is, assuming that our leaders don’t want war. JEFFREY B. FREEDMAN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Nicholas Kristof says the Congressional Research Service estimates that as many as 300,000 people could die in the first few days of war with North Korea. He quotes a Stanford security expert who thinks that number could easily be a million if it were a nuclear exchange. Senator Lindsey Graham then relays a conversation he had with President Trump, in which he says Mr. Trump insisted: “If thousands die, they’re going to die over there. They’re not going to die here.” That seems to be a particularly chilling calculus. Apparently this president believes that the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents would be acceptable, as long as they are not American deaths. That may play well with his base, but history might think otherwise. MITCHELL KAPNER, CARY, N.C. "
"Hoboken, N.J., is a city of firsts, its proud residents like to say. Some historians say the first organized baseball game was played there in 1846. The first zipper was believed to have been invented there, too. And now the city of some 55,000 people on the Hudson River can boast another first: Councilman Ravi Bhalla on Tuesday became the first Sikh elected mayor in New Jersey, and one of only a few Sikhs to become mayor of an American city. “I feel exhilarated,” Mr. Bhalla, 44, said in an interview on Wednesday. “I didn’t have any expectations one way or another of victory or defeat, I was prepared for both. And I feel very grateful to have the opportunity to serve Hoboken.” Mayor-elect Bhalla, a 17-year resident of the city, had won elections in 2009 and 2013 to the City Council and twice served as its president. He was endorsed for mayor by the incumbent, Dawn Zimmer, who announced in June that she would not seek re-election. Mr. Bhalla and Ms. Zimmer are both Democrats, though Hoboken’s mayoral elections are nonpartisan. But even his deep roots and prior success among the city’s voters did not make Mr. Bhalla immune from racist attacks. On Friday night, doctored campaign fliers appeared on car windows in Hoboken featuring a picture of Mr. Bhalla, who wears the turban that is traditional to his faith. Above his picture was the message: “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” The implication was one that is familiar to many Sikhs, who are part of a separate, monotheistic faith that is neither Hinduism nor Islam, but who are often mistaken for being something that they are not. Particularly after Sept. 11, Sikhs have found themselves the target of hate crimes that often appear to be based in a belief that they are Muslim. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia ordered its citizens to leave Lebanon on Thursday, escalating a bewildering crisis between the two Arab nations and raising fears that it could lead to an economic crisis or even war. The order came after Saudi Arabia had stepped up its condemnations of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shiite militia that is the most powerful political and military force in Lebanon, and asserted that Lebanon had effectively declared war on Saudi Arabia. The developments plunged Lebanon into a state of national anxiety, with politicians, journalists and even parents picking up their children at school consumed with the question of what could come next. While analysts said a war was unlikely — because Saudi Arabia was not capable of waging one and Israel did not want one now — they worried that with so many active conflicts in the region, any Saudi actions that raised the temperature increased the risk of an accidental conflagration. “There are so many fuses, so little communication, so many risks of something exploding, that there’s little chance of something not going wrong,” said Robert Malley, the former director of Middle East policy in the Obama White House and now vice president for policy at the International Crisis Group. “Everything needs to go right to maintain calm.” The backdrop to the crisis was a series of steps by Saudi Arabia in recent days to confront its ascendant regional rival, Iran, and the surprise arrests of about 200 Saudis, including 11 princes, in what the government describes as an anti-corruption campaign but which critics see as a consolidation of power by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.

"No surprise here: Pete Souza is big in Brooklyn. On the anniversary of Donald J. Trump’s election victory, in a college auditorium steps from Hillary Clinton’s former campaign headquarters, hundreds of New Yorkers lined up to meet Mr. Souza, the chief White House photographer who captured many of the waking moments of President Barack Obama, the president who came before. As emotional Brooklynites streamed in to hear him speak — and to collectively reminisce about life before the Trump era — Mr. Souza, 62, sucked on a lozenge and fretted about the projector’s ability to perfectly display his photos. “I’m exhausted,” he said just before the event began. He hadn’t been sleeping well. “I’d better start getting wired in 10 minutes.” Life as a headliner makes him uneasy. For decades, Mr. Souza’s life has been about observation. Toggling between a career as a photojournalist and a White House photographer — he was also a photographer in the Reagan White House — Mr. Souza has honed an ability to crouch and shrink to capture the details no one else sees. He is still not quite sure why his Instagram feed has ballooned into a nostalgic haven for millions mourning the end of the 44th presidency, or why his book, “Obama: An Intimate Portrait,” which was released this week, has rocketed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list and sold out speaking events from this corner of New York to the Tate Modern in London.

"According to news reports, Donald Trump wanted the House Republican tax “reform” bill to be called the Cut Cut Cut Act. Alas, he didn’t get his wish, and it was instead given a boring name nobody can remember. But there’s still time to change it! So let me propose, as one reader suggested, that it be renamed the Leona Helmsley Act, after the New York hotelier convicted of tax evasion, who famously declared that “only the little people pay taxes.” That, after all, is the main thrust of the bill. It hugely favors the wealthy over the middle class, which is pretty much always true of Republican proposals. But it’s not just about favoring high incomes: It also systematically favors people who live off their assets, especially inherited wealth, over the little people — that is, poor shlubs who actually have to work for a living. To get an idea why, consider four hypothetical taxpayers and how they would fare under the G.O.P. bill. First is the poster child family Paul Ryan keeps talking about, a family with two children making $59,000 a year. In the first year of the Cut Cut Cut Act, such a family would indeed receive a tax cut. But this cut comes from several special tax credits that are basically loss leaders to help sell the plan; they all either expire in later years or will get eroded by inflation. By 2027, with the plan fully phased in, that exemplary family would actually be facing a significant tax increase relative to current law. Second, consider someone who is much further up the scale, but still works for a living. In the movie “Wall Street,” Gordon Gekko sneers at “a $400,000-a-year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being comfortable.” What would happen to that guy? Well, I’ve done some back-of-the envelope calculations: If you ignore deductions, he’d end up paying a few hundred dollars less in taxes. But once you take lost deductions into account, especially reduced deductions for state and local taxes, he almost certainly ends up facing a tax hike, not a cut. And of course it’s not just Wall Street stiffs who would find themselves in that situation: So would doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other well-paid professionals. Overall, the Tax Policy Center estimates that more than a quarter of the population would see taxes go up, not down, under the G.O.P. proposal; for those with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000, that fraction rises to more than 40 percent.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief. Even as California declared itself the center of Democratic resistance to President Trump and Congressional Republicans, there was a sense (or hope) among California conservatives that the state had a protector in Washington: Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies. But the tax bill being pushed through by Mr. Trump and House Republicans is testing one of the most interesting political dynamics of the year: Does Mr. McCarthy’s loyalties rest more with his home state, or with fellow Republicans in Washington? The Republican tax bill has drawn opposition from Republicans in other blue states because it would eliminate or restrict reductions for state, local and property taxes — a change that would be particularly expensive to residents of California. In the latest bit of bad news for California, it turns out that the bill would eliminate deductions for personal losses from natural disasters like wildfires and earthquakes, according to The Los Angeles Times. But members of the Republican delegation from California, whose opposition could scuttle the legislation, and who have displayed strong loyalty to Mr. McCarthy, have been either silent or tepid about the bill, with some notable exceptions. Mr. McCarthy said in a statement Wednesday that the tax bill was filled with provisions, such as eliminating the alternate minimum tax and raising the standard deduction, that would ease the tax burden on Californians, who already endure high state income taxes. He noted that the Democratic-controlled state legislature had just raised gas taxes. "
"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Trump administration on Thursday imposed sanctions against 10 more Venezuelan officials, including members of the country’s election commission and several government ministers, accusing them of undermining democracy through their use of corruption and censorship in support of President Nicolás Maduro’s tightening grip on power. At least five of the officials were singled out by Treasury Department officials for their roles in recent regional elections, which were marred by numerous irregularities and charges of fraud. Other officials were identified for their aggressive efforts to control the news media and for their involvement in a state food program that opposition leaders say was riddled with graft. “As the Venezuelan government continues to disregard the will of its people, our message remains clear: the United States will not stand aside while the Maduro regime continues to destroy democratic order and prosperity in Venezuela,” Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said in a statement. “We will maintain our vigorous efforts to sanction Venezuelan government officials who are complicit in Maduro’s attempts to undermine democracy, violate human rights, inhibit the freedom of expression or peaceful assembly, or engage in public corruption, unless they break from Maduro’s dictatorial regime,” Mr. Mnuchin added. As a result of the Treasury Department’s designation, the government froze all the assets under the United States’ jurisdiction belonging to the 10 officials and prohibited Americans from doing business with them.

"BEIJING — President Trump’s $250 billion in Chinese business deals probably won’t be enough to stop a trade fight. Mr. Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, offering personal praise and qualified criticisms of China’s trade practices. China, in return, offered modest concessions on some thorny trade issues. The two sides also pointed to what they claimed were billions of dollars of deals between Chinese and American companies to show face-saving progress. But behind the scenes, Washington and Beijing are gearing up for what may well be months of contentious relations between the world’s two largest trading partners. After initially focusing this year on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States’ free-trade pact with South Korea, Trump administration officials plan to pursue previous promises to investigate what they call Chinese theft of American intellectual property. Lawmakers also plan to intensify scrutiny of Chinese investments in sensitive areas of the American economy. Mr. Trump hinted at coming tensions on those fronts on Thursday, saying he hoped to address “the chronic imbalance in our relationship as it pertains to trade.” “This includes addressing China’s market access restrictions and technology transfer requirements,” he said, “which prevent American companies from being able to fairly compete within China.” "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. At first, people talked about the Republicans’ plan for tax reform. Once most of the plan’s reform elements disappeared, a more appropriate name seemed to be “tax cut.” But now that the bill’s details are coming out, it’s time to update the name again. Here’s my suggestion: Paul Ryan’s 2017 Tax Increase on Middle-Class Families. Amazingly, the bill released by House Republican leaders last week would increase taxes, on net, for families that have at least one child and make less than $100,000. That conclusion comes from a rigorous independent analysis of the bill, released yesterday afternoon by the Tax Policy Center. It was one of two damaging evaluations of the bill that came out yesterday; the other came from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress. The budget office projected that the plan would increase the deficit by $1.7 trillion over the next decade, even more than Republican leaders had claimed. Ultimately, Congress will need to find a way to pay those costs, and the most likely strategy will involve tax increases or benefit cuts for the middle class and poor. Put it all together, and this bill is a middle-class tax increase. In effect, Ryan and other House leaders are proposing an enormous tax cut for the wealthy and then trying to hold down the bill’s cost by raising taxes on middle-class and poor families. On average, households making at least $5 million would receive an annual tax cut of almost $300,000 once the bill was fully phased in. The situation for the middle class is quite different. A big reason is that personal exemptions — the $4,000 in income, per person, that families can write off — would disappear. The bill would increase standard deductions that all taxpayers can take, but the increase isn’t large enough for many families to make up for the disappearance of per-person exemptions, as Michael Linden of the Roosevelt Institute explained to me. A Times editorial breaks down other parts of the bill that hurt the middle class. "
"On Oct. 21, a body was found off a county road west of Corpus Christi, Tex., with bullet wounds to the chest, abdomen and shoulders. The victim was Stephanie Montez, a transgender woman. But because the police misidentified her as a man, it was not until last week that Ms. Montez, 47, was known to be among the more than two dozen transgender Americans killed this year. Even as transgender people have scored political victories and turned public opinion in favor of more protections, violence has risen, especially against black and Hispanic transgender women. And Ms. Montez’s case shows the difficulties advocates face in tracking killings and other hate crimes. The full death toll is impossible to determine, but by rights groups’ estimates, each of the past three years has become the deadliest on record. The Human Rights Campaign has documented the killings of 25 transgender people in the United States so far in 2017, compared with 23 last year and 21 in 2015. Other organizations, like Glaad and the Transgender Law Center, have slightly different tallies, but the trend holds. "

"LEWISTON, Me. — This week Maine voted to become the 32nd state to expand Medicaid despite opposition by Gov. Paul LePage, who had vetoed five previous expansion bills passed by the state legislature and has now threatened to block the results of the ballot initiative. Unless Mr. LePage succeeds, about 80,000 more Mainers will be eligible for coverage, a victory in an unsettling year for health care in America. With the Affordable Care Act under constant threat from the Trump administration and out-of-pocket costs rising faster than wages, health care topped the list of the most important issues facing Americans this year. However, Maine and other rural states face a health care crisis that Medicaid expansion can’t fix on its own. It’s not about affordable coverage; it’s about access: For too many rural areas, doctors and hospitals are scarce. In the postwar era, America made hospital construction and modernization a priority. On Aug. 13, 1946, Harry Truman signed the Hill-Burton Act, giving communities grants and loans for hospital construction. By 1975, almost one-third of American hospitals owed their creation to the law. Financing for Hill-Burton health care construction ended in 1997, but one rule from the original bill still applied: These hospitals had to give free or reduced care to people who couldn’t afford services. As rural areas aged and the population shrank because of manufacturing’s decline and the rise of a technology-driven economy centered on urban areas, hospitals struggled to stay in operation. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals started shutting down at worrisome rates because of an increase in financial penalties for noncompliance with A.C.A. mandates, the cost of tighter reporting standards and smaller reimbursements for certain procedures. Since the A.C.A. became law in 2010, over 80 rural hospitals have closed nationwide. Maine alone has lost three hospitals in that time, about 10 percent of its rural total. If closings continue at this rate, 25 percent of America’s rural hospitals will have disappeared in the decade after Obamacare’s passage. This does not take into account facility deterioration, doctor departures or department closures. "

"Most theories for the great crime decline that swept across nearly every major American city over the last 25 years have focused on the would-be criminals. Their lives changed in many ways starting in the 1990s: Strict new policing tactics kept closer watch on them. Mass incarceration locked them up in growing numbers. The crack epidemic that ensnared many began to recede. Even the more unorthodox theories — around the rise of abortion, the reduction in lead or the spread of A.D.H.D. medication — have argued that larger shifts in society altered the behavior (and existence) of potential criminals. But none of these explanations have paid much attention to the communities where violence plummeted the most. New research suggests that people there were working hard, with little credit, to address the problem themselves. Local nonprofit groups that responded to the violence by cleaning streets, building playgrounds, mentoring children and employing young men had a real effect on the crime rate. That’s what Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, argues in a new study and a forthcoming book. Mr. Sharkey doesn’t contend that community groups alone drove the national decline in crime, but rather that their impact is a major missing piece. “This was a part that has been completely overlooked and ignored in national debates over the crime drop,” he said. “But I think it’s fundamental to what happened.” "

"As it stands now, the proposed House tax bill would give the undeserving rich — legatees who will inherit multimillion dollar estates — a $172.2 billion tax break over the next ten years. In doing so, the measure would further entrench the super rich, a class that in recent years has acquired a growing share of both income and wealth. Conservative estimates published by the Brookings Institution show that from 1992 to 2013, the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent rose from 27 percent to 32 percent, and their share of income swelled from 12 to 18 percent. Looking at a century of data in “Wealth Inequality in the United States since 1913,” the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman found that the share of household wealth held by the top 0.1 percent recently climbed back over 20 percent, a figure it hadn’t reached since the 1930s. (Their findings are demonstrated in the accompanying chart.) There are a host of provisions in this year’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that disproportionately reward the rich, but the estate tax is one area where we can see the intentions of its sponsors most clearly. The House legislation, backed by the Republican leadership and President Trump, would, starting in 2018, double the size of estates exempt from taxation to $10.98 million from the current level of $5.49 million. It would repeal the tax altogether at the end of 2023. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, for the tiny percentage of the population that benefits from such immense estates, the value of the tax cut would grow steadily from $1.3 billion in 2018 to $38 billion in 2027. Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard’s Kennedy School who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2013 to 2017, emailed his response to my inquiry about the impact of the bill on households with different incomes: The House bill would repeal the estate tax, Furman wrote, and it “would also retain the step-up-basis loophole that even” President George W. Bush’s The estate tax has been under assault by Republicans in Congress for more than four decades. According to a paper published on Nov. 2 by Isabelle Sawhill and Eleanor Krause of the Brookings Institution, the estate tax currently applies to “a tiny fraction of American estates — about 2 out of every 1000 deaths,” compared with “the 1970s, when there were over 70 taxable estates for every 1000 deaths.” "
"FRACTURED CONTINENT
Europe’s Crises and the Fate of the West
By William Drozdiak
Illustrated. 298 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $26.95. The collapse of the Soviet Empire left Europe more united than ever before. Most of its countries shared a political (democratic) and economic (capitalist) system; Germany and Russia — the great powers that had caused so much instability in the past — were no longer threats, and the European Union was on the verge of incorporating much of Eastern Europe and creating a single currency. At the end of the 20th century, the view that a “united Europe” was on its way to becoming “the next global superpower,” and the West was at the dawn of a new golden era, was widespread. Could history prove itself any more unpredictable? Today, there are growing fears that Europe and the West have entered a period of terminal decline. How did we get from there to here? How did the unified, peaceful Europe of the late 20th century turn into the fractured, discordant continent of the early 21st? William Drozdiak, a former editor and chief European correspondent for The Washington Post, has written a book examining the current crisis from the vantage point of various European capitals — providing a colorful narrative of how it is being experienced differently in each place. From Berlin, the international aspects of the crisis appear front and center. Drozdiak finds in Germany a reluctant hegemon, unsure how to repair the postwar liberal international order now so disdained by the Trump administration. In Riga, Drozdiak discovers Europe’s increasingly precarious security situation. Russia threatens countries on Europe’s periphery and the conflicts in Syria, Libya and elsewhere are spilling over into its borders. Whether Europe can protect itself — again particularly with the Trump administration’s ambivalence about NATO — is an open question. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Looking at the results in the election for Virginia governor on Tuesday, Trevor Noah and Stephen Colbert were both surprised to see President Trump distancing himself from the defeated Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, who had embraced many elements of Mr. Trump’s platform. On “Full Frontal,” Samantha Bee discussed the need for gun control legislation. She told some jokes, then turned things over to a gospel choir, which sang a very nontraditional hymn — about what prayer alone can’t achieve. Mr. Noah pointed out that after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, both Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey headed straight to Gentle Path at the Meadows, a high-end rehabilitation facility for men with sexual addiction and other issues. Mr. Noah wasn’t so sure that’s where they belong. "
"Sheriff Joe Arpaio used to require pregnant inmates in the Arizona jails he controlled to get a court order before being allowed out of their cells to obtain a desired abortion. Needless to say, he was sued, and needless to say, he lost. (The sheriff appealed to the Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.) So he switched tactics to require any inmate who wanted an abortion to prepay the transportation and security costs, something not required for any other off-site medical procedure. The American Civil Liberties Union took the sheriff back to court and won again. That seemed to be that. Following President Trump’s pardon of Mr. Arpaio three months ago for an unrelated contempt of court conviction, the 85-year-old former sheriff, a right-wing hero for his years of abusing immigrants, seemed finally about to fade from the scene. But guess what? It turns out that we’re all living in Sheriff Joe country now. I’m referring to the deeply disturbing events of the past few weeks as the Trump administration pulled out all the stops to keep a pregnant 17-year-old, an “unaccompanied minor” in federal custody as an undocumented immigrant, from exercising her constitutional right to an abortion. The administration persisted even after a Texas judge ruled in September that the girl was sufficiently mature to make her own decision about her pregnancy. Known in court papers only as Jane Doe, she finally got her abortion on Oct. 25, thanks to a 6-to-3 ruling by the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. The abortion came after weeks of delay, after Jane Doe was forced to attend a counseling session at an anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy center” and as the pregnancy was approaching the 20-week limit for a legal abortion in Texas. The teenager is being held in Texas in a shelter run by a private contractor for the Department of Health and Human Services. Refusing to give up even after Jane Doe’s abortion, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco now wants to make sure the Trump administration can deter other pregnant teenagers in federal custody from terminating their pregnancies. Last week, he filed a wildly improbable Supreme Court appeal, asking the justices to vacate as moot the appeals court’s decision and, while they’re at it, to impose sanctions on Jane Doe’s A.C.L.U. attorneys for getting their client her abortion before the Trump administration could run to the Supreme Court with an emergency appeal. That’s a bizarre complaint; even the three dissenting appeals court judges, in an opinion by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, wrote that “the majority’s order today necessarily means that the government must allow an immediate abortion while Jane Doe remains in government custody.” (The mootness claim itself is shaky: Jane Doe filed her lawsuit as a class action, and she also has claims for damages still pending against the officials who blocked her path.) I gather that the decision to go to the Supreme Court was extremely controversial within the solicitor general’s office, staffed almost entirely by lawyers who are career civil servants and who serve from one administration to the next, sometimes for decades. Not a single career lawyer signed the solicitor general’s Supreme Court petition, a sure indication that something isn’t right in the office. If the recent trickle of resignations becomes a flood, we can assume that the talented lawyers who left their prestigious positions hadn’t signed up to work in what is becoming a Justice Department outpost of the National Right to Life Committee. Even if the Supreme Court ignores the administration’s appeal, no one who cares about the rule of law should assume that this story has had a happy ending. Far from it. What we see here is not an ending, but a beginning. We see the future of abortion in America. "

"BEIJING — President Trump heaped praise on President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday, blaming past American administrations for China’s yawning trade surplus with the United States and saying he was confident that Mr. Xi could defuse the threat from North Korea. Mr. Trump’s warm words, on a state visit to China replete with ceremony but short of tangible results, showed a president doubling down on his gamble that by cultivating a personal connection with Mr. Xi, he can push the Chinese leader to take meaningful steps on North Korea and trade. In public, Mr. Trump projected an air of deference to China that was almost unheard-of for a visiting American president. Far from attacking Mr. Xi on trade, Mr. Trump saluted him for leading a country that he said had left the United States “so far behind.” He said he could not blame the Chinese for taking advantage of weak American trade policy. Behind closed doors, American officials insisted, Mr. Trump forcefully confronted Mr. Xi about the chronic trade imbalances between the two countries. He also pressed China to take tougher measures toward North Korea, including a suspension of oil shipments. In neither case did the Chinese make significant concessions, nor did Mr. Trump express dissatisfaction with their response. It was a remarkable moment in the story of China’s rise and America’s response to it, with Mr. Trump’s performance suggesting a tipping point in great-power politics. By concluding that the United States can better achieve its goals by flattering a Chinese leader than by challenging him, Mr. Trump seemed to signal a reversal of roles: the United States may now need China’s help more than the other way around.

"When Hurricane Irma swept through the Florida Keys in September, it brought a vivid preview of the damage that climate change could inflict on the region in the decades ahead. The storm washed out two sections of the highway connecting the Keys, leaving residents stranded for days. With ocean levels rising around these low-lying islands, however, that interruption could end up seeming minor: By 2030, almost half the county’s roads could be affected by flooding. “We know that the water isn’t going away,” said Rhonda Haag, the sustainability director for Monroe County, which is preparing to elevate vulnerable roadways in the Keys. But the task is so costly, up to $7 million per mile of road, that the county may ultimately require outside help. In Washington, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is leading recovery efforts that could cost taxpayers more than $50 billion after devastating storms hit Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. At the same time, the agency is wrestling with an even harder problem: how to help communities prepare for future flooding disasters that could be far more severe than anything seen this year. Complicating that task is the fact that the Trump administration has largely been hostile to discussions of global warming. In August, a week before Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, President Trump rescinded an Obama-era executive order that urged federal agencies to take into account climate change and sea-level rise when rebuilding infrastructure. Climate change remains a polarizing topic in the nation’s capital, and FEMA is caught in the middle. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office warned that rising sea levels and heavier downpours fueled by global warming could increase flooding costs in coastal communities by $23 billion per year by midcentury unless they start adapting now.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Republicans in Congress are pushing ahead with their efforts to get a sweeping tax bill onto President Trump’s desk by Christmas. The Senate unveiled a bill that delays a big corporate tax cut until 2019 and keeps several valuable deductions — but completely eliminates the one for state and local taxes. The House and Senate proposals diverge on important provisions that will be challenging for lawmakers to rectify in the coming weeks, in part because of competing political priorities facing members in each chamber. Above, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, after a meeting on the tax plan. _____ "
"WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans who have struggled to accomplish much of anything are now fully invested in quickly pulling off one of the most difficult legislative feats of all — enacting a complicated rewrite of the federal tax code through a proposal littered with political land mines. With the Senate on Thursday unveiling its companion to the House tax overhaul, Republican leaders began carefully counting votes and calculating what it would take to secure a badly needed victory. Republicans in both the House and Senate believe they can ultimately prevail — though the end result might cost some Republicans their congressional seats next year. But they are not 100 percent certain, and are well aware that the slightest adjustment in the tax proposal to win one vote can just as easily drive off a few others. “I think it will go through, but who knows?” said Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who was around for the last major tax fight in 1986. “We will have to wait and see.” The two Republican plans — no Democrats are actively engaged in the negotiations — differ in substantial respects but share major elements, such as doubling of the standard deduction, increasing the child tax credit and trying to spur economic growth through a cut in the corporate tax rate. One difference presents a huge political problem. The Senate would eliminate the ability of individuals to deduct state and local taxes while the House includes a compromise that would allow taxpayers to take deductions of up to $10,000 in property taxes. That issue was already an obstacle in the House, and House Republicans say no final plan can survive the House if state and local tax deductions are fully prohibited. "
"“Big smile for the camera,” begins a barbed new song from the dissident Russian band Pussy Riot about state surveillance and police brutality. Released on Wednesday, the video for “Police State” shows three children in pastel-colored masks — a Pussy Riot trademark — who are being forced to watch looped videos of President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia shaking hands. A booted and uniformed Chloë Sevigny tosses children’s stuffed animals into a fire, and crushes others with a police baton. A ballerina blithely pirouettes in the background as lyrics proclaim: “No problems in paradise/We’ll lock them up.” Pussy Riot gained widespread attention in 2012 after three of its members were charged with “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” for staging an anti-Putin demonstration in Moscow at the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Christ the Savior. In the video for “Police State,” the band’s members also wear ski masks, which have the added benefit of conferring anonymity: The group’s membership is rotating and sometimes obscure. Only one member of Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, is clearly identifiable in the video. She said in a telephone interview from Berlin on Thursday that other members of the group needed to remain anonymous for their protection. Ms. Tolokonnikova said she hoped the video would highlight “how difficult and dangerous it is for political activists to spread new information.” She added, “We’ve been attacked several times and people around us have been attacked and even killed — killed just because of political participation.” The video was released a year after Mr. Trump’s presidential victory. Ms. Tolokonnikova called it a “sad anniversary,” adding “lots of people in the United States decided to choose this not-very-smart and pro-authoritarian person who is attacking women’s rights, trans rights and independent press.” She said Mr. Trump “treats critics as treasonous which is the first sign of being an authoritarian leader.” Ms. Tolokonnikova lives in Moscow, where she assumes, she said, that she is under surveillance, but “I’m not anything special in this regard. Every person who decides to be politically involved, they are under surveillance in Russia.” She said it was “something you get used to.” The song’s title, “Police State,” is not just an empty phrase for her. “It’s not just words for me,” she said. “I know what it means.” But she added: “If you constantly think about fear, about being beaten or one or another thing, you will never do anything. I prefer to think about things that can be changed.” "
"Tuesday night’s election results were a major shot in the arm for the anti-Donald Trump resistance and a major slap in the face for all the Democrats who caterwauled last November about how the party had focused too much on courting women and minorities, and ignored angry white men. After Trump’s election, there seemed to be a surge in coverage of these men, like The Guardian’s “Trump’s Angry White Men” and Time’s “The Revenge of the White Man.” Mark Lilla, a professor at Columbia, lamented “identity liberalism” on the cover of The New York Times’ Sunday Review, writing: “In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism’s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing. One of the many lessons of the recent presidential election campaign and its repugnant outcome is that the age of identity liberalism must be brought to an end.” These angry white men — who have shown little strong allegiance to liberalism — were being prioritized above people who have shown an undying devotion to liberalism: college-educated whites (particularly women), people of color and passionate progressives, which of course can be overlapping labels. These people take identity politics to mean recognizing, listening to and trying to satisfy the particular needs of particular groups of people who have very different lived experiences in this country. Objecting to identity politics is just a guise for objecting to politics for and about people who are not white, because as the British feminist author Laurie Penny explained to Salon in August: “All politics are identity politics, especially the politics of the far right. They’re about this idea of white identity, this idea of male identity that feels so under attack at the moment. When people attack identity politics, they are attacking politics that prioritizes or even includes women, people of color, queer people.” "
"BRUSSELS — Nearly three months after President Trump announced his new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, the United States and its international allies are still trying to come up with the troops required to carry it out. The relatively few American and international troops in Afghanistan are charged with training the Afghan military and with helping them beat back Taliban forces. With the militants at their strongest level since the start of the war in 2001, the issue of troop levels has renewed importance. “We’ve fought most of the year,” Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commanding officer of American and international forces in Afghanistan, told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday, “however, at the lowest level of capability that we’ve ever had in the past 16 years.” Since February, General Nicholson has requested several thousand  additional troops for the mission, to break what he calls a stalemate in the Afghan conflict. Mr. Trump announced the new strategy for Afghanistan in August, and authorized an American troop increase of roughly 3,000. Though military officials deem that increase necessary, the Pentagon has also stressed that for the American-led mission to succeed, more international forces, chiefly from NATO members, would be required. For most of this year, General Nicholson said, the mission in Afghanistan has had only 80 percent of the troops it required. He said he had asked NATO members and other countries involved in the conflict to send more soldiers, but, “We’re still waiting for this to all play out.” "
"Opposition from France and Italy doomed a European Union vote on Thursday to reauthorize the world’s most popular weedkiller, glyphosate, a decision that came hours after Arkansas regulators moved to ban an alternative weedkiller for much of 2018. The decisions are a double blow to the agrochemical industry and particularly to the chemicals giant Monsanto. An appeals committee of European officials will convene this month, though, to weigh again whether to continue to allow glyphosate just weeks before its registration expires. The chemical is the main ingredient in Roundup, one of Monsanto’s flagships, but its patent has ended and it is now made by much of the industry. The effort to reauthorize the weedkiller failed to receive a majority even though regulators were seeking only a five-year reauthorization instead of the typical 15, amid controversy and disputes about cancer risk that have made glyphosate’s future in Europe uncertain. Its approval in the region expires in mid-December. The vote on Thursday, which was weighted based on the population of the various European Union member states, was nearly 37 percent in favor of renewing the chemical and a little over 32 percent against, with nearly 31 percent abstaining. France and Italy opposed the renewal; Spain was in favor, along with Britain, which is due to leave the union. Germany and Poland abstained. In Arkansas, regulators voted on Wednesday to ban the use of another major weedkiller, dicamba, for more than six months of next year, including the summer, amid widespread reports of crop damage. Dicamba has been around for decades, but new versions have been developed by Monsanto, BASF and DuPont as an alternative to Roundup. The regulatory recommendation is now being sent to a state legislative panel. Taken together, the decisions reflect an increasing political resistance to pesticides in Europe and parts of the United States, as well as the specific shortcomings of dicamba, whose tendency to drift has given pause even to the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency, which has otherwise largely acceded to the wishes of the chemical industry. Dicamba has damaged more than 3.6 million acres of soybean crops in 25 states, roughly 4 percent of all soybeans planted this year in the United States. "
"WASHINGTON — With their hopes of repealing the Affordable Care Act dashed for now, deep-pocketed conservative activists have turned their attention to a smaller but still potent new effort: allowing private health care to compete with Veterans Affairs hospitals for the patronage of the nation’s veterans. Concerned Veterans for America, a little-known advocacy group backed by the conservative billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, is pressing Republicans to make it easier for veterans to see private doctors at government expense. The group’s voice had been lonely until recently, when a raft of Koch-connected advocacy organizations and other conservative allies joined the effort. That has in many cases pitted conservative advocates against congressionally chartered, old-line groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion that have long guarded the Veterans Affairs system that they helped build. “We actually have members that guide our advocacy and our voice as opposed to a small partisan think tank of ideologues,” said Louis Celli, the national director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation for the American Legion. “We get our voice from our two-million-person membership base that actually use V.A. services and tell us what they are looking for.” Dan Caldwell, the executive director of Concerned Veterans, pushed back, citing the Koch group’s volunteer membership numbers and the influence of veterans in its network. “What, in effect, those people are saying is that the military service of our staff and our members and our ideas mean less than theirs simply because we don’t have a congressional charter and we don’t wear hats,” he said.

"Performance art is in some ways like stand-up comedy. Both are often acutely personal and both can cause wincing discomfort (along with maybe a few good laughs). But while stand-up thrives on late-night TV, the scrappy, ad hoc kind of performance art that flourished in the 1970s is often said to have faded, eclipsed by big-budget productions. This month’s presentation of the multivenue biennial program  Performa 17 proves again there’s a thriving middle ground. Founded by RoseLee Goldberg, who still directs it, Performa arrived in 2005 as a revelation, presenting little-known artists whose work, even when rough, was visually arresting, emotionally gripping and technically sophisticated. Keeping the energy going has required varying the focus by region and theme. In this year’s iteration, which runs through Nov. 19, the emphasis is on African artists — particularly those from South Africa (Ms. Goldberg’s birthplace) — and the “historical anchor” is Dada. Emerging amid the wholesale slaughter of World War I, Dada was the heading for a series of incendiary acts at various clubs and cabarets — noise as music, nonsense as poetry — that managed to be both utopian and nihilistic. It suggested that yowling hilarity is the best revenge against an incomprehensibly violent world. Performa 17’s participants responded to the Dada cue in wildly varying ways. Among the standouts in the 19-day program’s first week, in various locations around the city, was the quietly grave, thoroughly devastating “Black Paper” by Teju Cole, the Nigerian-American writer, photographer and photography critic for The New York Times Magazine. It began with Mr. Cole entering in natty professional attire — crisp white shirt, porkpie hat, stylish glasses, pressed slacks — and promptly replacing it with the shapeless clothes of the dispossessed. Lying down on a cot at the center of the theater, he pulled a blanket over himself as six screens lit up, surrounding the audience. The first projected image, of a nondescript hotel room, appeared on every screen. A mingled soundtrack of crickets and traffic, nearly inaudible voices, and percussive music — pings, chimes, and a low piano note struck repeatedly — circulated on speakers behind the audience. Soon the front page of The Times from the morning after Trump’s victory appeared on several screens, with its banner headline, “Outsider Mogul Captures the Presidency.” Read a year later, it can be seen to brand him an unwelcome, even un-American, intruder. Subsequently, superimposed newspaper pages blurred, but a message had been delivered: alienation would be Mr. Cole’s tonic note, played up and down the keyboard. "
"After the billionaire investor Warren Buffett exposed the unfairness of a federal tax code that assessed his secretary at a higher rate than him, it was hard to imagine a tax reform plan that would be even less fair. House Republicans have come up with one. That’s not because the plan indiscriminately favors the rich. It’s because to a degree unprecedented in American tax history, it favors the investor class, Mr. Buffett prominent among them, at the expense of people who work for a living, like his secretary. It favors Donald Trump and his fellow real estate developers and investors, who already benefit from numerous loopholes in the tax code. “I wouldn’t call this tax reform,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. There is no more glaring example of the House Republicans’ indifference to the inequities embedded in the tax code than the treatment of so-called carried interest. For decades, the carried interest provision has enabled wealthy private equity managers, hedge fund managers and real estate investors to pay the lower capital gains rate (20 percent, not counting the Obama health care surcharge of 3.8 percent) on their income rather than the rate on ordinary income (a maximum of 39.6 percent). The former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was excoriated for taking advantage of the loophole in 2012, and as a candidate Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to close it. "
"NASA’s new heavy-lift rocket will not get off the ground until December 2019 at the earliest, and its maiden flight could easily slip to the middle of 2020, the space agency announced on Wednesday. The rocket known as the Space Launch System would succeed the Saturn 5 that took astronauts to the moon more than four decades ago. NASA says it plans to use the vehicle to take astronauts not only to the moon — one of the goals of the Trump administration — but someday Mars. Earlier this year, NASA acknowledged it would not be able to make the previously announced launch date of November 2018 for the first flight, which will not carry any astronauts. The completed review indicates a launch date of June 2020, but NASA said it might be possible to move up the launch date by six months. “This earlier launch date is reasonable and challenges the teams to stay focused on tasks without creating undue pressure,” William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said at a hearing of the House space subcommittee on Thursday. “Furthermore, NASA is taking additional steps to reduce schedule risks for both known and unknown issues and protect for the earliest possible launch date.” "
"ATLANTA — Republicans in Washington seemed near panic Thursday in the light of a news report in which four women said Roy S. Moore, the Republican nominee for a United States Senate seat in Alabama and an evangelical Christian, had made sexual or romantic overtures to them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, said Mr. Moore should step aside ahead of the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations were true. But in Alabama, the fallout was uncertain for a candidate who is considered a hero in some circles for his conservative cultural stances. Mr. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, was twice removed from that office for his positions on gay marriage and a Ten Commandments display. On Thursday, he strenuously denied the allegations the women made about him in on-the-record interviews included in the report, published by The Washington Post. And it was clear that many in his conservative base were in no mood to desert him in a race for a Senate seat Republicans consider crucial to maintaining their majority in the upper chamber. John Skipper, 66, a former chair of the Mobile County Republican Party, declared the allegations “total contrived media garbage.” Mr. Skipper said that he would still support the candidate and that he figured most of the Alabama Republicans he knew would probably do the same. “Most of them will not be shocked,” he said, “and will rather be expecting these shenanigans being pulled by the Democrats as standard operating procedure.” Whether Mr. Skipper’s prediction proves true remains to be seen. But the report unquestionably introduced new waves of uncertainty and turmoil into a race for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. "
"WASHINGTON — The White House unsuccessfully tried to pressure the Homeland Security Department to end a program that allows hundreds of thousands of people from countries affected by natural disasters or violence to live in the United States without fear of being deported, according to people familiar with the discussions. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, made an 11th-hour plea to Elaine Duke, the acting Homeland Security secretary, ahead of a deadline this past Monday to decide about the status of immigrants in the program from Honduras and Nicaragua. Ms. Duke ultimately delayed for six months a decision on the status of immigrants from Honduras, saying she had concluded after an internal department review that she did not have enough information about conditions in the country to decide. But she ended the protected status for thousands of immigrants from Nicaragua who came to the United States illegally after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Accounts of her phone calls with Mr. Kelly laid bare the strains between Trump administration officials trying to reduce both legal and illegal immigration — a campaign promise of President Trump’s — and career immigration officials who see those efforts as overly broad and harsh. The internal tensions over the administration’s immigration agenda were on display in discrepancies among descriptions of the calls. A White House official said that Mr. Kelly had encouraged Ms. Duke to make a decision but did not pressure her to end the program. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — On Tuesday afternoon, Twitter added a small blue check mark to the account of Jason Kessler, a move known as verification that indicates a prominent person’s real account. The action was quickly met with outrage. That’s because Mr. Kessler is a well-known white supremacist who has used Twitter to spread his message and organize rallies like Unite the Right’s march in Charlottesville, Va., where torch-wielding protesters marched through the streets chanting racist rallying cries. Across the Twitterverse, people including the comedian Michael Ian Black came down on the company. By Thursday morning, Twitter announced it would be halting its entire general verification program. It was yet another situation that the company has had to make amends on, just a week after the accidental deletion of President Trump’s Twitter account and testimony in Washington on how Russian agents used its service last year to sow discord. “The system is broken and needs to be reconsidered,” Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted on Thursday. “And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster.” When Twitter puts a verified check mark next to a white nationalist’s name, is the company endorsing that person? That was what Twitter was trying to figure out on Thursday. “Verification was meant to authenticate identity and voice but it is interpreted as an endorsement or importance,” the company said on Twitter. “We have created this confusion.” Twitter originally began verifying accounts to give high-profile individuals — celebrities, politicians, journalists and others — a way to distinguish themselves from impersonators. The blue check mark has since become something of a badge of honor, signaling that someone had reached a certain level of importance. “It’s recognition. It’s a simple as that,” Richard Spencer, a white supremacist who was verified by Twitter in 2016, said in an interview. “The blue check mark is useful.” The white nationalist movement has flourished on Twitter, but Mr. Spencer said the platform had been behaving erratically toward his community lately. “It seems to be non-algorithmic now,” he said. “It seems like there’s one person who doesn’t like this tweet or that account one day, and it seems like a judgment. It’s incoherent.” Mr. Kessler’s account — with the handle @TheMadDimension — remains verified. Late Wednesday, he responded to the uproar with a tweet wondering if it was still O.K. to be white, and included a poll for people to answer. As of Thursday afternoon, he had gotten nearly 50,000 responses. "
"BEIRUT, Lebanon — More than 200 people have been summoned for questioning, and most are still detained, in a wide-ranging crackdown that Saudi Arabia says is aimed at rooting out corruption and reclaiming embezzled funds, the government said Thursday. The kingdom’s attorney general, Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb, said in a statement that Saudi authorities believed that at least $100 billion “had been misused though systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades.” The statement provided new details about the crackdown, which has singled out some of the kingdom’s most prominent princes, investors and media moguls, but left many questions unanswered. The government has portrayed the arrests as a crackdown on corruption, but critics see the detentions as an effort by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to neutralize any remaining power centers in the kingdom that could challenge his rule. They also note that in a monarchy like Saudi Arabia, the blurry lines between public and private money make it unclear what exactly qualifies as corruption. In the statement, Sheikh Saud said that 208 people had been summoned for questioning and that seven had been released without being charged. The arrests, he said, were based on three years of investigations that produced “very large” evidence. It was unclear which body had carried out the investigations since the Supreme Anti-Corruption Committee that is leading the campaign was created only hours before the first arrests were made on Saturday.

"WASHINGTON — Now that the House and the Senate have both released their tax bills, the hard part can begin: getting them in sync. For months, Republican leaders of the “Big Six” working group held weekly meetings so that the tax plans that they unveiled would be largely unified, making it possible for legislation to sail through Congress before the end of the year. But the House and Senate proposals diverge on important provisions that will be challenging for lawmakers to rectify in the coming weeks, in part because of competing political priorities facing lawmakers in each chamber. Republicans originally wanted to collapse the tax brackets to three, from seven, in part to achieve their goal of simplifying the tax code so that people could file on a postcard. That proved difficult. The House plan went with four brackets: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and a top rate that stays at 39.6 percent for millionaires. The Senate bill sticks with seven brackets of 10 percent, 12 percent, 22.5 percent, 25 percent, 32.5 percent and 35 percent but lowers the top rate to 38.5 percent for high-income individuals and couples. Perhaps the thorniest issue thus far has been how to handle the state and local tax deduction, which allows people to deduct their state and local income, sales and property taxes. The House bill limits the deduction to just property taxes and caps it at $10,000. The Senate plan eliminates the so-called SALT deduction entirely, a move that could cause backlash from many upper-middle-class families and spook House members who have already objected to the more generous scaled-back version in their chamber.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “You’re a very special man,” President Trump told President Xi Jinping at a news conference in Beijing, showing uncharacteristic deference on a state visit that has been heavier on ceremony than tangible results. Mr. Trump may hope that cultivating a personal connection with Mr. Xi will help push him on North Korea and trade, but so far, the Chinese have made no significant concessions. Nor have American pleas quelled China’s online drug market, which Mr. Trump blames for contributing to the U.S. opioid epidemic. Here are photographs from Mr. Trump’s tour so far. He heads to Vietnam today, where he may meet President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He returns to the U.S. Tuesday, after the East Asia Summit meeting in Manila. _____ "
"Richly seasoned lamb curry, chana masala and saag paneer fill the chafing dishes. Cases display confections like gulab jamun and rasgulla, sweet milk and cheese dumplings. Overhead a television broadcasts images of Bollywood stars. These features so define Pakistani and Bangladeshi restaurants in New York City that, at first glance, such places appear almost indistinguishable. But make no mistake: Everyone has a favorite. For goat pulao, Amanet Khan, a taxi driver of 25 years, goes to Lahori Chilli, on a stretch of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn known as Little Pakistan. The dish is also a favorite at Chandni, a floor above the Ar-Rahman mosque in Manhattan. Go a few blocks east to Haandi in Curry Hill for lamb nihari, a stew of slow-cooked shanks and bone marrow. Jackson Heights, Queens, a few drivers say, is where to get beef Bihari kebab, either at Dera or Kababish, where meat sits on a charcoal grill with spices boiling underneath. By quirk of demographics, taxi drivers will be at any of these South Asian restaurants. According to New York City officials, about 62,000 people in the five boroughs identify as Bangladeshi, and about 51,000 as Pakistani. Of the 148,168 drivers licensed by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission in 2015, 19,354 reported that they came from Bangladesh; 12,536 from Pakistan. "
"WASHINGTON — The federal government on Thursday made public more than 13,000 additional documents from its files on President John F. Kennedy’s assassination as it seeks to finally release the last papers from its once-secret collection related to the 1963 murder. The release was the fourth since summer and primarily includes documents that were released in the past, but with sensitive information redacted. The versions posted online on Thursday were for the most part supposed to reveal the previously withheld portions in keeping with a 1992 law mandating the maximum release possible by 2017. The documents released so far this year have cast fresh light on one of the most sensational and still-debated events in modern American history. But as scholars and conspiracy theorists have combed through the files, they have not yet reported discovering conclusive evidence that definitively changes the previous understanding of the assassination or the weeks and months surrounding it. President Trump, who has dabbled in conspiracy theories himself, has expressed great interest in ensuring that the government finally divulge virtually everything it has kept out of the public eye for more than a half-century. Mr. Trump once asserted that the father of his Republican rival last year, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the assassination, and his sometime adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., published a book in 2013 asserting that President Lyndon B. Johnson was complicit in the assassination, which resulted in his ascension to the Oval Office. The 1992 law required the government to make public the last of the Kennedy assassination documents by Oct. 26, 2017, unless the sitting president opted to withhold any for national security reasons. After protests by the F.B.I. and C.I.A. in the days leading up to the deadline last month, Mr. Trump reluctantly agreed to hold back tens of thousands of the documents for another review, but ordered the agencies to make public everything by April 26 except the names and addresses of people still living. In keeping with the president’s order, the agencies are releasing some documents in periodic batches even before re-reviewing them, so some of what was posted on Thursday on the website of the National Archives and Records Administration may still have redactions that do not comply with Mr. Trump’s standard and will have to be rereleased by April. After the 13,213 documents were disclosed on Thursday, the archives still has about 17,465 that remain to be released in the months to come. "
"In November 2014, the married actors Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka attended a dinner party at the Chiltern Firehouse after the London premiere of “Horrible Bosses 2,” in which Mr. Bateman starred. The Chiltern, an 1889 fire station turned luxury hotel and restaurant, is owned by André Balazs, who built a hospitality empire with his boutique chain the Standard, the Mercer in SoHo and Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, Calif. The movie’s other stars, including Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, were also there with their guests. After dinner Mr. Balazs offered to take the group on a tour, leading them to an upstairs room with a view of London accessible by a firehouse-style ladder. Ms. Anka was wearing a burgundy leather dress and was hesitant to climb the ladder, according to witnesses. But Mr. Balazs insisted. As she navigated the steps, these people said, Mr. Balazs slipped a hand under her skirt and grabbed her crotch. Ms. Anka told the group what Mr. Balazs had done. Her husband and colleagues were visibly upset. “I witnessed behavior by André Balazs that was inappropriate and offensive,” said Mary Elizabeth Ellis, the wife of Mr. Day, in a statement. Downstairs, Mr. Bateman confronted the hotel owner, spitting gum in Mr. Balazs’s face. The Batemans hastily left the hotel, waving as they waded through paparazzi as if nothing had happened. Last week, the couple confirmed the incident in a statement released by their publicist. “On behalf of Jason Bateman and Amanda Anka, we can confirm that the account of André Balazs’s outrageous and vile behavior on that night in London is factual,” the statement said. “His actions were dealt with at the time.” Since transforming his industry with the Standard brand he created nearly two decades ago, Mr. Balazs, 60, has expertly navigated channels of celebrity, fashion and business in New York, Los Angeles and beyond. The son of Hungarian immigrants, he dated the actress Uma Thurman for years and also dated the television host Chelsea Handler. He turned the sleepy Chateau Marmont into a hangout for members of the hip Hollywood set, like Johnny Depp and the singer Florence Welch. He has bragged of employing Ivanka Trump as an intern one year when she was a student. "
"WASHINGTON — More than 600,000 people signed up last week for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, significantly beating the pace of prior years as consumers defied President Trump’s assertion that the marketplace was collapsing. In a report on the first four days of open enrollment, the Trump administration said Thursday, 601,462 people selected health plans in the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov. Of that number, 137,322 consumers, or 23 percent, were new to the marketplace and did not have coverage this year through the federal insurance exchange. “It’s the biggest start to open enrollment ever,” said Lori Lodes, an Obama administration official and a founder of Get America Covered, a nonprofit group helping people get information about insurance options. “It shows that people really want to get health insurance and value it.” The surge in sign-ups came after Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress had repeatedly tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, warning that markets were imploding and rates exploding. “Obamacare is finished,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting last month. “It’s dead. It’s gone. It’s no longer — you shouldn’t even mention. It’s gone. There is no such thing as Obamacare anymore.” The numbers tell a different story. Sign-ups averaged more than 150,000 a day last week. By contrast, they averaged 66,000 a day in the first week of open enrollment in November 2014 and 77,600 a day in the first week of enrollment in November 2015. The Obama administration reported data every other week last fall, and the first report showed that sign-ups averaged 84,000 a day. "
"It was the statue that never was: a bronze, bejeweled monument to a British queen intended to rise five stories high on the Queens side of the East River across from the United Nations in the 1990s. Backed by millions of dollars in privately raised funds and plenty of hype, the project was more than a decade in development and construction. But in 1998, it became mired in racially and politically charged protest that ended with the project scrapped and the nearly completed bronze statue melted down for scrap. Though largely forgotten, the statue controversy was something of a forerunner to the current controversy, swirling nationally and in New York City, over statues deemed offensive because of the histories of the figures they depict. In the late 1980s, a Portuguese group proposed a statue to honor Catherine of Braganza, a 17th-century Portuguese princess who married King Charles II of England and became, many believe, the eponym of the borough of Queens. In 1992, the artist Audrey Flack won a competition for the commission to create a 35-foot figure atop a 15-foot base. She spent a decade creating smaller models and then a full-size clay figure to cast in bronze. "
"DUBLIN — Every era gets the Lenny Bruce it deserves. Ours is Kathy Griffin. On Wednesday night, Ms. Griffin, 57, delivered a wild two-hour-and-15-minute performance that brought to mind Bruce’s late period, when that comic’s compelling if exhausting shows featured blow-by-blow analysis of his legal battles with the government. At the start of Ms. Griffin’s performance, which included raucous cheers, disarming boos and a premature finale when she fainted, she warned: “I’m not going to stop talking until I’m arrested.” A bit dramatic, sure, but not as much as you might think. Ms. Griffin embarked on this international tour, “Laugh Your Head Off,” after her American dates were canceled when she was photographed holding a Donald Trump mask smeared in ketchup. TMZ’s headline: “Kathy Griffin Beheads President Trump.” Even though Mr. Trump has picked fights with everyone from Meryl Streep to the cast of “Hamilton” since being elected, he has gone after no artist as hard as Ms. Griffin. He wrote a blistering tweet, his wife released a strongly worded formal statement and his son Donald Jr. harshly criticized her on Fox News. While Ms. Griffin joked on Wednesday, “For two hours I had to convince my mom I wasn’t in ISIS,” her stories about the resulting furor were dark and even chilling. As a result of this tasteless photo, Ms. Griffin didn’t just receive death threats, lose gigs and sponsorship money, and get fired as a host of CNN’s annual New Year’s Eve special. She was also put on the no-fly list and became the subject of a Secret Service investigation for, she says, “conspiracy to assassinate the president.” When she asked the federal agent why the government was going to such extremes, the woman pointed upward, indicating, Ms. Griffin interpreted, that this came from the president himself.

"Randall L. Stephenson, chief executive of telecommunications giant AT&T, said selling CNN in order to push through his company’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has never been and will never be on the table. “I have never offered to sell CNN,” he said repeatedly. “There is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN.” Speaking at The New York Times’s DealBook conference in New York — a day after tensions over AT&T’s negotiations with the Justice Department spilled into the open — Mr. Stephenson said that selling the cable news network, which President Trump has accused of bias, “doesn’t make sense in the context of what we’re trying to accomplish.” Mr. Stephenson said Thursday that the Justice Department had never told AT&T that selling CNN was the price of getting the deal done. Since the election, Mr. Stephenson has met with Mr. Trump several times. But he said he has not, to the best of his recollection, had conversations with people inside the administration about the deal. To a question — posed by a CNN reporter in the crowd — about whether the pall over the deal can be attributed in part to a “Trump factor,” Mr. Stephenson said no. If completed, the acquisition of Time Warner — the owner of HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN — would transform AT&T into a colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions of people via its wireless and satellite services. But on Wednesday, negotiations between the companies and the Justice Department appeared to be mired in politics. Accounts of AT&T’s meeting with antitrust officials on Monday — which Mr. Stephenson said was “very productive” — have differed. In one, Justice Department officials called on the company to sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or DirecTV — the satellite television provider that AT&T purchased two years ago for nearly $49 billion — for the Time Warner deal to proceed. Another version involved Mr. Stephenson’s offering to sell the news channel. Mr. Stephenson on Wednesday and again on Thursday denied making such an overture. “This is a classic vertical merger,” Mr. Stephenson told The Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. “There are no overlaps of competition. There are no competitors being taken out of the competition. There hasn’t been one of these challenged in the courts and defeated in 40 years.” The deal is designed to help AT&T counter slowing growth in its core wireless, internet and satellite businesses while fending off online video upstarts like Netflix and Hulu. “The idea that somehow we’re going to take distribution and content and create something so powerful that it would disrupt Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, it’s comical to be honest,” he said. “We’re trying build a platform that allows us to compete with those guys.” "
"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans outlined their vision on Thursday for overhauling the tax code, proposing a one-year delay in President Trump’s top priority of cutting the corporate tax rate while reinstating some prized tax breaks used by middle-class families. The Senate bill differs significantly from the House version approved by the Ways and Means committee on Thursday: It would preserve some popular tax breaks, including ones for mortgage interest and medical expenses, and would maintain a bottom tax rate of 10 percent for lower earners. But it would also jettison the state and local tax deduction entirely and delay the enforcement of a 20 percent corporate tax rate until 2019, which could rankle the White House and mute the economic growth projections that Republicans are counting on to blunt the cost of the tax cuts. The disparate bills show the competing pressures that Republican lawmakers are facing and the calculations that Senate and House leaders are making to ensure passage of the bills through their respective chambers. While both bills share the main priorities of cutting corporate and individual taxes, they diverge on matters of high political sensitivity, particularly for vulnerable House Republicans from high-tax states and for Senate Republicans concerned about adding to the federal budget deficit. Senate staff members said their draft would require changes, likely major ones, to survive procedural rules that allow it to pass on a party-line vote. Those changes could include setting some of the tax cuts to expire after a period of years. A retiring senator, Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, raised concerns that the legislation could add more to federal deficits. “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt,” Mr. Flake said, “by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.” Senators Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the bill did not go far enough in increasing the child tax credit, which rose to $1,650 per child in the Senate version, from $1,600 in the House bill, and would now be available to families making up to $1 million a year, a leap from a current income limit of $110,000. “The Senate is not going to pass a bill that isn’t clearly pro-family,” they said in a joint statement, “so we look forward to working with our colleagues to get there.” "
