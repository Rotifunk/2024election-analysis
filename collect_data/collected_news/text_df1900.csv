"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Huge explosion in Afghanistan. A truck bombing near the presidential palace in Kabul today killed at least 80 people and wounded hundreds. The blast, in a crowded area near several embassies, shattered windows a mile away. Here’s what we know about the attack, including photographs from the scene. • U.S. set to exit climate pact. President Trump is poised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement, two officials with knowledge of the decision said, a move that would make good on a campaign pledge and that would severely weaken the landmark 2015 accord. White House officials cautioned that the decision was not final. The president has said the agreement, under which nearly every nation committed to curbing emissions, would hurt the U.S. economy. "
"City Council members and immigrant activists cheered in April when they saw the $16.4 million in legal services that Mayor Bill de Blasio budgeted for defending poor immigrants facing deportation. But then they saw the asterisk. The mayor said that the services would be denied to immigrants who had been convicted of certain crimes over the past five years, the 170 serious crimes for which the city requires law enforcement officials to turn over those detained to immigration enforcement agents. Was he prioritizing or discriminating? Weeks away from the deadline for the city budget, the City Council and the mayor are haggling over that point. On Wednesday, 27 of the 51 Council members signed a letter that was delivered electronically to Mr. de Blasio, urging him to provide legal help without restrictions. That is the public defender model currently used by the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, a model studied nationally that since 2013 has provided services primarily for indigent immigrants who have been detained. “We want to step away from rhetoric that one person is more deserving than another in representation,” City Councilman Carlos Menchaca, who represents Brooklyn and is the lead signatory, said in an interview on Monday. In the letter, provided to The New York Times, the council members questioned the mayor’s commitment to maintaining the free, unfettered Family Unity model, let alone fund it. “We are concerned that the exclusion you propose will not only undermine our city’s commitment to due process for all but will also perpetuate the failures and racial disparities that pervade our criminal justice system,” the letter said.

"The most striking aspect of last Thursday’s opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which rejected the Trump administration’s latest effort to revive its travel ban for individuals from six predominantly Muslim countries, was its reliance on Donald Trump’s own words as candidate, president-elect and president. The court leaned particularly heavily on his now-famous campaign statement that he was “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The government’s lawyers argued that those words had no bearing on the order’s lawfulness, but the court disagreed. The president’s words, the court found, led to only one conclusion: The order was driven by “religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination,” not a genuine national-security need (as the order claimed), and was thus most likely unconstitutional. What weight, if any, should the words of a United States president have in court? It’s not a question the Supreme Court has ever answered. But if the Trump administration asks the court to hear this case, and the court agrees to do so, the outcome will almost certainly turn on this issue. I believe the correct view is that the speech of a candidate or even a president should not ordinarily be relevant to a court’s determination of the meaning or lawfulness of government action. This is especially true when the words of the president conflict with executive-branch positions offered in other, more authoritative settings and documents. But there is an exception to this rule: namely, when presidential speech supplies evidence of intent or purpose of established legal relevance — for example, when assessing a claim of religious discrimination. Thus the Fourth Circuit was right to rely on Mr. Trump’s words in rejecting the administration’s effort to revive its travel ban, and the Supreme Court should follow suit. "
"The New York Times offered buyouts to its newsroom employees on Wednesday, aiming to reduce layers of editing and requiring more of the editors who remain. In a memo to the newsroom, Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and Joseph Kahn, the managing editor, said the current system of copy editors and “backfielders” who assign and shape articles would be replaced with a single group of editors who would be responsible for all aspects of an article. Another editor would be “looking over their shoulders before publication.” “Our goal is to significantly shift the balance of editors to reporters at The Times, giving us more on-the-ground journalists developing original work than ever before,” they said in the memo. In a separate memo, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher, said the company would be eliminating the position of public editor, which was established to receive reader complaints and question Times journalists on how they make decisions. Liz Spayd, the current public editor, will leave The Times on Friday. The buyouts are meant primarily for editors, but reporters and others in the newsroom will also be able to apply for them, the memo said. Mr. Baquet and Mr. Kahn said that the savings generated by the reduction in editing layers would be used to hire as many as 100 more journalists. The Times would turn to layoffs if not enough people volunteer for buyouts, Mr. Baquet and Mr. Kahn said in the memo. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. Three decades ago, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt wrote an essay that would eventually become widely read — and that today offers insight into President Trump. The work was called, “On B.S.” (Well, not quite, but this is a family newsletter.) Matthew Yglesias of Vox published a long reflection on Frankfurt and President Trump yesterday, and it began like so: “Donald Trump says a lot of things that aren’t true, often shamelessly so, and it’s tempting to call him a liar. But that’s not quite right.” A lie is a conscious effort to mislead someone, usually in the service of persuasion. But Trump often isn’t trying to persuade. He is instead creating a separate language meant to distinguish his allies from his enemies. A Trump lie, Yglesias writes, is “a test to see who around him will debase themselves to repeat it blindly.” It’s a smart essay, and I encourage you to read it. But I do think the B.S. Theory of Trump gives short shrift to one aspect of his lies. Even if they are not meant to persuade, they are typically intended to distract people from reality. That is, his untruths about the House’s health care bill aren’t merely intended to distinguish his supporters from his opponents. They are also intended to obscure the reality that the bill would deprive millions of people of health insurance. His untruths about his tax plan, immigrants, voter fraud, crime and many other subjects serve a similar purpose. They attempt to create enough confusion about basic facts that Trump’s preferred policies, and his kleptocratic approach to government, can start to sound sensible. In reality, those policies would benefit the affluent (starting with his own family) at the expense of most Americans. In this way, Trump’s untruths resemble classic lies. They aren’t merely unconcerned with truth. They are opposed to it. A crucial response, insufficient though it may be, is to document the falseness of his statements with simple evidence. Speaking of which: Kate Shaw, a legal scholar, writes in today’s Times about how federal judges have held Trump accountable for some of his lies about immigration, and Avik Roy touches on some of his lies about health care. Yesterday’s newsletter focused on Trump’s abandonment of European allies, and Ross Douthat, Tom Friedman and the Editorial Board all offer takes on that topic today. "
"SOFIA, Bulgaria — Our reading diet these days is filled with anniversaries and scandals. This year, bookstores are being invaded by an army of new books related to the centenary of the Russian Revolution. And on the scandal front, not a day seems to pass without a new disturbing, inflammatory indignity besmirching the Trump administration. Could the newly published books on the Bolshevik Revolution help us make sense of President Trump’s Russia-centered scandals? You might be surprised. Many contemporary writings see the 1917 revolution as little more than a German plot. This view is particularly popular now in Russia itself, where “revolution” is considered a dirty word. People are rarely content to explain revolutions by using commonplace political logic. History’s changing events are interpreted as either something inevitable like the work of God or the intervention of a foreign power. And with Communism kaput, many of the popular histories of the Russian Revolution have now focused their attention from the rise of the masses toward espionage narratives that show how the Germans, as Winston Churchill put it, “transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland to Russia.” Now, as many people see Mr. Trump’s election victory as little more than the effect of a Russian plot, if we understand why the Germans helped the Bolsheviks in 1917 and what happened after, we could get a better grasp on why Moscow might have been tempted to help the Trump campaign in 2016 and what we can expect next. The 1917 analogy suggests that Russia intervened in American politics because of a Hillary Clinton they loathed rather than a Donald Trump they liked. For sure, the kaiser’s Germany had no sympathy for Vladimir Lenin’s revolutionary dreams. If the maverick Bolshevik had been German, the authorities would have tossed him in jail. But Lenin was Russian, and the German high command saw Russia’s revolution as helpful to Germany in the war. Likewise, it seems that Moscow’s main goal in 2016 was major disruption over all else. To unduly stress ideological or other links between the Kremlin and the American president would be misleading. "
"Though they live just a half-mile from the Paerdegat Basin in Brooklyn, George and Laura Fishman were spared the kind of damage that upended their neighbors’ lives during Hurricane Sandy. (There were not, for instance, fish in their basement.) But that posed a problem of its own. How, the Fishmans asked themselves, can we prepare for the next one? Should we buy flood insurance? Should we elevate our boiler and water heater? Should we get out altogether? These are not isolated concerns. Communities across the country are confronting the mounting evidence of climate change, even as the Trump administration has rolled back environmental laws and regulations and dismissed members of an important science panel. The New York Times is presenting case studies, and an associated glossary, examining tangible measures in and around New York City to make buildings and infrastructure more resilient in the face of floods, surges, high winds and heavy rains. That effort reaches all the way to a two-story semidetached brick-and-frame house on Avenue M in the Canarsie neighborhood that the Fishmans have owned for 42 years. Canarsie sits on the vast Jamaica Bay. Numerous creeks and basins, like the Paerdegat, penetrate upland from the bay, putting surrounding areas at risk of flooding. Dr. Fishman, 66, is a professor emerita of history at York College in Jamaica, Queens. Mr. Fishman, 68, is a retired middle school teacher and administrator in Brooklyn and Queens. He loves stained glass. Panels with ruby roses and cardinals alternate in windows around the house with panels showing a striped lighthouse and a striped clown fish. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump assailed Democrats and a television comedian on Wednesday in his latest Twitter blasts since returning from an overseas trip in which he had largely abstained from the sort of combative social media postings that helped propel him to the Oval Office and have gotten him in trouble ever since. The president castigated Kathy Griffin, the celebrity comic and author, for posing for a video showing her holding what looks like the severed and bloodied head of Mr. Trump. The video touched off a storm of protests from people on all sides of the political spectrum, which forced Ms. Griffin to apologize, and CNN announced that it would fire her from the annual New Year’s Eve program she has co-hosted. In a statement later in the day, the first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Ms. Griffin’s sanity. “As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,” she said. “When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.” The Trumps had the support of the daughter of the woman the president beat in last year’s election, among others.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The climate change fight has focused largely on cutting emissions. But California is now considering another solution: dirt. Whereas an overabundance of carbon in the air has been disrupting our climate, plants are hungry for the stuff. The Central Valley’s farmlands essentially operate as a vast lung, breathing in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and converting it into plant tissues. That results in less of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere. But the healthier the soil, the more carbon is stored in plants. Enter California’s Healthy Soils Initiative, a statewide program rolling out this summer that is the first of its kind in the country. “I think there’s a growing recognition that the soil beneath our feet has huge potential to sequester carbon,” said Karen Ross, secretary of the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture.

"WASHINGTON — Momentous arguments inside the West Wing over the future of the Paris climate accord became a messy public spectacle on Wednesday, with some aides saying that President Trump had decided to abandon the landmark global warming agreement while others insisted that no decision had been made. Three administration officials with direct knowledge of the intense White House debate said early Wednesday morning that Mr. Trump was expected to withdraw the United States from the 2015 climate change accord that committed nearly every nation to take action to curb the warming of the planet. In addition, three other officials said later Wednesday that they expected him to withdraw from the agreement, though they said that decision could still change. Hours later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had made his decision and would announce it in the Rose Garden at 3 p.m. Thursday. The White House’s legislative affairs office has suggested another route: Sending the Paris agreement to the Senate for ratification as a treaty. Since it would require an impossible two-thirds vote, that alternative would also lead to withdrawal. Other White House insiders disputed those reports, saying that no verdict had been reached. Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, offered only that “I’m hearing from a lot of people, both ways,” and promised a decision “very soon.” With the world watching nervously, the feuding among the president’s aides further exposed the fault lines of a chaotic decision-making process that has swirled around Mr. Trump since he took office.

"LONDON — When Prime Minister Theresa May called an early election in April, there was an air of inevitability about her victory. Some even predicted the biggest landslide in decades in the June 8 vote. No longer. While Mrs. May is still expected to win, the previously yawning gap between her and the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has narrowed, reflecting, experts say, a growing consensus that her campaign has stumbled badly. A more limited win could potentially undermine her authority as she negotiates Britain’s torturous departure from the European Union. One analysis, published Wednesday, predicts that neither major party will win an outright majority, potentially forcing the formation of a messy coalition government. But British pollsters have been among the biggest losers in recent elections — including failing to predict the 2015 general election and, in many cases, getting last year’s Brexit vote wrong. On Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn shook up the race with a last-minute decision to join a televised debate in Cambridge that Mrs. May did not attend. Emboldened after a competent performance in a television event on Monday, Mr. Corbyn sought, before the debate, to portray Mrs. May as weak and evasive for not appearing. “Refusing to join me in Cambridge tonight would be another sign of Theresa May’s weakness, not strength,” Mr. Corbyn, who has been trying to revamp his own image as a weak-kneed pacifist, said in a statement.

"In the first months of his campaign, back when the press and his political opponents still regarded him as a curiosity or a nuisance, Donald Trump was accumulating online fans in surprising places. On the anarchic image board 4chan, he was celebrated as a fellow troll, while on Reddit, a pro-Trump community gained tens of thousands of members, shifting the entire political ecosystem on the platform. So when Trump actually began dominating the Republican primary contest, these two communities were among the first to feel a need to explain why he hadn’t been stopped — and couldn’t be. They answer they hit on was one that has proved to be oddly durable: that Trump was a chess master, a strategic mastermind. At first, this view was typically expressed with a wink. Candidate Trump, his fans explained, was able to juke the entire Republican field because he was thinking six moves ahead, playing the game in the fourth and fifth dimensions — when he was on a roll, in the 10th and 12th. Scott Adams, the creator of “Dilbert,” might have been one of the first to earnestly credit Trump with such incredible strategic foresight, in a late-2015 blog post: “2-D Chess Players Take on a 3-D Chess Master.” Chess-master Trump began as a meme and has evolved as such. Every day, it seems, he is playing a multidimensional chess game on some new plane, from health care to Russia to, of course, the media. During the campaign, chess theory tended to appear when Trump’s actions seemed impossibly strange or inexplicable. Melania Trump’s Republican National Convention speech, which contained passages lifted from a speech by Michelle Obama? A brilliant move to amplify coverage of her speech. “4-D chess once again from Trump,” wrote Paul Joseph Watson, a presenter for Alex Jones’s Infowars, in February, after Trump, by then president, seemed to refer to a terror attack in Sweden that hadn’t happened. “Create controversy over #SwedenIncident — force media to talk about Sweden’s multicultural hell.” As a theory of Trump’s actions, the chess-master meme is notable for its total lack of predictive power. Instead, it acts as an explanatory bridge across the wide abyss between two observable tendencies: that Trump keeps doing unexpected or abnormal things; and that his political opponents, and the media, can’t seem to stop him. Which makes the convergent evolution of a similar mythology among liberals all the more notable. In a marginal but influential liberal vision of the president — prevalent in Twitter-driven coverage and in discursive cable-news segments — his impulsive behavior and impetuousness are recast as steps in some sort of complex playbook. Their version of the theory doesn’t exactly correspond with its counterpart on the right, but the two don’t contradict each other, either. Maybe Trump isn’t a chess master, these liberals might suggest, but he’s at least a studied Machiavellian. In a viral Medium post in January emblematic of this mode of thinking, a Google engineer made the case that Trump’s botched immigration order was a “trial balloon” for a coup: that Trump could make use of the ban’s failure to mark a path to unchecked power. The most common liberal version of the theory is less byzantine. It takes the form of what the journalism professor and critic Jay Rosen has called “distraction theory.” In this line of reasoning, the Trump administration’s production of chaos is not a result of incompetence or venality but, in fact, a series of targeted acts of diversion. These usually take the form of tweets saying something like: “Don’t be distracted by [breaking news story]! Trump is only trying to distract us from [long-simmering news story]! Stay focused.” Such claims are most often made about Russia: For example, distraction-master Trump diverted unwanted attention from that story in March by claiming that he was wiretapped by President Obama. The approach doubles as press criticism, which gets something right on the way to getting something wrong — identifying journalistic market failures but crediting them to a constantly unfolding and infinitely complex external master plan.

"In the film “The Manchurian Candidate” — the true and only John Frankenheimer version, not the misbegotten remake — an international operation conspires to place a Communist agent in the White House. The mechanism is complicated, involving brainwashing, fake heroism and an assassination scheme, but the core conceit has a distinctive genius: The agent of influence the Communists intend to raise to the presidency is basically a Joseph McCarthy figure — a right-wing politician named Johnny Iselin who rants about Red infiltrators even as he’s actually being manipulated himself, by a Machiavellian wife who takes her orders from Moscow or Beijing. Sadly for this newspaper’s web traffic, this will not be a column about the mounting evidence linking Melania Trump to Kremlin handlers, the timeline that proves that she’s been running her husband as a Russian agent since the 1990s or the deep Cold War-era connections between her Slovenian circle and the K.G.B. Instead, I want to talk about the striking contrast between Donald Trump’s strange Russian romance and the way that the Communists in Frankenheimer’s movie went about their America-subverting scheme. In “The Manchurian Candidate,” the whole point of the story is that the plot is secret, designed so that its intended outcome is the last thing that Americans expect. They’re being duped into voting for a man who they think is the most hawkish of Russia hawks, when all the while he’s being maneuvered into betraying America to the Comintern. In Trump’s campaign for the presidency, by contrast, the Russian romance was not only out in the open, it was a deliberate selling point, which the candidate himself consistently brought up and emphasized and touted. Any American voter who paid attention knew that Trump was a Russia dove, that he intended to seek a détente with Moscow, that he wanted to make some sort of Great Deal with Vladimir Putin and inaugurate a new era of great power cooperation. He won the Republican primary on that position. He won the Electoral College on that position. The public had every reason to understand that he was unusually pro-Russia, and in the necessary numbers they voted for him anyway. Now it may be, as many postelection commentaries have argued, that the public was underinformed about the various connections between Trump’s campaign staff and Russia’s oligarchic-intelligence complex, and that a thorough airing of Trumpworld’s ties would have made his pro-détente rhetoric seem more sinister.

"The tectonic plates of Europe are shifting, and President Trump is at the heart of this upheaval. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany bluntly made that point on Sunday when she said, “The times in which we could rely fully on others — they are somewhat over,” and the result is that “we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands.” With that line, it became clear that the United States is no longer the reliable partner her country and the rest of Europe have long depended on. Since World War II, the United States led the way in building a new international order rooted in NATO and the European Union as well as a belief in democracy and free markets. Britain, France and Germany were central to that effort, which for 70 years kept the peace and delivered prosperity to millions of people while standing firm against the Soviet threat, helping end the Bosnian War and combating extremism in Afghanistan. This trans-Atlantic partnership is still vital. But how, and how well, it will function as American leadership recedes is unclear. So far, no one is talking about dissolving NATO; Europe still depends for its security on America’s nuclear and conventional arsenals. But Ms. Merkel’s remarks underscored profound divisions between Europe and the United States that have one clear beneficiary, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who has longed for the alliance, Moscow’s Cold War adversary, to unravel. Before Mr. Trump attended his first meetings of NATO and the Group of 7 last week, European leaders hoped they could bring him around on critical issues. That now seems like a pipe dream. Mr. Trump doubled-down on his most destructive campaign impulses by hectoring the other members at length for what he called their insufficient levels of military spending, and by refusing to reaffirm NATO’s bedrock mutual defense commitment. He also broke with the allies on other issues. He offered a more conciliatory line on Russia and refused, despite their entreaties, to endorse the Paris agreement on climate change. When he returned home, Mr. Trump stoked the fires more, complaining in a tweet that Germany pays “far less than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change.” His remarks showed no appreciation for how NATO works, how Ms. Merkel is in fact pushing her country to spend more on defense — and, more generally, how comments like this insult a trusted ally.

"SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump’s trip to Europe was truly historic. He left our most important allies there so uncertain about America’s commitment to their security from Russia and to shared values on trade and climate change that German leader Angela Merkel was prompted to tell her countrymen that Europe’s days of relying on America are “over to a certain extent,” and therefore Germany and its European allies “really must take our fate into our own hands.” No U.S. president before had ever put a crack in the Atlantic alliance on his inaugural tour. Historic. Merkel is just the first major leader to say out loud what every American ally is now realizing: America is under new management. “Who is America today?” is the first question I’ve been asked on each stop through New Zealand, Australia and South Korea. My answer: We’re not the U.S.A. anymore. We’re the new U.A.E.: the United American Emirate. We have an emir. His name is Donald. We have a crown prince. His name is Jared. We have a crown princess. Her name is Ivanka. We have a consultative council (Congress) that rubber-stamps whatever the emir wants. And like any good monarchy, our ruling family sees no conflict of interest between its personal businesses and those of the state. So any lingering Kennedyesque thoughts about us should be banished, I explained. Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay no price, bear no burden, meet no hardship, support no friend, oppose no foe to assure the success of liberty — unless we’re paid in advance. And we take cash, checks, gold, Visa, American Express, Bitcoin and memberships in Mar-a-Lago. The Trump doctrine is very simple: There are just four threats in the world: terrorists who will kill us, immigrants who will rape us or take our jobs, importers and exporters who will take our industries — and North Korea. Threats to democracy, free trade, the environment and human rights are no longer on our menu. Therefore, no matter how unsavory you are as a foreign leader, you can be the United American Emirate’s best friend if you: 1.) Pay us by buying our weapons. I warn you, though, Saudi Arabia has set the bar very high, starting at $110 billion. "
"BEIJING — When he assumed power in 2013, President Xi Jinping of China tried to court one of America’s main Asian allies, South Korea. It worked for a while. Then the relationship soured. South Korea’s president at the time, Park Geun-hye, showed great respect for Mr. Xi, appearing shoulder to shoulder with him at a military parade in Tiananmen Square, the only American ally to do so. Then she turned on Mr. Xi when he declined to rein in North Korea as much as she had expected. Now Mr. Xi is trying again, wooing South Korea’s new leader, Moon Jae-in, and still hoping to chip away at the American alliance with South Korea and fortify China’s position in Northeast Asia. Mr. Moon, a proponent of engagement with North Korea, is a more natural friend for Mr. Xi than the conservative Ms. Park, who is in jail facing corruption charges. As North Korea steps up the frequency of its missile tests and prepares for a sixth nuclear test, it has become more important for China to make common cause with South Korea if it wants to find a diplomatic solution to the standoff with the North, as Beijing insists that it does. China’s relationship with North Korea, its ostensible ally, is at a ragged low, and its ties with the South are in poor shape. All at once, Beijing is at odds with both Koreas. "
"Megyn Kelly left her job at Fox News two weeks before Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. In the nearly four and a half months since, there has been, well, quite a bit of news to cover. But Ms. Kelly has not exactly been aching to cover it. Her time away from the television studio, she said, has been “awesome.” It has not only provided her a breather from a news cycle that has been dominated by Mr. Trump, but has also given her a breather from being tossed around at the center of a news cycle, courtesy of Mr. Trump. “It’s just nice to not be at the pointy point of the spear for every news story he generated,” she said in a recent phone interview. Oh, and a few other things have happened, like the death this month of Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chairman, and the scrambling of that network’s prime-time lineup — of which she was once an integral part. But more on that in a bit.

"The 2000s were thrilling here in America, in the most strictly neutral sense of the word — sensation after sensation, the fall of the towers, two wars, financial collapse, natural disaster, fear. Adults responded, very sanely one could argue, by devoting the period to reading about teenage vampires. (Or waiting on Platform 9¾ for the next train to Hogwarts.) Then things slowly stabilized, and perhaps our mood shifted too. The immense success of “Gone Girl” in 2012 seemed to consolidate that sense: The most popular novels could be about grown-ups again. Less frightened that our houses might be taken, we began to wonder instead who might hurt us while we were inside them. But this summer and fall will bring, depending on the vicissitudes of publishing industry timing, the last of those Obama-era thrillers. What are people going to read during a Donald Trump administration? Precisely how thrilling will these years prove? And just how much will we long to escape them? What a shame it would be to revert to the reading habits of the “Twilight” age, if it meant missing out on books as subtle, brilliant and mature as Karen Dionne’s newest novel, THE MARSH KING’S DAUGHTER (Putnam, $26). It’s the narrative of Helena, the child of a teenager and her abductor, who kept them hidden for years in a beautiful lost corner of Michigan. “I didn’t know we were captives until we were not,” Helena says. Her understanding of the world during that time comes largely from a stack of old National Geographic magazines and what her father — a master tracker and hunter named Jacob, part Ojibwa, charismatic, domineering, loving and cruel — teaches her to believe. The novel begins 15 years after her escape, Helena having made a life for herself, with a family and a small business selling jam made with cattails, a wisp of wilderness knowledge obscure enough to appeal to hipsters, a nice metaphor for the chasm between her childhood and theirs. Then her father escapes from prison, killing two guards. Helena immediately thinks of her daughters. She knows which one he would take, she realizes, and this horrifying unbidden thought decides her. “If anyone is going to catch my father and return him to prison, it’s me. No one is my father’s equal when it comes to navigating the wilderness, but I’m close.” The book adopts a plaited structure, with alternating chapters set in the past and the present, the former relating the tale of Helena’s flight from the marsh where she grew up, the latter her return to it to search for the man who raised her.

"JACKSON, Miss. — Hoyt Cantrell drove a truck for more than 20 years before seizures — 23 of them since 2009 — cost him his livelihood. His two-bedroom house in the heart of this Southern state capital is partly boarded up, with no running water or electricity, but he cannot afford much better. He has tried hard to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance and food stamps. So far, he has failed. To President Trump, people like Mr. Cantrell are the exceptions in the expanding world of American poverty. In the view of his administration, access to food stamps is far too easy, and being on disability is just a matter of finding a friendly judge. The budget that the president has proposed for the coming fiscal year would expand a work requirement for “able-bodied” adults receiving help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, slicing $192 billion over 10 years. He would also trim $70 billion from Social Security’s disability program by tightening access. “We need people to go to work,” said Mick Mulvaney, the White House’s budget director and the proposal’s chief architect. “If you’re on food stamps, and you’re able-bodied, we need you to go to work. If you’re on disability insurance, and you’re not supposed to be — if you’re not truly disabled, we need you to go back to work. We need everybody pulling in the same direction.” Mr. Cantrell, 50, is not surprised that Mr. Trump is trying to make a hard process even harder. “The bigwigs are going to do what they want anyway,” Mr. Cantrell said. “I just live day to day on what God gives me. But it’s hard to do sometimes.” "
"Nearly seven months after the presidential election, pollsters are still trying to answer a question that has rattled trust in their profession: Why did pre-election polls show Hillary Clinton leading Donald J. Trump in the battleground states that decided the presidency? Is political polling fundamentally broken? Or were the errors understandable and correctable? At their annual conference in New Orleans this month, polling experts were inching toward the latter, more optimistic explanation. And there is mounting evidence to support their view. At least three key types of error have emerged as likely contributors to the pro-Clinton bias in pre-election surveys. Undecided voters broke for Mr. Trump in the final days of the race, or in the voting booth. Turnout among Mr. Trump’s supporters was somewhat higher than expected. And state polls, in particular, understated Mr. Trump’s support in the decisive Rust Belt region, in part because those surveys did not adjust for the educational composition of the electorate — a key to the 2016 race. Some of these errors will be easier to fix than others. But all of them seem to be good news for pollsters and others who depend on political surveys. It might seem strange to argue that the polls could miss the result of an election and could still be trusted in the future. But there are some kinds of polling errors that pollsters can accept, even if the public never will. There’s nothing pollsters can do, for example, if undecided voters break for one candidate in the final hours. Even an error that puts more blame on the pollsters might be acceptable, provided it can be fixed. "

"President Trump is said to be considering withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a landmark accord reached in 2015 between 195 countries that seeks to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change by curbing global greenhouse gas emissions. The White House says it has not yet reached a final decision on Paris, and hundreds of corporations and world leaders are lobbying the United States to stay in the pact. Within the administration, some senior officials, including Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, have warned the president that the diplomatic repercussions from leaving could be severe. An American withdrawal would not scuttle the Paris accord, but it could seriously weaken global efforts to avoid drastic climate change. Here’s a primer on how the Paris agreement works — and what could happen if the United States leaves. Under the Paris agreement, every country submitted an individual plan to tackle its greenhouse gas emissions and then agreed to meet regularly to review their progress and prod one another to ratchet up their efforts as the years went by. Unlike its predecessor treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris deal was intended to be nonbinding, so that countries could tailor their climate plans to their domestic situations and alter them as circumstances changed. There are no penalties for falling short of declared targets. The hope was that, through peer pressure and diplomacy, these policies would be strengthened over time. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump said he would announce his decision today on whether or not the U.S. will remain a part of the Paris climate agreement, promising clarity in an issue that has deeply divided his administration. A withdrawal would severely weaken the 2015 accord that committed nearly every nation to take action to slow down global warming. Mr. Trump has said that regulations would hurt the U.S. economy and hinder job creation. Here’s a look at the major players still hoping to sway Mr. Trump’s decision. And while China and the European Union remain committed to the pact, here’s what other countries might do. _____ "

"A majority of Exxon Mobil’s shareholders, in a reversal, have voted in favor of more open and detailed analyses of the risks posed to its business by policies aimed at stemming climate change. Those policies include the goal of the Paris climate agreement to restrict global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Preliminary results announced at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday put the results at 62.3 percent in favor, up from the 38 percent a similar resolution garnered last year. The resolution, which the company’s directors opposed, is nonbinding. But Darren W. Woods, the chief executive, said the board would consider the result because it reflected the view of a majority of shareholders. Investors and groups concerned about climate change submitted similar proposals in the last few years, but Exxon resisted. Increasingly, though, Wall Street and large investors, including fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, two of Exxon’s largest investors, have signaled concerns about the risks to companies whose assets were based in fossil fuels that could lose significant value as climate policies and market forces reduce demand. Exxon would not say how specific funds voted their shares on Wednesday, and Vanguard would not disclose its own vote. A person briefed on BlackRock’s decision said the fund voted with the majority on the proposal. BlackRock voted for a similar proposal earlier this year at Occidental Petroleum, the first time it had opposed company management on such a measure. Three years ago, a group of investors withdrew a similar resolution after Exxon agreed to report details of the risks that stricter limits on carbon emissions would place on its business, becoming the first oil and gas producer to do so. But that report lacked the detail that the resolution’s proponents were seeking. This year, the resolution was led by the New York State Pension Fund and the Church of England investment fund and included dozens of backers like the New York City Retirement Systems. Supporters hailed the decision as sending a powerful message that investors wanted fossil fuel companies to move toward a low-carbon economy, even if President Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris accord. “The burden is now on Exxon Mobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously,” said Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller and trustee of the state’s Common Retirement Fund. Mr. Woods said before the vote that Exxon Mobil believed the risks of climate change were serious and warranted action. But he expressed confidence in the company’s reporting on its long-term financial viability, which indicates that even assuming the 2-degree goal of the accord is met, demand for oil and gas would remain high. “It is a global challenge that requires global participation, and we think the advantage of the Paris framework is that it engages and involves communities and countries all around the world irrespective of their economic development,” he said.

"It is a point of pride for CBS, which has long been viewed as the stable, no-drama network: When it makes a transition, it is done smoothly. When Bob Schieffer handed the reins of “Face the Nation” to John Dickerson in 2015, he did it with the camera rolling and a big grin. The same went for Charles Osgood when he introduced viewers to Jane Pauley as the new anchor of “CBS Sunday Morning” last year. The transfer of power at “CBS Evening News” did not go that way. The news that Scott Pelley would be leaving as that nightly show’s anchor and moving full time to “60 Minutes” spilled into public view unexpectedly Tuesday night after it was reported that Mr. Pelley, while on a reporting assignment, had movers go to his Midtown Manhattan office to start boxing things up. A spate of news reports followed, initiated by The New York Post’s Page Six. CBS confirmed on Wednesday that Mr. Pelley would be making his exit from the show. Currently on assignment in the Middle East, he is expected to return to the broadcast temporarily on Monday. At some point in the next few weeks, the CBS veteran Anthony Mason will take his place on an interim basis, a spokeswoman for the network said. No permanent successor has been chosen, and a search for a new anchor is underway. Both management and Mr. Pelley had been preparing for his departure from the evening newscast for months, and the move was made with a couple of points in mind: “60 Minutes,” which is entering its 50th season and enjoying a hot hand, will get a full-time correspondent who can devote himself to the newsmagazine without the distractions of a second job. Ratings were another factor: Mr. Pelley’s evening news show has long been in third place, and he has fallen further behind his two main competitors in the ratings this season. The evening news assignments — which were once filled, with stature and glamour, by Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather — are not what they once were. Network executives are far more dedicated to morning news shows, where the star power is bright — with personalities like Gayle King, Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose and George Stephanopoulos — and the profits are huge.

"The president offered Americans a bit of levity on Wednesday morning amid his broadsides about the Russia investigation and complaints about fake news, closing out a busy day of tweeting with the message, “Despite the constant negative press covfefe.” Though it spawned some amusing responses, the tweet was not appreciably stranger than most of the president’s tweets, which frequently feature misspellings, unconventional capitalization and unusual use of quotation marks. In fact, the “covfefe” gaffe was just the latest of Mr. Trump’s tweets to bear an uncanny resemblance to certain strains of absurdist Twitter comedy. Sometime in the early 2010s, a style of humor marked by bizarre spelling, grammar and subject matter became popular on Twitter. Ultimately known as “weird Twitter,” it was tough to define — talking about weird Twitter was a surefire way to get made fun of by weird Twitter — but easy to spot. Practitioners included @dril, who remains anonymous, and Patricia Lockwood, a poet and the author of the recent memoir “Priestdaddy.” Along with @horse_ebooks, an account that tweeted seemingly random but frequently entertaining snippets of text, the weird Twitter comedians presided over the emergence of a new and ridiculous form of humor. While the heyday of weird Twitter is probably over (the form may have reached peak awareness in 2013, with an oral history by John Herrman and Katie Notopoulous at BuzzFeed), its spirit lives on in high-concept humor accounts like @SICKOFWOLVES, the online performance art of Chuck Tingle — and, most oddly, in the early-morning missives of President Trump. Mr. Trump isn’t the first politician to exhibit weird Twitter characteristics — weird Twitter denizens sometimes counted Senator Chuck Grassley as one of their own for tweets like this: "

For one thing, though they could cause much misery, those are reversible actions. What they will remember is what we did or did not do about global warming. They will remember because they will be living either in a world that has surmounted this challenge, or one that has descended into chaos because we — the people of today — let this tragedy unfold.

"To the Editor: “Show HUD’s Budget Cuts the Door” (editorial, May 30) was right on the money, or in this case, the lack thereof. We need to stop calling the Trump proposal the “skinny budget.” This isn’t a healthy slimming of government; it’s a starvation diet. Amply funding health care for people in need, housing for homeless people and basic nutrition for hungry kids isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing. Cutting those programs will cost more money in the long run because people without coverage still get sick, shelters actually cost more than housing subsidies and hungry kids lead to terrible outcomes. Budgets are moral documents showing what we care about most — which in this case might be tax cuts for the most prosperous. They are also investments in our future. This mean budget seeks to invest far too little and costs us far too much. JEFF FOREMAN, NEW YORK The writer is policy director of Care for the Homeless.

"For a little while, it looked as if Kathy Griffin was getting exactly what she wanted. On Tuesday afternoon, an image appeared online of the actress posing with a mask styled to look like the severed, bloody head of President Trump. It was inevitable that the violent image, taken by the photographer Tyler Shields, would get a reaction. It did — but the response was explosive, and almost unanimously negative. By Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Griffin had been condemned by the president and fired as co-host of CNN’s New Year’s Eve program. “CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year’s Eve program,” the network tweeted. A spokeswoman said that there would be no additional comment. The image of Ms. Griffin had provoked howls of outrage from Mr. Trump’s supporters and critics alike when it first appeared on Tuesday. Melania Trump, the first lady, said the image was “simply wrong.” Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, called it “disgusting but not surprising”; Chelsea Clinton said it was “vile and wrong.” Even Ms. Griffin’s entertainment industry colleagues, including CNN’s Anderson Cooper, who had hosted the network’s New Year’s Eve broadcast with her, shook their heads in disgust. Within hours on Tuesday, Ms. Griffin, who self-deprecatingly acknowledged her middling celebrity in a reality show “My Life on the D-List,” posted a video apology to Twitter. “I went way too far,” Ms. Griffin said. “The image is too disturbing, I understand how it affects people. It wasn’t funny. I get it.” She added that she would ask the photographer to take down the image — a futile gesture given that the picture had already spread far and wide — and begged for forgiveness. Her apology did little to appease Mr. Trump, who slammed the actress in a tweet Wednesday morning, saying that Ms. Griffin should be “ashamed of herself.” Mr. Trump has frequently used Twitter to lash out at his fellow celebrities, distracting from the more substantive issues dogging him. (On Tuesday night, he again found himself the subject of the popular Twitter imagination when he tweeted a new word, “covfefe.”) On Tuesday, as the online outrage exploded, even the United States Secret Service seemed to refer to Ms. Griffin’s violent photos in a pair of pointed tweets. In an earlier tweet, Ms. Griffin had appeared to try to mitigate the impact of the image, saying, “OBVIOUSLY, I do not condone ANY violence by my fans or others to anyone, ever! I’m merely mocking the mocker in chief.” That post was later deleted. "
"BERLIN — Exit President Trump, offending almost everyone. Enter China, eager to talk. In a geopolitical whirl this week, the new American president had barely left Europe to face his Russia troubles at home before Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Continent’s No. 1 leader, suggested that Mr. Trump’s America was no longer a reliably close ally. An outcry ensued, with analysts on both sides of the Atlantic talking of an epochal shift in relations. And that was even before reports began to emerge from the White House on Wednesday that Mr. Trump was expected to withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. But as Ms. Merkel’s busy diplomatic schedule this week seemed to indicate, she might have other options. On Monday and Tuesday, Ms. Merkel hosted a big Indian government delegation, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom her spokesman made a point of calling a “reliable partner.” Then, on Wednesday, the chancellor welcomed Li Keqiang, the prime minister of China. The timing of the visits has intensified speculation that in the current febrile state of global politics, China in particular may prove a steadier ally on climate change and free trade than Mr. Trump, even if it comes with its own tensions and complexities. “Trump’s turn away from America’s classic leading role is having a destabilizing effect,” wrote Henrik Müller, a professor at Technical University of Dortmund, in his weekly column on the global economy for Der Spiegel. “One consequence: Global economic policy is sorting out in a new way. The other two big economies — the E.U. and China — are seeking new partners to work on the international problems.” "
"HARTFORD — Even in ordinary productions of George Bernard Shaw’s “Heartbreak House,” the arrival of Boss Mangan in the middle of the first act changes the temperature of the play completely. Up to that point, Shaw has been busy exposing us to two breeds of ineffectual English elites, circa 1914: the cultured but idle bohemian class, represented by Hesione Hushabye (partly based on Virginia Woolf), and the horsy, empty-headed aristocracy represented by her sister, Lady Utterword. The bohemians have souls, the aristocrats power, and neither knows what to do with them. Mangan’s entrance introduces a new and loathsome figure to these late Edwardians: the “practical business man.” He is, Shaw writes in his preface, one of those “poor devils” who became rich “by placing their personal interests before those of the country” and thus proved “not only that they were useless for public work, but that in a well-ordered nation they would never have been allowed to control private enterprise.” That it is probably impossible not to think of President Trump when you read those words is a tribute to Shaw’s insight into the workings of the world, which goes so deep as to seem oracular. That it is completely impossible not to think of President Trump when you see Hartford Stage’s eye-opening revival of the play is a tribute to its wig designer, Jason Allen, who has put the character in a hideous yellow comb-over. Additional credit, of course, goes to the actor, Andrew Long, who at various points approximates Mr. Trump’s characteristic shrug-smirk-wince and his familiar seesaw of aggression and petulance. Ilona Somogyi, the costume designer, helps, too, by hemming the sleeves on Mangan’s frock coat so as to make his hands seem the size of credit cards. The Trumpification of Mangan is the revival’s grand gesture, and a sign that the director, Darko Tresnjak, currently represented on Broadway by “Anastasia,” is anxious to make a case for the continued relevance of this century-old Shaw work. It also vivifies a production that, until the reveal, takes its time getting started. That is partly Shaw’s doing: In establishing the “pretty and amiable voluptuaries” assembled in the peculiar, ship-shaped house in the Sussex countryside where the play takes place, he is simulating the moral vacuum that allowed bosses like Mangan to thrive, and that helped create the conditions for World War I. That vacuum is represented theatrically by the drawing-room-comedy conventions that set the plot in motion. The glamorous, witchy Hesione (Charlotte Parry) has invited to the house a young, impoverished friend, Ellie Dunn (Dani De Waal), with the aim of persuading her not to marry Mangan. A series of mistaken identities involving Hesione’s husband and Ellie’s father establishes a blithe mood, albeit with typical Shavian grounding in the realities of gender and money and class. Romantic attachment and disappointment are presented as mirror images of social attachment and disappointment, a stance that, were it not for the jokes, would seem almost Chekhovian. (The play’s subtitle is “A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes.”) "
"WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is planning to create a political action committee, the most concrete sign yet that he intends to remain active in the Democratic Party and is considering a presidential bid in 2020. The “American Possibilities” PAC, which Mr. Biden intends to unveil on Thursday, will offer the former vice president a platform he can use to nurture relationships with donors, travel on behalf of the party and contribute to candidates in the two governor’s races in November and in next year’s midterm elections. He has tapped a former aide in his vice-presidential office and a veteran of President Barack Obama’s White House campaigns, Greg Schultz, to help lead it. By creating a political organization, Mr. Biden, 74, is also sending an unmistakable message to the many other Democrats eyeing the White House that he is not planning to quietly recede into retirement. “Biden has a lot of support out there, and this gives him a way to grow that support while also helping Democrats win and build the party,” said Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic strategist who was not privy to the planning of the PAC.

"After last year’s election, Facebook came in for a drubbing for its role in propagating misinformation — or “fake news,” as we called it back then, before the term became a catchall designation for any news you don’t like. The criticism was well placed: Facebook is the world’s most popular social network, and millions of people look to it daily for news. But the focus on Facebook let another social network off the hook. I speak of my daily addiction, Twitter. Though the 140-character network favored by President Trump is far smaller than Facebook, it is used heavily by people in media and thus exerts perhaps an even greater sway on the news business. That’s an issue because Twitter is making the news dumber. The service is insidery and clubby. It exacerbates groupthink. It prizes pundit-ready quips over substantive debate, and it tends to elevate the silly over the serious — for several sleepless hours this week it was captivated by “covfefe,” which was essentially a brouhaha over a typo. But the biggest problem with Twitter’s place in the news is its role in the production and dissemination of propaganda and misinformation. It keeps pushing conspiracy theories — and because lots of people in the media, not to mention many news consumers, don’t quite understand how it works, the precise mechanism is worth digging into. We recently saw the mechanism in action when another baseless conspiracy theory rose to the top of the news: The idea that the murder last year of Seth Rich, a staff member at the Democratic National Committee, was linked, somehow, to the leaking of Clinton campaign emails. The Fox News host Sean Hannity pushed the theory the loudest, but it was groups on Twitter — or, more specifically, bots on Twitter — that were first to the story and helped make it huge. "
"With a week to sift through the Trump administration’s first full-fledged budget proposal, two inescapable realities have come into sharper focus: the enormous magnitude of the desired cuts in many domestic programs and an utter disdain for numerical integrity. First, no budget in my 40 years of following fiscal policy has attempted to reallocate outlays as radically as this budget does. Most of the commentary has focused on the cumulative spending changes over the next decade; look instead at the proposed outlays for 2027 to understand the full extent of the proposed shifts. As the chart below shows, defense receives an increase, Medicare and Social Security retirement are left almost entirely unchanged and pretty much everything else is massively trimmed. (All projected changes are in relation to current law, and these figures are not adjusted for inflation, making the effective cuts from today’s spending levels that much greater.) Not all of the reductions are immediately evident in the document released by the Office of Management and Budget. In particular, much has been made of the $616 billion of Medicaid cuts. What the press has sometimes missed (because the Trump administration hid the numbers) is that the $616 billion is on top of $834 billion of Medicaid reductions in the Republican health care legislation.

"WASHINGTON — The United States has started arming Syrian Kurds with heavy machine guns, antitank weapons and other arms, a critical step in preparing a pivotal part of the force that will carry out the final assault on the Islamic State’s de facto capital of Raqqa, Pentagon officials said. The weapons deliveries follow the Trump administration’s decision earlier in May to arm the American-backed Kurdish militias over the objections of Turkey, an important NATO ally that considers the Kurdish fighters to be terrorists. “The U.S.-led coalition has begun issuing arms and equipment to Kurdish elements of the S.D.F.,” Col. Ryan S. Dillon, a military spokesman in Baghdad, said in an email on Tuesday, using the abbreviation for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a combination of mostly Syrian Kurdish and Arab militias. Colonel Dillon said the equipment provided included “small arms, ammunition, heavy machine guns” and antitank weapons to use against “heavily armored vehicle-borne I.E.D.s,” or improvised explosive devices. NBC News first reported that the arms shipments had begun. American military commanders have long argued that arming the People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., a Kurdish militia fighting alongside Syrian Arab forces against the Islamic State, is the fastest way to seize Raqqa.

"GREER, S.C. — No matter that this small Southern city sits squarely in the middle of Trump country: The president, with his criticism of German trade policy, was setting off alarm bells in the mind of Mayor Richard W. Danner. President Trump, on his recent trip to Europe, reportedly declared the Germans “bad, very bad” on trade; Greer’s City Hall sits mere miles from a BMW automobile plant that employs about 8,800 people. And so after Mr. Danner read the news here, he quickly organized a call with Chamber of Commerce officials, who on Tuesday brainstormed ways to reassure BMW executives that they in fact considered them to be good. Very good. “There was a real sense of urgency that we need to be clear to BMW and to anyone else who would listen that we can’t take this kind of rhetoric lightly,” said Mr. Danner, who was first elected to Greer’s nonpartisan mayor’s office in 1999. “For us, this isn’t a political issue. This is a matter of livelihoods and of a regional economy and a lot of other things that are going on here.” Mr. Trump’s brewing feud with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on trade policy — which included an early-morning tweet Tuesday bemoaning “a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany” — has struck a disquieting chord in thriving Southern areas like this one. These places have opened themselves to global trade, and particularly welcomed German auto manufacturers, considering them a gold standard of prestige and economic stimulus. But the same areas have also proved to be reliable bases of support for Mr. Trump, underscoring the unresolved tension between globalist and protectionist tendencies within both the administration and the broader Trump coalition. In few places is the tension more evident than South Carolina. The current governor, Henry McMaster, a Republican, was an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump. The previous governor, Nikki R. Haley, made attracting foreign and outside investment a central theme of her tenure, aggressively marketing the state’s low-tax and anti-union policies to potential manufacturers. Ms. Haley, a Republican, now serves as Mr. Trump’s envoy to the United Nations. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump welcomed the prime minister of Vietnam to the Oval Office on Wednesday, cutting business deals and discussing the transfer of a Coast Guard cutter to a onetime enemy that the United States now views as a front-line defender against an expansionist China. It was Mr. Trump’s first meeting with the prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and the president had warm words for his guest, despite having raised concerns within the Vietnamese government on both economic and security fronts early in his administration. Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade pact struck by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of which Vietnam is a member and would be a major beneficiary. The president has also relaxed the pressure on China in return for its help in curbing North Korea, which has prompted concerns among Vietnam and its neighbors that the United States might not be as quick to thwart Beijing’s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. “Prime Minister Phuc has done a spectacular job in Vietnam, led so many different categories in trade and other things,” Mr. Trump told reporters before their meeting. “We’re going to be discussing trade. We’re going to be discussing North Korea. We have many things to talk about and we look forward to being together, very much so.” Mr. Trump made no mention of Vietnam’s human rights abuses, which include the detention of dissident bloggers and religious activists, and have become the subject of persistent interest on Capitol Hill.

"WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, who have spent the past few months slowly figuring out the rhythm of post-White House life, have taken some time to invest in local real estate: They just spent $8.1 million to buy the mansion they’ve been renting in an exclusive neighborhood here. Last May, the Obamas decided to lease the 8,200-square-foot Tudor-style mansion in Kalorama, a Washington neighborhood that has long been home to diplomats, lobbyists, politicians and the occasional spy. The wealthy enclave is especially crowded lately: President Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson have all moved into Kalorama in recent months. The Obamas purchased the nine-bedroom home through a holding company they control, according to Washington property records posted on Wednesday. The property was previously owned by Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary to Bill Clinton who is now the top communications official for the National Football League. The sale, reported by The Chicago Sun-Times, was confirmed by Kevin Lewis, Mr. Obama’s spokesman. “Given that President and Mrs. Obama will be in Washington for at least another two and a half years, it made sense for them to buy a home rather than continuing to rent property,” Mr. Lewis said in an email. The couple’s younger daughter, Sasha, is still in high school. For the short term, at least, she will tether the Obamas to a heavily Democratic city where people are still reeling from the arrival of the Trump administration. The family has largely kept a low profile here, staying out of the political fray. But both Mr. and Mrs. Obama have traveled extensively in recent weeks. And without mentioning his name, the Obamas have either subtly taken aim at Trump policies or basked in their post-White House popularity. Last week, Mr. Obama was greeted warmly by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in a visit to Berlin — a stark contrast to the cool reception Mr. Trump received from European leaders hours later in Brussels. And in recent speeches, Mrs. Obama has hinted at taking on a more vocal role in politics. "
"Senators expect the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to testify next week about his conversations with President Trump, congressional officials said on Wednesday, setting up a test of the White House’s willingness to cooperate with investigations into Mr. Trump’s associates. Putting the highly anticipated hearing on the calendar would force Mr. Trump to decide whether to invoke executive privilege and try to prevent Mr. Comey from testifying. Mr. Comey is expected to be asked about several conversations he had with the president, including one in which he says Mr. Trump encouraged him to stop investigating his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Separately, the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas on Wednesday to Mr. Flynn and the president’s longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for documents and their testimony. And in an unusual move, the Republican chairman of the House panel — who has recused himself from leading the investigation — unilaterally issued a series of subpoenas to the intelligence community. The chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, is seeking information about how Obama administration officials handled sensitive information about Trump associates. But Mr. Comey’s testimony would be the most sensational moment to date in a controversy that has engulfed the Trump administration from its beginning. Congress and a Justice Department special counsel are investigating whether Mr. Trump’s associates colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. Courts have recognized a president’s constitutional right to keep his discussions a secret in most instances. A White House spokeswoman had no comment on whether Mr. Trump planned to try to block Mr. Comey’s testimony. It is a delicate decision with political and legal consequences. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump is considering reversing major pieces of the Obama administration’s opening with Cuba and reinstating limits on travel and commerce, citing human rights abuses by the Castro government as justification for a more punitive approach. Mr. Trump wants to announce the changes in Miami as early as June and deliver on a campaign promise that remains a cherished demand for the politically conservative Cuban-American exile community, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But he has not made a final decision on the steps he will take because of internal disagreements within his administration over how far to go in unwinding one of President Barack Obama’s most significant foreign policy achievements. Clamping down on engagement with Cuba would be a high-profile way for Mr. Trump to showcase a stark break with his predecessor and to fulfill a pledge, delivered during a speech in Miami in September, to a crucial constituency that disproportionately supported him. It would also enable the president to reward the loyalty of Cuban-American lawmakers who have been agitating for a harder line on Cuba, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, both Republicans of Florida. But as the White House has sought to formulate a series of steps for Mr. Trump to announce, a split has emerged over rolling back a policy that many senior officials privately agree has been an improvement on the Cold War dynamic that shaped relations with Cuba in the past. In addition to the revival of diplomatic relations for the first time in a half-century and liberalized rules for trade, travel and commerce, the new approach has paved the way for cooperation in intelligence-sharing, drug interdiction, scientific research and a host of other areas. “A lot of the bureaucracy has been resisting a complete rollback” of Mr. Obama’s policy, said Christopher Sabatini, a Latin America specialist and executive director of Global Americans, a research organization. “Trump is the ‘Art of the Deal’ guy, and there’s no deal to be had here if they reverse the entire policy.” The dilemma is a familiar one for the president, who built his campaign and political persona around bold, contrarian policy pronouncements like building a wall on the southern border, instituting a Muslim ban and canceling the Paris climate accord, only to see his hopes for quick and simple action scuttled by thorny questions of law and policy, and resistance from the business community.

"WASHINGTON — There was a time in the not-too-distant past when President Trump refrained from flamethrowing messages on Twitter. That time is over. Never mind that his aides have asked him to stop. Never mind that now the lawyers have told him to stop. Even though his White House has been warned that tweets could be used as evidence against him, Mr. Trump has made clear in the days after returning from a largely Twitter-free overseas trip that he fully intends to stick to his favorite means of communication. Since the weekend, he has gone after favorite targets, like the “fake news” media, Congress and Hillary Clinton, and even some new ones, like Germany and the comic Kathy Griffin. He denounced the “witch hunt” investigations into contacts between his associates and Russia. And he fomented a worldwide mystery with a middle-of-the-night post that introduced a new word to the language: “covfefe.” Throughout last year’s campaign and into the early months of his presidency, the concern among Mr. Trump’s advisers was mainly political. Every time the president let loose with one of his 140-character blasts, it distracted from his agenda and touched off a media frenzy that could last for days. But now the worry has turned increasingly legal. With multiple investigations looking at whether the president’s associates collaborated with Russia to influence the election, any random, unfiltered tweet could become part of a legal case. “There is a reason for the old lawyer’s proverb — the fish got hooked because it opened its mouth,” said Robert F. Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama. “Tweeting spontaneous thoughts and feelings may be emotionally satisfying in the middle of the night, but Mr. Trump’s lawyers will surely remind him that there are always fishermen around, casting their lines.” More than ever before, the White House is looking at the Russia case through a legal prism and hoping to wall it off from day-to-day governance. The president’s aides are assembling a team of lawyers, including some who would join the staff and others who would remain outside the White House. Individual aides are also shopping for lawyers. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump has given at least 16 White House staff members dispensation to work on policy matters they handled while employed as lobbyists or to interact with their former colleagues in private-sector jobs, according to records released late Wednesday. The details on these so-called ethics waivers — more than five times the number granted in the first four months of the Obama administration — were made public after an intense dispute between the White House and the Office of Government Ethics, which had been pushing the Trump administration to stop granting such waivers in secret. The list of waivers includes high-profile names such as Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, and Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser. They had to be granted waivers because of their prior work with organizations such as the Republican National Committee, which Mr. Priebus once ran, and because they continue to have contact with those organizations as part of their White House work. But the waivers granted by the White House are also going to former lobbyists, despite Mr. Trump’s campaign vow to try to reduce the influence of lobbyists in Washington. Andrew Olmem, who until recently was a Washington-based partner at the law firm Venable L.L.P., is a special assistant to the president for financial policy after he lobbied the federal government on behalf of a number of financial firms, including American Express, MetLife and S&P Global. Mr. Olmem’s waiver allows for him to participate in communications and meetings with former clients involving Puerto Rico’s financial issues, as well as amendments to the Flood Disaster Protection Act and reforming the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s treatment of insurers, the White House said. A second waiver was given to Michael Catanzaro, who until January was registered as a lobbyist for companies including Devon Energy, an oil and gas company, and Talen Energy, a coal-burning electric utility. Mr. Catanzaro moved from lobbying against Obama-era environmental rules to overseeing the White House office in charge of rolling back the same rules, an activity permitted by his waiver. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump is poised to decide whether the U.S. will remain a part of the Paris climate agreement, a decision that has deeply divided his administration. He met with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam, above, in the Oval Office. A withdrawal would severely weaken the 2015 accord that committed nearly every nation to take action to slow down global warming. Mr. Trump has said that regulations would hurt the U.S. economy and hinder job creation. Here’s a look at the major players still hoping to sway Mr. Trump’s decision. And while China and the European Union remain committed to the pact, here’s what other countries might do. _____ "
"Only future generations will be able to calculate the full consequences of President Trump’s incredibly shortsighted approach to climate change, since it is they who will suffer the rising seas and crippling droughts that scientists say are inevitable unless the world brings fossil fuel emissions to heel. But this much is clear now: Mr. Trump’s policies — the latest of which was his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change — have dismayed America’s allies, defied the wishes of much of the American business community he pretends to help, threatened America’s competitiveness as well as job growth in crucial industries and squandered what was left of America’s claim to leadership on an issue of global importance. The only clear winners, and we’ve looked hard to find them, are hard-core climate deniers like Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency and the presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, and various fossil fuel interests that have found in Mr. Trump another president (George W. Bush being the last) credulous enough to swallow the bogus argument that an agreement to fight climate change will destroy or at least inhibit the economy. Mr. Trump justified his decision by saying that the Paris agreement was a bad deal for the United States, buttressing his argument with a cornucopia of dystopian, dishonest and discredited data based on numbers from industry-friendly sources. Those numbers are nonsense, as is his argument that the agreement would force the country to make enormous economic sacrifices and cause a huge redistribution of jobs and economic resources to the rest of the world. In truth, the agreement does not require any country to do anything; after the failure of the 1997 Kyoto Accord, the United Nations, which oversees climate change negotiations, decided that it simply did not have the authority to force a legally binding agreement. Instead, negotiators in Paris aimed for, and miraculously achieved, a voluntary agreement, under which more than 190 countries offered aspirational emissions targets, pledged their best efforts to meet them and agreed to give periodic updates on how they were doing.

"Though a bill to terminate the remaining travel restrictions to Cuba garnered 55 votes in the Senate last week, President Trump is considering reviving limits on travel to the island, potentially disrupting investments in Cuba made by travel companies since President Barack Obama relaxed restrictions in 2014. Since that time, Starwood Hotels & Resorts struck a management deal with two hotels in Cuba. Airlines including American, JetBlue, Southwest and United began direct flights. Cruise traffic, too, is growing; in addition to several smaller lines, Norwegian Cruise Line now travels to the island, and Holland America Line just announced its intention to begin cruising there in December. “Now there are a lot of investments and a lot of skin in the game, and it’s a more complicated picture,” said Tom Popper, president of Insight Cuba, which has been operating tours on the island since 2000. What a change in policy would look like with respect to travel remains unclear. It’s possible the White House could impose stricter regulations on travel licenses, several tour operators say, or return to the restricted licensing in place before December 2014. Currently, Americans can visit Cuba under a general license that requires them to self-certify that they will engage with Cubans on a people-to-people basis for educational purposes. In practice, customs and immigration agents don’t ask for proof that a traveler’s itinerary includes meetings with Cubans. Stricter enforcement is one possible change. If licensing reverts to a pre-Obama-agreement system, group tour operators, including cruises, might continue to operate under the people-to-people license for which they apply. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump has called the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal a “rape” of the United States. He has scolded Germany for being “very bad” on trade because it runs a surplus. And in April he said that he was “psyched” to terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, only to reverse course. Despite Mr. Trump’s incendiary talk, his top trade advisers are taking a more cautious approach to dealing with America’s trading partners, striking a more moderate tone than the president but still laying the groundwork for the changes he has promised. That more moderate tone has come as a relief to those who feared the Trump administration would swiftly usher in a wave of protectionism, while disappointing some people who hoped that a sweeping rewrite of trade deals would come in the administration’s early days. Signs of greater moderation were on display this week when Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, suggested that the administration would actually try to build off some aspects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, or T.P.P., that Mr. Trump abandoned in January as Nafta renegotiations begin this summer. Mr. Ross also said that America’s trade deficit with Canada was “blameless” because it was the result of energy needs, rather than misdeeds. And he dismissed the idea that Mr. Trump was really ready to pull out of Nafta. “The first guiding principle is do no harm,” Mr. Ross said at a Bipartisan Policy Center forum on Wednesday. "
"Here’s one of the surest routes for men to think of women as equals: Have a daughter. In Silicon Valley, the venture capitalists who invest in tech start-ups are significantly more likely to hire a female investing partner if the hiring partners have daughters, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard. Having mixed-gender teams in turn improved venture capital firms’ financial performance — providing rare quantifiable evidence of the business benefits of diversity. The influence of daughters is consistent with previous research that shows that fathers of daughters support more egalitarian gender roles, and that male lawmakers, judges and corporate executives with daughters are more likely to support gender equity and policies that benefit women. Even men who play traditional gender roles in their personal lives tend to want their daughters to be independent and high-achieving, research has found. Having daughters seems to make them more aware of sexism or expose them to challenges different from their own. Ivanka Trump, for example, has done this in at least one way, by encouraging her father to include a paid parental leave policy in his new White House budget. “If I’m an old white male, I perhaps wouldn’t go out of my way to associate with young females,” said Maya Sen, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. “But if I have a daughter, I do come into contact with her and her friends, so it breaks the flocking with like-minded people.” Ms. Sen was not involved in the new study, but found in a previous study that judges, particularly Republican ones, were more likely to vote in favor of women on issues like sex discrimination if they had daughters. It’s generally difficult to find real-world evidence that decreasing bias and hiring more diverse teams directly cause better performance. But because the sex of children is random — providing natural experimental and control groups — and because it affected the likelihood of hiring female partners, the study was able to compare the effect of diversity on performance. The researchers were Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Sophie Wang, a Harvard economics Ph.D. student. The probability of a venture firm’s succeeding, as measured by start-ups going public or being acquired for more than the amount invested, was 3 percent higher in firms in which investing partners had more daughters. The rate of return for the funds also increased 3 percent. The researchers controlled for factors like firms’ size, age and demographic makeup. "
"Soon after President Trump announced that the United States would back out of the Paris climate accord, several large companies based in the United States that had supported the international pact said they were disappointed by the decision and would continue their environmental efforts. And two chief executives who sat on Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council — Elon Musk and Robert A. Iger — said they were leaving that group because they disagreed with the exit from the Paris agreement. While Mr. Trump said the decision to exit the deal was made to protect American jobs — a contention that environmental groups have disputed — some large companies had urged the president to stay in the accord. Twenty-five companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, bought full-page ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post last month to argue their case. Some of those companies, and others with similar views in the technology, energy and engineering sectors, reacted quickly on Thursday. But so did some companies, particularly in the coal industry, that supported Mr. Trump’s decision. Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, said he would leave an advisory council for Mr. Trump. "
"Where would modern dance be without its tradition of difficult women (often from the West Coast of America) who wanted to change the world? Some of them still want to change it today. At the start of the 20th century, Isadora Duncan (born in California) dared to dance with a heroically scaled vocabulary of barefoot, natural human movement, and to align herself with both free love and Bolshevism. Since at least the 1940s, when she moved permanently to California, Anna Halprin (born 1920) has kept challenging the nature of dance and society in a series of ways. She in turn has influenced Simone Forti (born in Italy in 1935), who studied with Ms. Halprin in the Bay Area in the 1950s, and Yvonne Rainer (born in California 1934), both founding parents of dance postmodernism. Ms. Halprin, Ms. Forti and Ms. Rainer are still working — and still contentious. All four women were represented on Wednesday in the performance of “Radical Bodies” at Hunter College’s Kaye Playhouse by the University of California Santa Barbara Dance Company. Five women performed José Limón’s “Dances for Isadora” (1971), which honors Duncan’s spirit and style in a series of solos; 11 dancers performed “The Paper Dance” from Ms. Halprin’s “Parades and Changes” (1965); nine dancers performed Ms. Rainer’s “Chair/Pillow” (1969); and Ms. Forti, with a shaggy mane of white hair, performed her own “News Animations,” an improvisatory speech and movement solo she has been developing since 1981. Ms. Forti’s openness about having Parkinson’s disease and Ms. Halprin’s work on dances connected to cancer research and healing link these choreographers to the movement that has been, adversely but controversially, labeled “victim art.” (In a program note, Ms. Forti wrote: “I shake but I’m fine. And the dance is all there.”) Both prove difficult by their way of connecting their dances to current politics. Ms. Forti, charmingly and mildly, talks throughout her solo in a seemingly meandering way about, on one hand, the sociology and movement patterns of wildlife and, on the other, Fox News and President Trump. Because her manner is so unassuming, her alternation between these subjects appears endearingly eccentric until, suddenly but no less gently, she makes it plain that certain politics (guess whose) threaten to decimate wildlife.

"To the Editor: Re “Jared Kushner and the Knotty Politics of Clan” (column, May 30): David Brooks suggests that clannishness is at odds with the government of laws “our forebears spent centuries trying to build.” And indeed it is. But clannishness is at odds with any form of governance, law-based or blood-based, that tries to supersede it. Mr. Brooks’s conflation of clannishness with “family-first devotion” and “loyalty to kith and kin” is also problematic. In fact, clannishness is only a subset of family-based social orders; a great many people believe in self-sacrifice and putting family first yet feud with no one. And does Mr. Kushner’s family even fit Mr. Brooks’s definition of clannishness? Are we to conclude that Mr. Kushner’s family built “a barrier between family — inside the zone of trust — and others, outside that zone” when Mr. Kushner’s uncle maneuvered to have Mr. Kushner’s father jailed and when Mr. Kushner’s zone of trust appears to include the Russians? There are no doubt definitions of clannishness that would encompass Mr. Kushner — and President Trump, too, as Mr. Brooks suggests. But if Jared Kushner overpaid for 666 Fifth Avenue, pushed for the firing of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, or engaged in questionable dealings with the Russians, it was not because his mentality was “entirely clannish.” He did these things out of ignorance, arrogance and cupidity.

"To the Editor: “A Vast Divide” (news article, May 15) noted that opponents of the designation of Bears Ears in Utah as a national monument describe the Obama administration’s action as a “land grab” and compared it to “grand theft.” But ownership of the land has not changed. Bears Ears remains in the hands of the American people. Bears Ears helps tell the full history of human civilization in our country, and we feel strongly that it deserves its new status alongside other beloved national monuments dedicated using the Antiquities Act. For years, Bears Ears had been left woefully unprotected, and its priceless petroglyphs, pictographs and other resources were being lost to looting, vandalism, reckless recreation and other threats. As the Trump administration considers the status of Bears Ears, at issue is not who should own this iconic landscape but rather whether this special place and its unparalleled collection of cultural resources deserve to be adequately protected for all Americans.

"LONDON — In April, after Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain announced that she would hold a general election on June 8, the first celebrity endorsements were for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party. And they came from an unlikely source: Britain’s thriving answer to rap music, known as grime. The spontaneity and extent of the endorsements, most of them appearing within a day or two of Mrs. May’s announcement, caught people by surprise. Jme, a grime star and the founder of Boy Better Know records, instructed his 700,000 Twitter followers to vote for Mr. Corbyn. Professor Green, a popular rapper and television host, posted a long endorsement on Instagram. Akala, another rapper, followed a string of tweets in support of “homie Jeremy Corbyn” with an op-ed essay in The Guardian. On the face of it, Mr. Corbyn, a teetotal, vegetarian, 68-year-old bicyclist, and the hip, young grime M.C.s make for unlikely allies. But the pairing makes sense: Like rap music in the United States, grime emerged from some of the poorest parts of the country, dilapidated inner-city housing projects. Mr. Corbyn’s left-wing policy proposals — like increased spending on public housing and free university education — are exactly what poor Britons, ethnic minorities and urban youth have been waiting to hear from a politician. Stormzy, who scored a No. 1 album in March with his debut “Gang Signs and Prayer,” put it best when he endorsed Mr. Corbyn last year: “My man, Jeremy! I dig what he says,” the M.C. said. “I feel like he gets what the ethnic minorities are going through and the homeless and the working class.” As grime M.C.s and their fans have generated support for Labour ahead of the vote, they are proving why Mr. Corbyn’s centrist critics within the party might be wrong about their leader — and showing how the party could someday find a path to victory. Since Mr. Corbyn’s grass-roots campaign and resounding victory in the 2015 Labour leadership election, the attacks from the news media, as well as from many Labour members of Parliament, have been histrionic. Mr. Corbyn and his supporters are regularly described as “out of touch” leftists. Even at the start of his campaign, Mr. Corbyn was forced to deny that he epitomized an “Islington elite” running (and ruining) the Labour Party, a reference to the North London borough Mr. Corbyn has represented since 1983, an area with affluent neighborhoods alongside extreme poverty.

"UNITED NATIONS — Leaders from around the world maintained a defiant front on Thursday after President Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. President Emmanuel Macron of France, speaking in French before switching to English, said he believed Mr. Trump was making a mistake. He then extended an offer to Americans: “Tonight, I wish to tell the United States: France believes in you, the world believes in you. I know that you are a great nation. I know your history, our common history. To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second home.” “I can assure you,” Mr. Macron added, “France will not give up the fight.” He capped off his English remarks with a twist on Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan: “Make our planet great again.” China made it a point to say it would stay in the accord, while Mr. Macron and the leaders of Germany and Italy issued a joint statement expressing “regret” and rejecting Mr. Trump’s assertion that he would renegotiate the deal. “We therefore reaffirm our strongest commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement, including its climate finance goals, and we encourage all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change,” the statement said.

"Set your alarms: At 3 p.m. today, President Trump finally answers the question of whether the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. The world is watching for signals from the White House: Some in the administration said that Mr. Trump would abandon the landmark agreement, while others insisted that no decision had been made. The New York Times has primers on what would happen if the United States left and where other countries stand. Several businesses have expressed concern about a withdrawal from the 2015 accord: • Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, said he would have to resign from two White House advisory boards if the president left the agreement. • Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft took out ads in American newspapers on Thursday, featuring an open letter to Mr. Trump saying that the Paris agreement would generate jobs and economic growth, The Financial Times reported. And regardless of Mr. Trump’s actions, climate change and its related policies have been increasingly on investors’ minds. "

"VISTA, Calif. — Representative Darrell Issa was 2,500 miles away from his Southern California home the other day, on a fund-raising mission to Florida. Outside his congressional district office here, a light drizzle fell from the sky. It was a weekday morning. But no matter. Close to 1,000 people were gathered for yet another weekly demonstration, a jumble of umbrellas, placards (“Repeal and Replace Issa”), honking horns and angry chants. They denounced Mr. Issa, a Republican who has held his House seat since 2001, for his support of President Trump and the Republican health care bill. “There are a lot of people who are very passionate,” said Nancy Arwine-Mavers, 58, a cardiac sonographer. She said this was her first political rally since marching for the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s. “People who usually don’t protest are coming out. They are realizing that one vote could cause them to lose their health care.” If Democrats have any chance of capturing the 24 Republican seats they need to take back control of the House, the road to victory starts here in California, and particularly in Orange County, a former conservative bastion that favored Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was the first time the county had voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. All 14 members of the California Republican congressional delegation voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including seven who, like Mr. Issa, represent districts that voted for Mrs. Clinton. Four of those come from districts that include Orange County. With its changing demographics and its declining Republican Party, California has increasingly loomed as the center of any national battle for House control. The Trump fervor this year offers an opportunity for Democrats to make the sort of congressional district gains that have eluded them even as they have come to dominate state politics over the last decade.

"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. There wasn’t much doubt about what late night would latch on to Wednesday: President Trump’s now-legendary “covfefe” tweet, which baffled a nation for several hours before it was deleted. All the hosts but Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah had the week off, but those two picked up the slack. Always keeping the big picture in mind, the “Full Frontal” host suggested that progressives delighting in Mr. Trump’s apparent Twitter misfire might be overlooking more pressing concerns. Ms. Bee, returning to the airwaves after an extended break, also caught up with Greg Gianforte, the tycoon who was elected to Congress from Montana last week — a day after he was charged with assaulting a reporter. But she noticed something the other late-night hosts didn’t point out last week: the rather limited choices that were available to Montana voters. Mr. Trump’s first overseas trip as president last week left some American allies alarmed. On “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah noticed that Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had a strikingly different interpretation. "
"The final design for the Museum of Modern Art’s $400 million expansion project, which will be officially unveiled on Thursday, is striking and provocative less because of its look than its implicit message: MoMA isn’t modern yet. Under the new plans, the museum is moving away from discipline-specific galleries that feature established artists — many of them white men — and toward more chronological and thematic approaches that include multiple formats as well as more minority and female artists. Museum executives also want to update and streamline their Midtown Manhattan building once and for all, after several iterations over the years. The most recent — an $858 million reconfiguration in 2004 by the Japanese architect Yoshio Taniguchi — resulted in congestion and overcrowding. The new design calls for more gallery space and a transformed main lobby, physical changes that, along with the re-examination of art collections and diversity, represent an effort to open up MoMA and break down the boundaries defined by its founder, Alfred Barr. “It’s a rethinking of how we were originally conceived,” Glenn D. Lowry, the museum’s director, said in an interview at MoMA. “We had created a narrative for ourselves that didn’t allow for a more expansive reading of our own collection, to include generously artists from very different backgrounds.” Whereas galleries were formerly labeled according to discipline — architecture, photography — now each floor will represent a rough chronological moment. A floor devoted to the 1920s and ’30s, for example, will include photography as well as drawings, paintings and sculpture. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) He’s been called college basketball’s greatest coach. John Wooden led the University of California, Los Angeles, to 10 national titles in a 12-season stretch from 1964 to 1975. But to many of his former players, Mr. Wooden, who died in 2010, was more than a winning coach — he was an exemplary man. Bill Walton regards him that way. So does Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, whose new book “Coach Wooden and Me,” chronicles their relationship, first as player and coach, then as lifelong friends. When the pair met in 1965, they could scarcely have seemed more different: Mr. Wooden a 55-year-old, 5-foot-10, white Hoosier, and Lew Alcindor — who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — an 18-year-old, 7-foot-2, black New Yorker.

"During his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist, lived up to the grand Democratic tradition of favoring the underdog at the expense of the rich. He proposed hammering the affluent by raising taxes in the amount of $15.3 trillion over ten years. New revenues would finance about half the cost of a $33.3 trillion boost in social spending The Sanders tax-and-spending plan throws into sharp relief the problem that the changing demographic makeup of the Democratic coalition creates for party leaders. Trouble brews when a deeply held commitment to the underdog comes into conflict with the self-interested pocketbook and lifestyle concerns of the upper middle class. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that under the Sanders plan, a married couple filing jointly with an income below $10,650 would continue to pay no income tax; everyone else would pay higher taxes. Those in the second quintile would pay an additional $1,625 and those in the middle quintile would see their income tax liability increase by $4,692. Those in the top quintile would pay $42,719 more. Higher up the ladder, the tax increase would grow to $130,275 for those in the top 5 percent, to $525,365 for those in the top one percent and to $3.1 million for the top 0.1 percent. When the additional revenues from the Sanders tax hike are subtracted from the additional spending his proposals would demand, the net result is an $18.1 trillion increase in the national debt over 10 years, according to the center.

Eric and Don Jr. are traveling the world to promote Trump hotels and golf courses while being looked after by the Secret Service on our dime. Tiffany is going to law school. If only the others were in law school. Pop question: Who’s your favorite mini-Trump? I’m sort of attached to Eric, the one who compared waterboarding to a fraternity hazing. In theory, Eric and Don Jr. are supposed to be totally unconnected to the government, running the family business in a manner so separate from the president that they might easily be working in a totally different dimension. Hahaha. “I do not talk about the government with him and he does not talk about the business with us. That’s kind of a steadfast pact we made, and it’s something we honor,” Eric told Forbes earlier this year. Then, Forbes reported, about “two minutes later” Eric volunteered that he’d still be making “profitability reports and stuff like that” to the president. He and Dad are, Eric added, “pretty inseparable.” Darned tootin’. Besides traveling the world to publicize Trump golf courses and hang out with potential investors, Eric and Donald Jr. are also working the political side of the street. The boys recently met with Republican leaders to discuss 2018 election plans. (Don Jr., by the way, is the one who was recently off shooting prairie dogs during their breeding season.) "
"Progress on gun control has been glacially slow, and on the federal level nonexistent. Even so, it’s worth noting and celebrating laws enacted in four states this year to deal with one of the grimmest aspects of the nation’s firearms carnage — the murders of about 50 women each month, shot to death by current or former intimate partners. Many had been the victims of repeated domestic abuse. Some had obtained court protection orders that proved no defense against the fury of an abuser who came armed. The urgency for preventive action is obvious. Research shows the presence of a gun in a situation of domestic abuse makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed. While Congress ducks this life-and-death issue, laws that could disarm domestic abusers before they can kill have been enacted in New Jersey, North Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. Those states join 19 others that have shown a bipartisan resolve to keep guns from domestic abusers. California’s law is particularly important because it gives standing to concerned family members, not just the police, to seek a court ruling against possession of a gun by a violent abuser. This is a key initiative; no one knows better than the family of a disturbed person the danger presented by a firearm in the home. A 1999 Connecticut law, allowing the police to pre-emptively take the guns of potentially violent or suicidal people, shows a considerable benefit, having prevented up to 100 suicides, university researchers found. The home-and-hearth slayings rooted in domestic abuse go largely unnoticed in the nation at large. Yet new research reveals how often these deadly encounters mushroom into the slayings of four or more people as a gunman runs amok. Of the 156 mass shootings from 2009 to 2016, more than half — 54 percent — were traceable to domestic or family violence, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control research and advocacy group. Among 422 victims in these shooting sprees, 181 were children. For all these casualties, few such mass shootings trigger the national alarm prompted by headlines about global terrorism. But they should. Entire families and other innocent bystanders are being ravaged by known domestic abusers still able to keep their weapons. Ideally, a concerned Congress would enact programs to help families and other intimates more easily petition courts for the surrender of a known abuser’s guns. Such a proposal exists, but it almost certainly won’t pass muster in the current Republican-controlled Congress or with President Trump, the ever grateful candidate of the gun lobby. This makes the issue an even more urgent priority for the states. "
"BERLIN — The Atlantic is rough these days, as stormy disregard blows from the United States to Europe and back. After President Trump attacked Germany’s trade practices, Chancellor Angela Merkel told a campaign rally in Munich that “the times we can completely rely on others are somewhat over” and that “we Europeans must take our destiny into our own hands.” Mr. Trump reacted with a tweeted threat, citing Germany’s failure to meet NATO’s military spending goals, saying “this will change.” Ms. Merkel’s statement went viral, and by the next day her spokesman Steffen Seibert was doing damage control. He stressed that Ms. Merkel had called for more European independence before (which is correct) and that the chancellor is “a deeply convinced trans-Atlanticist” (which is correct, too). And it is true: On many levels, despite all the rhetorical thunder, little has changed in substance, so far. Military experts say that within NATO, day-to-day business is somewhat hampered because positions on the American side are still unfilled but that it’s otherwise pretty much business as usual. They point out that the American brigade deployed in January 2017 to reassure Eastern Europe about Russia is still there. The same is true for economic and environmental cooperation, at least in Germany. Scientists continue working together, and Germany’s economics minister, Brigitte Zypries, recently had a constructive, friendly meeting in Washington with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the United States trade representative Robert Lighthizer. And yet Ms. Merkel’s statement was much more than just campaign chatter. Yes, she needs to assert independence in the face of a stronger-than-expected challenge from the center-left Social Democrats. But she meant what she said, and her statement accurately captures a new direction in trans-Atlantic relations. As Mr. Seibert said, this isn’t the first time a European has called for self-sufficiency from America. It has been an annoying refrain for decades. But suddenly it’s being sung with new urgency — and excitement. "
"Until a few decades ago, the popular but falsely reassuring belief was that babies in the womb were perfectly protected by the placenta and that children were just “little adults,” requiring no special protections from environmental threats. We now know that a host of chemicals, pollutants and viruses readily travel across the placenta from mother to fetus, pre-polluting or pre-infecting a baby even before birth. Toxic chemicals like lead, certain air pollutants, pesticides, synthetic chemicals and infectious agents like Zika can derail the intricate molecular processes involved in a fetus’s healthy brain development. So can physical and social stress experienced by the mother. At a time when we should be spending more on research and prevention of those threats, President Trump would do the opposite. He would cut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent, including cuts to scientific work on chemical safety. He would slash money for biomedical research and programs to fight outbreaks of infectious disease. We need more spending in those areas, not less. We need more testing of chemicals before they are marketed, not less. Toxic exposures are shockingly prevalent. Analysis of biomonitoring data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds dozens of toxic chemicals, pollutants and metals in pregnant women, many of which are also found in cord blood of newborns. These include pesticides sprayed in inner-city buildings and on crops, flame retardants used in furniture, combustion-related air pollutants from fossil-fuel-burning power plants and vehicles, lead, mercury and plasticizers. All have been shown in epidemiologic studies in the United States and elsewhere to be capable of damaging developing brains, especially while babies are exposed in utero or in their early life. This is why it was particularly distressing that the new head of the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, recently rejected the scientific conclusion of the agency’s own experts, who had recommended banning one of the nation’s most widely used insecticides, chlorpyrifos. The experts made their judgment on the basis of many years of research indicating that chlorpyrifos was linked to significant harm to children, including diminished cognitive ability. Research has also conclusively shown that climate change, caused in large part by carbon dioxide emitted by burning coal and other fossil fuels, is linked to more heat-related disease, malnutrition, infectious disease, trauma and mental health problems from extreme natural disasters like flooding. Those consequences can directly or indirectly affect early brain development, the cognitive and behavioral functioning of children and their ability to learn. "
"President Trump blurted a telling remark in a presidential debate when he was accused of failing to pay income taxes: “That makes me smart.” For Mr. Trump and his circle, what matters is not what’s right but what you can get away with. In his White House, if you’re avoiding the appearance of impropriety, you’re not pushing the boundaries hard enough. Government ethics officials say dealing with this administration is an exhausting game of whack-a-mole: go after one potential violation, and two others crop up. That’s because ethical regulations were not written with this sort of administration in mind. The current standoffs make clear that existing rules need to be clarified and strengthened, and new ones enacted, to ensure that the traditional standards we’ve expected of our public officials are met. Past administrations got stuck in swampy territory. Leaving aside the sins of Richard Nixon, the Reagan administration’s dodgy dealings ranged from the truly alarming Iran-contra to questionable “loans” of designer gowns to Nancy Reagan. President Bill Clinton’s presidency, the low point of which was his impeachment after lying to a grand jury about his sex life, ended with the return of White House property amid public pressure. These issues seem almost quaint by Trumpian standards. Before Mr. Trump stepped foot in the White House, his campaign was being investigated for possible collusion with the Russians to swing the election. Against that backdrop, it barely registers that his hotel blithely told Congress last week that it won’t track foreign government payments, in potential violation of the Constitution. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump said he would announce today whether the U.S. would remain part of the Paris climate agreement, an issue that has split his administration. An American withdrawal would severely weaken the accord, which commits nearly every nation to taking action to slow global warming. Mr. Trump has said that carbon regulations would hurt the U.S. economy. But he is also known for last-minute reversals. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, suggested Mr. Trump did not understand the mechanics of the treaty. “Not everything written in international agreements is fake news,” he said. Major players still hope to sway Mr. Trump’s decision. Here’s what other countries might do if the U.S. pulls out. Above, the Arc de Triomphe in Paris last year, when it was lit up to celebrate the accord. "
"DONGGUAN, China — The Chinese factory workers who make shoes for Ivanka Trump and other designers gather at 7:40 every morning to sing songs. Sometimes, they extol worker solidarity. Usually, they trumpet ties between China and Africa, the theme of their employer’s corporate anthem. That’s no accident. With many workers here complaining about excessive hours and seeking higher pay, the factory owner wants to send their jobs to Ethiopia. The employer, Huajian International, now faces scrutiny from labor activists for how it treats workers. Chinese authorities this week detained an activist who went undercover in the company’s factory here for a labor rights group. Two other activists who worked at Huajian are missing; it’s unclear whether they were detained. The activists’ focus on Huajian’s factories points to changing labor conditions in China as manufacturers try to get more work out of an increasingly expensive labor pool. "
"Eric Goode, 59, is a New York entrepreneur who is an owner of downtown establishments like the Bowery Hotel and the Waverly Inn. He was a creator of Area, the art-gallery-nightclub from the 1980s. He is also a conservationist with something of an obsession for turtles. And now he is the plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that accuses President Trump of violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, a once-obscure provision intended to prevent federal officials, including the president, from falling under the influence of foreign powers. Mr. Goode is an unlikely, reluctant and unusually prominent plaintiff in the high-stakes constitutional lawsuit. “I do question the wisdom of it,” he said over a cappuccino in the lobby of the Bowery Hotel, which looks like a British manor’s library with a rain forest growing in it. “Hopefully I am not going to get audited and harassed for the next three years, but it seemed like the right thing to do. I’m worried about veiled forms of retribution.” He was just back from a Rainforest Trust board meeting in Virginia and was headed to the West Coast outpost of his Turtle Conservancy in Ojai, Calif., where Galápagos tortoises and other creatures, some of which he has helped rescue from the black market, roam safely. His celebrity friends come there to roam, too. Their specific breeds, he doesn’t want to mention. Back to the Constitution. The foreign Emoluments Clause prohibits federal officials from accepting payment from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. It was written in the day when the founding fathers worried about kings trying to buy the favor of officials, and about such employees trying to make money off their positions. It hasn’t been talked about much in the past 200 years. But because Mr. Trump maintains an ownership stake in the Trump Organization, with vast hotel, residential and commercial real estate holdings that foreign governments can direct business to, emoluments are once again a flash point. "
"There is no other way to put it: Former F.B.I. Director James Comey tragically botched the investigation into Hillary Clinton, no doubt playing a part in her losing and Donald Trump’s being elected. But it is also true that Comey may be a linchpin in undoing the mistake he made. Trump was completely out of bounds when he fired Comey — the man who was leading an investigation into connections between Russia and the Trump campaign — and then bragged to the Russians about the firing. Last month, The New York Times reported that Trump asked Comey “to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting.” “ ‘I hope you can let this go,’ the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo.” The question of whether Trump’s ask, Comey’s continuance and Trump’s subsequent firing of Comey constitutes obstruction of justice looms large. Now CNN is reporting that “Comey plans to testify publicly in the Senate as early as next week to confirm bombshell accusations that President Donald Trump pressured him to end his investigation into a top Trump aide’s ties to Russia, a source close to the issue said Wednesday.” This is shaping up to be a high-drama media event. But the clarity of good vs. evil isn’t as clear-cut here as I would like it to be. To me it registers more as a matter of degrees: A good man exposed for colossal mismanagement versus a wretched man craning toward monstrosity. "

If President Trump pulls the United States out of the Paris climate treaty, he would hurt the planet, make people (especially children) sicker and aggravate geopolitical tensions. But you probably knew much of that. Less obviously, he would also do substantial damage to American interests — the country’s global power and its economy. An exit from the Paris accord would be a remarkable lose-lose proposition: bad for the rest of the world and bad for the United States. This is lost on Trump and his aides for many reasons, but one is their oversimplified, zero-sum understanding of international affairs. “The world is not a ‘global community,’” H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn, two of the most highly regarded Trump advisers, wrote in The Wall Street Journal, “but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage.” If something is bad for the rest of the world, it’s probably good for America, according to this view. The miserable irony of a Paris withdrawal is how bad it would actually be for the United States. An exit would, as Hannah Waters of the Audubon Society tweeted, “accelerate U.S. decline. World economy moves towards renewables; U.S. left behind.” Both Waters and John Upton of the nonprofit Climate Central noted that virtually the only industry that favors an exit from the accord is coal (and not even all of coal). Other energy industries understand that their future success depends on growing renewable energy. Trump, alas, seems happy to do coal’s bidding — at the expense of the rest of the country and the rest of the world. He probably won’t even succeed at bringing back many coal jobs, as Paul Krugman has written. For a needed dose of hope on this potentially dark day, I recommend: — Waters’s Twitter feed, which points out that, even with an American exit, the accord today includes countries accounting for about 65 percent of global emissions; when it was ratified, that number — including the United States — was 55 percent. — A Rhodium Group report (via David Roberts), which points out that America’s “ability to meet its 2025 Paris commitment will depend in large part on the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election.” — And the work of Michael Bloomberg and various groups connected with him, which emphasizes the impact that states, local governments, companies and others can still have on the climate.

"When a new administration comes to Washington, top government regulators flock to the exits to find new jobs, but they seldom have to look very far. A few parlay their experience into corporate counsel jobs or trade up to a more rarefied law firm than the one they had left earlier. But most of them, like Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, or Mary Jo White, former chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, simply return to their previous law firms. In the latest high-profile transition, the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder has welcomed back Aitan D. Goelman, who was enforcement director at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission until February. In his regulatory role, Mr. Goelman oversaw cases using new enforcement powers authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation that grew out of the 2008 economic crisis. “I was interested in hands-on law practice,” Mr. Goelman said in explaining why he returned to his firm. But like most other top federal lawyers, he first looked around to see what was on offer elsewhere in the legal industry. “I spent four months talking with many firms,” he said, “and a lot of them were interested because I had experience with big institutional clients who were caught up in government regulations or prosecutions.” Mr. Goelman will be a firm partner in Washington focusing on the securities, commodities and derivatives industries, internal investigations and defense of cross-jurisdictional regulatory and criminal matters.

"In his first sorties on the world stage, France’s new president, 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron, had to dash fears that he would be handicapped by youth and inexperience, and demonstrate the more vigorous French leadership he promised during his campaign. He carried this off with aplomb in a series of recent meetings with international leaders, displaying the trappings of French regality and the pragmatism of a contemporary technocrat. But with Europe facing existential challenges, the world in turmoil, and President Trump abdicating America’s historic global leadership, Mr. Macron’s real international tests are still to come. From his meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on his first day in office on May 15, to the NATO meeting in Brussels, the G7 meeting in Taormina, Italy, last week and his meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, Mr. Macron made it plain that he is no pushover and is not afraid of speaking forcefully. Standing with Mr. Putin, amid the splendor of the palace at Versailles, where Russia’s Peter the Great paid homage to the child king Louis XV in 1717, he called Russian media outlets that tried to derail his campaign “organs of influence” that “sow defamatory untruths.” He said the use of chemical weapons in Syria would lead to “immediate retaliation on the part of France,” and the warned that France was closely watching the horrifying witch hunt against L.G.B.T. people in Chechnya. And while Mr. Macron made it clear to Mr. Putin that he will defend France’s values with military might, if necessary, he still committed himself to dialogue with Russia and Syria. He also expressed hope that dialogue with Mr. Trump could prove fruitful, noting the president’s “willingness to listen” and “his desire to make progress,” after talks at the G7 meeting about the Paris climate accords. That assessment seems overly optimistic, since the president’s policies would harm the environment even if he stood by the climate accords. That may be an early lesson for Mr. Macron. World leaders may give one impression during a high-level dialogue, and do the opposite at home. Mr. Trump’s America First attitude also leaves Mr. Macron in a position no French president has faced since the end of World War II: a world bereft of U.S. leadership. The people of France, of Europe and of the world must hope that he will rise to the challenge. "
"To the Editor: President Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris agreement (nytimes.com, June 1) belies science, a near-universal agreement on climate change, and reason itself. Scientific understanding of climate change led 195 countries to build the Paris agreement’s modest but important pillars of domestically determined goals, financing and carbon accounting. It is a model for how nations should solve future problems — problems even America may face. Mr. Trump’s decision is not only an arrogant abrogation of science and cooperation but also defies logic. Ignoring job opportunities in clean innovation and relying on 18th-century technologies is a mistaken bet to “make America great again.” JOHN O. NILES, SAN DIEGO The writer is director of the Carbon Institute. To the Editor: Apparently President Trump is plunging his head further into the sand and helping push the planet toward catastrophic levels of warming, consigning future generations to economic dislocation and environmental chaos. In response, the 194 other nations that signed the Paris climate agreement should impose economic sanctions on the United States. These sanctions should remain in place until a future president charts a course to fully mitigate the effects of Mr. Trump’s decision. This White House may embrace some future dystopia to cement its “America First” legacy, but it has no right to take the world’s children and grandchildren down that path. Their parents and grandparents must steadfastly object and be ready to shoulder some pain now to preserve a livable future for those whose lives we hold in our hands. DOUGLAS THOMPSON, SACRAMENTO To the Editor: While it is true that withdrawing from the Paris climate accord was a campaign promise of Donald Trump, it is important to realize that most people are not single-issue voters, and apparently most of those who voted for Mr. Trump did so despite this promise, not because of it. "
"President Trump said on Thursday that the United States was officially withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, following through on a campaign promise and defying fellow world leaders who had pleaded with him to remain a party to the pact. The move was sure to provoke a sharp backlash from the rest of the world, and it could prove to be a major setback for international efforts to avert drastic global warming. The world’s nations had already been struggling to reduce emissions deeply enough to prevent global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, the threshold deemed unacceptably risky. The Paris climate deal was meant to provide a structure to ratchet up those efforts over time. Now, the world’s largest economy has clearly stated that it wants no part of that process. The big question now is how other countries will respond to Mr. Trump’s withdrawal: Do they keep pressing ahead with climate action anyway, or does the accord start to unravel without the United States? Here’s a look at what happens next. The Paris climate deal, which 195 countries agreed to in 2015, was designed to work through voluntary action and peer pressure. Because it was never ratified by the Senate, the United States will face few barriers to leaving. The Trump administration plans to invoke the accord’s formal withdrawal mechanism, a winding legal process that will take four years to complete and would lead to an official exit on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the next presidential election. A future administration could, if it chose, rejoin. "
"People say, if all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. We should be so lucky. President Trump has a hammer, but all he’ll use it for is to smash things that others have built, as the world looks on in wonder and in fear. The latest, most troubling example is his decision to obliterate the Paris climate accord: After nearly 200 years of scientific inquiry and over 20 years of patient diplomacy that united every nation save Syria and Nicaragua, we had this afternoon’s big game-show Rose Garden reveal: Count us out. It’s a stupid and reckless decision — our nation’s dumbest act since launching the war in Iraq. But it’s not stupid and reckless in the normal way. Instead, it amounts to a thorough repudiation of two of the civilizing forces on our planet: diplomacy and science. It undercuts our civilization’s chances of surviving global warming, but it also undercuts our civilization itself, since that civilization rests in large measure on those two forces. Science first. Since the early 1800s we’ve been slowly but surely figuring out the mystery of how our climate operates — why our planet is warmer than it should be, given its distance from the sun. From Fourier to Foote and Tyndall, from Arrhenius to Revelle and Suess and Keeling, researchers have worked out the role that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases play in regulating temperature. By the 1980s, as supercomputers let us model the climate with ever greater power, we came to understand our possible fate. Those big brains, just in time, gave us the warning we required. And now, in this millennium, we’ve watched the warning start to play out. We’ve seen 2014 set a new global temperature record, which was smashed in 2015 and smashed again in 2016. We’ve watched Arctic sea ice vanish at a record pace and measured the early disintegration of Antarctica’s great ice sheets. We’ve been able to record alarming increases in drought and flood and wildfire, and we’ve been able to link them directly to the greenhouse gases we’ve poured into the atmosphere. This is the largest-scale example in the planet’s history of the scientific method in operation, the continuing dialectic between hypothesis and skepticism that arrived eventually at a strong consensus about the most critical aspects of our planet’s maintenance. Rational people the world around understand. As Bloomberg Businessweek blazoned across its cover the week after Hurricane Sandy smashed into Wall Street, “It’s Global Warming, Stupid.” But now President Trump (and 22 Republican senators who wrote a letter asking him to take the step) is betting that all of that is wrong. Mr. Trump famously called global warming a hoax during the campaign, and with this decision he’s wagering that he was actually right — he’s calling his own bluff. No line of argument in the physical world supports his claim, and no credible authority backs him, not here and not abroad. It’s telling that he simultaneously wants to cut the funding for the satellites and ocean buoys that monitor our degrading climate. Every piece of data they collect makes clear his foolishness. He’s simply insisting that physics isn’t real. "
"The internet is full of confident people who do not know what they are talking about. The latest example: a conviction spreading in right-leaning social media communities that a garbled tweet by the president — he wrote “covfefe” — was not a late-night typo but was instead Mr. Trump sending a message to the world in Arabic. “Covfefe,” these people on the internet insist, is Arabic for “I will stand up.” That is not even close to true. We asked Ali Adeeb Alnaemi, a professor of Arabic at New York University, what he thought of this translation, which has been falsely spread online by anonymous Reddit users with screen names like “PepeTheRacistFrog.” Mr. Alnaemi, who previously worked for The New York Times in Baghdad, made a good-faith effort to see where this mistranslation may have come from. In a phone interview, he repeated the word “covfefe” several times before finally laughing. “Come on,” he said. “I’m sorry. No.” Mr. Trump wrote the word as part of a half finished tweet that was posted just after midnight on Wednesday and not deleted for several hours. Most people assumed it was a typo, but a meme was quickly born. In a tweet posted the next morning, the president seemed to join in the fun, joking that the word’s true meaning may never be known. His press secretary, Sean Spicer, did not seem to think it was a laughing matter, however. “The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,” he said at a briefing on Wednesday, to the disbelief of the assembled reporters. But what did the president mean? Mr. Alnaemi said the word “covfefe” was “something meaningless” in Arabic, a language that Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to ban Muslims from the United States, has never publicly claimed to speak. There is no standardized method for rendering Arabic words in Latin script, but the professor said if Mr. Trump had wanted to write “I will stand up” in Arabic he would have written something like “saqef” or “sawfa aqef."" “Honestly when I heard that some writers thought Trump was speaking Arabic I said to myself, ‘Wow, they know Arabic more than I do,’” Mr. Alnaemi, who was born and raised in Iraq, said. “Because I cannot think of a word that would mean the equivalent of ‘covfefe.’” "
"LONDON — For the first time since the government of Hungary threatened to shutter the university he founded in Budapest, the American financier and philanthropist George Soros criticized the country’s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, saying he has presided over a “mafia state.” In a keynote speech Thursday at the annual economic forum of the European Commission, Mr. Soros cited “the deception and corruption of the mafia state the Orban regime has established” and praised those who protested a law passed in April that seemed designed to close the school, the Central European University. Mr. Soros, a benefactor of civil society groups in his native Hungary and elsewhere, founded the C.E.U. in 1991 and endowed it to operate as an independent American institution in Hungary. The law passed by the Hungarian Parliament in April would effectively force the closing of the university because it does not operate a campus in the United States, where it is registered. The law was widely viewed as a crackdown on free expression and liberal values under Mr. Orban, who has called the university a fraud and accused Mr. Soros of fomenting dissent against the government. In his speech Thursday, Mr. Soros denied he was trying to interfere in Hungarian politics, and chastised Mr. Orban for trying to cast him as an enemy. “He sought to frame his policies as a personal conflict between the two of us and has made me the target of his unrelenting propaganda campaign,” Mr. Soros said of the Hungarian prime minister. “He cast himself in the role of the defender of Hungarian sovereignty and me as a shady currency speculator who uses his money to flood Europe — particularly his native Hungary — with illegal immigrants as part of some vague but nefarious plot.” "
"Shareholders of the oil giant Exxon Mobil have finally won a long-sought climate change victory. Over 60 percent of them backed a move that forces the $340 billion company to ramp up global-warming disclosure, up from under 40 percent in a similar attempt last year. Exxon already embraces the debate more than most. But shareholders want the company to be more forthcoming. Holdouts among their industry peers will have to follow or risk investor ire. Exxon's chief executive, Darren Woods, who took the helm at the beginning of the year, wrote in his first blog post about the importance of managing the risks of climate change. On several occasions Mr. Woods has talked about how Exxon does business in an environment in which, under the 2015 Paris accord, nearly 200 countries, including China and India, have agreed to reduce their carbon emissions. At the company’s annual meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, Mr. Woods reiterated Exxon’s commitment to adhere to the guidelines of the agreement even if President Trump decides to withdraw the United States from the deal. Yet Exxon’s energy outlook remains fairly rosy, showing rising oil demand through 2040. Oil and gas development, Mr. Woods said, will still need $11 trillion of investment even under the constraints of the Paris agreement. Some shareholders have for several years found this discussion unsatisfactory. They have asked Exxon to analyze in more depth the potential effect on the company’s business of limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and to try to assess what might happen beyond 2040. And they have demanded access to independent directors to discuss their concerns. The difference this year is that more of them, potentially including big institutions like BlackRock, now want more information. After Wednesday’s vote, the company has to oblige. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Woods was vague on Exxon’s plans to comply. It’s not the first time an American company has gotten such a directive from shareholders — it happened at Occidental Petroleum earlier this month, for example — and greater disclosure is more common at European energy groups. Still, Exxon is the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company and it sets the standard. Others in the sector should consider themselves on notice. "
"President Trump and his daughter Ivanka could sell jewelry and wedding dresses and provide catering services in China under new trademarks granted in recent days by Beijing. The new trademarks expand the president’s business interests in the world’s second-largest economy after the United States’, which have already stirred complaints over a possible conflict of interest. During his campaign, Mr. Trump regularly blamed China for the loss of American industrial jobs and pledged to take a tough trade stance with Beijing. That position has since softened, in particular after an April meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. As a businessman, Mr. Trump has made money by licensing the use of his name on an array of products around the world, like vodka in Israel or soap in India. He has added to that list since taking office. Over the last three weeks, China’s trademark office gave preliminary approval for one trademark to Mr. Trump for providing catering services and four to his daughter through her trademarking business, Ivanka Trump Marks. Ms. Trump’s trademarks include those for jewelry, wedding dresses, watches and a range of electronic devices. Mr. Trump applied for the trademark in April 2016, while his daughter applied for the four trademarks from May to July last year. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, weakening efforts to combat global warming and embracing isolationist voices in his White House who argued that the agreement was a pernicious threat to the economy and American sovereignty. In a speech from the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the landmark 2015 pact imposed wildly unfair environmental standards on American businesses and workers. He vowed to stand with the people of the United States against what he called a “draconian” international deal. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president said, drawing support from members of his Republican Party but widespread condemnation from political leaders, business executives and environmentalists around the globe. Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the agreement for environmental action signed by 195 nations is a remarkable rebuke to heads of state, climate activists, corporate executives and members of the president’s own staff, who all failed to change his mind with an intense, last-minute lobbying blitz. The Paris agreement was intended to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures in concert, and the departure of the Earth’s second-largest polluter is a major blow. Mr. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the United States, and the administration said he had placed calls to the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Canada to personally explain his decision. A statement from the White House press secretary said the president “reassured the leaders that America remains committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and to robust efforts to protect the environment.” "
"Despite posing potential conflicts of interest, Rudolph W. Giuliani and another prominent lawyer were allowed on Thursday to continue to represent a Turkish-Iranian gold trader facing federal charges in Manhattan. The businessman, Reza Zarrab, 33, faces trial on Oct. 30 on charges of conspiring to commit money laundering, bank fraud and violating the United States sanctions on Iran. He has pleaded not guilty. Mr. Zarrab, whom prosecutors have depicted as a man of considerable wealth and influence in Turkey, retained Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, and Michael B. Mukasey, a former attorney general in President George W. Bush’s administration, to explore a possible diplomatic resolution to his case, outside of normal plea bargaining channels. In a court filing in April, Mr. Mukasey described the effort as seeking “a state-to-state resolution of this case.” The two lawyers have met with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and also discussed the matter with Trump administration officials. “Senior officials in both the U.S. government and the Turkish government remain receptive to pursuing the possibility of an agreement,” Mr. Mukasey said in the court filing. The office of Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, had asked Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court to conduct an inquiry into potential conflict issues raised by the two lawyers’ roles. For example, Mr. Giuliani’s law firm, Greenberg Traurig, and Mr. Mukasey’s firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, each represented banks that prosecutors say were victims of Mr. Zarrab’s scheme. Mr. Giuliani’s firm also served as a registered agent of Turkey. Judge Berman said in his ruling that “these potential conflicts have been thoroughly reviewed by Mr. Zarrab” with the assistance of an independent lawyer and his trial counsel, Benjamin Brafman. “Mr. Zarrab has stated unequivocally that he knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to conflict-free representation by Messrs. Giuliani and Mukasey,” the judge wrote. Judge Berman noted that the potential conflicts were described for Mr. Zarrab in court, including the ways in which Mr. Giuliani’s firm’s representation of Turkey may adversely affect his defense. Mr. Zarrab said he wanted to continue to be represented by the law firm. “I understand that the Greenberg firm represents the government of the Turkish Republic,” Mr. Zarrab told the judge. “In theory, the interests of the government of the Turkish Republic and my interests could be different in connection with this case.” “I do waive all my rights according to this subject,” Mr. Zarrab added. The United States attorney’s office, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey and their law firms all had no comment; Mr. Brafman’s office said he was unavailable for comment. Judge Berman noted that the conflict issue “must continue to be closely monitored.” “In reaching its conclusions,” the judge added, “the court has also taken into consideration the importance of maintaining the integrity of these proceedings as the case heads toward trial.” "
"The Trump administration may have skirted federal ethics rules by retroactively granting a blanket exemption that allows Stephen K. Bannon, the senior White House strategist, to communicate with editors at Breitbart News, where he was recently an executive. The exemption, made public late Wednesday along with more than a dozen other ethics waivers issued by the White House, allows all White House aides to communicate with news organizations, even if they involve a “former employer or former client.” The waiver, which was undated, did not mention Mr. Bannon specifically, but appeared to benefit him by potentially dislodging him from a pending ethics complaint over his past discussions with Breitbart editors. It would also free him from restrictions on his future communication with the conservative media company. The waiver, and the fact that it remains unclear when it was originally issued, seemed unusual to Walter M. Shaub Jr., the director of the Office of Government Ethics, who questioned its validity. “There is no such thing as a retroactive waiver,” Mr. Shaub said in an interview. “If you need a retroactive waiver, you have violated a rule.” A White House spokeswoman, Lindsay E. Walters, disputed that the Trump administration may have violated ethics rules by issuing a retroactive waiver. "
"WASHINGTON — Two Democratic senators disclosed on Thursday that they had asked James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, to open a criminal investigation into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions perjured himself when he falsely said at his confirmation hearing that he “did not have communications with the Russians” last year. The senators, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Al Franken of Minnesota, released three letters to the F.B.I. that they privately sent in March, April and May. The letters also showed they had been expecting a briefing from Mr. Comey on May 12 but never got it because President Trump abruptly fired him three days earlier. “We served with the attorney general in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee for many years,” Mr. Franken and Mr. Leahy said in a joint statement accompanying the release of their letters. “We know he would not tolerate dishonesty if he were in our shoes. If it is determined that the attorney general still has not been truthful with Congress and the American people about his contacts with Russian officials during the campaign, he needs to resign.” The dispute centers on Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation testimony Mr. Sessions gave in January, when he told Mr. Franken that he did not have any contacts with Russians last year. In fact, Mr. Sessions met at least twice in 2016 with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak: once at a reception at the Republican National Convention in July, and in Mr. Sessions’s Senate office in September. A day after The Washington Post reported those meetings on March 1, Mr. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the criminal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with it. The case is now being overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, although he has appointed a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, to handle it. But Mr. Sessions, who as a senator from Alabama was an early and staunch supporter of Mr. Trump, has insisted that his answer to Mr. Franken was correct when viewed in context because he was responding to a question about Trump campaign contacts with Russians. Mr. Sessions said he considered himself to have met with Mr. Kislyak in his role as a senator, not his role as a Trump campaign surrogate. "
"President Trump announced Thursday that he would pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. The decision makes good on a campaign promise and aligns with Mr. Trump’s “America first” message. It is also a major setback for the worldwide effort to combat global warming. What does the decision mean? We have extensive coverage here at The New York Times, but it is a complex issue and you may be wondering where to start. In December 2015, nearly every country in the world — 195 in all — agreed to the first global pact aimed at reducing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. It was a landmark diplomatic achievement and the pinnacle of President Barack Obama’s environmental agenda. Scientific studies show that if the world’s carbon emissions continue unchecked, atmospheric temperatures will continue to rise. The planet won’t just be hotter, but it will also suffer from rising sea levels, more powerful storms, droughts that lead to food shortages and other extreme conditions. "
"They’re adorable creatures who liven up sports events for young and old alike. What’s not to like about mascots? But then there are the occasions when it all goes wrong. On Wednesday night, Mr. Met, the cute baseball-headed character, was caught on tape flipping a finger at a fan. (It was not the middle finger. He has only four.) The Mets released a sternly worded statement saying, “We apologize for the inappropriate action of this employee.” Sadly, it was not the only time a mascot went rogue. On a snowy day in 2010, some University of Cincinnati football fans decided to chuck a few snowballs. That’s all in good fun, but, of course, it could have become a safety issue, so efforts were made to stop it. Unfortunately, a key player in the fight was the Bearcat mascot. “He’s throwing snowballs down to the students in the crowd,” the university police’s assistant chief, Jeff Corcoran, told WCPO. “They’re throwing snowballs back at him. They’re missing him. They’re hitting other people. Plus he’s up on top of like a six-foot-high wall that has ice and snow on top of it.” The police also believed he shoved an officer. The Bearcat was given a citation for disorderly conduct. “I’m coming up on 25 years here and I’ve never seen this before, and yes, I hope I never see it again,” Corcoran said. "

"As President Donald J. Trump prepares to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, here are three books that help illuminate some of the issues involved in this divisive subject. MERCHANTS OF DOUBT (2010)
How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues From Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming
By Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway
Bloomsbury Press; 368 pp. In a book that inspired a documentary by the same name, the co-authors, both historians of science, pull the curtain back on the small group of scientists who dispute evidence of climate change. Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway show that these scientists have not limited their scientific dissents to climate-related issues; they have also argued against the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke. Calling them “Merchants of Doubt,” Oreskes and Conway explore the motivations behind their stances. Many of them were prominent scientists during the Cold War era, and the authors argue that they appear to have begun equating environmentalism with socialism, and government intervention with tyranny. AN APPEAL TO REASON (2008)
A Cool Look at Global Warming
By Nigel Lawson
The Overlook Press; 144 pp. For a skeptical view of climate change, you might turn to Nigel Lawson’s book. Lawson, the former secretary of state for energy under Margaret Thatcher, argues that though climate science does contain a measureof truth, it is mostly overstated — in his view, any decrease in quality of life over the next 100 years would be modest, at most. And even if the most pessimistic environmental forecast were to prove true, Lawson believes, society would do what it has done for centuries: adapt. His standpoint is decidedly economic, laying out a case for why taking action now is both expensive and unwarranted. FLIGHT BEHAVIOR (2012)
By Barbara Kingsolver
HarperCollins Publishers; 448 pp. When this novel’s protagonist, Dellarobia, witnesses a striking vision of orange in the mountains, like fire with no smoke, she is convinced it is a sign from God. The vision makes her a quasi-celebrity, drawing journalists, religious leaders and a climate scientist into her small town. The various reactions and interpretations of the phenomenon — later discovered to be a colony of Monarch butterflies displaced by a flood in their usual home in Mexico — reflect contemporary conversations on climate change and open up Dellarobia’s world. Barbara Kingsolver shows how individual motivations and circumstance determine belief. "
"WASHINGTON — The day before armed guards from the Turkish president’s security detail violently attacked a group of peaceful protesters here last month, the State Department notified Congress of its intention to license the sale of $1.2 million worth of semiautomatic handguns to the security force. Two weeks later, with mounting outrage over the episode among American lawmakers and a continuing investigation by the State Department that could lead to criminal charges against some of the guards involved, the future of the sale now appears to be in question. Though the State Department has not notified Congress if it intends to withhold a license for the sale, it has met resistance from senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill that could stall or even sink the transaction. The attack has presented the State Department with a particularly thorny challenge, as it balances geopolitical interests with domestic concerns in coordinating a response. American lawmakers have demanded the guards be held to account, while Turkey, a NATO ally and an active partner in the fight against the Islamic State, has all but denied the guards’ role in the skirmish. Several videos show the guards, many with pistols under their jackets, beating protesters. State Department documents show the United States government would authorize Sig Sauer, the New Hampshire-based firearms maker, to sell some 1,600 semiautomatic pistols to a Turkish government-controlled intermediary, which in turn would sell them to the agency tasked with protecting the president. The State Department declined to comment on the proposed sale. Representatives of Sig Sauer and the Turkish Embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to requests for comment. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has drafted a sweeping revision of the government’s contraception coverage mandate that could deny birth control benefits to hundreds of thousands of women who now receive them at no cost under the Affordable Care Act. The new rule, which could go into effect as soon as it is published in the Federal Register, greatly expands the number of employers and insurers that could qualify for exemptions from the mandate by claiming a moral or religious objection, including for-profit, publicly traded corporations. A 34,000-word explanation of the intended policy change is blunt about its likely impact on women: “These interim final rules will result in some enrollees in plans of exempt entities not receiving coverage or payments for contraceptive services.” The architects of the Affordable Care Act intended to broadly expand access to contraception by making it a regular benefit of health insurance, and the Obama administration’s goal was to guarantee birth control for as many women as possible. More than 55 million women have birth control coverage without out-of-pocket costs, according to a study commissioned by the Obama administration and cited in the draft rule. By spring 2014, two-thirds of women using birth control pills and nearly 75 percent of women using the contraceptive ring were no longer paying out-of-pocket costs. In 2013 alone, the mandate had saved women $1.4 billion on birth control pills, according to the National Women’s Law Center. But a series of lawsuits filed over the last five years by priests, nuns, charitable organizations, hospitals, advocacy groups and colleges and universities convinced Trump administration officials that a change was needed. The new rule, drafted mainly by political appointees at the White House and the Health and Human Services Department, seeks “to better balance the interests” of women with those of employers and insurers that have conscientious objections to providing or facilitating access to contraceptives. "
"MOSCOW — Shifting from his previous blanket denials, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia suggested on Thursday that “patriotically minded” private Russian hackers could have been involved in cyberattacks last year that meddled in the United States presidential election. While Mr. Putin continued to deny any state role in the hacking, his comments, made to reporters in St. Petersburg, Russia, departed from the Kremlin’s previous position: that Russia had played no role whatsoever in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and that, after Donald J. Trump’s victory, the United States had become the victim of anti-Russia hysteria among crestfallen Democrats. Asked about suspicions that Russia might try to interfere in the coming elections in Germany, Mr. Putin raised the possibility of attacks on foreign votes by what he portrayed as free-spirited Russian patriots. Hackers, he said, “are like artists” who choose their targets depending how they feel “when they wake up in the morning.” Any such attacks, he added, could not alter the result of elections in Europe, America or elsewhere. Artists, he said, paint if they wake up feeling in good spirits while hackers respond if “they wake up and read that something is going on in interstate relations” that prompts them to take action. “If they are patriotically minded, they start making their contributions — which are right, from their point of view — to the fight against those who say bad things about Russia,” Mr. Putin added, apparently referring to Hillary Clinton. The Kremlin took a dim view of Mrs. Clinton, considering her far less friendly toward Russia than a President Trump would be because of her blunt criticism of Mr. Putin and his policies in Syria and elsewhere. Mr. Putin’s remarks stopped far short of accepting the conclusions of American intelligence agencies that the Kremlin was behind the election campaign cyberattacks. But they opened room for verbal maneuvering by Moscow — and also by Mr. Trump — amid multiple investigations in the United States into Russian meddling, including one by the F.B.I. about the firing of its director, James B. Comey. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an order keeping the American Embassy in Tel Aviv rather than moving it to Jerusalem as he promised during last year’s campaign, aides said Thursday, disappointing many Israel supporters in hopes of preserving his chances of negotiating a peace settlement. Aides said the decision was just a delay and that he still planned to move the embassy to Jerusalem when conditions were right, although past presidents have said the same without ever acting. In a statement issued by the White House, officials said that Mr. Trump’s move should not be considered “a retreat from the president’s strong support for Israel” and its alliance with the United States. “President Trump made this decision to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend America’s national security interest,” the statement said. “But, as he has repeatedly stated his intention to move the embassy, the question is not if that happens, but only when.” Mr. Trump made no mention of his pending decision during a visit to Jerusalem just last week and waited to announce it until almost the last minute he could under law, demonstrating the deep political sensitivity of a city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. The order waives for six months a congressional edict requiring the embassy be located in Jerusalem, meaning he will have to consider the matter again by Dec. 1. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has nurtured a close relationship with Mr. Trump, offered only modest regret for the decision publicly. “Though Israel is disappointed that the embassy will not move at this time, we appreciate today’s expression of President Trump’s friendship to Israel and his commitment to moving the embassy in the future,” his office said in a statement. Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian Authority representative in the United States, welcomed the decision, saying it cleared away one obstacle to negotiations. “This is in line with the long held U.S. policy and the international consensus and it gives peace a chance,” he said.

"This Week in Hate highlights hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of President Trump. A black college student was fatally stabbed in College Park, Md., days before he would have graduated. Two men were killed and another wounded when they tried to stop a man’s hateful rant on a train in Portland, Ore. This week, a home in Los Angeles owned by the N.B.A. star LeBron James was vandalized with racial slurs. “We got a long way to go, for us as a society and for us as African-Americans, until we feel equal in America,” Mr. James said at a news conference on Wednesday. “Hate in America, especially for African-Americans, is living every day.” Though the frequency seems to have decreased since the beginning of the year, hate crimes like the attacks in Portland and the vandalism of Mr. James’s home continue. More comprehensive data is needed, but reports to the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups over the past few months have revealed a few patterns. Reports of hate crimes surged in the days after the election. The Southern Poverty Law Center counted almost 900 incidents of hate or bias in the ten days after the election, using a combination of news reports and witness testimony. The group counted 1,094 incidents in the first month after the election, and 1,863 between November 9 and March 31. Schools were a particularly common location for hate incidents — the S.P.L.C. counted 284 at primary and secondary schools, and 330 on college campuses. The group counted 178 incidents involving the posting of white supremacist flyers; the flyers were posted in two bursts, one the week after the election and one during the month of February, and the majority of flyers were posted at colleges. "
"WASHINGTON — There was Robert F. Kennedy’s still-mysterious phone call with an Izvestia correspondent, actually a Soviet spy, on Dec. 1, 1960, signaling that his brother, the president-elect, wanted to change the nature of the United States’ relationship with its Cold War adversary. It wasn’t exactly a success: First came the Bay of Pigs, then the Cuban missile crisis. There was Richard M. Nixon’s secret channel to the South Vietnamese through Anna Chennault, a prominent Republican fund-raiser, urging the South Vietnamese to deflect President Lyndon B. Johnson’s effort to join peace talks in Paris because Nixon, she said, would give them a better deal. Fifty years later, historians are still arguing over what Nixon’s direct role was, and whether, as Johnson railed, the action was “treasonous.” Back channels during presidential transitions are not unprecedented, but they are always fraught, as President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have discovered in recent weeks. In the end, the trouble hinges entirely on the content. “Getting-to-know-you is fine,” said James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama who raised the alarm when he saw intercepts suggesting a series of contacts between the Trump transition team and Russians. The risk, he said, comes when those doing the talking violate “the tradition of one president at a time.” Kennedy probably did not go over the line, the evidence suggests. Nixon probably did. Whether Mr. Kushner and Michael T. Flynn, and perhaps others in the Trump transition team, crossed that line is still an open question. The answer may be different for each of them. Mr. Kushner has never talked, at least publicly, about the content of his meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, or a later session with a Russian banker. That session has been described in various ways, as everything from a business meeting to an effort to open a back channel to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. "
"LONDON — Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, ridiculed a published report on Thursday that suggests United States investigators think he may be able to shed light on any possible collusion between Russia and Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. Mr. Farage was responding to an article in The Guardian newspaper on Thursday that said he was a “person of interest” in the F.B.I.’s investigation into Moscow’s contacts with representatives of Mr. Trump’s campaign, including Michael T. Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump’s national security adviser. The Guardian, citing unidentified sources, said Mr. Farage was not accused of wrongdoing but had “raised the interest” of the F.B.I. because of his relationships with the Trump campaign and with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks. American officials say Russian hackers working for the government obtained documents from the Democratic Party and provided them to WikiLeaks to damage the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Under Mr. Farage, the far-right, anti-immigrant UKIP played an influential role in a referendum last year in which British voters supported withdrawing from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit. The investigators are examining whether Mr. Farage was a link between Mr. Assange and Trump advisers including Roger Stone, who has acknowledged being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker who is thought to be an agent of Russian military intelligence. “This hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump,” Mr. Farage said in a statement to The New York Times. “For the record I have never been to Russia, I’ve had no business dealings with Russia in my previous life and I have appeared approximately three times on RT in the last 18 months,” referring to the Russian television network that has been accused of serving as a propaganda organ for the Kremlin. He added that a March meeting he had with Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where the Australian has received political asylum, “was organized for me by LBC Radio with a view to conducting an interview.” Mr. Farage has hosted a show on the independent radio station in London. Mr. Farage said that the Guardian article made him laugh. “I consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the F.B.I., as I have no connections to Russia,” he said. "
