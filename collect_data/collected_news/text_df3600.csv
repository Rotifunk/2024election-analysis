"President Trump’s inaugural committee, under fire for a delay in donating its remaining funds to charity, plans to give $3 million to three organizations involved in hurricane rescue efforts, officials said on Tuesday. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., chairman of the private Presidential Inaugural Committee, said the money will be divided equally among three groups — the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical group. All three groups are involved in relief efforts after a string of hurricanes that ravaged the Gulf Coast, Florida and the Caribbean. “The surplus of these privately donated funds will be put to great substantive use for relief victims throughout the heartbreaking regions of America impacted by the recent catastrophic disasters,” Mr. Barrack said in an email. “The committee will continue to curate worthwhile causes and make further contributions that serve America’s agenda and will conclude in accordance with its charter in the next few months,” he added. The committee raised $107 million for the inauguration, a record amount, accepting corporate individual donations in amounts up to $1 million. It remains unclear how much money the committee still has, and officials declined to say. They said they anticipated additional costs before winding down the committee. A spokeswoman for Melania Trump, the first lady, has said that some of the leftover funds have been used for renovations to the White House and Naval Observatory, home of the vice president. Mr. Barrack said the charities were involved in “disasters across America’s geographic palate.” "
"SAN DIEGO — On a dusty patch of land surrounded by a chain-link fence near the border here, workers this week began shoveling ground for a large-scale prototype for a border wall with Mexico. The eight different models of President Trump’s promised wall will range from 18 to 30 feet tall. Four will be made of concrete and four will use “other materials.” They are being built in a carefully protected area not far from a field, where, decades ago, Mexican migrants once openly gathered before crossing into the United States illegally. But in many ways a preview for a wall, and what it can and cannot accomplish, has been here for nearly two decades. Stretching roughly 20 miles along the southern edge of California and into the Pacific Ocean are two layers of steel and concrete, the toughest barrier in the country. The state has long been at the center of the debate over how to stop illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America. Now, the rest of the country is once again turning to the region that has long grappled with border security to see what the future of enforcement might look like. And despite California’s role as the epicenter for opposition to Mr. Trump, the administration apparently never considered placing the models of a would-be wall anywhere else. "
"Across the country N.F.L. players knelt or linked arms during the national anthem in a widespread demonstration against President Trump, who criticized athletes on Twitter and in a speech last weekend. In over 6,000 comments on the website of The New York Times and 4,600 more on The Times’s Facebook page, readers shared their reactions to the dramatic demonstrations. Some expressed pride over the display of free expression while others said that players only succeeded in disrespecting the American flag. Here is a selection of the thousands of comments we received, which have been edited for length and clarity. “I teach high school. Much to my students’ amazement, I have always explained that there could be no greater honor for the men and women who have given their lives for this country than not to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or the national anthem. I explain that they died precisely so that we would have that choice, not so that we may become automatons who stand and sit on cue.” As a three-tour combat vet of Iraq, I stand with these players to protest if they desire to do so. For those who oppose these N.F.L. players, I respect your right to do so. I served to protect all Americans not just the ones I agreed with. "
"WASHINGTON — The tax plan that the Trump administration outlined on Wednesday is a potentially huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans. It would not directly benefit the bottom third of the population. As for the middle class, the benefits appear to be modest. The administration and its congressional allies are proposing to sharply reduce taxation of business income, primarily benefiting the small share of the population that owns the vast majority of corporate equity. President Trump said on Wednesday that the cuts would increase investment and spur growth, creating broader prosperity. But experts say the upside is limited, not least because the economy is already expanding. The plan would also benefit Mr. Trump and other affluent Americans by eliminating the estate tax, which affects just a few thousand uber-wealthy families each year, and the alternative minimum tax, a safety net designed to prevent tax avoidance. The precise impact on Mr. Trump cannot be ascertained because the president refuses to release his tax returns, but the few snippets of returns that have become public show one thing clearly: The alternative minimum tax has been unkind to Mr. Trump. In 2005, it forced him to pay $31 million in additional taxes. Mr. Trump has also pledged repeatedly that the plan would reduce the taxes paid by middle-class families, but he has not provided enough details to evaluate that claim. While some households would probably get tax cuts, others could end up paying more. The plan would not benefit lower-income households that do not pay federal income taxes. The president is not proposing measures like a reduction in payroll taxes, which are paid by a much larger share of workers, nor an increase in the earned-income tax credit, which would expand wage support for the working poor.

"The sidewalks of Sunset Park, in Brooklyn, were overflowing with bottled water and boxes of donations on Tuesday, most bound for Puerto Rico, others to Mexico. At an East Harlem fund-raiser, Puerto Rican poets shouted their verses above the thunderous roar of the Metro-North Railroad trains. New York is in aid-overdrive after hurricanes and earthquakes struck the homelands of two of its largest Spanish-speaking populations, Puerto Rico and Mexico. As the devastation of Puerto Rico, in particular, has become clear, and amid criticism of the Trump administration for what some say is a slow response to the island’s crisis, anxious New Yorkers have been stepping up. “I’ve been a community organizer for 20 years and I can tell you, the outpouring of support is overwhelming. It brought the community together in a way I have not experienced,” said Eddie Santiago, 53, who was loading boxes of supplies in Sunset Park. For those with family members in Puerto Rico, he added, “this allows us to keep our sanity and our spirits high.” Christina Torres, 32, wearing a Puerto Rican flag bandanna tied around a belt loop, has not been able to reach her 63-year-old mother in Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria hit more than a week ago. Her mother has diabetes and asthma. “I’m all worked up, but this is my healing process,” Ms. Torres said as she packed cereal boxes to send over. The enthusiastic response has united Haitian activists, Colombian singers, Puerto Rican salsa bands, Chinese warehouse owners, New York police officers, Jennifer Lopez, a local Lions Club, a mosque and a Mexican entertainment mogul, to name a few. Planned New York fund-raisers include a rodeo, a 5K running race and a night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "
"In devising any complicated plan, there will be some knotty issues when it is tempting to offer vague promises of fixes that come later. The new Republican tax plan includes just such language, about a provision that wealthier Americans might find tempting to abuse. “The framework contemplates that the committees will adopt measures to prevent the recharacterization of personal income into business income to prevent wealthy individuals from avoiding the top personal tax rate,” says the tax reform blueprint presented on Wednesday by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration. It is an important asterisk to one of the core elements of the plan: a desire to tax income of “pass-through” businesses such as partnerships at a rate of only 25 percent. Currently, such income is taxed at the owners’ individual income tax rate, which is as high as 39.6 percent (and would fall to 35 percent in the Republican plan). The Republicans want the pass-through businesses to have a tax rate more in line with that of big, C-class corporations (which they are proposing to tax at 20 percent). But that vague language about the framework contemplating committees adopting measures shows that a fundamental question about this change remains unanswered. Namely, how do you reduce the rate on these pass-through businesses without also creating a wide-open lane for wealthy Americans to drastically reduce what they owe the government? The premise of having lower rates for businesses than individuals is to encourage investment and hiring, and achieve higher economic growth. The problem arises because there is often a fuzzy line between what constitutes “business income” and “labor income.” "
"The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience. Bassey Etim, our community editor, has responded to readers who questioned our policies governing which New York Times articles  are opened for comments: Why didn’t The Times’s community desk allow comments on a Sept. 23 article about men who believe the push for gender equality in technology has gone too far? The answer, I’m afraid, is rather dull: Our moderation resources are limited on weekends, which means fewer stories are opened for comment. And given the volume of news over the weekend — including President Trump’s continued criticism of N.F.L. players who are protesting the United States criminal justice system, and the declining fortunes of the Republican health care bill — many worthy news items had to forgo comments. Declining to host these discussions on nytimes.com is a difficult decision, but our research has consistently shown that Times readers prefer our moderated comments spaces. (Yes, most of our comments are still moderated by hand.) By weeding out trolling, abuse and off-topic content, we hope to create a space where everyone, no matter what their background or political beliefs, can feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. That said, we are continually working to expand our moderation capacity. But we won’t do so at the expense of abandoning our ideal of high-quality comments sections. "
"On the evening of Sept. 14, a man who looked an awful lot like Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president of the United States, boarded Air Canada Jazz Flight AC 8889 in Vancouver, British Columbia. He made his way down the aisle of the Bombardier CRJ 900, found his seat, 17A, in the economy cabin, then settled in for the 923-mile flight to his final destination, Whitehorse, in Canada’s Yukon Territory. He was carrying a camouflage backpack, but he checked some other luggage at the beginning of his journey, two cities earlier, at New York’s LaGuardia Airport. That luggage consisted of a high-end hunting bow and a duffel bag. Hunting bows are dangerous weapons, and when you travel from the United States to Canada with a bow, you are supposed to retrieve it and whatever other luggage you are traveling with at your initial port of entry, then escort it through customs for inspection before continuing your journey. He had entered Canada in Toronto but failed to retrieve his bow and duffel bag there, which is why, a half-hour after his flight arrived in Whitehorse, when most of the other passengers had long since gotten their things and gone on their way, he was still milling around the baggage carousel, looking increasingly forlorn, as it appeared his luggage was not going to show up. I was supposed to be on that same flight from Vancouver to Whitehorse — I spend a lot of time in the Yukon and keep an apartment there — but I’d missed a connection, so I was still in Vancouver when a Whitehorse friend who happened to be at the airport that night called to let me know about an unexpected visitor. “Are you sure it’s him?” “Yes.” “What’s he wearing?” “I don’t know … outdoorsy gear. Gore-Tex. Khakis and boots. Baseball cap.” “Is he with anyone?” “Yeah … older guy, squat and short. And a young kid, maybe early 20s. Southern accents.” “Are they Secret Service?” She didn’t think they were. They didn’t fit the template, physically or behaviorally. The kid, for one thing, was really young and acted it. He just seemed super psyched to be there, she said. Also, no earpieces. I asked her to look around again, to try to spot the agents, because I figured if it was him, they had to be there somewhere. As far as I knew, the president’s immediate family all had Secret Service protection, at all times. "
"OTTAWA — While President Trump has reserved his harshest words on trade for Mexico and China, Canada, one of America’s closest allies, has emerged as a major pressure point on trade, with the countries’ leaders trading barbs over lumber, dairy products, airplanes, and even magazine paper. In the latest move, the Trump administration imposed a huge tariff on a new aircraft made by Montreal’s Bombardier to compensate for what it deemed unfair subsidies by Canadian governments. The focus on Canada reflects the complexities that Mr. Trump faces in remaking the global rules of trade. He has threatened punitive tariffs on imported goods and vowed to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. He has promised to level the playing field with China and Mexico. But aggressively targeting China could disrupt the global supply chain, raising costs for American manufacturers. It could also inflame geopolitical tensions at a time when Washington needs Beijing’s help in dealing with North Korea. Relations with Mexico are already beleaguered over clashes on immigration, while taking on trade often means taking on exports from plants owned by American corporations. "
"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has aggressively pushed to dismantle regulations and downsize the organization, is threatening to reach outside his agency and undermine the Justice Department’s work enforcing antipollution laws, documents and interviews show. Under Mr. Pruitt, the E.P.A. has quietly said it may cut off a major funding source for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. Its lawyers handle litigation on behalf of the E.P.A.’s Superfund program seeking to force polluters to pay for cleaning up sites they left contaminated with hazardous waste. The E.P.A. reimburses the Justice Department for that work, paying more than $20 million annually in recent years, or enough for 115 full-time employees, budget documents show. But Mr. Pruitt has signaled that he wants to end those payments, potentially carving a major hole in the division’s budget, in a little-noticed line in the E.P.A.’s budget proposal in the spring. No decision will be made until Congress passes an E.P.A. budget for the fiscal year that begins in October, officials at both agencies said, although the payments were created by the executive branch, not Congress, so Mr. Pruitt may be able to act on his own. Congress hopes to pass a spending plan before a stopgap measure expires in mid-December. Mr. Pruitt, a former attorney general of Oklahoma with strong ties to the fossil fuel industry who frequently sued the E.P.A. before President Trump placed him in charge of it, has made no secret of his ambition to unwind its regulations and shrink its work force to curtail what he sees as federal overreach in protecting the environment and public health. The prospect of Mr. Pruitt expanding his efforts to the Justice Department has raised worries among employees in the Environment and Natural Resources Division about potential layoffs or furloughs and significant reductions in their work to fight pollution in the nation’s waterways, soil and air. Because they would continue to be responsible for pursuing Superfund cases, cutbacks would likely be spread across the division’s workload, which also includes suing oil companies, power plants and other corporations when they violate such antipollution laws as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act.

"The first general election debate in the race for New York City mayor just got more crowded, if not more colorful, as organizers announced on Wednesday that Bo Dietl, the bombastic and frequently profane former police detective running on his own political line, will join Mayor Bill de Blasio and his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis. Mr. Dietl met the threshold of having raised and spent $500,000 so far, set by the city’s Campaign Finance Board, and received word from one of the debate’s media sponsors, Spectrum NY1, that he had been invited to the Oct. 10 debate. “I’m not going to be Wild Man Bo,” he said in a telephone interview, speaking from a senior center on Staten Island. “I’m going to be a gentleman with specific facts. I’ve got real numbers that I’m going to push.” The inclusion of Mr. Dietl, who had been a supporter of President Trump before his botched attempt to run as a Democrat in the mayoral primary left him without a party registration, could redound to the benefit of Mr. de Blasio. Any splitting of the right-of-center vote could make it hard for Ms. Malliotakis, an assemblywoman from Staten Island, and Mr. Dietl to overcome the mayor’s strong Democratic registration advantage. Voters drawn to the forceful anti-de Blasio rhetoric of Ms. Malliotakis may find themselves lured by Mr. Dietl’s pugilistic and occasionally impolitic delivery of the same message. He is running without major party backing on a “Dump the Mayor” line. A spokeswoman for Charter Communications, which owns NY1, said that “while Dietl is not enrolled in the campaign finance program, we have decided to invite him based on his showing in a recent poll and his regular presence on the campaign trail.” "
"WASHINGTON — Unwilling to accept defeat, President Trump insisted on Wednesday that Republicans “have the votes” to dismantle much of the Affordable Care Act, and he predicted that the Senate would vote on legislation to do that in the first three months of next year. In the meantime, he said, he intends to negotiate with Democrats on a bipartisan health care bill and issue a “very major executive order,” probably next week. Under the order, Mr. Trump said, “people can go out, cross state lines, do lots of things and buy their own health care.” Millions of people could benefit, he said. Mr. Trump’s seemingly contradictory comments to journalists mystified members of both parties in both houses of Congress. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, laughed when asked about Mr. Trump’s assertion that the votes were there for health care. “I’d like to know where they are,” Mr. Thune said. “He must be using a different calculator than the rest of us.” In the space of 10 minutes, the president said seven times that “we have the votes” on health care. But that appeared to be based on some erroneous or optimistic assumptions: That Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, was in the hospital and unavailable to vote, and that other Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, were ready to vote yes. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — President Trump took aim at Facebook on Wednesday, calling the social network “anti-Trump.” But the social network insists it is pro-democracy and pro-truth — and the German election shows it. The president’s post on Twitter added to the pressure that Facebook has been under, facing accusations of partisanship from both sides of the political aisle. The social network has been accused of spreading fake news that influenced the outcome of the presidential election last year, and more recently, it acknowledged that Russians used fake accounts and Facebook ads to push divisive issues during the campaign. “Trump says Facebook is against him,” Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, said in a post addressing Mr. Trump’s tweet. “Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like.” The accusations have left Facebook with something to prove: that it is ready for the next election. “Every day I work to bring people together and build a community for everyone,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. “We hope to give all people a voice and create a platform for all ideas.” Mr. Zuckerberg expressed regret for initially appearing dismissive of his company’s potential effects on the 2016 election, saying that the topic was “too important.” But he also repeated a point he has made many times — that Facebook’s broader impact, “from giving people a voice to enabling candidates to communicate directly to helping millions of people vote,” had a much greater effect on the election than that of misinformation on the platform.

"Eight years after the Great Recession officially ended, the fruits of economic growth are finally spreading to low-wage workers, racial and ethnic minorities and other groups that were largely left out of the early stages of the recovery. But in a pattern that has become familiar in recent decades, the biggest gains continued to flow to the richest Americans. The typical American family had a net worth of $97,300 in 2016, up 16 percent from 2013 after adjusting for inflation, according to data released by the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday. The gains were broad-based, cutting across racial, educational and economic categories — a significant shift from the years immediately after the recession, when both income and wealth continued to decline for many families. But despite the gains, wealth also become more concentrated: • The richest 1 percent of households controlled 38.6 percent of total wealth in 2016, up from 36.3 percent in 2013. • The bottom 90 percent of households controlled 22.8 percent of all wealth. Inequality could grow even starker under the tax plan unveiled Wednesday by President Trump and congressional Republicans. That plan would sharply reduce taxes on corporations and certain forms of business income, as well as eliminate the estate tax, which falls on only the wealthiest households. Mr. Trump has said his plan would not reduce taxes on the rich over all, but most independent experts are skeptical of that claim. "
"SAN FRANCISCO — After a weekend when Americans took to social media to debate President Trump’s admonishment of N.F.L. players who do not stand for the national anthem, a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the issue with hashtags such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee. As Twitter prepared to brief staff members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, researchers from a public policy group have been following hundreds of accounts to track the continuing Russian operations to influence social media discourse and foment division in the United States. For three weeks, a harsh spotlight has been trained on Facebook over its disclosure that Russians used fake pages and ads, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign. But there is evidence that Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian influence campaign last year. In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using “bot” accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers. Twitter has struggled for years to rein in the fake accounts overrunning its platform. Unlike Facebook, the service does not require its users to provide their real name (or at least a facsimile of one) and allows automated accounts — arguing that they are a useful tool for tasks such as customer service. Beyond those restrictions, there is also an online black market for services that can allow for the creation of large numbers of Twitter bots, which can be controlled by a single person while still being difficult to distinguish from real accounts. Since last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts — human users and suspected bots alike — they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem. "
"President Trump and Republican leaders released their long-awaited tax plan on Wednesday, offering several misleading and false claims to bolster their framework for the overhaul. Here’s an assessment. The lack of details in the plan make it difficult to estimate how the cuts would be distributed across income levels, but Mr. Trump and the wealthy would “almost certainly benefit,” said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center. The Republican framework would eliminate the “death tax,” which applies to estates valued over $5.49 million in 2017. Mr. Trump has an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion. He might not personally see a tax break from the repeal, Mr. Williams said, because “he’ll be dead. But his heirs will.” The new plan also would repeal the alternative minimum tax, a parallel system of taxation that currently ensures that those who take deductions and try to exploit loopholes pay a minimum amount; it largely impacts people making between $200,000 and $1 million. Without this tax, Mr. Trump would have paid $31 million less in taxes in 2005, according to his tax return that year, which was disclosed on the “Rachel Maddow Show” in March. Reducing the top marginal income tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent would also benefit the wealthy, though the plan does not specify which income levels it would affect. Mr. Trump accurately said that the plan gives Congress leeway to raise the top rate. Scott Greenberg, of the conservative Tax Foundation, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about who would benefit more, given the scant level of specificity released. But he said “clearly some elements” of the plan would reduce the tax liability of high-income households. "
"After months of secret negotiations, the Trump administration and congressional leaders have come up with a tax plan — sort of. What they have really come up with is a wish list of tax cuts for the wealthy, with lots of “we’ll get back to you on that” promises where the details are supposed to be. This much is clear: The tax “framework” published by Republican leaders on Wednesday would greatly increase the federal deficit, would not turbocharge economic growth and could leave many middle-class families worse off by ending deductions they rely on. It would do little or nothing to improve the lot of the working class, a group President Trump says he is fighting for. It would instead provide a windfall to hedge fund managers, corporate executives, real estate developers and other members of the 1 percent. And can it be just a happy coincidence that Mr. Trump and his family would benefit “bigly” from this plan? On income taxes, the framework calls for reducing the top tax bracket to 35 percent, from 39.6 percent, which would benefit people earning $418,400 a year or more. It would also raise the rate for people in the lowest bracket to 12 percent, from 10 percent. Republicans say they will offset that particular burden by roughly doubling the standard deduction to $24,000 for a couple ($12,000 for a single person). In addition, the proposal would eliminate most itemized deductions except mortgage interest and charitable donations. This could greatly hurt middle-class families in New York, California and other states with high local and state taxes that the families will no longer be allowed to deduct from federal taxes. Under the guise of helping small businesses thrive and thereby creating jobs, the Republicans propose to lower the tax rates paid by people who earn money through private equity firms, partnerships, limited liability companies and other businesses — the very entities that Mr. Trump earns much of his income from. The framework would tax such so-called pass-through income at 25 percent, rather than at ordinary income tax rates. But here’s a depressing truth: The administration’s claims to the contrary, the plan would not help most small businesses, since they already pay less than 25 percent because their incomes put them in lower tax brackets. It would help millionaires, with the 400 richest households saving an average of $5.5 million, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Republicans want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which is primarily paid by upper-income families with lots of deductions. This tax accounted for a vast majority of the income tax Mr. Trump paid in 2005, according to a leaked copy of his return. And the framework would do away with the estate tax, which applies to estates larger than $5.49 million for an individual. Just 0.2 percent of the people who die every year owe the tax, and eliminating it would cost the government $269 billion over a decade. "

"MOBILE, Ala. — Senator Mitch McConnell and his minions wasted some $10 million — and President Trump squandered more of his shrinking political capital — trying to tell Alabama Republicans whom to choose as their nominee for the Senate. When their placeman, the temporary incumbent Luther Strange, lost by more than nine percentage points on Tuesday to Roy Moore, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, their ham-handed interventions were exposed as flagrant political malpractice. It’s a familiar pattern. When Republican Party committees or groups backed by Mitch McConnell tried to dictate choices to Republican voters in Florida in 2010, they got Marco Rubio instead; in Texas in 2012, it was Ted Cruz; in Nebraska in 2014, it was Ben Sasse. Voters in Alabama, like their predecessors, told the Washington bully-boys to stuff it. State parties can choose their own nominees, thank you very much, without orders from a Republican politburo. Mr. Strange was never the front-runner. Smart Alabama analysts had rated Mr. Moore the likely winner from the day qualifying for this special election closed. Local considerations and reputations, not Washington’s feuds, set the parameters. But the McConnell gang’s activities, especially their mendacious and noxious substance and character, made it more likely rather than less that Mr. Moore would emerge as the nominee. The more they polluted the airwaves and local mailboxes with nasty, ludicrous attacks on Mr. Moore (my house received nearly 20 glossy, redundant and tone-deaf mailers in a single week), the more Alabamians were both disgusted by their vile tenor and reminded that Mr. Strange was the choice of the Washington insiders they despise. Alabamians found it insulting to be told by Washingtonians that they should vote for Mr. Strange over Mr. Moore because the latter was “a career politician.” Note to Washington: Southerners don’t see judges as politicians, especially when the judge in question twice relinquished his seat not for money but for what many cultural conservatives call principle. Further note: Voters damn sure think that the “career politician” gibe is hypocritical when it is employed on behalf of a longtime Washington lobbyist who was running his fourth political race since 2006.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from our Los Angeles bureau chief, Adam Nagourney. It has long been one of the lesser-known facts about the life of Barack Obama. For all the talk about the former president and his Ivy alma maters — Columbia University and Harvard Law School — he actually spent the first two years of his higher education life, from 1979 to 1981, attending Occidental College in Los Angeles. For Occidental, or Oxy as it is known, Mr. Obama has long been its little-known claim to fame. That may be about to change for this 2,000-student private liberal arts college founded in 1887. Occidental is announcing on Wednesday the creation of the Barack Obama Scholars Program, a $40 million endowment intended to cover the $70,000 annual tab of tuition and board for 20 students a year. It will be aimed at providing four-year scholarships to veterans, community college transfers and those who are the first in their family to go to college. “My years at Occidental College sparked my interest in social and political causes, and filled me with the idea that my voice could make a difference,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. He said he hoped this program would “train the next generation of leaders and active citizens, and fill them with the conviction that they too can change the world.” "
"ARENYS DE MUNT, Spain — As Spain’s government tries almost everything it can to stop an independence referendum Sunday in the restive northeastern region of Catalonia, the standoff is escalating into a constitutional crisis emblematic of the larger forces tearing at European unity. With the support of the Spanish judiciary, Madrid has shut down websites and advertising campaigns that have promoted the vote. It has raided the offices of companies that would print the paper ballots. It has sent in thousands of police officers from outside the region, threatening to block polling stations. Last week, a dozen regional government officials were detained. Spain’s attorney general has warned that scores more could be arrested and prosecuted, including even the leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont. “We are witnessing the worst democratic regression since the death of Franco,” Mr. Puigdemont said in an interview, referring to Gen. Francisco Franco, the dictator whose death in 1975 opened the way for Spanish democracy. “What is happening in Catalonia is very serious.” Indeed, Catalonia’s standoff has steadily, if quietly, ratcheted up this year as world attention largely focused elsewhere, with pivotal elections taking place in critical European Union states, most recently last Sunday  in Germany. Those elections presented big tests of the bloc’s cohesion. The dispute over Catalonia instead presents a test of the cohesion of a member state itself. And it points to ominous storm clouds in other independent-minded regions, from Scotland to northern Italy. "
"After enthusiastically endorsing an Alabama senator’s campaign for re-election, President Trump distanced himself on Tuesday night from the candidate’s loss in the most Trumpian way possible: He deleted his supportive tweets. Hours after Senator Luther Strange, a Republican from Alabama, lost in Tuesday’s primary runoff, Mr. Trump excised at least three favorable Twitter posts, including one sent Tuesday morning. In that tweet, posted as the polls in Alabama opened, the president boasted that Mr. Strange “has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement.” Mr. Strange, who was appointed to the Senate early this year after Jeff Sessions vacated his seat to become attorney general under Mr. Trump, conceded on Tuesday night to Roy S. Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court justice whose candidacy was opposed by leading establishment Republicans. The deleted tweets were archived by ProPublica, a nonprofit journalism website, but are no longer public on Twitter, feeding into an intriguing legal debate about whether Mr. Trump is breaking the law when he expunges his tweets. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited Alabama on Friday to attend a rally for Mr. Strange. The closely watched campaign was seen by many as a barometer of Mr. Trump’s political sway. Mr. Strange was the first candidate endorsed by the president to lose an election since Mr. Trump took office. Around the same time the president was deleting tweets about Mr. Strange, he also deleted a tweet congratulating Mr. Moore on his victory. He later reposted that message, and early Wednesday he tweeted about speaking with Mr. Moore by telephone. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Late-night hosts heaped scorn on President Trump on Tuesday for what they called his slowness in addressing the fallout from Hurricane Maria. A week after the storm slammed Puerto Rico, Mr. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would go there to survey the damage. But Conan O’Brien says that with all Mr. Trump’s recent focus on N.F.L. protests, we can’t be sure he will. Seth Meyers was particularly upset that Mr. Trump chose Monday to remind his Twitter followers that Puerto Rico is in debt to Wall Street banks. "
"JARABULUS, Syria — Since 2011, the civil war in Syria has killed more than 470,000 people, mostly civilians. Millions of people have been displaced, and nearly five million Syrians have fled, creating the biggest refugee crisis since World War II. By far the greatest burden of receiving Syria’s refugees has fallen not on the United States or on Europe, but on Syria’s neighbors: Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Together, these countries are hosting most of the five million Syrians. Each is coping with huge challenges, with different degrees of success. In my visits to those three countries, I‘ve been struck by how much more dignity has been accorded to Syrian refugees in Turkey than in Jordan, and especially in Lebanon. Lebanon, with a population of six million, has long given refuge to Palestinians. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, some 450,000 Palestinian refugees are registered in Lebanon, most of them in camps. Even third-generation Palestinians born in Lebanon retain refugee status and live in refugee camps without a pathway to citizenship — almost 70 years after their ancestors arrived. Lebanese law even excludes refugees from most jobs. To this refugee population, Lebanon has now added an estimated 1.5 million Syrians. Many live in plastic tents in crowded camps with scarce access to clean water, surviving on aid from nongovernmental organizations. Because the Lebanese government doesn’t want the Syrians to become permanent residents as the Palestinians have, the camps are not officially recognized or managed by the United Nations. Resentment toward Syrian refugees has reached alarming levels. With elections next year, some Lebanese politicians are promising to deport the refugees once the war in Syria has been fought to a standstill. For the time being, Syrians receive charity, not dignity. Over the last 10 months, I visited several of these camps. In a camp in the Bekaa Valley, I met 12-year-old Nour and her sister, Aya, outside a bakery. As I stopped to buy sweets to celebrate the end of Ramadan, I asked Nour about her family. She told me that she and Aya had lost everyone. She now lives with her only remaining relative — an impoverished elderly aunt who has five children of her own. Nour hasn’t been to school since the outbreak of the war. In Lebanon, she spends her days in the street with her sister, begging. Nour and Aya are among thousands of Syrian children who have to roam the streets selling napkins, candies and bottled water. Others work on farms to support themselves and what is left of their families. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • “This is like in war.” Those were the words of an emergency doctor in Puerto Rico, where hospitals have been crippled by flooding, damage and fuel shortages since Hurricane Maria battered the island. The airport has become a place of concentrated anxiety and long waits. Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland are relying on strangers to contact relatives back home, and millions across the Caribbean remain without power or clean water. Here’s how you can help. President Trump will visit Puerto Rico and the storm-ravaged Virgin Islands next week. He called his administration’s response to recent hurricanes “great,” “amazing” and “tremendous.” • Obamacare overhaul is dead, again. “We haven’t given up on changing the American health care system,” Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said on Tuesday, adding, “We are not going to be able to do that this week.” "
"Today, President Trump and Congress will officially make a tax overhaul their big priority. The president will begin laying out at least some details in a speech in Indiana. Here’s what would affect corporate America, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal: • The corporate tax rate would drop to 20 percent, from 35 percent. • A 25 percent tax on “pass-through” businesses. • A one-time low tax for companies repatriating offshore profits, followed by a lower tax on overseas profits going forward. But some analysts said they did not expect more just yet. From The Journal: And Politico’s Nancy Cook and Ben White report on worries among lawmakers and administration officials about what the president will say: Republicans will need to tread carefully. From a new poll by The Washington Post and ABC News: • More than seven in 10 adults felt the current system favors the wealthy. • About 65 percent of Americans said large corporations pay too little in taxes. • About 45 percent favored lowering taxes for businesses, while 48 opposed such a change.

"INDIANAPOLIS — President Trump on Wednesday began an ambitious push to slash taxes and salvage what remains of his embattled legislative agenda in Congress this year, proposing a politically challenging array of tax cuts for individuals and businesses that would constitute the most sweeping changes to the federal tax code in decades. Mr. Trump, smarting from the latest defeat this week of his efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, cast the tax plan as an economic imperative and the fulfillment of a promise to his working-class supporters to deliver benefits in the form of lower taxes, better jobs and higher wages. “This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor and as wages start going up at levels that you haven’t seen in many years,” Mr. Trump told hundreds of supporters in a speech at the Indiana State Fair Grounds. But the president offered no measure of the plan’s cost and scant detail about how working people would benefit from a proposal that has explicit and substantial rewards for wealthy people and corporations, including the elimination of taxes on large inheritances and deep reductions in the rates paid by businesses large and small. After months of secret talks among Republicans, the nine-page proposal produced by the so-called Big Six working group prompts as many questions as it provides answers. Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul — or if it will favor the richest Americans. On the individual side, the plan would collapse the tax brackets from seven to three, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, the president said. The current top rate is 39.6 percent and the lowest rate is 10 percent. The framework also gives Congress the option of creating a higher, fourth, rate above 35 percent in the tax plan to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share. "
"I went to my first Kansas City Chiefs football game in December 2010, six months after my father, Army Col. John McHugh, had been killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul, Afghanistan. The team sent my newly minted Gold Star family pregame field passes and seats only a few rows behind the team’s bench. When we got to our seats after spending pregame on the field, I knew the national anthem was coming — and I knew how hearing this song would make me feel. (Even today, I still can’t listen to “The Star-Spangled Banner” without crying.) But when we stood to listen to the Eli Young Band, everything went wrong. They got the second verse wrong, and then got it wrong again when they did it over. “Get off the field, you’re drunk!” yelled a woman behind us who sported red-and-yellow face paint and seemed drunk herself. Once the band finally reached the end of the song, instead of singing “home of the brave,” the entire stadium screamed “home of the Chiefs!” They had replaced “brave” — a word that, to me, represented my father, a man who spent 24 years in the military and gave his life for the country — with a mascot. My blood boiled. “They do it at every game,” my boyfriend at the time whispered to me. Like it was no big deal. Just a football thing. The following year, I enrolled for college at Kansas State University, some 130 miles west of Arrowhead Stadium. At my first Wildcat football game in Bill Snyder Family Stadium, as I barely held myself together during the national anthem, the purple clad K-State fans shouted “Chiefs” in place of “brave.” We’re not even at a Chiefs game, I thought. Again, my blood boiled. "
"TV’s numerous series revivals usually make at least a gesture toward rationalizing why they need to tell one more story. “Twin Peaks: The Return” had Agent Cooper emerge from the Black Lodge after 25 years. “Gilmore Girls” brought Rory home to Stars Hollow after her grandfather’s death. “Will & Grace,” returning Thursday after eleven years, makes little such pretense. It’s back on TV because somebody at NBC wanted it back on TV. The 2006 no-longer-a-finale ended with Will Truman (Eric McCormack) and his best friend Grace Adler (Debra Messing) married to their respective lovers. Now, they’re not. A flash-forward introduced us to their two adult children meeting. Turns out the kids were never born. Why? The return episode suggests it was all a dream. Or part of it was. Most of it? Whatever. Do you want to watch the show or not? If you do, you’ll find — once you get past the painful first episode — pretty much what you would if you selected any random episode from the series’s eight-season run: a tart, high-strung quip-delivery device. Which is ... fine. The best and worst thing you can say about “Will & Grace” is that it’s the kind of half-hour confection that doesn’t cry out for obsession over narrative continuity. "
"We hear it all the time: Americans are more divided than ever, or at least since the Civil War. But the solar eclipse on Aug. 21 brought the United States together in greater numbers than most any national event in recent memory, according to a study released Tuesday by the University of Michigan. It estimated that 88 percent of American adults — about 215 million people — watched the solar eclipse, either in person or electronically. That’s nearly twice the number of people that watched the Super Bowl last year. It’s almost 30 percent more Americans than participated in the presidential election last year. If the eclipse had been a television program, it would have received the most viewers of any in American history; the audience for the cosmic event was almost 18 times as large as that of the “Game of Thrones” finale a week later. “This level of public interest and engagement with a science-oriented event is unparalleled,” said Jon Miller, director of the International Center for the Advancement of Scientific Literacy at the university’s institute for social research, in a statement. The number of viewers represents a greater percentage of Americans than those that brush their teeth daily, and more than double the number that floss daily, according to estimates from a 2014 survey. The study was conducted under a cooperative agreement with NASA. A follow-up survey is planned for October and November to see whether the viewing inspired people to seek out more information about astronomical occurrences. Most adults watched the eclipse, which was the first to be visible in some form coast-to-coast in the United States for nearly a century, with family, friends or co-workers. Though many documented the event using social media, only about 61 million people viewed it electronically, like via live streams, the study found. It suggested that about 70 percent of American adults, 154 million, had actually ventured outside to watch in person as the moon blocked out the sun. The eclipse was viewed by massive crowds in Oregon, Illinois, Kentucky and elsewhere. President Trump, Melania Trump and their son, Barron, watched the scene from the White House balcony in Washington, where President Trump dared to glance at the eclipse without wearing protective glasses. Space has had a uniting effect during turbulent times in America’s past. Even the huge number who witnessed the eclipse paled in comparison with those who tuned in to another lunar event: An estimated 600 million people worldwide watched the first moon landing on July 20, 1969.

"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — In “The Mayor,” a new ABC comedy series that premieres on Oct. 3, Brandon Micheal Hall plays Courtney Rose, a struggling rapper who runs for mayor of a small Northern California town in an ill-considered scheme to get the word out about his mixtape. Free publicity, no risk of actually winning — what could go wrong? Of course, Courtney does win, much to everyone’s surprise. Had Mr. Hall ever been in a similar predicament, where he chased after something he figured he had little shot at, and then got it? “I’m actually having that experience right now,” he said. In a Cinderella story that mirrors his character’s, this is Mr. Hall’s first leading role in a series, and by far the biggest role of his young career. The 24-year-old actor had appeared in six episodes on the TBS series “Search Party”; before that, he had appeared in single episodes as a rookie cop (on CBS’s “Unforgettable”), another rookie cop (in the Netflix series “The Characters”) and a delivery guy (on Comedy Central’s “Broad City”). “For ‘Broad City,’ I got to kiss Abbi Jacobson, so that was fun,” he said. Mr. Hall has strong comedic backup on “The Mayor,” most notably Lea Michele (“Glee,” “Scream Queens”) as his chief of staff and Yvette Nicole Brown (“Community”) as his mother. Rounding out the cast are the relative newcomers Marcel Spears and Bernard David Jones, as Courtney’s old pals turned City Hall staffers. “Those are my boys,” Mr. Hall said. “We’re going through this journey together, because it’s new for all of us. We’re like a boy band.” And then there’s Daveed Diggs, the Oakland-based rapper and Tony-winning actor (“Hamilton”), who is writing raps for every episode and coaching Mr. Hall on how to deliver them. (Mr. Diggs is also one of the show’s executive producers, a fact prominently displayed in the show’s trailer.) “What we’re asking Brandon to do is crazy,” Mr. Diggs said. “I recorded 100 songs before I let anybody hear them, but his first recorded songs are going to be out there for the public.” "
"WASHINGTON — Tom Price’s fondness for taxpayer-funded private jet trips drew the ire on Wednesday of President Trump, who said he was disappointed in his secretary of health and human services, and would personally examine any financial malfeasance. Mr. Trump, who vowed during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would wring the capital of excess financial waste, publicly voiced his disapproval of Mr. Price for taking dozens of privately chartered flights that crisscrossed the nation to resort areas and conferences, racking up a tab of $400,000. Before departing on a trip to Indiana to pitch his tax rewrite plan, the president, who has not released his tax returns or completely divested himself from his real estate empire, sought to put out the latest ethical fire set by a member of his cabinet. “I was looking into it, and I will look into it. And I will tell you personally, I’m not happy about it,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Price. “I am not happy about it. I’m going to look at it. I am not happy about it, and I let him know it.” According to a senior administration official familiar with Mr. Trump’s thinking, the president’s willingness to ferret out financial wrongdoing is not good news for Mr. Price, a physician and a former Georgia congressman who has been a vocal proponent of cost-cutting within his own agency. Mr. Trump, who is known to dislike appearances of financial waste, is said to be increasingly frustrated with a series of reports published by Politico about Mr. Price’s spending habits. Politico has revealed that Mr. Price has made at least 26 such flights, including trips to Nashville, where his son lives and where Mr. Price owns a condominium, and to St. Simons Island, a Georgia resort area where Mr. Price owns property and recently spoke at a medical conference. Mr. Price also chartered a flight that included travel to Philadelphia from Dulles International Airport in Virginia, a distance of about 130 miles. "
"To the Editor: Re “Tyranny of the Minority” (column, Sept. 26): Brava to Michelle Goldberg on her first New York Times column. To protect our democracy, at least three things must happen. First, gerrymandering on partisan-politics grounds must be declared as impermissible as it is on racial and other historically invidious grounds. Second, voter suppression laws must be outlawed. Third, and perhaps the linchpin of the foregoing, we must correct the absurdity of according the same free speech rights to business entities as are vouchsafed to actual human beings. Unfortunately, these issues will have to be battled before the Supreme Court, where, alas, the rich and powerful currently control the spoils of constitutional interpretation. LINDA RABIN HAMMELL
LATHRUP VILLAGE, MICH. To the Editor: Bill Clinton was twice elected president with less than 50 percent of the popular vote, admittedly in three-way races. Did his presidency constitute undemocratic, minority rule? Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 1.5 million votes in the 49 states outside of California. Should California have the power to outweigh a majority in the other 49 states? Mr. Trump carried 30 of 50 states. Would it be more democratic if the winner in only 20 states became president? I’m no Trump supporter, but the arguments in this column don’t amount to much more than liberal whining about the fact that someone the left despises was elected president. Democrats, get your voters out. They probably constitute a majority, but if they can’t be bothered to turn out, what do you expect? "
"Roy S. Moore, who won a special Republican primary runoff for an Alabama Senate seat on Tuesday, is a staunch evangelical Christian, and his often-inflammatory political beliefs are informed by his strongly held religious views. He has condemned homosexuality and used offensive language when talking about race, recently referring to Native Americans and Asian-Americans as “reds and yellows.” His insistence on the primacy of religion over American law has twice led him to be taken off the Alabama Supreme Court: once in 2003, for refusing to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from the courthouse, and again in 2016, when he asked state probate judges to disregard a federal ruling on same-sex marriage. Here are some of the ways that Mr. Moore has described his own views in the past. Mr. Moore has long been virulently opposed to gay marriage and has condemned same-sex relations altogether. In a 2002 concurring opinion in a case that granted a lesbian custody of her son, he wrote, “Homosexual behavior is a ground for divorce, an act of sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one’s ability to describe it.” He added that homosexuality could disqualify parents from having the right to custody. “I write specially to state that the homosexual conduct of a parent — conduct involving a sexual relationship between two persons of the same gender — creates a strong presumption of unfitness that alone is sufficient justification for denying that parent custody of his or her own children or prohibiting the adoption of the children of others,” the opinion read.

"ORLANDO, Fla. — The American fast food industry is built on two pillars: cheap hamburgers, and cheap labor. As economists try to understand why wages have stagnated across the country’s economy, they are examining the cheap labor part of the equation closely. A few have zeroed in on an obscure clause buried in many fast-food franchise agreements as a possible contributor to the problem. Some of fast-food’s biggest names, including Burger King, Carl’s Jr., Pizza Hut and, until recently, McDonald’s, prohibited franchisees from hiring workers away from one another, preventing, for example, one Pizza Hut from hiring employees from another. The restrictions do not appear in a contract that employees sign, or even see. They are typically included in a paragraph buried in lengthy contracts that owners of fast-food outlets sign with corporate headquarters. Yet the provisions can keep employees tied to one spot, unable to switch jobs or negotiate higher pay. A lack of worker mobility has long been viewed as contributing to wage stagnation because switching jobs is one of the most reliable ways to get a raise. Defenders of the practice argue that the restaurants spend time and money training workers and want to protect their investment. But two lawsuits, filed this year against McDonald’s and Carl’s Jr.’s parent company, CKE Restaurants Holdings, contend that such no-hire rules violate antitrust and labor laws. "
"SAN JUAN, P.R. — Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico discussed the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and the needs of island residents with a reporter from The New York Times on Tuesday. Here are his remarks, edited for length and clarity. Q. What keeps you up at night? A. The safety of the people of Puerto Rico. I haven’t slept much. It’s been very intense, but I am committed to making sure that during this emergency period we have our people safe, we can make sure they are alive, getting food and water. After we stabilize the situation, we can think about how to rebuild Puerto Rico. Q. What’s your biggest worry? A. Here’s my worry: the perception that this is just, for lack of a better term, this was a regular hurricane impact. This is a major catastrophic event here. Puerto Rico, within the span of two weeks, received two Category 4-5 hurricanes. That has never happened anywhere. The devastation has been enormous. Q. Have you spoken to President Trump? A. I have spoken to him at least five times. A few hours ago, I was in the Situation Room briefing him. He has been acting proactively. He issued two pre-landfall emergency declarations for Puerto Rico. That had never been done before. He declared Puerto Rico a disaster area practically while the storm was still hitting Puerto Rico. Q. What do you tell him? The phones are down; the lines are around the streets and back; hospitals are closed. Where do you begin to tell him what you need? A. There are several priorities. The health care situation, making sure we have hospitals running, making sure we have situational awareness of those hospitals. "
"The N.F.L. has been loud lately. Its sponsors, not so much. The debate over players’ kneeling during the national anthem — simmering since last year, when the San Francisco 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick knelt to protest police brutality against African-Americans — boiled over last week when, during a speech in Alabama, President Trump declared that players like Mr. Kaepernick ought to be fired. Far from discouraging the protests, Mr. Trump’s remarks galvanized them, and on Sunday, players nationwide knelt or locked arms in a show of solidarity against the president. In one of his signature Twitter outbursts, Mr. Trump called on football fans to boycott the N.F.L. It is hard to say whether the fans are on board, but the league’s sponsors evidently are not. Few of them have commented on the protests at all — perhaps reflecting a calculation that this is a controversy best kept out of — and what response they have given has consisted, for the most part, of bland statements. Here’s a roundup of advertisers’ reactions, most of which come from public statements made by the companies. Anheuser-Busch and Bose spoke with Yahoo Finance. NIKE: “Nike supports athletes and their right to freedom of expression on issues that are of great importance to our society.” ANHEUSER-BUSCH: “At Anheuser-Busch we have a long heritage of supporting the institutions and values that have made America so strong. That includes our armed forces and the national anthem as well as diversity, equality and freedom of speech. We proudly employ over 1,100 military veterans and we work every day to create an inclusive environment for all of our employees. Because only together can we achieve our dream of bringing people together for a better world.” BOSE: “Bose was founded in the United States, and our world headquarters is in Massachusetts, where it’s been for over 50 years. It’s now surrounded by several other Bose facilities — and at all of them, at all times, we proudly fly the American flag. It’s a symbol of our great country which protects the freedom for every person to express their views. We respect that freedom, whether we agree with those views or not.” FORD: “We respect individuals’ rights to express their views, even if they are not ones we share.” HYUNDAI: “We stand for and respect individuals’ freedoms to express their First Amendment rights in any peaceful manner in which they choose. We also stand for inclusion, freedom and all that represents those values.” UNDER ARMOUR: The company “stands for the flag and by our athletes for free speech, expression and a unified America.” The N.F.L.’s other sponsors include Barclays, Bridgestone, Campbell’s, Castrol, Dannon, DMI, Extreme Networks, FedEx, Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Marriott, Mars, Microsoft, Nationwide, News America, Papa John’s, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, Quaker, USAA, Verizon and Visa.

"Paul Horner, a writer who trolled the nation with his fabricated news stories and claimed that he was responsible for Donald J. Trump’s election victory, died last week. The cause was a suspected drug overdose, the authorities in Arizona said Wednesday. Mr. Horner, 38, was found dead in his bed in Laveen, Ariz., on Sept. 18, according to Mark Casey, a Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office spokesman. His family said he had been known to abuse prescription drugs, Mr. Casey said, and “evidence at the scene suggested this could be an accidental overdose.” There were no signs of foul play. Mr. Horner’s fraudulent articles could be found on Facebook, various news domains that he created, and in years past, on the fake news website National Report. Even his byline was fake. He often went by the name Jimmy Rustling, as he did on this story, in which he claimed protesters were getting paid $3,500 to disrupt Trump rallies. That article, which was tweeted out by Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, now has a taunting disclaimer at the top that says the story isn’t real: “I personally went to two Donald Trump rallies and I can say with 100% certainty that NONE of the protesters were getting paid,” the statement says. “This story I wrote is mocking all of you sheep who think protesters are getting paid.” "
"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Republicans are confronting an insurrection on the right that is angry enough to imperil their grip on Congress, and senior party strategists have concluded that the conservative base now loathes its leaders in Washington the same way it detested President Barack Obama. The defeat of Senator Luther Strange, Republican of Alabama, in a primary election on Tuesday night appears to have ushered in a season of savage nomination fights and activist-led attacks on party leaders, especially on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Despite enjoying the strong backing of President Trump, Mr. Strange lost by a wide margin to Roy Moore, a firebrand religious activist and former judge, who denounced Mr. Strange as a puppet of the Senate leader. Mr. Strange’s demise, senior party strategists and conservative activists said Wednesday, makes it likelier that Republican incumbents in the House and Senate will face serious primary challenges in 2018, fueled by anger at the party’s apparent ineptitude at wielding power in Washington. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist and a vehement antagonist of the party establishment, said on Tuesday night that he intends to target Republican senators in Mississippi, Arizona and Nevada for defeat. And that rebellion could spread. Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader, was blunt: “Every Republican senator had better get prepared for a challenge from the far right.” If nothing else, divisive intraparty battles could cost party donors tens of millions of dollars and weaken Republicans’ position in a year when Democrats were already poised to make gains, at least in the House. They could also reshape the party’s agenda, driving it further in the direction of Mr. Trump’s strain of nationalism rather than the more conventional, business-oriented agenda espoused by Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. Republicans increasingly worry that their base’s contempt for Mr. McConnell is more potent than its love for Mr. Trump. Mr. McConnell could be an anchor around incumbents in the same fashion as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, who is routinely used to undermine Democratic candidates. The loudest applause Mr. Moore received during an election-eve rally came when he declared, “Mitch McConnell needs to be replaced.” "
"BRIGHTON, England — Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, told supporters on Wednesday that their brand of left-wing politics had brought them to “the threshold of power,” as he ended an annual conference that consolidated his grip over the party and marked another stage in his journey from fringe politician to potential prime minister. In a speech of around 80 minutes, Mr. Corbyn mocked his detractors, including Prime Minister Theresa May, and criticized President Trump, winning frequent applause from party members who have been buoyed by Labour’s performance in elections in June, which exceeded most expectations and deprived Mrs. May and her Conservative Party of a parliamentary majority. The four-day meeting, in the seaside city of Brighton, underscored Labour’s shift to the left, focused in large part around Mr. Corbyn, who was once seen by many in his party as an electoral liability. In some respects a British version of Bernie Sanders, Mr. Corbyn, 68, has championed an agenda that includes nationalizing utilities, abolishing university tuition fees and increasing taxes for the wealthy and for corporations. Mrs. May built her election campaign around the assumption that, with his left-wing platform, Mr. Corbyn was unelectable, but many voters saw Mr. Corbyn as personable and authentic, compared with wooden performances from the prime minister. A member of Parliament since 1983, he spent years as a backbencher before winning a once-improbable bid for leadership of the party after Labour lost a general election in 2015. On Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn mocked Mrs. May’s campaign claims that she provided “strong and stable” leadership and that voting for Labour would usher in a “coalition of chaos.” "
"To the Editor: Re “The Abbie Hoffman of the Right,” by David Brooks (column, Sept. 26): Calling the late Abbie Hoffman a buffoon and comparing him to President Trump sullies the reputation of a 1960s activist who was a leader of a youth movement that changed the course of American history. Yes, Mr. Hoffman was a master of “political theater,” but he was no buffoon. Mr. Hoffman took to the streets of a divided America, risking life and limb in opposition to the Vietnam War, racism and police brutality. He lived a simple, self-sacrificial life and faced trumped-up charges as a member of the Chicago Eight. What risks for his beliefs has President Trump taken? PATRICK O’NEILL, GARNER, N.C. "
"LONDON — This week’s Labour Party conference, an annual gathering and one of the landmark events of the British political calendar, had an unexpected attendee: a bodyguard. He was not there to protect Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s leftist leader, or any of the party’s grandees. Instead he guarded Laura Kuenssberg, the political editor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. As one of Britain’s leading political journalists, with a reputation for asking tough questions, and as a woman, Ms. Kuenssberg has long been the target of vitriolic abuse and threats of violence. But the sight of her being shadowed by a guard, and the realization that her employers must now deem those threats credible enough to warrant giving her protection, has shocked some members of the British commentariat. “It is so profoundly depressing,” said Jenni Russell, a prominent columnist and former BBC editor who also attended the conference. “The graphic level of threats to women is quite extraordinary and it’s one of the worst things to have happened in recent British public life.” Multiple journalists have seen Ms. Kuenssberg with a guard this week, although she and the BBC both declined to comment, or to confirm or deny the news. Others spoke of how her experience was part of an international trend in which public discourse has become more venomous, and trust in mainstream journalists has eroded. Her case has some parallels with the intimidation of journalists at rallies during President Trump’s election campaign, in particular of Katy Tur, an NBC correspondent who was protected by a Secret Service agent as she left a rally in 2015 at which the future president had singled her out for criticism.

"I believe Valerie Plame, the former C.I.A. operative and fading liberal celebrity, when she says she missed the anti-Semitic “undercurrents” in an article she called “provocative, but thoughtful.” I believe her when she says she “zeroed in on the neocon criticism” but missed the article’s more prejudicial elements. The article was titled “America’s Jews Are Driving America’s Wars.” It uses variants of the word “Jew” 22 times. The word “neocons” appears only twice. I believe Plame is telling the truth when she says the subtlety was lost on her. I believed Donald Trump when he insisted last year there was nothing amiss with him tweeting the image of a six-pointed star superimposed over a pile of $100 bills alongside a picture of Hillary Clinton and the caption “Most corrupt candidate ever!” I believe him when he said it was a sheriff’s star, not a Star of David. I did not believe white supremacist David Duke when he said there was “no way” it was a sheriff’s star. What does David Duke know about dog whistles anyway? I believe the national council of the American Studies Association was taking an “ethical stance” when it voted unanimously in 2013 for an academic boycott of Israeli institutions. I find nothing askance in the association never previously boycotting the institutions of any other country. I believe the group’s then-president, Curtis Marez, made a valid argument that Israel was targeted because “one has to start somewhere.” I believe the A.S.A. will one day get around to boycotting the academic institutions of China for its occupation of Tibet, or of Russia for its occupation of Ukraine, or of India for its alleged occupation of Kashmir. I believe there’s nothing discriminatory in singling out the Jewish state for behavior the A.S.A. accepts from other states. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Restrictions on North Korea are expanding. China is closing joint ventures and ordering North Korean companies to leave by January. South Korea is strengthening pre-emptive strike, defense and retaliatory capabilities. (Above, President Moon Jae-in at an Armed Forces Day ceremony on Thursday.) And Malaysia barred its citizens from traveling to the country, complicating an Asian Cup soccer match set for next Thursday in Pyongyang. The story of two North Korean spies arrested in Ukraine in 2011 shows the extent to which Pyongyang has scoured the world for missile technology. _____ "
"Luis Rivera-Pérez was a baby-faced 18-year-old recruit when he left his home in San Juan in 1951 to fight in Korea with the 65th Infantry Regiment, a storied Puerto Rican unit known as the Borinqueneers. He aged quickly in combat, venturing out on night patrols where they used flamethrowers to incinerate enemy troops hidden in caves. In one battle, they slogged up a hillside for a bayonet assault, only to be pinned down by relentless gunfire. “It was a massacre,” said Mr. Rivera-Pérez, 84. “There were so many wounded and dead.” He was among a group of Borinqueneers — a name rooted in the island’s past — who were pinned down again this week, this time in a hotel in a drab industrial corner near Kennedy International Airport in Queens. They were en route to Puerto Rico from South Korea, where they had been honored by its government for their military service, when Hurricane Maria devastated their island home, leaving them stranded with little word from relatives and friends. Just as scarce was encouragement from President Trump, their commander in chief, who has been faulted by many for spending more time attacking football players exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest than addressing the mounting humanitarian crisis. They were flabbergasted when the president’s first substantive remarks about the tragedy was how the island “sadly” had to deal with the $73 billion debt it owes hedge funds and banks. They felt it was an insult to them — American citizens by act of Congress and birth — who felt they had already paid a steep price in blood and youth decades ago. Indeed, this fighting force — lauded by no less than Gen. Douglas MacArthur — has seen action from World War I through Korea, and was among the last of the segregated military unit to be disbanded. Their bravery and sacrifice is chronicled in citations, medals and etched on headstones and remembered in street names and on postage stamps. On their recent South Korea trip, strangers stopped them on the street to offer thanks and gratitude. “The Koreans respect and love us more than our own people in the United States,” lamented Victor Santiago Latimer, 87, another veteran still living with emotional and physical wounds from the conflict. “The president should be a man with a bigger heart and take care of things. Right now he says we have to pay the debt. What does he mean? That we owe and get nothing in return? Every day the U.S. takes away from what we have. We’re not a state, but we’re part of the U.S., but he is not interested in that. When we went to war, the Puerto Ricans were hand in hand with the U.S. We defended the nation. We were with you. Why are we not treated well?” That last question has been asked by generations of Puerto Ricans, from those living on an island whose fate rests with Congress, to those who came to New York and endured prejudice and indifference from their fellow citizens as they worked hard at blue-collar jobs. More recently, the island’s fiscal crisis has sparked a new exodus, including many professionals, to outposts like Orlando, Fla. "
"By any measure, Tahseen Chowdhury is no ordinary 17-year-old. He is president of the student government at Stuyvesant High School, among New York City’s most selective public schools, and leads the student advisory council for the borough of Manhattan. He even helped found two companies: an event photography business and a firm that teaches students computer programming and engineering. It stands to reason that Mr. Chowdhury, a senior, would cast the widest possible net when applying to college. But he is confining his search to New York — and not because he needs to stay close to family in East Elmhurst, Queens. Rather, Mr. Chowdhury, a Democrat, is mounting a campaign for the State Senate, and wants to be within striking distance of the State Capitol in Albany. With the State Legislature in session from January to June, Mr. Chowdhury envisions an unusual schedule of alternating semesters, one that would spread his college career over eight years. “If I win, I would take the spring semesters off to be in Albany and then go to college in the fall,” he said. “I will have to choose a college that will work with that schedule.” Mr. Chowdhury’s campaign is hardly unique. Across the New York region, and indeed the country, young people are turning their attention to politics, motivated in part by the election of President Trump. From mayoral races to state legislative campaigns, teenagers and others who are too young to vote are canvassing neighborhoods and learning the intricacies of electoral politics. Some are running for office themselves. The trend is heartening to academics and observers of public service like Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz. Dr. Benjamin said he has long detected a distinct lack of interest in elective office in young people, even those otherwise active in environmental advocacy and identity politics. "
"Oakland, Calif. — Young migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador come to this country fleeing violence and lives that are often dictated by savage gangs. It’s expensive to get here. They often arrive with thousands of dollars of high-interest debt and little or no English skills. And they face an administration that insists that they are gangsters bringing bloodshed and gang warfare to American cities. In fact, these young people are often fleeing gangs. And the challenges they face in the United States make them particularly vulnerable for recruitment into the same violent gangs they left home to escape. “They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful quiet neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields,” President Trump said of the members of MS-13, a transnational gang composed largely of Central American youth; its activity has been growing in recent years, both in the United States and in Central America. A few weeks ago, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told law enforcement officers that these young, undocumented immigrants were “wolves in sheep’s clothing.” I work at Oakland International High School in Oakland, Calif. It is a public school with a population made up entirely of recently arrived immigrant students. Today, over 25 percent are unaccompanied minors — young people who crossed into the United States without papers or parents — who have been released from immigration custody and placed in deportation proceedings to await their day in court. Since we opened 10 years ago, our students’ gang involvement has markedly decreased. This is because we have gotten better at what we were meant to do, namely: provide programs that teach skills, offer support services that reduce barriers to coming to school, and foster a sense of community. We offer what the gangs offer, but better. I had one student who came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor from Honduras. His mother left him when he was little, and he never knew his father. He lived with his grandmother until she died. He was just 13. For two years he lived alone in her house, selling water bottles on the street on behalf of a neighboring family. Sometimes they invited him over for dinner; other times they didn’t. He told me that he saw this life in Honduras as a dead end. He crossed into Guatemala, rode on top of trains through Mexico, hiding what little money he had pressed against the inside of his cheek, and swam across the Rio Grande. He was apprehended at the border, placed into a youth detention center, and sent to live with his aunt in Oakland, pending his deportation hearing. He enrolled at Oakland International but, after a couple of weeks, his attendance waned. Soon he stopped coming altogether. "
"BARCELONA — A mayor from the Spanish hinterland, Carles Puigdemont was a relative unknown until thrust into the leadership of Catalonia last year. He was a compromise choice to break a deadlock among separatist parties. It was “a last-minute and accidental arrival through the back door,” Mr. Puigdemont recalled in an interview this week at the Gothic palace of his regional government in Barcelona. Now, as Catalonia attempts to hold an independence referendum on Sunday, Mr. Puigdemont, 54, sits at the heart of a constitutional crisis for Spain, an insurgent in the eyes of Madrid. If the vote goes on, as he says it will, Mr. Puigdemont (pronounced POOTCH-da-mon) could be barred from politics and go to prison for misusing public money to hold a referendum that Spanish courts have ordered suspended. The prospect seems to leave him unbothered. Mr. Puigdemont may be an accidental leader, but he is a purposeful proponent that Catalonia — prosperous and distinct in culture, history and language — should be independent. A former journalist, with a Beatles mop-top haircut, he was already calling for separation from Spain on the streets of Barcelona in the early 1980s, when secessionism was a marginal movement in Catalonia.

"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security will soon begin collecting social media data from all immigrants entering the United States, part of what agency officials call an effort to more effectively screen those coming to the country but privacy advocates see as an unnecessary intrusion that would do little to protect national security. The department will begin collecting the information on Oct. 18, the same day the Trump administration’s new travel ban on citizens of seven countries and restrictions on those from two others are set to take effect. Green card holders and naturalized citizens will also have their social media information collected, with the data becoming part of their immigration file. It was unclear whether the monitoring would take place only in the application process or could continue afterward. The department published the new requirement in the Federal Register last week, saying it would collect “social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results,” which would be included in an applicant’s immigration file. It said the data would come from “publicly available information obtained from the internet, public records, public institutions, interviewees, commercial data providers.” The data collection has alarmed privacy groups and lawyers, who expressed concerns on about how the department would use the information. Advocates say they also worry that the monitoring could suck in information on American citizens who communicate over social media with immigrants. “This would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on the free speech that’s expressed every day on social media,” Faiz Shakir, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. “This collect-it-all approach is ineffective to protect national security and is one more example of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda.” "
"On a gray day in late January — four days after President Trump’s inauguration and three days after the Women’s March — I received a call from the newly constituted office of Ivanka Trump. I was invited to the White House to discuss a computer-science education initiative she was spearheading. She wanted the organization I founded, Girls Who Code, to join. Despite my deep personal opposition to many of the positions President Trump had already expressed, I was prepared, in the interest of furthering our mission, to collaborate with his new administration the way we had with the Obama administration. Three days later, the president signed Executive Order 13769, which indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States and blocked citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entry for 90 days, keeping the “Muslim Ban” promise Trump made on the campaign trail. I immediately thought of the many young immigrants — including Syrian refugees — who participate in Girls Who Code, which is dedicated to educating, empowering, and equipping girls with the skills and resources to pursue opportunities in technology and engineering. I thought of the girls wearing hijabs in our after-school clubs, many of them from families with roots in the seven countries Mr. Trump had singled out. I thought of the Islamophobia many of them have faced. By putting anti-Muslim stereotypes and bigotry into policy, the president of the United States, I worried, had just painted a target on their backs. If I agreed to work with his administration, how could I look these girls in the eye? And what good would it do to advance my organization’s educational mission if I offered implicit support to an administration that didn’t see these girls and members of their families as fully American — let alone as the leaders we hope they will become? I declined Ms. Trump’s invitation. This week, President Trump directed the Education Department to commit at least $200 million toward computer science education. Several corporate and nonprofit partners were on hand at a Detroit event to celebrate the occasion. Girls Who Code was not. While I have great respect for the partners participating in this program, many of whom support the work of Girls Who Code, I do not believe this initiative — nor any partnership with this White House — can reverse the harm this administration has already done in attempting to legitimize intolerance. Indeed, collaborating with this administration, on any issue, emboldens it only further. "
"WASHINGTON — Republicans’ release of a sweeping plan to rewrite the tax code has set off a scramble among Washington lobbyists and trade groups to protect valuable tax breaks and other long-ingrained provisions. The plan’s scant details make it hard to know what, exactly, is on the chopping block. But within hours of the plan’s unveiling on Wednesday, flash points emerged over measures that supporters said could hurt the housing market, raise borrowing costs and increase the tax burden on families in high-tax states. The response put Trump administration officials on the defensive as they embark on a campaign to sell the plan. “The lobbyists shouldn’t have input, but the people in Congress should have input, and we’ll be working with them closely as we turn this into a bill and get it to the president to sign this year,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Fox Business Network on Thursday. Opposition from the real estate industry was swift and vocal, with trade groups strongly criticizing elements of the plan that they say will make home-buying less attractive and weaken the housing market. While the plan specifically calls for preserving the mortgage interest deduction, real estate agents are warning that a proposal to double the standard deduction will make taxpayers less likely to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage deduction. The deduction is a key incentive for people to buy homes, since it reduces their taxable income by the amount of interest paid on a mortgage. Real estate agents worry that doubling the standard deduction may provide a richer tax break than itemizing and claiming the mortgage deduction. "
"To the Editor: Re “Sweeping Trump Tax Plan Vague on Details and Cost” (front page, Sept. 28): You write of the Trump tax plan, “Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul — or if it will favor the richest Americans.” Oh, please! The plan includes a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans — from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. The plan abolishes the estate tax completely. The plan creates a top tax rate of 25 percent for “pass-through businesses” like partnerships and sole proprietorships. Sounds like a huge tax cut for the very wealthy! The plan has no mention of carried interest, the famous loophole that lets wealthy hedge fund managers pay much lower taxes than salaried workers. WILLIAM BLANCHARD
CAMBRIDGE, MASS. To the Editor: Re “The Republican Tax Boondoggle” (editorial, Sept. 28): The Republican deficit hawks who shrieked so loudly whenever President Barack Obama proposed desperately needed infrastructure spending have mutated into fantasy elephants with wings. Suddenly with a Republican president in office and in desperate need of something their party can tout as a major legislative achievement, they are blithely untroubled by the danger of an exploding federal deficit. Once again Republicans are touting the fable of supply-side economics, where greatly increased growth magically makes expanding deficits vanish. No matter that as far back as Reaganomics or as recently as in Kansas it just doesn’t actually work. And rather than employing deficit spending for emergency repairs to our dangerously decaying infrastructure, the benefits of Trumponomics appear to disproportionally go to the president and others already well off.

"PARIS — President Trump has rarely been accused of running a surplus in predictability. As his administration this week imposed punitive tariffs on a Canadian airplane manufacturer, it exacerbated confusion over where Mr. Trump might venture next in his zeal to redraw the terms of American commerce with the world. Trade experts strained to find evidence of a cohesive strategy, noting that Mr. Trump has sparred over trade with a sometimes bewildering array of nations. He has frequently trained his wrath on China and Mexico, accusing them of stealing American jobs. He has attacked Germany for its exporting prowess. He has threatened to blow up a trade deal with South Korea. Few could have foreseen that a primary target of Mr. Trump’s actions would be a stalwart ally, Canada. “He has not had a discernible trade policy from the beginning,” said Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “I don’t think there’s a theory that unites the various decisions of his administration’s trade policies, other than things that make a news splash.” For global companies seeking to divine the new rules of the Trump era, ambiguity has become a seemingly permanent state of affairs.

"Another day, another rant from Donald Trump. This time, the president took aim at Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who spent the majority of last season sitting or kneeling during the national anthem to draw attention to police brutality and racial injustice.

"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — The first public whiff of the drama came two years ago, with a surprise divorce filing by the governor’s wife of more than 50 years. A surreptitious, salacious recording surfaced months later. Then, this past April, Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama, a Republican, resigned under the threat of impeachment over his relationship with a close aide. It was only this week, though, that Alabama’s in-house sex scandal made its mark on national politics, convulsing the Republican Party and shutting down the Senate career of Luther Strange, a former state attorney general who many here once believed would become a Capitol Hill fixture. Instead, Mr. Strange may be little more than a historical footnote, his tenure derailed, in part, because he accepted Mr. Bentley’s appointment to an open Senate seat while he oversaw an investigation into the governor’s office. Although some of Mr. Strange’s defeat in Tuesday’s Republican primary runoff, at the hands of the evangelical jurist Roy S. Moore, can be traced to frustration and fury about the machinations of Washington, the senator struggled mightily to move beyond unproven suspicions that he and Mr. Bentley had cut some kind of corrupt deal. “The Bentley controversy shook the people of Alabama at their very core,” said Angi Stalnaker, who managed one of Mr. Bentley’s campaigns for governor. “All of our corruption up until now had been our own private family embarrassment,” she said. “Unfortunately for Senator Strange, he had a timing issue: He was tangentially involved in a controversy that was the one where Alabamians finally said, ‘Enough.’” Mr. Moore, who brandished a revolver during a rally on Monday, was never able to show off a smoking gun tying Mr. Strange’s appointment to a bargain to slow or stop the investigation that contributed to Mr. Bentley’s downfall.

"WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Black Caucus pressured Facebook this week to seriously examine how the site allowed Russian operatives to use advertising to target Black Lives Matter and sow racial divisions ahead of last year’s election. In a letter Tuesday to the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, Representative Robin Kelly, Democrat of Illinois, wrote that Russian-backed Facebook pages promoted “incendiary anti-immigrant rallies, targeted the Black Lives Matter movement and focused attentions on critical election swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan.” Russian groups backed by the country’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, paid Facebook to influence voters last year by “purchasing ads designed to inflame and exploit racial, political and economic rifts in the U.S.,” Ms. Kelly wrote. Ms. Kelly’s letter follows weeks of criticism of Facebook over its disclosure that Russians used fake pages and advertisements, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign. The company had long denied that Russians had exploited its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6. Now, Ms. Kelly said, she wants insight into how Facebook examines prospective advertisers, how it vets ads placed by foreign authorities and the “true cost and scope of Russia advertisements placed during the 2016 election cycle.” "
"A lower tax rate for corporations. Reduced taxes for partnerships like law firms. An easy way to bring overseas profits back to the United States without being taxed. Corporate America had a long wish list when it came to tax reform, and on Wednesday, President Trump gave companies just about everything they wanted. “This is much more than I think anyone could have hoped for,” said Robert Willens, an independent corporate tax expert. “I’ve never seen something like this. Taken together, this is the most dramatic and beneficial group of corporate tax reform suggestions we’ve ever had.” The list of those who stand to benefit from the proposed tax plan, which Mr. Trump promoted on Wednesday during a speech in Indianapolis, is long. Individual earners, small businesses, law firms, hedge funds, manufacturers and multinational corporations could all see dramatic tax cuts. There is no certainty that the main points in the White House plan will become law. Congress must now turn the nine-page proposal into a passable piece of legislation. But business leaders were nonetheless quick to applaud the broad outlines of the proposal, claiming that tax cuts they would spur new investment and grow the economy. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, called the plan “an encouraging step forward in our shared goal of a tax system that delivers higher economic growth, job creation and wages that our country desperately needs.” "
"To the Editor: Re “Frantic Efforts for the Ailing in Puerto Rico” (front page, Sept. 27): The governor of Puerto Rico and the mayor of San Juan could not be more clear about the gravity of the disaster that’s befallen their island. The efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coast Guard, the National Guard and other branches of local, state and the federal government are substantial and impressive. However, this nearly unprecedented crisis needs something more, because hundreds if not thousands of American citizens’ lives are at risk. President Trump should immediately appoint someone of the stature of his chief of staff, John Kelly; his national security adviser, H. R. McMaster; or a former general like David Petraeus or Ray Odierno to lead the effort. Otherwise people will die because of a lack of adequate leadership. ANDREW ROSENZWEIG
WHITE PLAINS To the Editor: It is unacceptable that Puerto Rico, a United States territory, is not receiving the same humanitarian aid and attention from the government as states on the mainland hit by recent storms. After Hurricane Harvey in Houston, President Trump and the government were quick to respond and provide aid. The president took much longer to address Puerto Rico — tweeting on Monday that it is in “deep trouble,” which I’m sure the people there are very aware of, and not visiting until this coming Tuesday. This is yet another injustice the people of Puerto Rico have to face as the United States treats them as second-class citizens. Without the right to vote in federal elections, they are left powerless, and the effects of this lack of voice and power are apparent in the government’s reaction to this catastrophe. Puerto Rico deserves and needs representation in the United States government, although it is a tragedy that it took such an event to bring attention to this. AMANDA BUTCHER, DIABLO, CALIF.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will seek to reconsider an Obama-era blueprint for protecting the greater sage grouse, a move that could lead to new mineral leasing, grazing and other commercial activities across the quirky bird’s Western habitat. The Interior Department intends this week to publish a formal notice of intent to amend 98 sage grouse habitat management plans across 10 states, according to multiple agency and state officials who have been briefed on the effort. Those plans, completed in 2015, were adopted after a decade of negotiations among conservationists, sportsmen and extraction industries as well as federal, state, local and tribal authorities. The elaborate compromise was designed to keep the sage grouse off the endangered species list, which would have required much greater restrictions on activities within the bird’s broad range. The sage grouse, which looks like a chesty chicken but struts like a spiky-tailed peacock, is renowned for its elaborate mating dance. The agency’s decision is not entirely unexpected. Earlier this year, Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, ordered a review of the sage grouse plans, in part to determine whether they were hindering energy production. A task force recommended changes that could loosen protections for the bird. "
"PARIS — Broken gargoyles and fallen balustrades replaced by plastic pipes and wooden planks. Flying buttresses darkened by pollution and eroded by rainwater. Pinnacles propped up by beams and held together with straps. Little of that deterioration is immediately visible to the millions of awe-struck tourists who visit the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris every year, many of them too busy admiring the intricately sculpted front to notice the wear and tear. But on a recent afternoon, André Finot, the cathedral’s spokesman, pointed out the decay. One patch of limestone crumbled at a finger’s touch. “Everywhere the stone is eroded, and the more the wind blows, the more all of these little pieces keep falling,” said Mr. Finot, gingerly stepping over fallen chunks of stone on the cathedral’s rooftop walkway. “It’s spinning out of control everywhere.” This is not the first time — nor will it be the last — that the cathedral, a jewel of medieval Gothic architecture, has required an extensive makeover. But experts say Notre-Dame, although not at risk of sudden collapse, has reached a tipping point — and an expensive one at that. "
"OTTAWA — Six weeks into the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the thorniest issues surrounding the pact remain unresolved. The United States, Canada and Mexico wrapped up the third round of trade talks in Ottawa on Wednesday, and negotiators from all sides said they are working nights and weekends to bring the deal to a close. But most also freely admitted that the most difficult part of negotiations is yet to come. That includes putting to paper, for the first time, some of the most sweeping changes the Trump administration wants to the trade agreement. Trade negotiations are typically opaque. The text being worked on is classified in the United States, and no team wants to weaken their position by giving away too much information to their opposition. But public statements at the close of the third round of talks this week offer new insight into progress on some of the main goals for the Trump administration’s renegotiation of Nafta. Much of what negotiators want to do is simply update Nafta, the bulk of which was written a quarter century ago. That includes setting new regulations on digital trade and telecommunications, updating the customs process that carries goods over borders, and making sure regulations among the countries are in step. This work has been relatively easy, because many of the updates can be drawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP is a trade deal negotiated by the United States and 11 other countries under the Obama administration, including Mexico and Canada. President Trump heavily criticized the TPP and withdrew the United States from the pact, essentially putting it into cold storage. "
"“We’re off our meds,” Henry Dunbar, the protagonist of Edward St. Aubyn’s modern retelling of Shakespeare’s “King Lear,” whispers in the novel’s arresting opening sentence. “We’re off our meds/ we’re off our heads,” Peter Walker — a stand-in for Lear’s fool — sings back giddily in response. In “Dunbar,” Mr. St. Aubyn’s reimagining of the tragedy, Lear is an 80-year-old Canadian corporate titan whose global media empire and legacy are under threat from his rapacious daughters, Megan and Abigail. The pair have him drugged and committed to a sanitarium in rural England as they plot to take over his empire. Meanwhile, Dunbar, blinded by pride, greed and paranoia, has alienated those most loyal to him, including Florence, his third daughter, who attempts to rescue him and foil her sisters’s plot. After he flees the asylum, with the help of his fellow patient, the unhinged alcoholic comedian Walker, he starts to grasp the depth of his daughters’ treachery, and the magnitude of his own ignorance and arrogance. “Dunbar” is the latest entry in the Hogarth Shakespeare project, which pairs contemporary novelists with Shakespeare’s timeless dramas and has attracted a parade of prominent writers, including Margaret Atwood, Gillian Flynn, Howard Jacobson, Jo Nesbo and Anne Tyler. Plenty of towering literary figures — among them Balzac, Turgenev, and the Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Jane Smiley — have taken inspiration from King Lear. But few writers are as well equipped as Mr. St. Aubyn to tackle the tragedy, a dark, twisted and violent family drama about a megalomaniacal monarch’s dysfunctional relationship with his heirs. He’s covered similar emotional and psychological territory in his Patrick Melrose series, which chronicle the violence and sexual abuse he suffered as a child, his descent into alcoholism and heroin addiction, and his struggles as a husband and parent. He’s so familiar with Lear — he studied the text intensely as a young man — that in conversation, he effortlessly recites from the play verbatim. "
"The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would temporarily waive a century-old shipping law for Puerto Rico that officials there said was hindering disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. The waiver of the law, known as the Jones Act, comes as federal and local officials report more supplies trickling onto the increasingly desperate island. But the Trump administration remains under pressure to step up the recovery effort. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, announced the decision on Twitter on Thursday morning, saying that President Trump had authorized it after a request from Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico. “It is an act of justice. It will allow Puerto Ricans to rebuild and to have a cost of living that really frankly is affordable,” Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, said on CNN on Thursday. "
"WASHINGTON — Justice Neil M. Gorsuch addressed a conservative group at the Trump International Hotel on Thursday, drawing protests and criticism for speaking at a venue that is the subject of several lawsuits against the president. In his remarks, Justice Gorsuch called for civility in debates over public controversies. On the one hand, he said, the First Amendment guarantees that “Americans can say pretty much anything they want for more or less any reason they want more or less anytime they want.” “But with every right comes a correlative responsibility,” he said. “And to be worthy of our First Amendment freedoms, we have to all adopt certain civil habits that enable others to enjoy them as well. When it comes to the First Amendment, that means tolerate those who don’t agree with us or those whose ideas upset us, giving others the benefit of the doubt about their motives.” Some experts in legal ethics and many liberal groups questioned the wisdom and prudence of Justice Gorsuch’s decision to speak at the hotel. Several lawsuits are challenging the constitutionality of foreign payments to companies controlled by President Trump. “It’s disappointing that Justice Gorsuch agreed to speak at President Trump’s hotel, when Trump’s failure to adequately divest his hotels and other assets creates unconstitutional conflicts of interest that could very well end up before the court,” said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which represents lawmakers suing Mr. Trump. “Justice Gorsuch told the Senate during his confirmation that he was committed to the independence and integrity of the judiciary,” Ms. Wydra said, “but the decision to speak at an event that profits the president sadly falls far short of that standard.” "
"Von Miller, a star linebacker for the Denver Broncos, was one of many N.F.L. players who knelt on Sunday during the playing of the national anthem in what became a sweeping and stark show of solidarity against police brutality and a silent admonition of President Trump. But the story this week, involving Miller and a Denver car dealership, offered a window into potential troubles for high-profile athletes and advertisers. It may also be a lesson in the dangers of jumping to conclusions in the age of viral news stories, internet mobs and instant boycotts. It was widely reported that a car dealership had fired Miller over his protest, but the facts turn out to be more complicated. The original TV news report has been retracted. Miller is among the N.F.L.’s highest-paid players and has done commercials for brands as well known as Old Spice. But it was a Denver car dealership that found itself at the center of a contract tussle that vaulted its name overnight into the national sports conversation. "
"Otto F. Warmbier, the college student imprisoned in North Korea and returned to the United States in a vegetative state, suffered extensive brain damage following interrupted blood flow and a lack of oxygen, according to the coroner who examined his body. But an external examination and “virtual autopsy” conducted by the coroner’s office in Hamilton County, Ohio, could not determine how his circulation had been cut off. “All we can do is theorize, and we hate to theorize without science backing us up,” Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco, the county coroner, said in an interview Thursday. Mr. Warmbier, 22, an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, was convicted in March 2016 of trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a trip to North Korea and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was flown back to the United States in June in a vegetative state. North Korean officials said Mr. Warmbier’s condition was caused by sleeping pills and botulism, a diagnosis that medical experts doubted. He died six days later at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. His parents requested that a full autopsy not be performed. On Tuesday, during an appearance on the television show “Fox & Friends,” Fred Warmbier said that his son had been “tortured” and described North Korean officials as “terrorists.” "
"Roy Moore’s decisive victory over Luther Strange in the Republican Senate primary runoff on Tuesday in Alabama confirms — as I have reported before — that many Republican voters have a strong sense of white identity, that they harbor high levels of racial resentment and that they sometimes exhibit authoritarian leanings. At the same time, that’s not a complete picture. A 2013 study of red and blue America, conducted well before the seismic events of the last two years, sheds additional light on the Republican electorate and provides a more complicated understanding of contemporary conservatism. In “Divided We Stand: Three Psychological Regions of the United States and Their Political, Economic, Social, and Health Correlates,” Peter J. Rentfrow, a reader in the psychology department at the University of Cambridge, along with five co-authors, explores the results of standardized personality tests given to 1.6 million people in the United States from 1999 to 2010. The Rentfrow paper breaks the country into three “psychological regions” and ranks each region on personality dimensions known as the big five traits: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. The most conservative and most Republican of the three psychological regions — which Rentfrow labels “Cluster 1: Friendly and Conventional” — extends across the northern tier of the United States from Montana to Michigan, down through the Midwest to almost all of the South for a total of 26 states. The accompanying map shows the region in shades of purple. "

The standard by which the Trump tax plan should be judged is the standard that the Trump administration itself has set. “There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said shortly after the election. “My plan is for the working people,” President Trump said yesterday. “I don’t benefit.” None of that is true. It’s the latest disturbing example of politicians telling falsehoods about a proposed policy. Trump has done so repeatedly, and now members of Congress are doing it more often, too. These aren’t mere exaggerations or truth shadings; they are often just lies. “Trump’s tax plan: prioritize cuts for the rich, say he isn’t,” as New York Magazine succinctly puts it. You can read The Times Editorial Board’s analysis — that the plan relies on the discredited notion that tax cuts for the rich help everyone — here. "
"It’s been more than a week since I’ve had any word in New York from my 93-year-old father in Puerto Rico. He lives in Coamo, a town in the path of the worst storm to hit the island since 1928. My experience has been shared by millions of Puerto Ricans in the diaspora since Hurricane Maria wreaked its havoc on Sept. 20. The so-called natural disaster wiped out the deteriorating infrastructure of the entire commonwealth, destroying homes and roads, and leaving Puerto Rico without electricity. Estimates are that it will take months to make the grid fully functional again. The loss of communications has meant no news at all from the more remote communities like Coamo, which is also my hometown. This wasn’t just nature’s work. Another type of storm had been pounding the island long before last week. With no real representation in Washington, Puerto Rico has always been subject to the whims of stateside politicians unaccountable to the island’s people. More than half a century ago, tax breaks lured industry from the mainland to Puerto Rico, but in recent decades those advantages were yanked back. That set the stage for vulture hedge funds to swoop into the vacuum, but left hospitals, schools, electrical and communications grids too underfunded and fragile to weather a Category 4 hurricane. The immediate cause of the humanitarian crisis we’re witnessing now was a one-two punch by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. But the seeds for it were sown by a public debt crisis that has made life harder and harder for Puerto Ricans in recent years. The island tried to meet draconian debt payments by making disastrous cuts to public services. Those measures pushed Puerto Ricans out of work and into poverty. By 2015, 46.1 percent of the population was living under the poverty line, including about 60 percent of the island’s children. The governor at the time, Alejandro García Padilla, declared the debt unpayable and began defaulting on debt payments. The cruelly named Promesa law (“promesa” means “promise” in Spanish) passed by Congress last year was supposed to resolve the debt crisis and right Puerto Rico’s economy. But any meaningful recovery for Puerto Rican families remains a distant hope. The commonwealth’s tight budget has made life on the island impossible for hundreds of thousands of families. They migrated to the mainland; in Central Florida, they were arriving daily by the hundreds before hurricane season. Then came Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Immediate needs on the island include search and rescue, getting communications back up and clearing roads to get goods and help to people who need it. Beyond that, though, Puerto Rico needs Congress to help it recover from the devastation wrought by economic strategies that have failed the island for decades. "
"One of President Trump’s judicial nominees became something of a hero to religious conservatives after she was grilled at a Senate hearing this month over whether her Roman Catholic faith would influence her decisions on the bench. The nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, a law professor up for an appeals court seat, had raised the issue herself in articles and speeches over the years. The Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee zeroed in on her writings, and in the process prompted accusations that they were engaged in religious bigotry. “The dogma lives loudly within you,” declared Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, in what has become an infamous phrase. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, accused his colleagues of employing an unconstitutional “religious test” for office. Ms. Barrett told the senators that she was a faithful Catholic, and that her religious beliefs would not affect her decisions as an appellate judge. But her membership in a small, tightly knit Christian group called People of Praise never came up at the hearing, and might have led to even more intense questioning. Some of the group’s practices would surprise many faithful Catholics. Members of the group swear a lifelong oath of loyalty, called a covenant, to one another, and are assigned and are accountable to a personal adviser, called a “head” for men and a “handmaid” for women. The group teaches that husbands are the heads of their wives and should take authority over the family. Current and former members say that the heads and handmaids give direction on important decisions, including whom to date or marry, where to live, whether to take a job or buy a home, and how to raise children. "
"WASHINGTON — In 2001, when surging budget surpluses fueled hopes of extinguishing the national debt, a pitched battle broke out over President George W. Bush’s proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut. Never mind that the tax cut’s 10-year tab was supposed to leave behind more than $3 trillion in surpluses — Democrats and some Republicans said that the tax cut was just too large. Fast forward to President Trump’s Washington, where the budget deficit for this fiscal year is projected to near $700 billion and the federal debt has topped $20 trillion. A new tax cut is emerging to rival those of the Bush years, and the deficit hawks have hardly peeped. “It’s a great talking point when you have an administration that’s Democrat-led,” said Representative Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of about 150 conservative House members. “It’s a little different now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.” For years, Republican lawmakers lamented the soaring national debt, pressing for spending cuts and clinging to the mantle of fiscal responsibility. But last week, Senate Republicans hammered out a deal to allow for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, betting that supercharged growth will make up for lost revenue, a potentially dubious prospect. The tax plan outlined Wednesday by the White House and Republican leaders in the House and Senate could cost more than $2 trillion over the next decade, according to a preliminary estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan advocacy group. This month, the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate voted to raise the debt limit without doing anything to rein in spending. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump failed again this week to fulfill his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health plan. Now he is taking aim at Mr. Obama’s central environmental legacy, the Clean Power Plan. The administration has made clear its desire to repeal the Obama energy plan. But what would take its place remains a mystery. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected in the coming days to reveal its strategy for reversing the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants across the country. Yet while Mr. Trump has declared the Obama-era plan dead — “Did you see what I did to that? Boom, gone,” he told a cheering crowd in Alabama recently — industry executives say they expect that utilities could still be subject to some restrictions on carbon emissions. “I would be surprised if repeal did not lead to replacement,” said Paul Bailey, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. If the E.P.A. does open the door to a new, weaker set of rules that utilities and others favor, it will most likely touch off a legal battle with environmental groups and pose a bureaucratic challenge to an agency where critical senior positions remain vacant. It could also force the agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has rejected the scientific consensus that human emissions cause climate change, to implicitly acknowledge that greenhouse gases harm human health and that the E.P.A. has an obligation to regulate them. "
"WASHINGTON — Bipartisanship took a beating this week. The easy Senate primary victory of the archconservative Roy Moore in Alabama and the announcement by Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee that he would retire represented real steps backward for those who had seen faint signs of a thaw in the partisanship that has gripped Washington for years. Mr. Corker was a deal maker and senior Republican trusted by Democrats as someone they could partner with on tough issues. More important, the win by Mr. Moore, a no-compromise candidate in the vanguard of a series of challengers to sitting Senate Republicans, is likely to push nervous incumbents to the right to try to fend off aggressive attempts to unseat them. In addition, Senator Susan Collins, the centrist Republican usually essential to any across-the-aisle negotiations, is weighing a run for governor back home in Maine and nearing a decision on whether to leave Congress. Those developments, along with announced departures by some moderate House Republicans, hold the potential for a sharp decrease in consensus building — just as bipartisan overtures were emerging on spending, health care and immigration. The defeat of Luther Strange, the appointed senator shellacked by Mr. Moore, has the most significant implications. Mr. Strange was backed by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, as well as Washington’s business lobbying community because he was considered a conventional Republican and a reliable vote when Congress had to perform such fundamental tasks as keeping the government open or raising the debt limit. Mr. Moore would be no such thing. He is much more likely to be in the ranks of unyielding Republicans unwilling to follow leadership, even it means government disruptions and legislative stalemate. He has already demanded the ouster of Mr. McConnell. "
"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Senator Luther Strange ended up losing to Roy Moore, a twice-ousted Alabama Supreme Court justice with far-right views, in the Republican Senate primary on Tuesday. President Trump had endorsed Mr. Strange, and, unsurprisingly, late-night hosts took that angle. Stephen Colbert pointed to a New York Times report that Mr. Trump was exasperated with the size of his crowd at a rally for Mr. Strange and had wondered aloud whether audience members liked his choice of a pink tie. Mr. Colbert imagined the way that conversation went, impersonating Mr. Trump. Twitter has announced that it’s exploring doubling the number of characters allowed in a single tweet. Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah foresee some downsides. Mr. Meyers delivered a reflective monologue in support of N.F.L. players’ right to protest during the singing of the national anthem. He said he knew that rooting for a sports team means engaging in a kind of fantasy. But he challenged his viewers to see football players as whole people with a point of view worth hearing. "
"Last December, Destina Garcia found herself outside a locked front door in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. Somewhere on the other side was an older man who needed her help. She didn’t know yet that he had terminal cancer. She hadn’t met his estranged daughter, the one she would eventually bring north to spend the final days at her father’s side. At that moment, Ms. Garcia was only a few weeks into a brand-new and also very old kind of job, one being modernized to help fix the broken American system of education, training and employment. She had just begun work as an apprentice. President Trump has started a debate about whether it’s possible to vastly expand the number of apprenticeships nationwide without losing the elements that make them work best. Ms. Garcia, who is 30, grew up in the Manhattanville Houses project in West Harlem and had a son at 18. She found entry-level work coding medical records. But she soon ran into a quandary: While most good jobs require some kind of credential, going to college can be expensive and time-consuming. Even if you finish, there’s no guarantee of employment. She picked up certificates as a certified nurse assistant and an emergency medical technician, but neither led to permanent work — perhaps because in those fields, as in most, employers value skills that can be learned only on the job. But how do you get a job without the skills? "

"SEOUL, South Korea — The president of South Korea vowed on Thursday to accelerate efforts to strengthen its pre-emptive strike, missile defense and retaliatory capabilities against North Korea, and he renewed his call for the armed forces to become more independent from the United States. In a speech to mark South Korea’s Armed Forces Day, the president, Moon Jae-in, said he would push for the South to move more quickly to retake wartime operational control of its military from its American ally. Since the Korean War in the early 1950s, the terms of the countries’ alliance have called for an American general to command the South’s 650,000-member military should war break out. Mr. Moon and other liberals have campaigned for South Korea to play a greater role in the alliance, and they have long called for the country to resume responsibility for wartime command as soon as it can feasibly do so. But the idea has gotten more public support as remarks by President Trump have led many South Koreans to doubt his commitment to defend their country. Mr. Moon said Thursday that a more self-reliant military could make itself stronger and more feared by North Korea. But he also said the South should strengthen its alliance with Washington. An aide to Mr. Moon said this week that the allies were working on ways to move strategic American military assets into the region more frequently, to help deter North Korea. “The top priority is to secure abilities to counter the North Korean nuclear and missile threats,” Mr. Moon said. Since Mr. Moon took office in May, North Korea has conducted at least nine missile tests. On Sept. 3, the North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. And the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been trading increasingly bellicose threats with Mr. Trump. "
"Where does President Trump’s big tax push, unveiled yesterday in Indiana, go from here? What It Means for Corporate America • Owners of pass-through businesses — which include partnerships like law firms — would see their tax rates fall to 25 percent from 39.5 percent. • Private equity could be worried about any cap on deductions for debt interest payments. • Businesses can immediately write off the full costs of capital investments for at least five years, a provision known as full expensing. • From Mr. Trump's speech: “Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again.” • The bottom line, from the FT’s Barney Jopson: The Economic Impact NYT's Julie Hirschfield Davis and Alan Rappeport: WaPo’s Damian Paletta, Mike DeBonis and Carolyn Y. Johnson: Republicans are considering limiting or eliminating deductions for state and local taxes as well. Will It Pass?

"Yes, Donald Trump has once again used racial hostility to rouse his base and is reveling in the achievement. According to The New York Times, when Trump’s advisers appeared lukewarm about the uproar he created by chastising, in the coarsest of terms, N.F.L. players who chose to quietly kneel to protest racial inequality and police violence, “Mr. Trump responded by telling people that it was a huge hit with his base, making it clear that he did not mind alienating his critics if it meant solidifying his core support.” Every way he is manipulating his majority-white base to oppose a majority-black group of private citizens is disgusting. Trump is disgusting. But I am also infuriated by his framing: that this has nothing to do with race (whenever you hear that, know that the subject at hand must have everything to do with race) and that this is just about patriotism, honoring national ritual, celebrating soldiers, particularly the fallen, and venerating “our flag.” What this misses is that patriotism is particularly fraught for black people in this country because the history of the country’s treatment of them is fraught. It’s not that black people aren’t patriotic; it’s just that patriotism can be a paradox. Many black people see themselves simultaneously as part of America and separate from it, under attack by it, and it has always been thus. "
"While the Supreme Court has taken the Trump administration’s travel ban appeal off its calendar, there is something important to remember: Just because a case is moot, as this one appears to be, doesn’t mean that nothing happened. A great deal has happened in the eight months since the newly inaugurated president unleashed his first Muslim travel ban, fulfilling his campaign pledge to impose “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” It was a bizarre and terrifying weekend — terrifying not only for those whose valid travel documents had without notice become worthless but also for the rest of us, plunged suddenly into the shocking new reality of Donald Trump’s America. Blocked by the courts, the first travel ban morphed into the second, and now, on the eve of a scheduled Supreme Court argument, we have travel ban 3.0, with a few fig leaves added. (While it’s true that North Korea, a new country added to the previous all-Muslim list, is not a Muslim country, it’s also true that a grand total of 109 visas were issued last year to North Koreans, and subjecting those individuals to exacting scrutiny, as surely happened, is not likely to have overtaxed our national resources.) Unlike the first ban, issued in the apparent absence of any legal advice, and unlike the second, on which lawyers seemingly functioned while holding their noses and their breath, this one is the product of some smart lawyering. It was clearly designed to address the main statutory flaw that the lower courts found in the earlier versions, which was that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the president lacks unilateral authority to issue a categorical ban on the entry of entire nationalities without a very precise reason. The official explanation of the new order stresses the multidepartmental consultation and the summerlong study of the world’s nations that went into selecting the eight countries to which the new open-ended ban applies. This effort to snatch a case from the arms of a potentially hostile Supreme Court is dramatic but not unprecedented. In November 2005, the George W. Bush administration suddenly announced that it was transferring Jose Padilla, a United States citizen held in military custody, without charges, for more than three years, to the civilian criminal justice system to face charges of aiding terrorism. The reason for the sudden rush? Mr. Padilla’s lawyers had filed a Supreme Court appeal challenging his military confinement, and the government’s response to his petition was due within days. I don’t know the back story, but most likely, lawyers in the solicitor general’s office told the White House that there were no plausible arguments they could offer in defense of Mr. Padilla’s treatment. In any event, the ploy worked; voting 6 to 3, the justices refused to hear Mr. Padilla’s case, which Justice John Paul Stevens had described at an earlier stage as having “at stake nothing less than the essence of a free society.” If the justices find the pending travel ban case to be moot, they will probably take the usual step after a finding of mootness and vacate the lower court decisions that found the second travel ban to be invalid. That means that the opinions of the United States Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits will be wiped off the books, rendered nonexistent, not to be cited in the future. But once again, that doesn’t mean that those rulings didn’t happen. A majority of judges in those two circuits — not the “so-called judges” of President Trump’s fevered imagination, but actual life-tenured, Senate-confirmed federal judges — flexed their muscles and stood up to the president. That’s important. The judicial muscle needs exercise just like any other. Disused, it wastes away. Overused, it leads judges to trample on executive and legislative authority. Did the Appeals Court judges hit the right balance? We won’t get a definitive legal answer, but the answer surely lies not in law but in politics. Ultimately, the judgment on this episode will come not from the courts but from the people. "
"Donald Trump has just voted in the Worst Cabinet Member contest. “We’ll see,” he said when asked by reporters if he was going to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. I believe I speak for us all when I say this does not sound like a vote of confidence. Price recently became famous as the guy who enjoys traveling by private charter plane at the taxpayers’ expense. You would think that Trump, who loves his private planes like a family member, would be a little sympathetic to someone’s distaste for commercial travel. But no. “I am not happy about it. I’m going to look at it. I am not happy about it, and I let him know it,” Trump told reporters Wednesday. Now Price is also the guy who is waging a war against birth control that’s cratering teen pregnancy prevention programs. But in this administration you can ruin federal initiatives aimed at avoiding unwanted pregnancy and Donald Trump — no fan of unwanted pregnancy — will completely ignore it. If Price goes down, it will be over his travel bills, which is sort of like Al Capone going to jail for tax evasion. Price claimed that a majority of the private charters he’d taken “were for the opioid crisis or the hurricanes.” No indication of whether it was a weather disaster or drug emergency that took him to the Aspen Ideas Festival in June. Still not quite as bad as attempting to cut $6 billion from next year’s National Institutes of Health research. But I say, go with what you can get. Tom Price is terrible and whatever sends him out of government is fine. Do you think he’s the Worst Cabinet Member? There’s so much competition. Consider Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who attempted to get rebellious House members to support Trump’s budget deal with the Democrats by asking them to do it “for me.” Apparently Mnuchin had no idea that Republican lawmakers’ affection for him was about on par with their feelings for special work sessions over holiday weekends.

"BANGALORE, India — IBM dominated the early decades of computing with inventions like the mainframe and the floppy disk. Its offices and factories, stretching from upstate New York to Silicon Valley, were hubs of American innovation long before Microsoft or Google came along. But over the last decade, IBM has shifted its center of gravity halfway around the world to India, making it a high-tech example of the globalization trends that the Trump administration has railed against. Today, the company employs 130,000 people in India — about one-third of its total work force, and more than in any other country. Their work spans the entire gamut of IBM’s businesses, from managing the computing needs of global giants like AT&T and Shell to performing cutting-edge research in fields like visual search, artificial intelligence and computer vision for self-driving cars. One team is even working with the producers of Sesame Street to teach vocabulary to kindergartners in Atlanta. “IBM India, in the truest sense, is a microcosm of the IBM company,” Vanitha Narayanan, chairman of the company’s Indian operations, said in an interview at IBM’s main campus in Bangalore, where the office towers are named after American golf courses like Peachtree and Pebble Beach.

"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Thursday to step up its assistance to Puerto Rico more than a week after Hurricane Maria, appointing a three-star general to coordinate with agencies and vowing to give the island all it needed as aides tried to stave off comparisons to the response to Hurricane Katrina more than a decade ago. But on Puerto Rico, the desperation and frustration only grew. Shelters ran out of supplies and residents lined up all night to purchase ice and fuel, only to walk away with a bag of cold water or just a few gallons of gas. Others complained of an absence of basics like tarps for roofs and the continuing lack of running water. Officials still struggled to get supplies out of port to be distributed across an island of 3.4 million people where there is no electricity and scant phone service. Hospitals ran low on diesel for generators. The island has become a landscape of long lines and growing impatience with the pace of the response to what Puerto Rico’s governor called the “greatest catastrophe” in its modern history. Lawmakers and local officials alike called on President Trump to place the military in charge and to send more troops, aircraft and ships. “With all the needs there are, we go out every day to the streets and are face to face with the people — you don’t see a single government agency,” said Elizabeth Perez, a police officer in Ponce, P.R., who recently visited poor neighborhoods in her district and found people living in dire conditions. The White House continued to insist that the administration was doing all that it could. A century-old shipping law was temporarily waived after officials in Puerto Rico said it was hindering disaster relief efforts. About 7,200 troops are on the island, as are about 2,800 federal relief workers, the White House said. And the Pentagon announced that a new, higher-ranking military commander, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan of the Army, would work with federal aid agencies on the response. "
"WASHINGTON — A key senator investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election sharply criticized Twitter on Thursday for failing to aggressively investigate the Russian misuse of its platform after the company said it had largely limited its own inquiry to accounts linked to fraudulent profiles already identified by Facebook. The senator, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Twitter’s briefing for congressional investigators “very disappointing,” and accused company officials of ignoring extensive evidence of nefarious Russian activity. The company’s presentation “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions and again begs many more questions than they offered,” Mr. Warner said, adding, “Their response was frankly inadequate on every level.” After a closed-door briefing for the Senate and House intelligence committees, Twitter said that it had found about 200 accounts that appeared to be linked to the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election — a small fraction of the number found by outside researchers. It said it identified the accounts by looking for links to 470 fraudulent Facebook profiles and pages that had already been identified by Facebook investigators. The creators of the Facebook pages posed as American activists to spread disinformation and sow discord during the election season. Twitter identified only 22 accounts on its platform that were directly tied to the Russian Facebook pages and then discovered another 179 accounts that were “related or linked” to the Facebook accounts. None were registered on the site as advertisers, the company said. "
"WASHINGTON — After being rebuked by President Trump for racking up at least $400,000 in travel on chartered flights, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said on Thursday that he would pay back taxpayers for his part of the bill and stop flying on private jets. But that does not mean his job is safe. Mr. Trump has grown incensed by Mr. Price’s liberal renting of expensive planes, which he views as undercutting his drain-the-swamp campaign message, according to several administration officials with direct knowledge of the president’s thinking. Through intermediaries and the media, Mr. Trump has let it be known that offering reimbursement as repentance was no guarantee that Mr. Price would keep his job. On Thursday, Mr. Price tried anyway. “I look forward to gaining, regaining the trust that the American people, some of the American people, may have lost in the activities that I took,” Mr. Price said in an appearance on “Special Report with Bret Baier” on Fox News. Mr. Price called Mr. Trump “a remarkable leader,” and said the president had expressed displeasure to him “very clearly.” With his job on the line, Mr. Price, a physician and former Georgia congressman, spent much of the day posing for photo ops — receiving his flu shot and attending a panel on the opioid crisis with first lady Melania Trump. In a statement, he expressed “regret” over the cost to taxpayers and said he would write a personal check to the Treasury to cover his expenses: “The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) What if California did away altogether with cars powered by fossil fuels? Gov. Jerry Brown is said to have considered the question. According to a report in Bloomberg, he asked a state regulator about a plan by China to phase out sales of fossil-fuel vehicles. “I’ve gotten messages from the governor asking, ‘Why haven’t we done something already?’” said Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board. “The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California.” The remarks have thrilled environmentalists who see tailpipe pollution — accounting for about a third of total greenhouse gas emissions — as a bane to both air quality and the climate. “It’s an important conversation to have and we’re glad it’s starting to get some traction,” said Gina Coplon-Newfield, who heads the Sierra Club’s clean transportation unit. For now, conversation is all it appears to be. A spokesman for the air resources board, Dave Clegern, declined to say whether officials were serious about a ban. "
