"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The Macrons visit the Trumps, Brexit’s impact grows, and cash handouts are ending in Finland. Here’s the latest: • The Trumps hosted Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, the president and first lady of France, at the White House. At the top of the agenda: the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Macron vigorously supports. During a joint news conference, President Trump said he still thought the agreement was “terrible.” But he also said he could agree to “a new deal” negotiated by American and European officials if it was strong enough. Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron were particularly warm toward each other. We explore “le bromance” of the two presidents, which continued into the night at the Trumps’ first state dinner. On the fashion front, our critic weighed in on the wide-brimmed white hat Melania Trump donned for the arrival ceremony. "
"Sean M. Spicer, whose famously rocky tenure as press secretary to President Trump made him a household name, has kept a relatively low profile since he resigned last summer — a cameo at the Emmys aside. On Wednesday, he turned up in Manhattan, at Madame Tussauds, the tourist-friendly waxworks temple, where he had been enlisted to help unveil the likeness of a former White House colleague: the first lady, Melania Trump. “She’s a very caring and gracious woman, and our country is grateful to have her,” Mr. Spicer said, holding a microphone in front of a reproduction of the Oval Office, which featured a giant Madame Tussauds flag. “Amazing!” replied his interlocutor, Christine Haughney, the regional marketing manager for Tussauds’s parent company, Merlin Entertainments. The departure of a high-level employee from the White House usually leads to a cable television contract or a big-time consulting gig. A few West Wing alumni ascend to elder-statesman status, joining the David Gergens of the world. "
"WASHINGTON — “This is my first and only book party, and I didn’t do the invites,” the former F.B.I. director James Comey said Tuesday night, peering out over a sparse crowd on the seventh floor of the Newseum. (This was easy for him to do as he is, famously, 6-foot-8.) Mr. Comey, by now a bona fide bipartisan pariah, was sipping California pinot noir from a paper cup and celebrating the remarkable success of his juicy new memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” with perhaps the last crowd left in town who will gladly have him: journalists. In a city not known for snappy dressing, Mr. Comey cut a sharp figure in a bespoke blue plaid suit made by the haberdasher The Tailored Man of Alexandria, Va., and brown R.M. Williams Chelsea boots he says were given to him by friends from the Australian police force (not to be confused with the black Chelsea boots Mr. Comey wore for his prime time “20/20” interview, which earned him plaudits from Esquire and GQ).   As a late-April rain lashed the museum’s panoramic windows, the man of the hour cheerily recounted tales from his whirlwind media tour.  “The clutch of people coming up to me in airports, that’s probably the hardest thing to get used to,” he said. Who was scarier to face: the ladies of “The View,” or the New Yorker editor David Remnick? “I was nervous at ‘The View’ and ‘Colbert,’ because my wife cared about ‘The View’ and my kids cared about ‘Colbert,’ Mr. Comey said. “Those are the only two interviews I was nervous about.” Besides this room of tweet-stained wretches, is there anyone left in Washington who still likes him? "
"WASHINGTON — As Scott Pruitt, the embattled head of the Environmental Protection Agency, prepares to testify before Congress on Thursday amid a series of spending and ethics investigations, an internal E.P.A. document indicates that he may blame his staff for many of the decisions that have put a cloud over his tenure at the agency. The document, known as the “hot topics” list, appears to lay out talking points for Mr. Pruitt’s two sessions before the House of Representatives. It suggests that Mr. Pruitt is prepared to say that he now flies coach when traveling; that others were responsible for giving two close aides who used to work for him in Oklahoma substantial pay raises; and that E.P.A. officials who were reassigned or demoted after challenging his spending all had performance issues. The document, which The New York Times has reviewed and the veracity of which the E.P.A. did not dispute, seemed to be a work in progress. Mr. Pruitt’s responses may change on Thursday when he appears before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in the morning, and a House Appropriations Committee panel in the afternoon. His testimony coincides with rising calls from both Democrats and Republicans for Mr. Pruitt to step aside. He has been criticized for spending more than $3 million on security in his first year in office, a figure that includes salary and overtime for his security detail of more than 20 people, some of whom have been dispatched to protect Mr. Pruitt on private trips to Disneyland, professional basketball games and the 2018 Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Republicans in both chambers of Congress are increasingly raising concerns about Mr. Pruitt. “They’re not good reports,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate. “He has to answer those questions. There’s a lot of stuff out there that is certainly not helpful to his or the administration’s cause.” "
"A federal jury on Wednesday acquitted a former trader for the Swiss bank UBS of charges related to market manipulation, dealing a blow to a Justice Department effort to crack down on a Wall Street practice known as “spoofing.” Prosecutors accused the former trader, Andre Flotron, of trying to move market prices for precious metals by making offers on electronic trading systems to buy or sell gold, silver and other financial products and then quickly deleting those offers before anyone could accept them. But after only a few hours of deliberation, a jury in United States District Court in the District of Connecticut rejected their theory, according to Mr. Flotron’s lawyer Marc L. Mukasey. Mr. Flotron’s acquittal could spell trouble for similar cases brought by the United States government. In January, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against seven other people for spoofing, among the first criminal charges brought for suspected financial crimes during the Trump administration. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission simultaneously brought civil cases against a number of the former traders, including Mr. Flotron. The traders’ behavior, a Justice Department official said at the time, reflected “a systemic problem.” The Connecticut jury decided otherwise. “It’s a huge setback for the government,” Mr. Mukasey said. “We basically smacked them in the face.” Mr. Mukasey said he planned to ask the trading commission to dismiss its civil case against Mr. Flotron. “While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury’s verdict,” a Justice Department spokeswoman said Wednesday. A UBS spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment. "
"Team owners, players and league executives held a confidential meeting in October, when they were under sharp criticism from President Trump over national anthem protests. During the three-hour session, the owners were particularly eager to find a way to avoid further public rebukes from Mr. Trump. [The full story on the private meeting is here.] "
"N.F.L. owners, players and league executives, about 30 in all, convened urgently at the league’s headquarters on Park Avenue in October, nearly a month after President Trump began deriding the league and its players over protests during the national anthem. It was an extraordinary summit; rarely do owners and players meet in this manner. But the president’s remarks about players who were kneeling during the anthem had catalyzed a level of public hostility that the N.F.L. had never experienced. In the spirit of partnership at the meeting, the owners decided that they and the players should sit in alternating seats around the large table, which featured an N.F.L. logo in the middle. “Let’s make sure that we keep this confidential,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said to begin the session. The New York Times has obtained an audio recording of the roughly three-hour meeting, and several people in the room corroborated details of the gathering. The unvarnished conversation reveals how the leaders of the most dominant sports league in the country and several of its most outspoken players confronted an unprecedented moment — mostly by talking past one another. [‘Divisive’ and ‘Disastrous’: Here are the most biting comments N.F.L. owners made about Trump.] The players sounded aggrieved. After discussing a proposal to finance nonprofit groups to address player concerns, they wanted to talk about why Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who started the anthem protests to highlight social injustice and police brutality against African-Americans, was, they believed, being blackballed by the owners. The owners sounded panicked about their business under attack, and wanted to focus on damage control. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, Democrats had another strong night at the polls last night. Yes, their candidate in an Arizona special House election lost, by five percentage points. But don’t be distracted by that. The district is overwhelmingly Republican. The Arizona result — along with several state-legislature races in New York — is consistent with that of dozens of other special elections so far this year and last year: Democrats are running far, far ahead of their 2014 and 2016 showings. Their performance suggests they are more likely to retake the House than not. Of course, there is still a lot that could happen between now and November. Reader project. A couple of weeks ago, I asked readers of this newsletter: Which political views that you disagree with do you nonetheless want to read? And on social media, I asked a related question: Which views are underrepresented in the national media? In both cases, I also asked which views readers considered beyond the pale of productive debate. The issue has obviously been in the news lately. Some Times readers have been upset by a couple of recently hired conservative writers here. The Washington Post faced similar criticism for its hiring of the libertarian-leaning Megan McArdle. And The Atlantic hired and — after a debate over his support for executing women who have had abortions — fired the writer Kevin Williamson. Nearly a thousand of you replied to my questions. Both I and my colleagues are grateful for the thoughtfulness of so many of the responses. We’ve now published an article about your thoughts, with extensive quotes. There were a few main themes: 1. The national media should expand the boundaries of the debate. 2. There should be more conservative arguments, especially the nonelite conservatism that helps explain Trump’s rise. 3. The media has many center-left voices. It needs more unabashedly left-wing voices. 4. The media’s voices are too male, too white, too privileged and too American. 5. Some positions don’t deserve a national platform. But don’t just rely on my quick description. Read for yourself what readers have to say. Technical difficulty. I know that some of you received yesterday’s newsletter late — and received a duplicate copy when it did arrive. I apologize. We believe we know what went wrong and have fixed the bug.

"Iran seized a prominent British-Iranian scholar during his visit there this month, a rights group said Wednesday, an arrest that may further stoke tensions with the West over President Trump’s threat to scrap the 2015 nuclear accord. The scholar, Abbas Edalat, an award-winning professor of computer science and mathematics at the Imperial College of London, is at least the third British-Iranian dual citizen to be incarcerated by the Tehran authorities in recent years. The group that reported Mr. Edalat’s arrest, the Center for Human Rights in Iran, said members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps took him into custody on April 15 while he was in Tehran to visit his family and attend an academic workshop. The group said the professor’s computer, CDs and notebooks were impounded. “Iran’s continued arbitrary arrests of dual nationals without transparency and lack of due process is extremely concerning,” Hadi Ghaemi, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. The nature of the charges against Mr. Edalat, if any, are not clear, and his arrest has not been reported in Iran’s official news media. There was no immediate comment on the arrest by officials from Iran or the Imperial College. Britain’s Foreign Office said in a statement that “we are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities following reports of the arrest of a British-Iranian dual national.” "
"In the end she played the part, donned the costume — and gave everyone something to chew on. Melania Trump, who orchestrated the first state dinner of the Trump administration, a.k.a. the most fancy ceremonial evening since the inauguration, stood next to her husband and welcomed President Emmanuel Macron of France and his wife Brigitte while wearing a Chanel haute couture dress of black Chantilly lace, hand painted with silver, and embroidered with crystal and sequins. Mrs. Trump’s dress looked kind of like sparkling sleeveless body armor and reflected a desire to pay homage to the guests of honor and what may be a new “special relationship” (identified thusly by President Trump earlier in the day while brushing what he identified as dandruff off Mr. Macron’s shoulders). Chanel is, after all, a brand that is almost synonymous with French fashion, and couture, a specific segment of the fashion industry that exists formally only in France. It was the first time Mrs. Trump had worn Chanel at a major public occasion since becoming first lady, and one of the rare times that a first lady’s office has advertised the fact she was wearing couture. Her predecessor, Michelle Obama, often had dresses altered to her specifications — and wore an Atelier Versace chain mail couture gown to her final state dinner with then-Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi — but couture is a sector unto itself, rooted in French history, unabashedly elite, and symbolic of what is known with pride as “savoir-faire,” or know how. It is also handmade to order, exists only as one-offs, and comes complete with prices that can run into the six digits. Mrs. Trump, for example, seems to have taken what was originally a jumpsuit from the Chanel spring 2018 couture collection and had it remade as a dress. "
"BEIJING — When President Xi Jinping announced measures to further open up China’s auto industry to foreign carmakers, the global industry initially cheered. Now the cheering has stopped. As details are emerging, foreign auto executives attending China’s annual auto show in Beijing this week said Mr. Xi’s initiative was too narrow and vague to change business on the ground. That means the initiative may not be a strong enough starting point for talks to stave off the Trump administration’s threats to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese-made goods. Central to Mr. Xi’s plan is that it will allow foreign automakers to own Chinese factories, instead of working through a 50-50 Chinese partner, as is currently required. But auto executives in Beijing said they were comfortable with the current system. “It would be crazy to think you can do it all yourself, in a market that is so different,” said Trevor Worthington, Ford’s vice president for product development in Asia and the Pacific. President Trump is sending to Beijing late next week a negotiating team that includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. Autos are one of the issues on the agenda. The Trump administration has accused Beijing of forcing foreign companies to share or reveal their technology as a price of doing business in China, particularly in futuristic areas like electric cars. Mr. Xi’s plan to further open up China’s auto market was seen as a potential olive branch. It calls for phasing out by 2022 the Beijing government’s requirement that any foreign automaker that wants to make cars in China do so through a 50-50 joint venture with a Chinese car company. For makers of electric cars, the requirement would end this year. He also said that China would reduce its 25 percent tariff on imported cars, without offering details. "
"Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Facebook reports earnings • Twitter’s strong results were driven by an impressive performance overseas. • The fight is on for Sky. • Why investors are feeling blue. • What’s behind the fight over an important banking regulation. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Facebook, engulfed in scandals stemming from the abuse of its network, has promised to spend large sums policing its operations, even if those outlays hurt the company’s bottom line. Facebook’s first-quarter results, released on Wednesday, gave the public a chance to see if Facebook is investing a lot more on cleaning up and securing its network. The company’s profits did not suffer much in the quarter. The results did show that expenses went up, and a company executive said on a conference call that security spending in part drove the increases. Still, the expense numbers did not provide clear evidence that Facebook is going the extra mile to police its network. Stamping out abuse was not the only cause of Facebook’s higher expenses – and the company’s costs are more or less in proportion to the levels of past quarters. Here are some relevant numbers. • On the conference call, David Wehner, Facebook’s C.F.O., highlighted a 51 percent increase in sales and marketing expense, the company’s third-biggest expense item. One of the drivers of the increase was spending on protecting the Facebook community, he said. But there were other factors, he added, like spending on what he called innovation. "
"The Trump presidency has sparked a debate about which voices are — and aren’t — reflected in the national media. Many publications have been criticized for publishing too narrow a range of opinions. And several publications, including The Times, The Atlantic and The Washington Post, have recently made high-profile conservative hires. I recently asked Times readers for their thoughts on the issue: Which opinions are underrepresented in the national media? And which if any should remain underrepresented because they’re beyond the pale of productive discourse? We have received almost 1,000 responses, via email and social media. Here, we describe some common themes from those replies: This was perhaps the most common response. There should be more writing from both pro-Trump conservatives and Jacobin-level socialists, as one reader, Andrew Ross, put it — “even though” (or maybe especially because) “elite readers may find their arguments objectionable.” Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab, called for a better airing of the “views of people whose politics are more than one standard deviation from the national mean.” A Twitter user named Rust Belt Jacobin summarized the missing as: “Leftists; Trump supporters; Latinos; working-class people.” In the 2016 Democratic primaries, for example, Bernie Sanders excited millions of people and won about 43 percent of the popular vote. Yet most national publications employed few if any opinion writers who preferred him over Hillary Clinton. Only a smattering of editorial boards endorsed Sanders: The San Francisco Examiner, The Seattle Times, The Daily Iowan and several alternative weeklies. The same broad point is true about Donald Trump. The Trump problem strikes me as trickier to solve, because so much of Trump’s political style depends on — and there’s no other accurate way to describe it — lying. I don’t think a publication would serve its readers by publishing columns arguing that Trump’s inaugural crowd set a record or that voter fraud was widespread. But the particular Trump phenomenon is different from a broader issue, as the next section shows.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The confirmation hearing for Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician and President Trump’s pick to lead the Veterans Affairs Department, was supposed to take place today. Instead, it’s been postponed indefinitely, to give a Senate committee time to investigate accusations that Dr. Jackson oversaw a hostile work environment, improperly dispensed prescription medication and possibly drank on the job. After hinting on Tuesday that Dr. Jackson might withdraw, Mr. Trump later defended him against “ugly” abuse by politicians. • The president has had less-kind things to say about his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, calling him “weak,” “disgraceful” and an “idiot.” That hasn’t kept Mr. Sessions from diligently pushing his boss’s conservative agenda. • They may have their disagreements, but President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France certainly seem to enjoy each other’s company. The two men — holding hands, kissing cheeks, brushing shoulders — bordered on the intimate on Tuesday, the second day of the French leader’s visit to Washington. "
"For all its deranging effects, I am always grateful to Twitter for the interesting ideas it surfaces. But rarely does this surfacing happen quite so overtly as it did earlier this month, when Jack Dorsey, the Twitter C.E.O., tweeted out as a “great read” an article series urging national Democrats to seek the kind of final victory they’ve won in California, in which the G.O.P. is reduced to a rump under one-party Democratic rule. Dorsey’s seeming endorsement of the thesis prompted some unhappy conservative reactions, but he was quite right to recommend the series: The California essays, written by Peter Leyden and Ruy Teixeira across several months last fall and winter, offer a useful framework for thinking about one way that our current ideological deadlock might give way to a new political dispensation. True, the fact that Teixeira has been predicting some version of this scenario for more than 15 years, originally in a famous book with John Judis, “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” whose thesis Judis has since partially abjured, should make one a bit skeptical of his prophetic power. But not so skeptical as to dismiss the possibility that he might eventually be proven right. The Judis-Teixeira theory, which I suppose is now the Leyden-Teixeira theory, holds that a coalition of younger voters, socially liberal professionals and minority voters would deliver the Democrats to long-term power. This hasn’t come close to happening nationwide, save in the unusual Great Recession election of 2008; instead the G.O.P. currently enjoys more power than at any moment since the New Deal. But it has happened in California, in a seemingly pretty durable way. And while it is not an iron law that what happens in the Golden State must go national, you can tell a plausible story in which California is a harbinger of a delayed-but-still-coming Democratic wave. The current Republican advantage, in this argument, is wide but shallow: It depends on a backlash that will weaken as the voters driving it gradually age and die, it relies on countermajoritarian bulwarks that savvy Democrats can dismantle, it’s based on an antique policy agenda that has no appeal to rising cohorts, and it’s now linked to an unpopular and erratic president who poisons everything he touches. Unlike in the 1990s, when Clinton Democrats had to imitate Reagan Republicans to succeed, there is nothing in the present G.O.P. worth appropriating or imitating or triangulating toward; instead, mobilization and boldness together can break the Trump Republicans, demographic weight can bury them, and then it’s California, here we come. I think a lot of this is quite plausible; indeed its plausibility is one reason among many why I thought conservatives should resist the lure of Trump, lest he govern badly, alienate widely, and act as a kind of accelerant toward a Californian future.

"SEOUL, South Korea — The leaders of North and South Korea will meet for talks on Friday, a rare moment of face-to-face diplomacy after 70 years of bitter rivalry. Adding to the history-making stakes of Friday’s encounter is the prospect that if all goes well, President Trump and Kim Jong-un will have their own meeting in May or June. Those talks would be the first dialogue between a sitting American president and a leader of North Korea. On the table are issues that have bedeviled the Korean Peninsula for much of the 20th century, including an official end to the Korean War, as well as some that are already shaping the 21st, like the North’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. As Mr. Kim and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea prepare to meet at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village that straddles their countries’ border, here is what you need to know. The Korean War effectively ended in a stalemate in July 1953, after three years of fighting. The conflict, the first of the Cold War, pitted North Korea, a Communist dictatorship supported by China, against South Korea and its ally, the United States, which led a United Nations force. Generals from North Korea, China and the United States signed the 1953 armistice at Panmunjom. The South Korean leader, Syngman Rhee, however, refused to sign. "
"WASHINGTON — A 15-month legal battle over President Trump’s efforts to impose a ban on travel to the United States from several predominantly Muslim countries reached a final stage on Wednesday at the Supreme Court, with its five-member conservative majority signaling it was ready to approve a revised version of the president’s plan. The justices appeared ready to discount Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to impose what he repeatedly described as a “Muslim ban,” while giving him the benefit of the doubt traditionally afforded to presidents. Some expressed worry about second-guessing executive branch determinations about who should be allowed to enter the United States. Immigrant rights groups had hoped that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. or Justice Anthony M. Kennedy would join the court’s four-member liberal wing to oppose the ban as unconstitutionally discriminatory against Muslims. But their questioning was almost uniformly hostile to the ban’s opponents. At one point in the oral arguments, Chief Justice Roberts asked whether Mr. Trump will forever be unable to address immigration in light of his campaign statements. “Is there a statute of limitations on that?” the chief justice asked. Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, representing the administration, said the latest travel ban, issued in September as a presidential proclamation, was not directed at Muslims. “This is not a so-called Muslim ban,” he said. “If it were, it would be the most ineffective Muslim ban that one could possibly imagine.” It excluded, he said, “the vast majority of the Muslim world.” "
"KEYSER, W.Va. — Don Blankenship is running for the United States Senate as a proud West Virginian with Appalachian roots, but his primary residence is a $2.4 million villa with palm trees and an infinity pool near Las Vegas. Mr. Blankenship, a Republican loyalist of President Trump, is running an America First-style campaign and calls himself an “American competitionist,” but he admires China’s state-controlled economy and has expressed interest in gaining Chinese citizenship. The former coal mining executive is widely known for spending a year in prison for his role in a mining explosion that claimed 29 lives. Yet ahead of the May 8 primary election, he is running as a champion of miners and has bought TV ads that challenge settled facts about his role in the disaster. And even as Mr. Blankenship seeks to join the Republican majority in Washington, a “super PAC” linked to the party establishment is attacking him as a “convicted criminal” and a hypocrite. No Republican candidate in the 2018 midterms embodies so many contradictions as pointedly as Mr. Blankenship, who was found guilty of conspiracy to violate mine safety standards in federal court and yet has plenty of supporters in coal country. He is one of three leading Republican contenders heading into the primary, even though he is lugging around enough political baggage to disqualify a candidate most anywhere else. "
"MAKE TROUBLE
Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead
By Cecile Richards with Lauren Peterson
304 pp. Touchstone. $27. Cecile Richards — the outgoing president of Planned Parenthood — may look calm and unflappable with her trademark blue suits and neat cap of golden hair, but she’s a troublemaker from way back. As a sixth grader in Dallas she refused to say the Lord’s Prayer in class. As a junior high schooler in Austin, she wore a black armband to express solidarity with the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, infuriating the principal. The rest is history. “Make Trouble” takes us through Richards’s life in activism and politics: Before Planned Parenthood, she had a full and varied career that included union organizing, starting the progressive organization America Votes and working for Nancy Pelosi. But there’s lots more, including loving depictions of family and friends, from the legendary Texas journalist Molly Ivins to her mother, Ann Richards, the “frustrated housewife” who became a beloved governor of Texas. Richards paints some vivid pictures of life in politics, too. For example, despite misgivings, she reached out to Ivanka Trump after hearing that she might want to help Planned Parenthood. They met at a Trump golf club in New Jersey, where Ivanka and her husband, Jared, offered her a deal: If Planned Parenthood stopped performing abortions, funding for birth control might go up. “Jared and Ivanka were there for one reason: to deliver a political win. In their eyes, if they could stop Planned Parenthood from providing abortions, it would confirm their reputation as savvy dealmakers. It was surreal, essentially being asked to barter away women’s rights for more money.” Books by public figures, especially when written with help from others — Lauren Peterson is a speechwriter — are often pretty deadly, but “Make Trouble” manages to be genial, engaging and humorous. (“It was almost like dealing with kidnappers,” is how Richards describes the months of waking to find yet another doctored video claiming to prove that Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue.) She’s good at sharing credit and giving praise — especially to her husband, the longtime labor organizer Kirk Adams, who was always game to move to a new city, take on a new adventure and pitch in with raising their three children. Her portrait of Nancy Pelosi as a nice person, a thoughtful boss and a brilliant strategist largely responsible for the passage of the Affordable Care Act (without the Stupak amendment that would have banned insurance coverage for abortion) is a pleasant corrective to the increasingly common view of her as an incompetent witch. As its title implies, this is not just a memoir but a call to action. Richards wants you to know that you too can make social change. She also wants you to know that a life of social activism is fun. She offers career advice (“never turn down a new opportunity”) and even travel tips (“try to know where the best ice cream is in any given airport terminal”). Considering how often progressives are portrayed as joyless scolds, this is a message that needs to get out more. There’s a lot of satisfaction in activism, even if you don’t win every battle. "
"WASHINGTON — It is supposed to be a last line of defense against a Sept. 11-style attack on the United States. But a federal program that puts armed undercover guards on commercial airliners is in such disarray that it does little to deter terrorists, many of its employees say, and is being investigated by Congress. Alcohol abuse among some in the Federal Air Marshal Service is so rampant that the Transportation Security Administration, which oversees the program, has had to monitor whether the armed guards show up for their flights sober, according to five people familiar with the situation. T.S.A. said its office of inspection makes quality assurance visits to ensure that the air marshals are properly prepared for their missions. Female and minority air marshals said in court documents and interviews that they faced discrimination at work, including being subjected to sexually explicit messages and racist jokes and memes sent on government-issued cellphones. Other air marshals said they were fired or threatened with termination for minor infractions, while misconduct by managers was overlooked. Just 22 percent of the marshals thought their leaders maintained “high standards of honesty and integrity,” according to a federal employee survey completed last year, one of the lowest rankings among agencies. “I ultimately decided to leave (retire) because I was denied the ability to leverage my experience for the good of the FAMs and I realize that I was part of a system which was putting the emotional well-being of FAMs at risk,” Kathleen Christian, who resigned last year as a clinical psychologist with the federal air marshals, said on Nov. 17 in a scathing email to several marshals. A copy was obtained by The New York Times. Congress has asked the Government Accountability Office, its investigative arm, to review the workplace complaints raised by air marshals, said Charles Young, a spokesman for the office. Employees with the air marshals view their jobs as crucial to overall efforts to protect airplanes and airports from terrorist attacks. But interviews with more than two dozen former and current federal air marshals describe an agency in crisis. "
"Dear tech workers, Long year, huh? I get it. Your industry is under siege. Whether you work at an established giant like Facebook or Google, a private company like Uber or Palantir, or a lesser-known start-up, it feels like you’re being attacked from a thousand directions. People are comparing your companies to Big Tobacco, and Congress is accusing your executives of undermining democracy, poisoning users’ brains and censoring content. All of a sudden, Silicon Valley — once the golden child of American industry — has become a villain. Some of the backlash probably feels excessive. After all, the tech industry still creates useful things and employs lots of decent and ethical people. But I’ve talked to a number of tech workers recently, and I’ve seen you wrestling with your consciences. Some of you have stopped wearing your company T-shirts around town, fearing dirty looks from strangers. Others have taken extended vacations after a particularly shameful scandal, or asked for a transfer within a company. More than a few of you have had awkward conversations with your parents. Here’s the thing, though. You don’t have to keep your concerns bottled up. You are your employers’ most valuable assets, and your bosses are desperate to keep you happy. As tech companies take on increasingly vital roles in global commerce and culture, you have the power to shape the way they operate and the ethical standards they uphold. If you want change, all you have to do is organize and speak up. In most industries, rank-and-file workers don’t have much say. The power of organized labor in America has been shrinking since the 1980s, and other than a few notable teachers’ strikes this year, large-scale collective action is rare these days. But tech is different. Unlike factories or airlines, tech companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain top talent. A shortage of skilled workers has led to lucrative bidding wars, tipping the balance of power in workers’ favor. Because many of them are attracted to altruistic missions — and unhappy or morally conflicted workers can easily find other jobs — executives are compelled to listen to them. "

If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. President Trump has shown a lot of affection for Emmanuel Macron during the French president’s visit to the White House this week. His handshakes seem to last a little too long, fingers get tangled, cheek-kisses flow abundantly. The late-night hosts rolled the tapes and let the jokes fly. One incident was a little less affectionate, but at least as awkward: Standing next to Macron, Trump told reporters he’d found dandruff on the French leader’s jacket. At one point in the visit Trump appeared to be trying to hold his wife, Melania’s, hand, while she avoided contact. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson’s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department has hit a major roadblock, with a number of serious accusations emerging against him in recent days. "
"TOKYO — Amid hurried preparations for the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s upcoming meetings with the presidents of South Korea and the United States, even the dessert menu is making Japan nervous. Upon learning of plans to serve Mr. Kim a mango mousse decorated with a map of the Korean Peninsula that includes islands over which Tokyo claims sovereignty, Japan’s Foreign Ministry lodged an official complaint with its neighbor. What might seem like a petty protest over dabs of icing speaks to long-simmering tensions between the two allies, but also anxiety in Japan that it is being left out as high-stakes talks with Mr. Kim on the fate of his nuclear arsenal begin. The disputed islands, in the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, are known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan. South Korea regularly depicts the islands on official maps, and Japan just as regularly protests. Japan’s unease extends beyond the moussed maps, of course. Given the speed at which the summit-level diplomacy is playing out, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has been working overtime to make sure his country is not forgotten. Last week, he traveled to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., to secure Mr. Trump’s agreement to seek the total abandonment of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs in his talks with Mr. Kim, and to press for the return of Japanese citizens abducted by the North decades ago.

"To the Editor: Re “Over 700 Children Taken From Parents at Border” (front page, April 21): The Department of Homeland Security’s practice of removing children from their parents upon crossing our borders is nothing short of horrifying. It is hard to imagine the mind-set that would sanction and pursue such a cruel and psychologically misguided policy. Children are dependent on their parents to help them manage and make sense of their world and deal with childhood anxieties. It would be terrifying for both the child and the parent to be abruptly separated from each other. Many prominent psychologists have written about the critical importance of this early dependent relationship and how disrupting it can seriously impair the child’s ability to develop into a healthy, well-functioning person. Failures in this area speak to a failure in our humanity. And they will inevitably give rise to a generation of individuals with severe psychological damage, which they will bring to the societies in which they live. JUDITH FELTON, NEW YORK The writer is a psychoanalyst and president of the Contemporary Freudian Society. "
"WASHINGTON — Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician nominated to lead the Veterans Affairs Department, provided such “a large supply” of Percocet, a prescription opioid, to a White House Military Office staff member that he threw his own medical staff “into a panic” when it could not account for the missing drugs, according to a summary of questionable deeds compiled by the Democratic staff of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. A nurse on his staff said Dr. Jackson had written himself prescriptions, and when caught, he simply asked a physician assistant to provide him with the medication. And at a Secret Service going away party, the doctor got intoxicated and “wrecked a government vehicle,” according to the summary. The two-page document, distributed by committee Democrats, fleshes out three categories of accusations — prescription drug misuse, hostile work environment and drunkenness — that threaten to derail President Trump’s nominee. Committee staff members say the summary details the testimony of 23 current and former colleagues of Dr. Jackson, many of whom are still in the military. An aide to Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the committee, said each allegation included in the document was based on information provided by two or more individuals. The new details came as White House officials on Wednesday ratcheted up their public defense of Dr. Jackson, calling the charges of workplace misconduct “outrageous,” even as new episodes of questionable conduct surfaced.

"Before she became a comedian, Michelle Wolf was a high school track star whose experience as a high jumper taught her a lasting metaphor about life.

SCARSDALE, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Punching Bag for President Now Has Clout” (front page, April 21), about the possibility that President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, would cooperate with investigators: Perhaps at some point before Donald Trump entered the presidential race, someone should have had the common courtesy to tell him that there is no omertà in American politics. DAVID J. MCCONNELL, LAS VEGAS To the Editor: Re “Thank Trump, or You’ll Be Sorry,” by Diana Butler Bass (Op-Ed, April 23): It is not gratitude that President Trump seeks. It’s adulation. It’s disturbing that leaders of other countries see this in him, enough so that they know they can manipulate him with praise. It’s bad enough when American allies know this. But hostile foreign powers also know it. PATTY QUINN, PHILADELPHIA "
"A lifetime ago, Anne Frank’s family applied for visas to the United States to escape Hitler, but we rejected the Franks and other desperate Jewish refugees. We thought: This is Europe’s problem, not ours, and we don’t want to be overrun by “those people.” Today President Trump is again slamming the door on desperate refugees. Indeed, the Trump administration is going a step further by wrenching children from the arms of asylum-seekers, apparently as a way of inflicting gratuitous cruelty to discourage new arrivals. José Demar Fuentes, a 30-year-old college graduate, arrived in November with his 1-year-old son, Mateo, from El Salvador, where Fuentes was on a gang’s execution list, according to his lawyer, Noreen Barcena. Father and son entered the United States legally, presenting themselves to an immigration officer, providing birth certificates and other documentation, and requesting asylum to save their lives. Several days later, immigration officers came and took Mateo. “They basically pried my client’s son from his arms and told him that he had to give up his son,” Barcena told me. “They were both crying.” Mateo ended up in foster care in Texas for about three months and had little or no contact with his family. Even kidnappers allow more communication. Caitlin Dickerson of The Times reported that more than 700 children have been separated from immigrant parents since October. "

ne of the first things you learn as a foreign correspondent is that history matters. Everywhere. So as I toured Port Arthur this week on a brisk Tasmanian morning, I wondered what the restored convict camp might have to teach. Our guides gave us clues more than conclusions. They pointed to the garden for guards’ families, set up to resemble an English country estate. They told us about punishment. They shared tales of individual prisoners and the British commandants who ran the place. But it was the cemetery just off the coast that lingered in my mind. Port Arthur’s upper-class overseers called it Isle of the Dead or Isle de Mort, and they were buried with headstones on the island’s highest point. The convicts just called it Dead Island. Their remains landed in unmarked graves near the water so their watchmen, our guide told us, “could look down on them in death as in life.” Some of the convicts probably deserved it. But walking among Port Arthur’s dead, it was hard to escape the sanctimonious rigidity of the English class system, made even more extreme by the culture of 19th-century incarceration. "
"The last year has been difficult for Time magazine. In November, it was sold with its corporate siblings People, Sports Illustrated, Entertainment Weekly and In Style to the Meredith Corporation in a $2.8 billion deal. Then in March 2018, the Meredith Corporation declared that it was selling the magazines that don’t fit its “main portfolio” — Time chief among them. That made Time 100 Gala on Tuesday night, which celebrated its 100 Most Influential People issue, more than just another party. It was to show that Time was still relevant. And there were big gets. In the cocktail area at the Time Warner Center, Leslie Jones was rocking a flat top, a white blazer and a pair of black sunglasses that gave her a Grace Jones by way of a Supreme drop vibe. Nearby was Maxine Waters, the California congresswoman whose ability to throw shade at Donald Trump and the Republicans earned her a place among the Time class of 2018. How much longer did Ms. Waters think Mr. Trump would be in office for her to kick around? “Not long,” she said. “I hope.” Just after 8 p.m., guests made their way into a tiered amphitheater for dinner. The biggest stars were on the lower levels, yet the traffic seemed to be flowing to the top, where Emma González and other survivors of the Parkland school shooting were seated. Celebrities of all stripes wanted to meet Ms. González, though she herself said the person she really wanted to meet was Trevor Noah. “Not to be that hipster person, but I love his comedy,” she said.

"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, will invoke his Fifth Amendment right in a lawsuit filed against the president by Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star better known as Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen’s decision, disclosed Wednesday in a court filing in California, where the suit was filed, came a day before a federal judge in Manhattan was set to hold a hearing regarding materials seized from Mr. Cohen during an F.B.I. raid earlier this month. Mr. Cohen cited the Manhattan investigation in his filing on Wednesday, saying that, if called as a witness in Ms. Clifford’s lawsuit, “I will assert my 5th Amendment rights in connection with all proceedings in this case due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the F.B.I. and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.” Ms. Clifford was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about claims that she had an affair with Mr. Trump. She sued last month to get out of the nondisclosure agreement she signed in October 2016, alleging that it was void because Mr. Trump had never signed it. Citing the Fifth Amendment in the Clifford case allows Mr. Cohen to avoid being deposed and revealing sensitive information in the more important criminal investigation. That investigation — which prosecutors say has been going on for months — became public in dramatic fashion on April 9, when agents from the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and a room at the Loews Regency Hotel he had been using. The inquiry is said to be focusing on hush-money payments that Mr. Cohen made to — or helped arrange for — Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who has also said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. For days now, prosecutors from the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan have been sparring with Mr. Cohen’s lawyers — and with lawyers for Mr. Trump — for the right to review the records first, a step that will shape the contours of how the government presses its investigation into whether Mr. Cohen tried to suppress negative news coverage of the president in the run-up to the 2016 election.

"At this point you have to ask: Just what do job postings for the Trump administration look like? Surely they must stipulate that relevant experience isn’t a plus, but that a flexible notion of ethics is. They must demand references who can recount specific instances of demonstrated incompetence. How else to explain the sheer number of poorly prepared or careless or sticky-fingered officials crammed into this careening clown-car of an administration? Consider the Trump appointees who have been in the news lately. Let’s start with Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician who on Thursday backed out of his nomination to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides health care to more than nine million vets and is the largest federal department after the Pentagon, and whose nomination was just withdrawn by the White House. More than 20 people who have worked with Dr. Jackson told senators either that he was drunk on the job, handed out sleeping pills, and even opioids, like Skittles, or screamed at his staff. The latest allegation is that he reportedly got drunk and wrecked a government car. Maybe, maybe, you could have overlooked all that if he had impressive qualifications to run one of the country’s largest and most important health systems — like management experience. But as best as anyone can tell, Mr. Trump picked Dr. Jackson because he is in the military, looks like a grown-up Doogie Howser and gave the president a glowing bill of health, including saying that the president has great genes and could have lived to 200 if he had had a better diet. Until Thursday morning, the White House pressed ahead with Dr. Jackson even as several senior Republican senators did everything they could to signal that it should cut bait. "
"WASHINGTON — The United States is pushing to quickly conclude a revised North American Free Trade Agreement during talks in Washington this week, but another, potentially insurmountable obstacle looms: getting such a deal through Congress. A revised deal with Canada and Mexico will need approval from the Senate and House, which, under current trade laws, must pass the revamped agreement by a simple majority. But Republicans may balk at some of the provisions, including overhauls to investment rules that help companies invest abroad, while Democrats, who have long criticized the existing deal, may argue that President Trump’s changes do not go far enough. Congressional approval has become the latest sticking point in the revamp of a trade pact that, after eight months of fractious negotiations, could finally be in reach. Ministers from Canada, Mexico and the United States were scheduled to temporarily wrap up talks on Thursday, but lower-level negotiators could continue meeting into next week. The three countries are making progress on the rules for manufacturing automobiles in North America, but they have yet to near consensus on other contentious parts, like methods for settling trade disputes, or patents for medicines, people briefed on the discussions said. Deadlines are now looming to complete negotiations and the administration is seeking to conclude a final deal in the next two to six weeks, before presidential elections in Mexico and midterm congressional elections in the United States. Administration officials want to announce an agreement in principle before next week, when Robert Lighthizer, the top trade adviser, is scheduled to travel to China for trade talks. That is also when a temporary exemption that the United States has granted Canada and Mexico from new steel and aluminum tariffs officially expires. A quick agreement would give the administration sufficient time to make the necessary notifications to Congress that are required under current law while still having the Republican-controlled Congress vote on the deal in a lame-duck session — after midterm elections that could allow Democrats to reclaim the House and potentially the Senate, but before newly elected lawmakers take their seats.

"It was not quite the blue wave that Democrats in New York had hoped for, but the results of Tuesday’s special elections in 11 state legislative seats did give the party hope that they might be able to help national Democrats retake the House of Representatives in the fall. Perhaps the brightest result for Democrats was in a highly contested race for State Senate in Westchester County, where the Democratic candidate, Assemblywoman Shelley B. Mayer, defeated the Republican, Julie Killian, by 15 points. And, as was expected, Democrats easily kept the vacant Assembly seats in their column in races in the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens, where the party enjoys a giant surplus in voter registrations. But the picture outside the city was mixed, where expectations for a blue wave felt more like a ripple. On Long Island, for instance, where three Assembly seats were vacated by Republicans, the special election kept two of those districts red. The third, in Suffolk County, was a notable exception: In the 10th Assembly District, Steve Stern, a Democrat and former county legislator, won a seat that had been in Republican control for 40 years. In two other Assembly races outside Albany, formerly Republican seats stayed that way — but just barely. In both the 102nd and 107th Districts in the capital region, the Republican challengers eked out victories, edging out their Democratic rivals by only 200 to 300 votes. "
"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions evaded lawmakers’ questions on Wednesday about whether his longstanding recusal from campaign-related investigations extended to the Justice Department inquiry into President Trump’s personal lawyer, saying only that he would not confirm the existence of the investigation itself. “I should not answer that question,” he said in testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, citing departmental rules about refraining from publicly discussing ongoing inquiries. “It would be inappropriate.” The wide-ranging corruption investigation into the lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has further strained the ties between the president and his top Justice Department officials. Their relationship has been fraught since Mr. Sessions recused himself last year from oversight of all campaign-related investigations, including the examination of Russia’s election interference and possible ties to Trump associates. The topic of recusal is particularly sensitive for Mr. Sessions, once a close ally of Mr. Trump and one of his earliest political supporters. By refusing to answer lawmakers’ questions about the Cohen investigation, Mr. Sessions avoided further wrath from Mr. Trump if he were to conclude that his attorney general had stepped back from an inquiry that the president is said to view as a greater threat than the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling. Mr. Sessions also demurred when asked whether he would quit if the president or his allies fired Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who oversees the special counsel investigation. “The question calls for speculation,” Mr. Sessions said. “I am not able to do that.” In stepping aside, Mr. Sessions cited his support for Mr. Trump during the presidential race as a potential conflict and said he was following Justice Department guidelines. But the president, who has said he viewed Mr. Sessions as a protector in his role as attorney general, has chafed about it since. The recusal helped lead to the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. "
"Exercising a seldom-used power, the judges of the Federal District Court in Manhattan voted unanimously on Wednesday to appoint Geoffrey S. Berman as the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, according to a court statement. Mr. Berman was appointed interim United States attorney in January, and his 120-day term was due to expire next week. With no one yet nominated by President Trump for the Southern District position, the judges acted to fill it with Mr. Berman. Under federal law, he will now serve until the Senate confirms a nominee by President Trump, whose administration has been slow to fill many posts in the executive and judicial branches. The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan is overseeing the federal investigation of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, and it recently emerged that Mr. Berman has been recused, for undisclosed reasons. His deputy, Robert S. Khuzami, is overseeing the inquiry. Mr. Trump has called an F.B.I. raid on Mr. Cohen’s office, home and hotel room “a disgraceful situation” and a “total witch hunt.” Mr. Berman, 58, was one of 17 United States attorneys around the country appointed in January on an interim basis by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

"Right now you’re probably asking yourselves — How is Mitt Romney doing? You know he’s running for the Senate in Utah, right? It’s going to be one of the really big races this fall. O.K., possibly not as riveting as the Republican primary in West Virginia, which features a former coal mining executive who hopes voters will be so enamored with his pro-business platform they’ll ignore his role in a fatal mine explosion, the poisoning of local drinking water and the fact that he actually seems to live near Las Vegas. But a Romney comeback would still be pretty darned interesting. True, the world was totally sick of him after those two terrible presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012. Remember when he claimed he’d only been pro-choice when he ran for governor of Massachusetts because he didn’t understand what an embryo was? Or when his position on the wealth gap was, “There’s no question it’s not good being poor”? Then he moved to Utah, and we forgot all about Mitt until he popped up in 2016 as a never-Trumper, tossing out the worst slams his little entrepreneurial heart could think of. (“He inherited his business. He didn’t create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines?”) After Trump was nominated, Romney swore he’d never vote for him, although he backed off the obvious alternative of Hillary Clinton. No, Mitt was a proud and useless Mystery Vote, musing about the relative advantages of going with the Libertarian or writing in his wife. When Trump won, Romney reappeared in a third incarnation, as the Secretary-of-State-in-Waiting who dined out with the president-elect, burbling about his “message of inclusion.” Then it became clear Trump was just dangling the nomination for the fun of seeing his old enemy leap up and down trying to grab it. No Cabinet Mitt. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has proposed legislation that could triple rents on the poorest tenants in federally subsidized housing as part of a push to redefine housing assistance as a temporary benefit instead of the permanent source of shelter it has become for millions of poor people. The legislation, spurred by Mr. Trump’s conservative budget director, Mick Mulvaney, and drafted by aides to Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, would also allow local governments to impose work requirements on tenants in public housing deemed fit for work. The plan would also increase rents for elderly and disabled people after six years, agency officials said. But the new rules would hit the poorest residents hardest, with minimum monthly rents in public housing developments and for recipients of Section 8 vouchers rising to $150 a month from $50. The increases would affect about 712,000 families over the next several years, HUD officials said. Rent hikes would gradually be phased in for tenants based on their income and other provisions that could effectively limit the amount of time some tenants would be allowed to remain in government-funded housing. “Every year, it takes more money, millions of dollars more, to serve the same number of households,” Mr. Carson told reporters Wednesday in a conference call. “It’s clear from a budget perspective and a human point of view that the current system is unsustainable.” "

"WASHINGTON — As crazy as it seems — though in this world, that’s a high bar — the mercurial president accused of racist comments and the bombastic rapper accused of supporting him have long seemed to enjoy each other’s company. President Trump and the rapper, Kanye West, share a history of unpredictable behavior — and a delight in freaking out and, perhaps, dividing an already divided public. On Wednesday, the Chicago-raised Mr. West and the Queens-born Mr. Trump joined forces again, this time on Twitter, with the president thanking Mr. West for his public praise, including an assertion that the two were brothers who shared “dragon energy.” In a string of tweets that seemed to outrage and concern his fans, Mr. West tried to defend his admiration for the president from “the mob” of people who “can’t make me not love him.” “You don’t have to agree with trump,” Mr. West tweeted. “I love everyone. I don’t agree with everything anyone does. That’s what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.” "
"Rudolph W. Giuliani, the new head of President Trump’s legal team, met with the special counsel’s office on Tuesday as he tries to expedite the end of the far-flung inquiry into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russian officials, three people familiar with the meeting said. Mr. Giuliani declined to confirm whether a meeting took place. But the three people briefed on the sit-down — the first since the former New York City mayor joined the legal team last week — described it as a productive effort to reopen negotiations over a possible interview that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is seeking with the president. News of the meeting was first reported by The Washington Post. In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said that his goal in the coming days was to find out where Mr. Mueller stands, particularly as it relates to the credibility of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director whom the president fired in April 2017. Mr. Comey has been interviewed by Mr. Mueller, and he has been deeply, personally critical of the president in his media tour promoting his new memoir. “At this stage of an investigation, it’d be highly unusual to let an ordinary client testify,” Mr. Giuliani said. However, he added, “This isn’t an ordinary client. This is the president of the United States.” He said that they were trying to assess whether Mr. Mueller “and his staff are truly objective,” particularly in terms of Mr. Comey. “Obviously, if they’ve already made up their minds, we’d be stupid to do that.” Mr. Trump’s legal team is not united on precisely how to deal with Mr. Mueller’s office going forward. But a person familiar with the discussions said that they expected to visit with Mr. Mueller’s team in the next few days as they try to find a path forward. "
"WASHINGTON — When the government of South Korea announced last week that it would begin work on a formal peace treaty with North Korea, to be discussed at a summit meeting on April 27, its so-called Sunshine Policy of engagement gave way to P.T. Barnum-style, a-sucker-born-every-minute diplomacy. Fighting in the Korean War ended in 1953 with just an armistice, and South Korean officials are calling for a “permanent peace.” But it is not merely unrealistic to hope that Kim Jong-un, the leader of the North, will offer the South real and lasting peace; it is delusional. If the past is any guide, the North will offer the South unenforceable verbiage. And if the South accepts a phony peace ploy, it will expose itself to more manipulation by the government in Pyongyang — not only in its domestic politics, but potentially also in its alliance with the United States. Let’s begin with the obvious. A peace treaty between two countries is a legal document that requires one sovereign state to recognize the other sovereign state’s right to exist. (Think Camp David accords of 1978, when Egypt agreed to recognize Israel.) Yet North Korea cannot commit to any such thing with South Korea, not least because the existential objective of its ruling family, the Kims, has been to wipe the state of South Korea off the face of the earth. That goal was the reason for the North’s surprise attack against the South in June 1950 that triggered the Korean War. And it has been the main focus of North Korea’s external policy since the 1953 cease-fire in that still-unfinished conflict. It is a central duty, fused into the very identity of the state, indelibly registered in Pyongyang’s institutions and ideology. The 1980 charter of the Workers’ Party of Korea, the ruling party, identified its “present task” as the “national liberation and people’s democracy in the entire area of the country” — meaning, the whole of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea’s Constitution declares “reunification of the country” to be “the supreme national task” and instructs the government to “carry the revolutionary cause of juche through to completion.” Juche is the doctrine extolling the vision of the entire Korean people gathering together self-determinedly under an “independent socialist state” run by Pyongyang. "
"WASHINGTON — Two back-to-back court developments this week indicate a possible road map for President Trump through the minefield of legal resistance he has faced as judges across the country have blocked much of his hard-line immigration agenda. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled in favor of an Obama-era immigration program but offered Mr. Trump the chance for a do-over, giving the president 90 days to provide a stronger legal justification to shut down the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects young immigrants from deportation. On Wednesday, in a separate case involving Mr. Trump’s efforts to ban travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, the Supreme Court strongly signaled that the administration’s third try at the issue would work. Questions by the justices indicated that they would most likely back Mr. Trump’s revised effort to assert executive authority over the border with “extreme vetting.” The judiciary has historically given presidents wide latitude to limit immigration, enforce the country’s borders and manage national security. Now, after a year and a half of deep skepticism about Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, legal experts said the courts are effectively saying that Mr. Trump can earn that kind of latitude if he goes about it the right way. “The courts are giving the Trump administration guidance on how to exercise their authority,” said Josh Blackman, an associate professor of law at the South Texas College of Law in Houston. On Tuesday’s DACA ruling, Mr. Blackman said, “This actually gives Trump a chance to clean it up and issue a new memo that will stand up on appeal.” Critics of Mr. Trump say they still believe the courts will rule against the president and declare his efforts unconstitutional.

"It’s a nightmare scenario, but it’s not hard to imagine: President Trump, growing tired of the Russia investigation as it closes in on him, fires Robert S. Mueller III and moves to dismantle the Office of Special Counsel. This would be a serious assault on the rule of law in the United States. The ability of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws would be in grave doubt. By now, Mr. Mueller has presumably amassed a great deal of evidence, some of which is highly classified, that may point toward serious crimes. Americans might reasonably wonder whether perpetrators, if they exist, would ever face justice. We hope that such a constitutional crisis is unlikely. But if it does come to pass, there is a way that Mr. Mueller and his staff could prevent their important work from being permanently buried: They could become lawful whistle-blowers. Many people think that exposing classified misconduct requires breaking the law. Not necessarily. If Mr. Mueller is fired, he and his team would not have to do anything illegal to disclose classified information and ensure that the American people learned the truth. Here’s how it could work: The moment he was dismissed, Mr. Mueller could lawfully take all the evidence he had collected — even the most highly classified materials — straight to Congress. If he personally lost access to the evidence, a remaining member of the Office of Special Counsel could do the same. Such a move would require speedy execution, so his office should already have a contingency plan. It is illegal to send classified documents across the regular internet, and Congress does not have access to the secure email system used by the executive branch. Therefore, someone with proper security clearance would probably need to manually transport the evidence — hard copy pages or encrypted hard drives — from the special counsel’s facility to Capitol Hill, less than a mile away.

"Despite it all, the Facebook juggernaut marches on. The social network is undergoing its worst crisis in its 14-year history as it faces a torrent of criticism about its privacy practices and the way it handles user data. But on Wednesday, Facebook showed that — as with past scandals — the controversy is so far doing little to hurt its bottom line. The Silicon Valley company reported a 63 increase in profit and a 49 percent jump in revenue for the first quarter, driven by continued growth in its mobile advertising business. Mobile advertising now represents more than 90 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue. The company also said that it added 70 million monthly active users last quarter, bringing it to 2.2 billion monthly active users as of March. The results sent Facebook’s shares up more than 7 percent in aftermarket trading on Wednesday, reflecting Wall Street’s willingness to shrug off the company’s privacy issues as long as the money keeps flowing in. “All the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. “All investors are looking for is a change in user metrics.” "
"WASHINGTON — One day after President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Trump showered each other with praise, the French president spoke more critically of his host’s foreign policy, trade and environmental decisions in a speech to Congress that amounted to an implicit rebuke of Mr. Trump’s “America First” approach. Mr. Macron, who traveled to Washington this week hoping to persuade the American president not to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal, reiterated his argument for preserving the deal even as he said he and Mr. Trump had decided to pursue “a more comprehensive deal” to restrain Tehran. The French president used his speech in the House chamber to urge Mr. Trump not to shrink from the leadership role the United States had played in forging the pact that Mr. Trump on Tuesday called “insane” and “ridiculous” — in the first place. “We signed it,” Mr. Macron said of the nuclear deal with Iran, raising a finger for emphasis, “at the initiative of the United States. We signed it — both the United States and France. That is why we cannot say we should get rid of it like that.” Mr. Macron acknowledged that the deal had not addressed crucial concerns, including future nuclear activities in Iran, the use of ballistic missiles and the country’s destabilizing activities in the region. “But we should not abandon it without having something substantial, and more substantial, instead,” he added. “What we decided, together with your president, is that we can work on a more comprehensive deal addressing all these concerns.” Later, in a news conference before wrapping up his three-day visit to the United States — the first formal state visit of the Trump era — Mr. Macron told reporters that while he could not be certain, he expected that Mr. Trump would disregard his entreaties and withdraw from the nuclear deal after all, given that scrapping it was a campaign promise.

"Updated June 26, 2018: In a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that President Trump acted lawfully in imposing limits on travel from several predominantly Muslim nations. Read our coverage of the decision. The Supreme Court in April heard arguments on President Trump’s third travel ban — perhaps the most contentious case they’ll hear this term. The case, Trump v. Hawaii, No. 17-965, was argued for the Trump administration by Noel J. Francisco, the solicitor general, and for the state of Hawaii by Neal K. Katyal. The full transcript is available here. What follows is a selection of some of the questions the justices grappled with. Mr. Francisco insisted that the details of immigration policy were for the president to decide. This colorful and provocative question from Justice Kagan cut to the heart of the case.  How much deference is owed a president who harbors illegitimate motives for what may be an otherwise permissible policy? Mr. Francisco gave a forthright answer to what he called a very hard question from Justice Kagan. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. New allegations emerged against Dr. Ronny Jackson, the president’s physician and nominee to lead the Veteran Affairs Department. Dr. Jackson is said to have given large amounts of Percocet to a colleague, and to have gotten drunk at a Secret Service party and “wrecked” a car. The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee has heard testimony from 23 current and former colleagues of Dr. Jackson. Democrats circulated a summary that paints a picture of prescription drug misuse, a hostile work environment and drunkenness. But White House officials have ratcheted up their public defense of Dr. Jackson. We discussed his prospects on our podcast “The Daily.” On Thursday, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is set to testify before Congress amid a series of ethics investigations. We obtained an internal document that appears to lay out his talking points. It suggests he may blame his staff for many of the decisions that have put a cloud over his tenure. _____ "

"On Wednesday night Meghan Markle finally walked down the wedding aisle, resplendent in a lacy, sparkling white dress. It was, of course, the “Suits” season finale, and she was marrying her on-show fiancé. But it was also a mere three weeks or so before Ms. Markle herself — biracial American, now former actress, divorcée, United Nations women’s advocate — will walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle to to marry her real fiancé, Prince Harry (beloved royal soldier and hell raiser turned mental health activist). That made for a digital frenzy about what may be coming, which is only going to grow as the days wind down. After all, the drip-drip-drip of details has already sped up. The betting is closed. On what? The still outstanding question: What will she wear? There are economic and cultural repercussions riding on the answer. And you thought it was just a dress. Pshaw. First, odds were on Ralph & Russo, makers of Ms. Markle’s official engagement dress. Then Erdem Moralioglu. After all, he is a Canadian — Ms. Markle lived in Toronto while she filmed “Suits” — who has become a stalwart of London Fashion Week, famous for his way with a romantic lace dress, and Ms. Markle told Vanity Fair she had been wearing his clothes for years. Then Burberry became a favorite, because — well, Britishness. (It probably won’t be the Anne Barge “Versailles” gown Ms. Markle wore in “Suits,” though that extravaganza did have a princess vibe.) The answer won’t be certain until the bride appears on May 19, but what is increasingly clear is that whoever the designer is, he or she will be vaulted into the global conversation. In today’s influencer culture, when an individual’s ability to ignite far-reaching trends simply by dint of her own appeal is more effective than any advertising campaign, and a photo can carry a message round the world more powerfully than any words, it is beginning to seem as if Ms. Markle could be the most influential of all.

"Two prominent Hollywood production companies have acquired the rights to produce a film based on The New York Times’s coverage of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein, The Times confirmed on Thursday. The movie will follow the work of Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, investigative reporters at The Times, and their editor, Rebecca Corbett. The team’s reporting on Mr. Weinstein helped set off the #MeToo movement and earn The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service. The rights were bought by Plan B, a production company co-founded by Brad Pitt that produced “12 Years a Slave” and “Moonlight,” and Annapurna Pictures, founded by Megan Ellison, the company behind “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Phantom Thread.” In October, an article by Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein, one of the most powerful executives in Hollywood. That article, along with reporting by Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker, led to a global movement that would expose sexual misconduct by prominent men in numerous industries, as well as the everyday sexism and abuse experienced by millions of women. After the news broke, Mr. Weinstein told The Hollywood Reporter, “The story sounds so good, I want to buy the movie rights.” He was soon fired from the movie company he co-founded. Subsequent Times articles revealed many more victims of Mr. Weinstein’s harassment, including the actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow. By the end of October, the list of known allegations stretched back to the 1970s. The Times later documented how Mr. Weinstein’s abuses went unchecked for decades with help from his associates. The movie deal, first reported Wednesday by Deadline Hollywood, stemmed from a new partnership between The Times and Anonymous Content’s media rights division. Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey are also writing a book for Penguin Press. Despite the challenges facing the media industry, journalism has become a hot subject for mass entertainment. The movie “Spotlight,” about the Boston Globe investigation that uncovered sexual abuse of children within the Roman Catholic Church, won best picture at the 2016 Academy Awards, and “The Post,” about The Washington Post’s efforts to publish the Pentagon Papers, was a box office hit in late 2017 and early 2018. Next month, Showtime will start airing a prime-time documentary series, “The Fourth Estate,” that follows a group of Times journalists in New York and Washington as they cover the Trump administration and other major stories. The director, Liz Garbus, was granted behind-the-scenes access to the paper for more than a year. And on Wednesday, Netflix announced a weekly series, “Follow This,” that accompanies BuzzFeed News journalists on the job. "
"With less than 200 days until the midterm elections, Democrats are generally thought to have a slight advantage in the fight for control of the House. That doesn’t mean they are going to prevail. The polls could be wrong, as all should understand by now, and there’s more than enough time for the national political environment to turn in favor of the Republicans. But these four indicators, for now, are consistent with a Democratic edge. Here’s what they are and what they’re telling us. One of the best measures of the national political environment is the generic congressional ballot, a poll question asking voters whether they intend to support Democrats or Republicans in the next election. The final generic ballot numbers typically perform well in approximating the House popular vote. Even this far ahead of an election, the generic ballot can do a decent job of predicting the final results.  And Democrats can reasonably hope for their lead to grow, given the tendency of the measure to break toward the party out of power. The Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot is around seven points, one of their weakest leads of the last year. At their peak, in December, Democrats led by 13 points, after the passage of the Republican tax cut bill. Obviously, the larger the lead for the Democrats, the better their chances this November. But even a seven-point advantage is far from bad news for the party. In recent wave elections, the party out of power has won the House national popular vote by six to eight points. So there’s no contradiction between a seven-point Democratic edge and an extremely favorable national political environment. It’s also consistent with most of the reporting on the state of specific Republican incumbents. A recent Politico article, for instance, described Republican troubles in safe districts like North Carolina’s 13th, North Carolina’s Ninth, Virginia’s Second, Virginia’s Fifth and Virginia’s Seventh.

"LONDON — Alfie Evans does not know it, but he is the subject of a national debate in Britain, international diplomacy and a bitter legal dispute. He is held up as a tragedy, a beacon of hope and an object lesson. And he might not live to turn 2 years old. The hospital and doctors treating him in Liverpool say that Alfie suffers from a degenerative neurological condition that is certainly fatal, that he is in a semi-vegetative state and that the only humane course of action is to let him die. His parents, supported by the Italian and Polish governments and the pope, are not convinced that he is beyond hope, or even that the doctors understand his condition, and they want to continue his care. On Wednesday, the British Court of Appeal upheld a ruling that not only approved the withdrawal of care and sustenance, but also prohibited his parents from seeking treatment elsewhere, despite an invitation to take him to a hospital in Rome. The decision is wrenching to the parents, the courts have said, but prolonging Alfie’s life would prolong his suffering, and so it would be contrary to his interests. The staff of Alder Hey Children’s Hospital took Alfie off a ventilator on Monday, but defying expectations, he kept breathing on his own. The parents’ lawyers from the Christian Legal Centre have said they will continue their appeals. “For the third day now, there’s been not one single problem with him,” his father, Tom Evans, told reporters outside the hospital on Thursday, insisting that Alfie was not suffering, despite what doctors have said. “It’s not a miracle, it’s a misdiagnosis.” [Do you think parental feelings or government decision-making should prevail in cases like that of Alfie Evans?

"To the Editor: Re “White House Withdraws Jackson Nomination for V.A. Chief Amid Criticism” (nytimes.com, April 26): The fact that Dr. Ronny L. Jackson withdrew his nomination as secretary of veterans affairs reinforces the failure of Donald Trump as an effective administrator. Additionally, it reveals that President Trump’s vetting process (if there is one) is not working. Taken together with the wide turnover of other people from the Trump administration, it is truly a reflection of who Mr. Trump is: a reactive and emotional manager, not thoughtful, knowledgeable, detailed or a rational leader. So much for his campaign proclamations that he will select only “top-of-the-line professionals” and only the “best and most serious people” to fill his administration. Sure thing, Mr. Trump! MICHAEL HADJIARGYROU
CENTERPORT, N.Y. To the Editor: “What do you need this for?” President Trump said he asked Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, his then foundering nominee to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. In this moment of candor, Mr. Trump exposed his own fundamental concept of public service: What’s in it for me? ALLAN LEEDY, PORTLAND, ORE. To the Editor: As a physician in the uniformed services, Ronny L. Jackson is required to have a medical license from a state or a United States territory. It would seem that whatever agency approved his license might want to investigate some of these very public charges of possible violations of medical ethics. LINDA CRABBE, ALAMEDA, CALIF.

"In 1989, NBC News did a special on race in America, in which it interviewed a young Donald Trump, who was then a couple of years younger than I am now. “A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market,” he said. “And I think a black sometimes may think that they don’t really have the advantage, or this or that, but in actuality, today, currently, it’s a, it’s a great — I’ve said on more than one occasion, even about myself, if I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black because I really believe that they do have an actual advantage today.” I was a second-year college student at the time, striving, I guess, to become one of those “well-educated blacks,” completely unaware that the man who just months earlier had taken out full-page ads in New York City newspapers demanding the death penalty for the Central Park Five was pretending to covet my burgeoning position in society. But of course, Trump was incredulous of his own comment, notable from the way he began to smirk as he mouthed the words “I would love to be a well-educated black.” It wasn’t sincerity but sarcasm. It was a way of making a point, not about jealousy but about resentment. It was a way of damning with faint praise the idea that the inviolable dominance of white male privilege in America was entering a period in which not every shred of advantage would redound to white men, even if a vast majority still did. Trump was attempting to express a white male anger and anxiety as made-for-television profundity and witticism. It would in many ways foretell a strategy that worked well for him decades later when he ran for president. Trump’s ability to completely embody and effectively project the petrifying fear young white men feel about the erosion of their privilege is a large part of the reason he is president today. "
"WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee fired a political warning shot at the White House on Thursday, advancing on a bipartisan vote long-stalled legislation to allow special counsels such as Robert S. Mueller III to appeal their firing to a panel of judges and possibly be reinstated. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has stated unequivocally that he will not bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. But with four Republicans, including the committee’s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, joining Democrats to vote in favor of it, the measure sent a clear message to President Trump that there would be serious consequences to firing the special counsel. Even senators who voted against the legislation warned Mr. Trump against trying to dismiss Mr. Mueller. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, said that “firing Mueller would cause a firestorm and bring the administration’s agenda to a halt. It could even result in impeachment.” Mr. Trump seemingly offered fresh reason for their concern earlier on Thursday. In a telephone interview with “Fox & Friends,” he again aired his frustration with the Justice Department and with Mr. Mueller’s team, which he dismissed as being filled with partisan Democrats. He said he had been trying not to interfere in matters before the Justice Department. But, Mr. Trump warned, “at some point I won’t.” Democrats have been clamoring for the Senate to move the legislation for weeks, as Mr. Trump has escalated his attacks on the special counsel investigation and contemplated removing key figures overseeing it. They claimed Thursday’s vote as a modest, if mostly symbolic, victory. “Frankly, I’ve never been so concerned that the walls protecting the independence and integrity of our law enforcement institutions are at risk of crumbling,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the longest-serving member of the Senate. “I’m hoping that the strong bipartisan stance we are taking today may save us from waking up to a tweetstorm that sends us careening toward a constitutional crisis.” "
"HOUSTON — As President Trump moves to recast trade and border relations with Mexico, American oil companies are worried that the prospective winner of Mexico’s presidential election will play his own nationalist card. The leading candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, wants to reverse policies that have tied a knot between Mexico and the United States in recent years in energy production and consumption. And he has promised to make sure that oil never falls “back into the hands of foreigners.” In addition to threatening refinery profits in the United States, his proposals could slow oil production in Texas and impede deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico by international oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. They would also jeopardize the United States’ energy trade surplus with Mexico, which reached roughly $15 billion last year. Mr. López Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City with leftist leanings, has a comfortable lead in the polls ahead of the July 1 vote. He has moderated his tone since losing the presidential race six years ago, but he has proposed a sweeping reorientation of the nation’s energy policy with an emphasis on independence from the United States. He has pledged to end oil exports, nearly all of which go to the United States, by 2022, and to instead spend $6 billion on building two refineries that would process crude for domestic consumption. That would sharply reduce American exports of gasoline to Mexico. Mr. López Obrador and his top energy adviser, Rocío Nahle, a former legislator who is in line to become energy minister, have called for a freeze on future deepwater drilling auctions and a review of contracts with international oil companies.

"WASHINGTON — The Senate easily confirmed Mike Pompeo on Thursday as the United States’ 70th secretary of state, elevating the current C.I.A. director and an outspoken foreign policy hawk to be the nation’s top diplomat. In the end, the 57-to-42 tally lacked the drama of other nail-biting confirmation votes in the Trump era. This week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the nominee’s main Republican antagonist, bowed to pressure from President Trump to drop his objections. Ultimately, seven members of the Senate Democratic caucus — five of whom face re-election this year in states that Mr. Trump won in 2016 — joined a united Republican conference to support Mr. Pompeo’s confirmation. Shortly after the vote at the Capitol, Mr. Pompeo went across the street to the Supreme Court, where he was sworn in by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Mr. Pompeo then dashed to Joint Base Andrews, where a plane was waiting to fly him to Brussels for a meeting of NATO allies. Senior staff on the plane greeted him with applause. Over the next three days, he will also travel to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Jerusalem; and Amman, Jordan. Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Pompeo’s predecessor, never went to Jerusalem out of deference to Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, whose portfolio included an effort to negotiate a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Pompeo’s agenda is already packed, with crucial deadlines in the coming weeks involving Russia, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela. And he must face these challenges while trying to repair a State Department damaged under the tenure of Mr. Tillerson and the crucial alliances frayed during the Trump presidency. Senators were mindful of the need to get Mr. Pompeo in place, given the crush of work facing him. His confirmation seemed all but assured after Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, a Democrat who is running for re-election in a state that Mr. Trump won by a wide margin, said last week that she would support him.

"During an expansive phone call with the hosts of “Fox & Friends” on Thursday morning, President Trump distanced himself from his personal lawyer Michael D. Cohen and offered more details of negotiations with North Korea. He also made statements about Iran, unemployment among black Americans, his record on deregulation and the 2016 election results that were imprecise or lacked context. Below is an assessment. The United States did not directly give Iran money as part of the 2015 nuclear deal. But the United States and European nations did release about $100 billion — not $150 billion — in previously frozen Iranian assets. Much of that money is tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion. The Obama administration did transfer $1.7 billion — not $1.8 billion — to Iran in 2016. That money was delivered in cash, some of it on a plane. But it was a payment related to a decades-long dispute and was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. As The Times has previously reported: "

Mr. Jost and Mr. Che will be the first current “S.N.L.” cast members to host the Emmys since Eddie Murphy in 1983. “S.N.L.” is in the midst of a resurgence, partly thanks to its spoofing of — and rivalry with — President Trump.

"SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Jong-un on Friday became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korean-controlled territory, starting a historic summit meeting with the South’s president that will test Mr. Kim’s willingness to bargain away his nuclear weapons. Mr. Kim’s crossing of the line at the heart of the world’s most heavily armed border zone, a prospect that seemed unthinkable just a few months ago, was broadcast live in South Korea, where a riveted nation sought to discern the intentions of the North’s 34-year-old leader. For South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who has placed himself at the center of diplomacy to end the nuclear standoff with the North, the meeting presents a formidable task: finding a middle ground between a cunning enemy to the North and an impulsive ally in the United States. The historic encounter at the Peace House, a conference building on the South Korean side of the border village of Panmunjom, could set the tone for an even more critical meeting planned between Mr. Kim and President Trump. [What does Kim Jong-un want from his meeting with President Trump? Read our analysis here.] On Friday morning, Mr. Kim emerged from a North Korean administrative building inside Panmunjom and walked toward the border line, where Mr. Moon was waiting. The two leaders smiled and shook hands across a concrete slab that marks the border bisecting Panmunjom. Then, Mr. Kim stepped across the border. After the two leaders posed for photos, they crossed briefly into the North’s territory at Mr. Kim’s suggestion, another highly symbolic moment. They then stepped back into South Korean territory, holding hands, and walked down a red carpet to inspect a South Korean military honor guard and enter the Peace House. "
"LONDON — Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, escaped tough questioning during congressional testimony this month in part because American lawmakers weren’t well versed about how the social network functions. On Thursday, one of his deputies faced a decidedly sharper inquisition from a panel in Britain. The dueling experiences highlight the different approaches taken on both sides of the Atlantic toward oversight of personal data and the social media giants who hold it. While the United States has largely eschewed regulating companies like Facebook, Britain and other countries in Europe have taken more aggressive stances, seeking to make tighter rules to better protect consumer privacy. In London, Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, faced more than four hours of questions from a British parliamentary committee over the company’s data-collection techniques, oversight of app developers, fake accounts, political advertising and links to the voter-targeting firm Cambridge Analytica. If American politicians have been lampooned for being Luddites, the British Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has built a reputation for thoroughness and detailed questioning. Damian Collins, the committee’s chairman, had more than 11 pages of questions for Mr. Schroepfer, including how facial recognition technology is used and the methods Facebook uses to track people even when they are not on the site. “This is the pipe through which the fake news comes, and there doesn’t seem to be much you can do to control it,” Mr. Collins said. The committee, which has been questioning the use of social media to spread misinformation and influence elections, had invited Mr. Zuckerberg, but he declined. The British committee’s 14-month investigation is part of an aggressive campaign by European authorities to clamp down on powerful American tech giants. The probe comes as German antitrust regulators investigate Facebook, others investigate Google, and the European Union prepares to put in place a sweeping new privacy law that sets more restrictions on how companies gather and share data.

"The escalating trade war between the United States and China, with the Trump administration considering $100 billion in punitive tariffs in response to China’s $50 billion in retaliatory tariffs, obscures a more important source of conflict: China’s desire to someday establish the yuan as a global reserve currency, on a par with the dollar. The dollar’s status is inextricably linked to international trade. Because the dollar reigns supreme in the trading system, other countries need to accumulate dollars. Most international trade is conducted using the dollar, even if the United States is not a party to the transaction. The United States wasn’t always so dominant. After the 1971 decision to end the link between the value of the dollar and gold reserves, the dollar became a currency much like any other. But in 1974, the United States and Saudi Arabia struck an agreement in which the Saudis and the other Gulf states supported the dollar as the primary medium of exchange for oil exports. Thus, oil and other commodities are priced in dollars, so any country that buys oil must build up its dollar reserves to pay for it — mostly by exporting its goods and services so that it can receive dollars as payment. Once established as a global reserve currency, the dollar has been kept strong by sustained demand for it, and a strong dollar makes American exports expensive to the rest of the world. American exports decline, imports increase, and a result is the trade deficit. Testifying before Congress in 1960, the economist Robert Triffin observed that the dollar’s global reserve status depends on the willingness of the United States to run trade deficits. This relationship, known as Triffin’s Dilemma, doesn’t always hold true (other countries have had reserve currencies and a trade surplus), but the American trade deficit with China, $375.2 billion last year, offers perhaps the best example of how a strong currency and trade deficits are connected. Still, there are enormous benefits to being able to print paper money and have the world treat it as if it were gold. Other countries need American dollars, and they are willing to pay a premium to hold them. Valery Giscard d’Estaing, finance minister of France from 1962 to 1966, called this an “exorbitant privilege.” Once they have amassed those all-important dollars, countries use them to buy United States Treasury bonds. (China alone held $1.2 trillion dollars of United States government debt at the end of 2017.) This enormous global demand for American debt means that the United States can borrow at relatively low interest rates, financing its budget deficits away. "

"TIJUANA, Mexico — The uncomfortable and dangerous rides atop freight trains are now in the past. So are the cold nights sleeping in parks, the hot days walking in the unforgiving sun and the unpredictability of the next meal or bath. Yet for hundreds of migrants who arrived in this border city this week after a month traveling en masse across Mexico, perhaps the hardest part is to come. The hope of sanctuary in the United States had sustained them throughout the trip, and, for many, one person now stood in the way: the president of the United States. “He doesn’t want anyone to enter,” said José Ignacio Villatoro, 20, who said he fled gang violence in Guatemala with his parents and three siblings. Mr. Villatoro was standing within sight of the border fence this week, weighing what he had been through and the effort that is still required. “I’m thinking about how to enter because it’s not at all easy,” he said, looking at his shoes. “I really don’t know what’s going to happen.” This has now become the defining challenge of the migrant caravan. The group is planning to walk en masse on Sunday to the border crossing leading to southern San Diego, with those planning to petition for asylum presenting themselves to American border officials and making their case for sanctuary.

The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, throws a harsh spotlight on North Korea’s human-rights abuses weeks before President Trump is scheduled to meet with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un. It also comes as the Trump administration is trying to win the release of three other Americans currently held there. Fred and Cindy Warmbier, Otto Warmbier’s parents, contend that North Korea used their son as a pawn in a confrontation with the United States over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. They are claiming damages to be decided by the court. “North Korea has repeatedly lied about the causes of Otto’s condition and refuses to acknowledge its abhorrent actions,” the 22-page complaint said. “In fact, North Korea, which is a rogue regime, took Otto hostage for its own wrongful ends and brutally tortured and murdered him.” Under American law, private citizens are not eligible to sue foreign countries. But Mr. Trump placed North Korea on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism in November — restoring it to a list it had been on from 1988 to 2008. That opened it to lawsuits from victims of terrorism. If the Warmbiers are awarded compensatory damages, they can draw from the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, established by Congress to pay out claims, with a cap of $20 million per person, or $35 million for a group of plaintiffs.

"WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. first gave the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, a file containing spousal abuse allegations against Rob Porter in March 2017, according to a detailed new timeline the bureau has given to Congress that casts further doubt on the West Wing’s account of how accusations against one of President Trump’s closest advisers were handled. Mr. Porter, Mr. Trump’s staff secretary, resigned under pressure in February after allegations that he had been physically violent toward two former wives were aired in the press. The White House — which initially sprang to his defense — has issued several competing accounts of how Mr. Trump’s team handled the allegations, which they insisted no senior officials knew about until just before Mr. Porter left his job. But in a letter this month to the leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is investigating how Mr. Porter could have received a security clearance given the allegations, a top official at the F.B.I. said that on March 3, 2017, the bureau sent a “partial report” on Mr. Porter “addressed to the Counsel to the President, Donald F. McGahn, which contained derogatory information.” A former federal law enforcement official said the violent abuse allegations were included in that file. The F.B.I. furnished a more complete report to the White House personnel security office in July, according to the letter, which did not detail the nature of the derogatory information. Mr. McGahn could not be reached for comment on the report. But a White House official said that he never saw it, and that aides believe it was reviewed by an underling and passed on to the White House personnel security office, which reviews F.B.I. background investigations as part of its process for evaluating whether officials should receive security clearances. Mr. McGahn, the official said, was busy at the time juggling the Supreme Court confirmation process for Neil M. Gorsuch, the selection of appeals court judges and the vetting of numerous cabinet nominees. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump distanced himself from his longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, on Thursday, saying that a federal criminal investigation was focused on Mr. Cohen’s business dealings and had nothing to do with his legal representation of the president. The president acknowledged that Mr. Cohen represents him in connection with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels who has asserted that she had extramarital sexual relations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election as part of what she now calls a “hush agreement.” But Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen did nothing wrong in that matter. Mr. Cohen handled just “a tiny, tiny little fraction” of his legal work, Mr. Trump said. “But Michael would represent me and represent me on some things,” the president said in a telephone call to “Fox & Friends,” his favorite cable television show. “He represents me, like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me.” “From what I see,” he continued, “he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going into this, which would have been a problem.” “From what I understand, they’re looking at his businesses,” he added. Discussing Mr. Cohen’s decision to decline to testify in a lawsuit by Ms. Clifford, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Mr. Trump said he was probably just following the advice of his own lawyers. “I’m not involved, and I’ve been told I’m not involved.” The president’s mention of Ms. Clifford was striking because he has mainly shown restraint in not discussing her. "
"Barbara S. Jones, a former federal judge, was selected on Thursday to oversee the process of screening materials seized in a recent F.B.I. raid from President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. It has been two weeks since federal agents descended on Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and hotel room and hauled away at least eight boxes of documents and more than a dozen cellphones, iPads and computer hard drives. But because the government and lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump have been sparring about whether the seized materials are privileged, the prosecutors working on the case have not yet been able to look at them. The selection of Ms. Jones, by a federal judge in Manhattan, to determine whether any of the materials are protected by attorney-client privilege appeared to resolve, at least for now, the dispute over who should be permitted to review the materials and how the process should proceed. Bringing on Ms. Jones to serve as what is known as a special master could speed up the review, but it also introduced another layer of scrutiny — and thus a note of caution — to the process. The judge who selected her, Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court, said that she had asked Ms. Jones how much time she could devote to the special master’s role. “She has committed 90 percent of her time to it and perhaps more if needed,” Judge Wood said. She added, “If at any point it turns out that the special master review process is going too slowly, I’ll revisit the question of the scope of the special master’s role.” "
"Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany arrives at the White House on Friday in the broad wake of a visit this week by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But don’t expect a sequel to the buddy movie. Already, the contrasts could not be starker. Mr. Macron was treated by President Trump to a 21-gun salute, a state dinner, a night of opera and a private visit to the home of George Washington. The public displays of affection between the two men were so gushy that they became the butt of jokes — even by Mr. Macron when, by the way, he addressed a joint session of Congress. On the schedule for Ms. Merkel? A working lunch. The last time Ms. Merkel met Mr. Trump at the White House, in March 2017, the two did not even manage to shake hands before assembled photographers. Few expect their rapport to be much different this time. But the lack of chemistry between Ms. Merkel, a scientist who grew up in communist East Germany, and Mr. Trump, a billionaire with a weakness for beauty pageants, is not new. What is new is the apparent indifference in the White House to the German chancellor, as well as the weakening of Ms. Merkel’s once towering position. Even last year, Ms. Merkel was seen as the leader of Europe, the defender of the liberal world order and the counterbalance to Mr. Trump. “We Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands,” she declared in a beer tent last May, making clear her disappointment with the new American president. But after 12 years in office and a difficult election last year, and with a successor waiting in the wings, Ms. Merkel now appears to be receding in influence. It is a vacuum into which the young Mr. Macron has eagerly stepped. "

In the first two episodes of Season 2, which arrived on Hulu on Wednesday, the series moves beyond the scope of the Margaret Atwood novel on which it’s based, following Elisabeth Moss’s Offred after authorities haul her away from the home of Commander Waterford (Joseph Fiennes). A harrowing visit to Fenway Park, a desperate act of self-mutilation and a first glimpse of the notorious Colonies are just some of the horrors that open the new season. ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’

Add it to your Watchlist Is all that misery worth enduring? Most critics agree that it is. “After a first season that started strong, then wobbled as it found its own material,” writes the New York Times TV critic James Poniewozik, the series has “become a confident, emotionally rich series — but one that, by nature and obligation, is wrenching to watch.” While we can’t make the show’s patriarchal dystopia any easier to stomach, we have put together a list of essential essays, interviews and recaps to help guide you through it. (Brackets in quotations come from their source publications.) ‘“The Handmaid’s Tale” and the Suffering of Women’ [The Atlantic] “There’s a unique kind of tension when a show whose message is so explicitly feminist (even if no one involved wants to actually use that word) depicts so much violence and brutality against women,” Sophie Gilbert observes. “For one thing, the series is doing it to prove a point: This is what happens, it says, when women are deprived of reproductive freedom, autonomy, votes, choices.” But Gilbert wonders whether all that horrific imagery is necessary, pointing out that, “as the first season showed, it’s possible to do all of this without such explicit, repetitive violence.” "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) For three decades, nothing. And then, in the span of six days, a team of law enforcement officers in Sacramento located and arrested the man they say is behind one of America’s most brutal and mysterious crime sprees, the Golden State Killer. Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was living in Citrus Heights, a suburb of Sacramento and a short drive on the freeway from the neighborhoods that he is alleged to have terrorized in the 1970s and 1980s. He is a former police officer who the authorities now say raped more than 50 women and killed 12 people. He wore the badge at the time of many of the rapes. Prosecutors and police officers on Wednesday said DNA analysis was crucial in linking Mr. DeAngelo with murders in Southern California. They managed to obtain his DNA and make the match. But how did they locate Mr. DeAngelo in the first place? And how are they so confident that Mr. DeAngelo was behind the rash of rapes in the Sacramento area, crimes for which there was no DNA evidence? Details will be forthcoming, officials promised at a news conference on Wednesday. Read our article here. For more: • The Sacramento Bee has listed the killer’s crimes, talked to Mr. DeAngelo’s neighbors, and profiled the distribution center where he worked for decades. • The Los Angeles Times dug into its archives to create a primer on the Golden State Killer. • The Mercury News spoke with the man’s youngest victim, who was only 13 when he raped her. Other victims expressed relief to The Associated Press. • And you may recall this newsletter linking to a story about “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark,” a chilling true crime book about the Golden State Killer. The writer Michelle McNamara spent the final years of her life chasing him. (And she wrote about it in this Los Angeles Magazine story in 2013.) She died in April 2016, before she could see the killer brought to justice, or her book published. Now her husband, the comedian Patton Oswalt, has a lot of questions for Mr. DeAngelo. "
"FAITH
A Journey for All
By Jimmy Carter
179 pp. Simon & Schuster. $25.99. When Billy Graham died recently, we were treated to a roll call of presidents whom Graham had visited in the White House to impart the kind of cheap-grace blessing only he could dispense. One name was missing from this list: Jimmy Carter. How could that be? Here was our putatively most religious president and the nation’s premier relayer of endorsements from God. But Graham was not invited precisely because Carter was our most religious president — a proud Baptist who followed in the tradition of Roger Williams, the man who created the first Baptist church in America and believed in the strict separation of church and state. Many have expressed surprise that evangelicals voted last year in overwhelming numbers for our arguably least religious president. There is no reason for surprise. The religious right has long been not a religion but an ideology. This was proved during Carter’s presidency. Some think Carter brought religion into politics. That was so only in the sense that Obama brought racism into the White House — that is, he did it only by way of a backlash from racists so stunned by the presence of a black man there that they loved and still love Trump for saying Obama’s presidency was illegitimate. The backlash under Carter was similar, orchestrated by Jerry Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority in 1979 to get Carter out of the White House — two-thirds of Falwell’s supporters voted for Reagan in 1980. When Carter was visited by a high official of the Southern Baptist Convention, the man told him, “We are praying, Mr. President, that you will abandon secular humanism as your religion.” Two errors lurked in that sentence and its presumption — that secular humanism is a religion, and that the Southern Baptists’ religion is a religion. Carter had shocked them by upholding the cancellation of Bob Jones University’s tax exemption (more influence of Roger Williams), supporting the Equal Rights Amendment, calling for a Palestinian homeland and holding a White House Conference on the Families where abortion, contraception, gay rights, divorce and other important social issues were openly discussed. In the ideology that the right thinks is a religion, the sin of sins is abortion, though that is not a subject mentioned in the Torah, or the Gospel, or the early church creeds and councils. Even the Catholic Church sees this not as a theological issue but as a matter of natural law, more a subject for philosophers, psychiatrists and scientists than for preachers as such. But science is evil in the rightists’ ideology: Scientists invent nonexistent things like evolution and global warming. The ideology also holds that guns are the very essence of government. Regulate guns in any way and we lose justice, liberty and comity, crushed by an instant tyranny. The ideology also insists that women should be subordinate to men, blacks to whites, and experts to “the common man.” Carter was too religious to accept such pseudo-religion. He taught Bible classes all his adult life, with an emphasis on what is in Scripture rather than what is not — mainly, a regard for the poor, the rejected, the victims of prejudice and injustice. Unlike Barack Obama, who continued and expanded our war in Afghanistan, Carter was a peace president who earned his Nobel Peace Prize, and keeps on earning it with worldwide efforts against war, poverty and disease.

"To the Editor: Re “What Trump Is Learning From Singapore — and Vice Versa (Opinion, March 29): Kirsten Han’s article paints Singapore as an authoritarian paradise, where critics of the government are squelched and drug traffickers are hanged. However, more than 60 international media organizations are accredited in Singapore, and we debate issues vigorously, online and off. The New York Times, including Ms. Han’s article, is available in print and online, as are all other online sites, except a few pornographic, jihadist and gambling ones. Singapore, like many other countries, is trying to deal with the spread of falsehoods online, which can undermine democracy and social cohesion. As a multiethnic, multireligious society, we cannot give bigotry free rein. We do impose the death penalty on criminals — not drug abusers — who traffic specific drugs above a prescribed amount. Singapore is a major port and financial center, in a region where heroin is produced and drug abuse a major problem. Without strict laws and enforcement, we would long have become a magnet for international drug traffickers. The World Economic Forum describes Singapore’s public institutions as transparent and efficient. The United States government’s own “World Factbook” characterizes Singapore as remarkably open and corruption free. I cannot recognize the country Ms. Han describes.

"NEW DELHI — When the leaders of the world’s two most populous nations meet on Friday in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India will be pushing to get less from President Xi Jinping of China. Less trouble like the embarrassing territorial showdown that put the two countries on alert last year. Less worry of the kind India is feeling right now about rising Chinese influence on its doorstep, in Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives. Analysts say Mr. Modi is fixated on winning next year’s election in India. And it is a measure of the fraught relationship between China and India right now that he is seen as needing Mr. Xi’s help to do that. Officials from both countries are describing the leaders’ meeting, which came at India’s request, as a chance to “reset” relations. But it is clear that Mr. Modi will be seeking assurances from Mr. Xi. “Everything for Modi right now is about 2019,” said Manoj Joshi, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a policy and research organization in New Delhi. “He needs stability. He doesn’t want anything to make him look like he’s not the 56-inch-chest guy.” In the past, Mr. Modi has bragged about having a 56-inch chest measurement, apparently a symbol of strength. But that swagger was bruised last year after Chinese troops swept into a disputed area along the Bhutan-China border near to where Indian troops were based and started building a road. When India objected, China threatened to “teach India a lesson.” "
"For years, the world economy has been trapped in a low-inflation, low-interest-rate rut. Yet the latest shifts in global markets suggest that this could, at long last, be ending. The evidence isn’t definitive. This could be a false dawn, of a type that has happened a couple of times in recent years. But let’s put it this way: If the world economy was coming out of its low-inflation funk, this is probably what it would look like. In recent days, the rate the United States government must pay to borrow money for two years has reached its highest level since 2008, and on Tuesday the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds rose above 3 percent  for the first time in four years. As recently as September, that rate was near 2 percent. You see a similar pattern in the bond prices of other advanced nations. For example, German 10-year yields rose to 0.64 percent Wednesday from 0.31 percent in September. If this really is the start of a resetting of inflation and interest rates toward more historically normal levels, it will be mostly good news for the world economy. Central bankers have spent years trying unsuccessfully to get inflation to the 2 percent level many of them aim for. "
"WASHINGTON — Ann Jacks quit her job as a restaurant chef in North Carolina, started her own business and worked 80 hours a week for two years, before exhausting herself and her patience. She shut down the company and, in November, returned to her old job. It paid a dollar an hour more than it did when she left it. Ms. Jacks, who now earns $22,000 a year and said she couldn’t afford her health insurance deductible, is one of many Americans still waiting to feel the effects of an improving economy nearly a decade after the Great Recession. “I don’t see evidence of the wages getting higher, except for specific types of jobs, like management, banking,” she said. “My attorney friends aren’t hurting.” Yet Federal Reserve officials are beginning to worry about a possibility that seems remote to workers who still feel left behind: the danger of the economy’s running too hot, destabilizing financial markets and setting off a rapid escalation in wages and prices that could force the central bank to slam the brakes on growth. Officials at the Fed have in the last few weeks escalated a public and private debate over how close the economy is to “overheating,” a condition when abnormally low unemployment can trigger spikes in inflation and destabilize financial markets. The Commerce Department will report its first estimate of first-quarter growth on Friday, and economists expect it will register around 2 percent, short of the 3 percent that President Trump has promised will deliver large wage increases to workers across the board.

"WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified on Capitol Hill on Thursday in what turned out to be a daylong grilling over allegations of ethical infractions and lavish spending. The E.P.A. chief, whose job may be hanging by a thread, delivered a typically lawyerly performance. As Democrats opened an aggressive, coordinated line of questioning — on Mr. Pruitt’s spending, housing arrangements, security team and raises for political appointees — he stayed quiet and calm, never raising his voice or his temper, but rarely giving direct answers to those questions. Here are the highlights from the two sessions: Representative Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, got the morning questioning off to a start by asking Mr. Pruitt to answer “yes or no” to whether he had approved pay raises for two E.P.A. employees he brought with him from Oklahoma. Mr. Pruitt said he had delegated the authority to grant such approvals, or as he put it, “There was delegation given in my authority.” He said, “I was not aware of the amount, and I was not aware of the bypassing that was going on.” Mr. Tonko said the answer suggested “you have no idea what is going on” under Mr. Pruitt’s name at the agency. Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, was even more direct in his opening remarks Thursday morning. “You are unfit to hold public office and undeserving of the public trust,” he told Mr. Pruitt. “Every indication we have is you really should resign.” "
"WASHINGTON — When it comes to presidential nominations, the clock is working against the Trump administration and Senate Republicans in more ways than one. Frustrated over Democrats slow-walking many executive and judicial branch nominees and chewing up Senate floor time in the bargain, Republicans moved on Wednesday toward shortening stringent time requirements that can turn even a routine confirmation into a C-Span-numbing, multiday slog. In the latest escalation of a hyperpartisan struggle over nominations, Republicans would dearly like to abbreviate the confirmation timetable and deprive Democrats of one of their last remaining weapons to register opposition to Trump nominees they consider objectionable. There is another beat-the-clock aspect at work, as well. With both parties now seeing at least a possibility that Democrats could recapture the Senate in the midterm elections in November, Senate Republicans know that time could be running short on their ability to force through Trump nominees. They would like to take full advantage while they are certain to maintain control. If Democrats were to rule the Senate next year, they would no doubt be very deliberate — to say the least — about bringing to the floor Trump administration candidates for the bench and top federal agency jobs. At the same time, they would face tremendous pressure from liberal advocacy groups and constituents to stall Trump picks as payback for Republican stonewalling in 2016 of the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland by President Barack Obama as well as their deep discontent with the quality and ideology of many nominees from this White House so far. “If Democrats take the Senate, they need to apply extreme vetting to President Trump’s nominees,” said Caroline Fredrickson, the president of the liberal American Constitution Society. “If that means none get confirmed, none get confirmed.” "

"George H.W. Bush once vomited on the prime minister of Japan. It was a mortifying but innocent incident, the result of a nasty stomach bug. Donald Trump has spent the last couple of days effectively doing likewise on France’s Emmanuel Macron. What’s Trump’s excuse? The contrast between the 41st and 45th presidents comes to mind this week as millions of Americans mourn the passing of Barbara Bush and pray for the health of her bereaved husband. It’s a study in American decline. Bush did his duty in World War II as the Navy’s youngest pilot and was shot down over the Pacific. Donald Trump shirked his duty in Vietnam, and we already know he doesn’t like guys who were shot down. Bush zipped through Yale in two and a half years and was elected Phi Beta Kappa. Trump is “like, really smart.” Bush married his teenage sweetheart at 20 and stayed married to her for 73 years. Trump stayed married to his first wife for 13 years, his second for five, and his current one (if you can call it a marriage) for 13, with all the assorted lecheries and abuses during and in between. Bush voted for the Fair Housing Act of 1968 as a Republican congressman. Trump and his father were charged with violating it in 1973. "

"Ernesto Deras cannot explain why he got up from his seat, approached the front of a church in the Panorama City neighborhood of Los Angeles, and started crying uncontrollably. “Perdón, perdón, perdón,” the man known to his fellow gang members as Satan, repeated as he fell to his knees. “I had been shot. I had had broken bones. I was in jail,” he told me this year, some two decades after he embraced God. But none of that had made him cry. “I felt like a man who didn’t have tears, but that day, something, something powerful happened.” Other former gang members tell similar stories. The church — in particular the evangelical Pentecostal church — drew them into its fold and wrenched them, prayer service by prayer service, from the tenacious grip of the gangs. The gangs, in turn, respected this exit. Becoming an active member of a religious community remains virtually the only way someone can leave the notorious gang Mara Salvatrucha, better known as MS-13, alive. There is little reliable data on how many members have left MS-13 by joining a church, but in a recent Florida International University survey of nearly 1,200 gang members in El Salvador’s jails, 58 percent said the church was the “most appropriate organization to lead rehabilitation programs.” The stories of these gang members’ experiences with religion give us clues about how to reduce the influence of MS-13 in the United States and other countries where it operates. The gang carries out horrific crimes, but after spending three years studying MS-13, my colleagues and I concluded that the best way to diminish the gang’s appeal to vulnerable young men is to think of it as more of a social organization than a criminal enterprise.

"In the civil war now being waged in this country, the combatants are not the blue and the gray of old. It’s the White House versus the blue states. And the weapons aren’t cannon balls but rather the threatened withholding of federal money from “sanctuary” cities and states, the plan for the next census that would have the effect of shrinking liberal states’ representation in Congress, and the cap on tax deductions that will strike at residents of cities and states where high tax rates support decent public services. While California is most prominently in the administration’s cross hairs — “California better hold on tight,” Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said on Fox News in January — the free state of California is not the only target. Chilling headlines like a recent one in a local newspaper in New Haven — “ICE Lies in Wait at Elm Street Courthouse” — are appearing all over the country as federal agents stalk and capture undocumented immigrants and leave the rest of us to shudder at tactics we used to ascribe to countries we regarded with disdain. Those old enough to remember the Rehnquist federalism revolution of the 1990s and early 2000s will recall how startling it was when Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist’s long-sought majority began to rein in the federal government’s authority over the states with an enthusiasm and to a degree not seen since the early years of the New Deal. The federal government can’t “commandeer” the states to carry out its enforcement objectives, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote for the majority in a 1992 case, New York v. United States, invalidating a federal plan to oblige the states to help dispose of radioactive waste. “Congress must accord states the esteem due them as joint partners in a federal system,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote in a 1999 case, Alden v. Maine, immunizing the states from suits for violations of federal labor law. For those who remember the unsettling decade when decisions like these poured from the Supreme Court, the current reversal of polarity is head-snapping. The Trump administration is not only commandeering local courthouses as convenient places to trap its prey, it also seeks to punish cities and states that resist. "
"Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, President Trump’s personal physician and his pick to lead the Veterans Affairs Department, dropped out of the running Thursday morning, after being accused of inappropriately dispensing drugs, including the opioid Percocet, to others, and prescribing himself medication. In an interview with CNN, Senator Jon Tester of Montana said Dr. Jackson was known as the “candy man” inside the White House. Mr. Tester said a number of sources had told the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee that, on overseas trips, Dr. Jackson would “go down the aisle way of the airplane and say, ‘All right, who wants to go to sleep?’ And hand out the prescription drugs like they were candy.” Then, the senator continued, Dr. Jackson would “put them to sleep and then give them the drugs to wake them back up again.” If true, Dr. Jackson was apparently casually dispensing Ambien for sleep and Provigil for arousal, both of which are powerful controlled substances with a potential for addiction. For any physician, let alone one who treats the president of the United States (and Dr. Jackson has now treated two: Mr. Trump and Barack Obama), such behavior is unethical and dangerous. First of all, with the exception of the president, it’s a safe bet that the people receiving these medications were not Dr. Jackson’s patients. That would mean he was prescribing controlled drugs to people whose medical histories he knew nothing about. What if, for example, some of them had a substance abuse or alcohol problem or serious pulmonary diseases? For people with those conditions, Ambien, a potent hypnotic drug, can be quite harmful. And Provigil, a long-acting stimulant-like drug, can raise blood pressure and provoke anxiety and worse in people who are medically or psychiatrically vulnerable. Just as worrisome, Dr. Jackson would have had no idea whether any of the people he allegedly casually drugged were taking other medications that might interact adversely with what he was handing out. Can the president’s physician really be clueless of the fact that interactions between drugs are among the most common causes of iatrogenic (that is, accidentally doctor-induced) morbidity and mortality?

"Updated, 9:48 a.m. Good morning on this gorgeous Thursday. There’s a lot going on — in New York, in the news, in life in general. There’s also a lot going on in our courts. So let us catch you up. As an addendum to today’s espresso, here’s what you need to know about the most notable cases on the docket in New York. The inquiry into Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer and confidant who is being investigated by federal prosecutors, in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The latest: Earlier this month, the F.B.I. raided Mr. Cohen’s office in Rockefeller Center and his hotel room on Park Avenue. (Among the materials seized during the raid, which you can read about here, were documents related to a payment to the pornographic film star known as Stormy Daniels, who said she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump and has filed a lawsuit against him.) Since the raid, there has been debate from both sides over which of those records can be used in the government inquiry and what information is protected by attorney-client privilege. Yesterday, Mr. Cohen said that, if called as a witness in the Stormy Daniels case, a suit filed in California, he would assert his Fifth Amendment right, citing the investigation in New York. You can read more here about the implications of invoking the Fifth Amendment and how it might help Mr. Cohen to avoid being deposed. What’s next: Today, Judge Kimba M. Wood, whose career was profiled by The Times last week, is expected to hold a hearing about who might conduct the independent review of the documents from the April 9 raid and how to proceed. "
"HONG KONG — In 2000, Kim Dae-jung, then South Korea’s president, flew to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-il, the leader of North Korea — the first time talks had ever been held between leaders of the two sides. The distance between the two airports was just 100 miles. But the flight took more than an hour, because the plane swung out over the sea west of the Korean Peninsula, to avoid crossing the heavily militarized land border. On Friday, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Kim’s son and North Korea’s current leader, is expected to walk across that border, where he will be greeted by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea before they sit down for talks on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone. Friday’s talks, the third summit meeting between the Koreas, could produce a statement about pursuing a peace agreement to end the Korean War of 1950-53, which was paused by an armistice but never formally brought to a close. But the meeting will probably be overshadowed by talks yet to come, said Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul. “This summit will not make any important decisions,” he said. “The South Korean government is between a rock and a hard place. It’s not in a position to discuss most of the issues which really matter. It’s kind of a preliminary event to pave the road for a future meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.” "
"Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself. • Facebook can afford to clean up its act. • Is the problem with I.P.O.s a ‘middle-market tax’? • On today’s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard. Some links require subscriptions. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. One of the mysteries of modern banking is why Deutsche Bank’s retreat from Wall Street, announced Thursday, took so long. Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution’s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank’s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank’s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won’t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it’s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow: Hubris. Large banks that did rebound after the crisis were able to point to actions that allowed them to get ahead of challenges they faced. Perhaps the largest challenge was raising large amounts of capital to placate creditors and regulators. But compare Deutsche Bank’s capital raising to that of JPMorgan Chase. In 2011, Deutsche Bank’s tangible equity capital (common equity minus goodwill) was equivalent to 3.3 percent of its assets (counted in the same fashion as in the United States), whereas JPMorgan’s was at 5.7 percent. Notably, Deutsche Bank, by the end of 2017, still had not raised that ratio to JPMorgan’s 2011 level. JPMorgan’s ratio was 7.2 percent at the end of last year. When United States regulators proposed that large foreign banks maintain higher capital at their U.S. subsidiaries, Deutsche, which has a big presence in the United States, resisted and moved to avoid the requirements. But the United States regulators mostly held firm, which may be one reason Deutsche is finally retrenching. If Deutsche Bank’s German regulator had been tougher, the bank may have done more, earlier, to shore up its balance sheet. After all, it was stiff pressure from the Swiss central bank that helped prompt the overhauls at UBS and Credit Suisse. Fear. Deutsche Bank’s leaders may have worried that scaling back its investment bank would cause too much financial pain. Those operations last year provided 54 percent of the bank’s overall revenue, so paring back the investment bank could have a big impact on the top line. And Deutsche Bank’s investment bank hardly has the earnings to absorb the costs of a deep restructuring. In the first quarter of this year, a good period for Wall Street as a whole, Deutsche’s investment bank posted a paltry return on equity of 1.4 percent. The potential cost of a far-reaching restructuring is also hard to assess. Deutsche Bank may be entangled in uneconomic trades that would cost large sums to exit. Fears of toxic exposures were stoked earlier this month, when it was reported that the European Central Bank had asked Deutsche Bank to estimate the costs of winding down its trading operations. "
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — An American military attaché has been barred from leaving Pakistan after his sport utility vehicle struck a motorcycle and killed one of its riders this month, in another flare-up of diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Pakistani officials have demanded that the United States waive diplomatic immunity for the attaché, Col. Joseph E. Hall, so that he can face criminal trial, but American officials have refused, according to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry. Pakistani officials said that Colonel Hall faces a civil suit from the family of the rider, Ateeq Baig, and that on Tuesday he was barred from leaving the country. Video of Colonel Hall’s truck running a red light on April 7 as it struck the motorcycle, killing Mr. Baig and seriously injuring the other rider, has gone viral in Pakistan. The outrage it is causing has resonated in a way similar to the case of the C.I.A. security officer Raymond A. Davis, who in 2011 shot and killed two armed men in Lahore, causing serious and lasting fallout with Washington. In Islamabad, Colonel Hall was briefly detained by the police after the crash, but was released because of his immunity, Pakistani police officials said. The American ambassador, David Hale, was called to the Foreign Ministry over the matter and later expressed sadness over it. An embassy spokesman, Richard Snelsire, said, “At this stage we are fully cooperating with the local police and authorities who are investigating the case.” A senior State Department official, Alice Wells, came to Islamabad on Monday to discuss the case with senior Pakistani officials, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, who would not further detail the conversations. On Wednesday, Mr. Baig’s family demonstrated in Islamabad to demand justice. “We are ready for agreement but on the condition of his arrest,” Idris Baig, the dead man’s father, said in an interview with The New York Times. “We haven’t even seen the killer once — no one from the Pakistan government or U.S. Embassy official came or offered us an agreement.” Mr. Baig was referring to the practice of paying “blood money” to families after wrongful deaths. A similar, though secret, agreement worth roughly $2.3 million led to the eventual release of Mr. Davis. The issue comes after months of worsening tensions between the United States and Pakistan. President Trump has accused the country of not doing enough to fight terrorism and end the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, and American officials pushed the effort to put Pakistan on an international terrorism-financing watch list in February. The month before, the United States announced that it was freezing up to $1.3 billion in annual security aid to Pakistan. "
"WASHINGTON — To senior White House aides serving the last three presidents, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson was the war-tested doctor who served in Iraq, helped them cope with their high-pressure jobs and ran his medical staff with the rigor befitting his rank of rear admiral in the Navy. But inside the White House medical unit, a military-run office with a few dozen doctors and nurses, Dr. Jackson was viewed as a bully and someone who kept sloppy medical records, drank too much and loosely dispensed strong drugs to curry favor with the powerful politicians and political aides he admired. Three current and former colleagues said that Dr. Jackson was sometimes intoxicated during overseas trips and that staff members were often ordered to leave a bottle of rum and a Diet Coke in his hotel room. On Thursday, Dr. Jackson withdrew from consideration to join President Trump’s cabinet as the secretary of Veterans Affairs after those and other allegations about his behavior cascaded into public view. Dr. Jackson, Mr. Trump and numerous White House officials dating to the Obama presidency insisted none of it was true. “These false allegations have become a distraction for this president,” Dr. Jackson said. Dr. Robert G. Darling, a former White House physician to President Bill Clinton and a retired Navy emergency medicine doctor, said, “This is a guy who served this country, who is in this job pretty reluctantly, and now he’s getting hung out to dry.” But in a White House where everybody appears to be in everyone else’s business, a picture has emerged of a medical unit oddly disconnected from the larger executive offices of the president, where a small team of military medical professionals reports up a narrow chain of command out of view from the political realm. Witnesses to Dr. Jackson’s behavior spoke on the condition of anonymity because they continue to serve in the military. Dr. Jackson’s medical unit operates inside the White House, not far from the West Wing, where the president and his aides work. But an isolated managerial bubble allowed Dr. Jackson to serve three presidents for a decade while escaping scrutiny of alleged abuses of power and position. Dr. Jackson’s employees were not subordinates of the White House chief of staff or the president’s lawyer. Instead, the medical unit reported through a military chain of command to the little-known White House Military Office. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Mick Mulvaney, the Trump administration’s budget director, made news this week by committing what’s known as a Kinsley gaffe: Mulvaney told the truth. Describing the behavior of himself and his staff during his years in Congress, Mulvaney said: “If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you. If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.” Lovely, eh? “It is hard to decide what is the worse thing here,” The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin writes, “Mulvaney’s pay-to-play operation, his shamelessness in bragging about it or Republicans’ utter indifference to it.” The attention to that comment drowned out nearly everything else that Mulvaney said at a conference of bank executives on Tuesday. But the rest of his remarks deserve some scrutiny, too. Mulvaney isn’t just the budget director. He is also the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the banking watchdog that the Obama administration and Elizabeth Warren created after the financial crisis. The bureau, often called the C.F.P.B., has had an impressive record since its founding, curtailing abusive lending practices by banks, among other things. It’s helped level the playing field — not all the way, to be sure — between big, powerful companies and American families. But Mulvaney has set out to dismantle the C.F.P.B. He has, as The Times reports: “frozen all new investigations and slowed down existing inquiries by requiring employees to produce detailed justifications” and “scaled back efforts to go after payday lenders, auto lenders and other financial services companies accused of preying on the vulnerable.” "
"In the end, the wheelers and dealers faded away, trying to get what they could under cover of darkness. Their loss of stature was abrupt. Only those willing to soldier on as subordinates remained, ceding authority to their leader, President Trump. For four decades, from 1968 to 2008, what was loosely described as the Republican establishment — the party’s congressional leaders, campaign operatives, donors, lobbyists and special interests — reigned supreme. Every four years, the party’s presidential nominee secured the establishment’s stamp of approval. Endorsements from governors and senators — and a gigantic campaign chest fed by major Republican fund-raisers — were the main markers of that approval. In a party deeply committed to hierarchy, the establishment-favored candidate was always the next in line, often the vice president (George H.W. Bush in 1988) or the candidate who had come in second (or a very close third) in the previous contested nomination battle (Ronald Reagan 1980, Bob Dole 1996, John McCain 2008 and Mitt Romney 2012). Now, the Republican establishment, embodied in the Bush family, proud but powerless, is a relic of a past, brought to its knees by insurgent forces, not least of which is the ascendance of social media.

"President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Washington was certainly grand theater: the hugs and kisses with President Trump, the dandruff whisked off his lapel, the first lady’s broad white hat, and then the 40-year-old French wunderkind rising before Congress to deliver a stern lecture in elegantly accented English on why the American president is wrong about multilateralism, protectionism, nationalism, Iran and climate change. Mr. Macron no doubt planned the bait-and-switch for some time. Other world leaders have tried different approaches to dealing with Mr. Trump, from joining him in a game of golf, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan did, to openly rebuking him, as President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico did this month. None have really worked. Nor is there much likelihood that the young French president, not yet a year in office, will have changed Mr. Trump’s mind in any meaningful way, even after being proclaimed “perfect” by his host. At a meeting with a group of journalists on Wednesday evening, Mr. Macron said that contrary to common wisdom, he found Mr. Trump to be “very predictable,” which would suggest that he did not expect the American president to be swayed by his Gallic reason. He acknowledged that he expected Mr. Trump to opt out of the Iran nuclear deal, and his goal, Mr. Macron said, was to position himself as an “honest broker” for the aftermath. If he achieves even that, it won’t be a bad outcome from the meeting. Mr. Macron’s goal from the outset of his presidency has been to assert France as the leader on global issues like climate change, European unity and resistance to right-wing nationalism and authoritarianism, and toward that end he has sought to forge comradely relations even with leaders who hold opposing views, whether by hosting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the imperial splendor of Versailles or getting touchy-feely with Mr. Trump. His trip to Washington was intended not only to court Mr. Trump but also to establish his credentials before the American public. A few days before his appearance on Capitol Hill, he had made a similarly ringing call on Europeans to defend democracy in a major speech before the European Parliament. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The White House withdrew the nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson to lead the Veterans Affairs Department this morning, after a series of accusations against him. “Unfortunately, because of how Washington works, these false allegations have become a distraction for this president and the important issue we must be addressing — how we give the best care to our nation’s heroes,” Dr. Jackson said in a statement provided by the White House press office. • The accusations included a hostile work environment, the improper dispensing of prescription drugs to White House staff members and reporters during official travel, and intoxication while traveling with the president. • President Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda has faced numerous legal challenges, but two court developments this week indicate a path  forward. On Tuesday, a judge gave the president 90 days to provide a stronger legal justification for shutting down the program known as DACA, which protects young immigrants from deportation. And on Wednesday, the Supreme Court strongly signaled that the administration’s third attempt to ban travel from a list of predominantly Muslim countries would be approved. Our reporter annotated excerpts from the arguments. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Women were finally believed.” That was one reaction outside the Pennsylvania court after Bill Cosby was found guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman in 2004. The verdict marks the bottom of a fall as precipitous as any in show business history. The victim, Andrea Constand, above, was a Temple University employee Mr. Cosby had mentored. She took the stand as something of a proxy for more than 50 other women who have accused Mr. Cosby of abuse. None of the other accusations have resulted in prosecution. It took the jury two days to decide to convict Mr. Cosby, 80, of three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault. He could face up to 30 years in prison. A previous trial ended in a hung jury. And in between the two trials, the #MeToo movement took hold, which some have suggested may have played a part in the outcome. _____ "
