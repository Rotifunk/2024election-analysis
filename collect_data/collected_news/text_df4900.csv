"The Amtrak derailment near Tacoma, Wash., that killed three people last week may well have been partly the individual failure of an engineer who was going much too fast. It was also, however, yet another demonstration of this country’s collective, continuing failure to invest in infrastructure. Though their inquiries are not complete, investigators have determined that the train, which was going from Seattle to Portland, Ore., was traveling at 78 miles per hour as it approached a turn that has a 30-m.p.h. speed limit. The circumstances are eerily similar to a 2015 Amtrak crash near Philadelphia in which eight people were killed when a train derailed as it sped through a sharp curve. In both cases, the trains were operating without the benefit of a system known as positive train control, which can automatically slow down or stop a train when human operators fail to do so. This technology is not some hot new thing. The National Transportation Safety Board has been recommending it for nearly half a century. For various reasons — including bureaucratic inertia and penny-pinching — many railroads still don’t have functioning systems in place. In 2008, after a rail accident in California killed 25 people, Congress required all railroads to install positive train control by the end of 2015. But after many railroads complained that they were not close to completing the task, lawmakers in late 2015 gave them another three years to comply. They also allowed the Department of Transportation to grant extensions of an additional two years on a case-by-case basis if railroads achieved certain milestones. While some railroads like Metrolink in Southern California now use the technology, many railroads, including New Jersey Transit, have made far too little progress, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. The industry, which includes many private freight railroads, clearly deserves much of the blame for dragging its feet. But so do federal and state governments, which have not only failed to push the industry harder but have never appropriated enough money to allow public transit agencies to upgrade their systems or held railroad officials accountable for delays. Amtrak says most of its Northeast Corridor has a functioning positive train control system, but that is not true across its national network, which includes track and equipment that is owned and has to be updated by other companies and agencies.

"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Even before a defiant Roy S. Moore stood at a lectern this month and refused to concede the Alabama Senate race, one political reality was clear: An extraordinary turnout among black voters had helped push Doug Jones to a rare Democratic victory in this state. That turnout, in which registered black voters appeared to cast ballots at a higher rate than white ones, has become the most recent reference point in the complicated picture about race and elections laws. At issue, at a time when minorities are becoming an increasingly powerful slice of the electorate, is how much rules like Alabama’s voter ID law serve as a brake on that happening. The turnout by black voters in Alabama raises a question: Did it come about because voting restrictions were not as powerful as critics claim or because voters showed up in spite of them? Whether blacks and other minorities vote has become an evermore crucial element in the national political calculus. Minority voters, who lean overwhelmingly Democratic, were 29 percent of eligible voters in 2012 and 31 percent in 2016; by 2020, the figure is expected to rise to nearly 34 percent. LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and a founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, which backed voter-mobilization efforts in the Senate contest, said the impact of voter suppression in Alabama was real, but that the policies were sometimes a motivating factor.

"“You all just got a lot richer,” Trump reportedly told guests at Mar-a-Lago. But Republicans will nonetheless keep insisting that the corporate tax cut that is the main item in the tax bill is really for the benefit of workers. They will be aided in this claim by some recent corporate announcements of bonuses or wage hikes that they attribute to the tax cut. It’s nonsense, of course. Think of the motivation: lots of companies are raising wages at least a bit in the face of tight labor markets; pretending that it’s because of the tax cut is a cheap way to curry favor with an administration that has no hesitation about using regulatory and antitrust decisions to reward friends and punish enemies. It’s basically Carrier all over: make a Trump-friendly splash by declaring that he persuaded you to save jobs, then lay off lots of workers after the cameras have moved on. But there’s a larger point here: even if you believe economic analyses that suggest corporate tax cuts are good for wages, it shouldn’t happen right away. Any trickle-down should come about because the tax cuts lead to higher investment, which leads over time to a larger capital stock – and it’s the increase in the capital stock, which may take many years, that leads to the wage rise. I keep finding it helpful to use a diagram representing the economy corporate tax-cutters imagine we have: a one-sector economy with no monopoly power, open to inflows of foreign capital. (Adding the reality of monopoly rents, noncorporate capital, and nontraded goods all reduce the extent of trickle-down.) This stylized economy looks like Figure 1: The downward-sloping line is the marginal product of capital, which is equal (in this model) to the pre-tax rate of return r. The after-tax return is r(1-t), where t is the tax rate. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/opinion/trickle-down-not-now-and-not-for-a-while-at-best-wonkish.html?searchResultPosition=109
"WASHINGTON — After a halting start, the Republican-controlled 115th Congress — sometimes in collaboration with President Trump, often despite him — has enacted surprisingly far-reaching conservative achievements in its first year, among them a long-promised rewrite of the tax code, oil drilling in the Arctic and a series of lifetime appointments to the judiciary. For the new year, Republican leaders in the House have their sights on decades-old programs for the poor that they say are too easily exploited by those who do not need them. Mr. Trump is expected to move forward with a long-promised program to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure. And Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, is speaking gamely of bipartisanship, especially on legislation to protect young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, whose Obama-era protection from deportation will run out in March. On Jan. 20, the latest stopgap spending measure expires, giving lawmakers from both parties another chance to force resolutions on outstanding immigration and health care measures, along with efforts to raise caps on military and domestic spending. And an $81 billion package of relief for hurricane and wildfire victims that passed the House last week awaits Senate action. “I don’t think most of our Democratic colleagues want to do nothing, and there are areas, I think, where we can get bipartisan agreement,” Mr. McConnell told reporters on Friday. But all of those plans will play out in an election year that is shaping up as a referendum on Mr. Trump, whose historically low approval ratings could deflate any Republican overtures to Democrats not anxious to boost the president.

"WASHINGTON — Representative Pete Sessions, a veteran Republican, was re-elected to his affluent Dallas-area House seat in 2016 with 71 percent of the vote, the remaining 29 percent split between the Libertarian and Green Party candidates. Hillary Clinton won the district by three percentage points, but no Democratic candidate even showed up to ride her coattails. In 2018, there will be 10. Federal Election Commission filings show that if a wave crashes on the Republican House majority in November, as many have predicted, Democratic surfers will be on their boards to catch it. Nearly a year out from the election, Democratic candidates have filed in all but 20 House districts held by Republicans. By comparison, Democrats in 80 districts do not have a Republican opponent for their seat. The Democrats are not just filing to run in districts where Mrs. Clinton performed well. They are also running for conservative seats that were uncontested in 2016 and where Republicans remain heavy favorites, in states like Texas, Arkansas and Nebraska. Four Democrats — a farmer, a soccer coach, an immigration lawyer and a health care consultant — are on the primary ballot in Illinois’ 16th District, a C-shaped district outside Chicago running from Wisconsin to the Indiana border. The Republican incumbent, Representative Adam Kinzinger, ran unopposed in 2016, when President Trump won the district by 17 points. Mr. Kinzinger is not high on anyone’s endangered list.

"The Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president. The shift in the Medicare program’s penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry’s main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve. “It is critical that we have relief,” Mark Parkinson, the group’s president, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump in December 2016. Since 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes — four of every 10 — have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. Medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores. The new guidelines discourage regulators from levying fines in some situations, even when they have resulted in a resident’s death. The guidelines will also probably result in lower fines for many facilities. The change in policy aligns with Mr. Trump’s promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business.

"After a year of high- and low-level attacks on the press and the First Amendment, there’s plenty to appreciate in Steven Spielberg’s new movie, “The Post,” which some people around here believe should be called “The Times.” With a focus on the as-yet-untested Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, played by Meryl Streep, “The Post” tells the story of how portions of a classified government study about the Vietnam War made their way into her newspaper. The Post began to run stories based on the top-secret study — which provided evidence that the Nixon, Johnson and Kennedy administrations had lied to the public about the war effort and its chances for success — only after The New York Times published articles quoting from it in summer 1971. The Nixon administration challenged The Times aggressively, accusing it of violating the Espionage Act and winning a temporary court order that blocked the newspaper from publishing more of what became known as the Pentagon Papers. As it casts a journalism era of analog technology and smoky newsrooms in an idealistic light, the movie makes the point that leaking to the news media can be a principled act — a concept that is certainly in order at a time when President Trump and his anti-press supporters equate it with treason. Daniel Ellsberg, a former Marine and military analyst, brought the Pentagon Papers to The Times, and later to The Post, motivated by an all-American notion that the nation’s citizens had the right to know more about what was going on half a world away in a war financed by their tax dollars and fought by so many of their children.

"A box filled with manure and addressed to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, was left Saturday at his neighbor’s home in the upscale Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, the police told KNBC-TV. Helicopter footage from the station showed the manure spilling onto the ground after the authorities emptied the box, which was covered in Christmas wrapping paper. A Christmas card that referred to Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump was inside the package, which was labeled as coming from “the American people,” KABC-TV reported. The Los Angeles Police Department told the television station KTLA the package contained horse manure. The box raised suspicions and the bomb squad was called to investigate. A Police Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Mr. Mnuchin, who was home at the time, “was made aware of the situation” but was not in immediate danger, Rob Weise, a watch commander with the Police Department, told KNBC. A Secret Service spokesman told The Associated Press that the agency was aware of the episode but declined to comment further. Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager and Hollywood film financier, was confirmed in February as Treasury secretary and helped plan and pitch Mr. Trump’s tax plan. During his time in office, he has come under fire for flying at taxpayer expense on military aircraft for trips that cost more than $800,000.

"NASHVILLE — At least since Martin Luther nailed his theses to the church door in 1517, Christians have disagreed on what Jesus calls them to do in the name of faith. There are nearly 34,000 Christian denominations worldwide, a number that doesn’t account for American Christians — nearly one in six, according to a Gallup poll last summer — who belong to no denomination at all. But as lively as Christian debate can be, the special Senate election in Alabama has exposed how closely conservative Christianity is now in lock step with the Republican Party. I grew up in Alabama, and I don’t doubt the sincerity of my fellow believers on the other side of the political aisle, but when faithful Christians vote for a man credibly accused of child molesting, something is terribly wrong with Christianity. (With white Christianity, that is: Black Christians overwhelmingly supported the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones.) Eighty percent of white born-again Christians voting in Alabama backed Roy Moore, and there is no skirting the damage they’ve done to their own moral standing. The day of the election, the editor in chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli, identified the biggest loser in Alabama: Christian faith itself. From now on, Mr. Galli wrote, “When it comes to either matters of life and death or personal commitments of the human heart, no one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation.” Christianity presents a conundrum for evangelicals considering a monstrous political candidate who is also a Christian. The very foundation of our faith lies in the infinite mercy of a loving God, and it’s hard for an ordinary sinner to cast the first stone. Last year I asked an evangelical friend how she could bring herself to support a presidential candidate like Donald Trump, whose behavior is so at odds with her own. “He says he’s changed,” she said, “and I believe in God’s redemption. If I didn’t, how could I get out of bed in the morning?” I believe in redemption myself, though if I were in charge I think I’d be looking for evidence of repentance, too. And I’d be asking why people so deeply invested in redemption also tend to be so deeply invested in sending their fellow human beings to death row. But I’m trying to understand the country I’ve found myself in since last year’s election, and these days I look hard for common ground. It isn’t easy to find. In her new book “Moral Combat: How Sex Divided American Christians and Fractured American Politics,” R. Marie Griffith explains the divide between liberal and conservative Christians as a casualty of “the sex wars” — disagreements over women’s rights, birth control, abortion and L.G.B.T. issues. By the time the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, she writes, “the rupture between Christian antagonists in the sex wars felt irremediable: one could plausibly argue that Christianity had flat out split into two virtually nonoverlapping religions.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/24/opinion/christians-christmas-faith-politics.html?searchResultPosition=102
"Ten years ago, a family arrived in the Bronx from Yaoundé, Cameroon, not speaking a word of English. This Christmas, they are celebrating a feat that would be impressive for any family: Three of the family’s five daughters have been accepted to Ivy League universities. In a year in which our nativist president would have you believe that immigrants are, at best, a job-stealing drain and at worst, criminals, rapists and people with AIDS, these three remarkable sisters are worth paying attention to. Not just because they are inspiring — they are — but because they are far better ambassadors for this country and exponents of its ideals than the 45th president. “We brought the girls to this country because there are better opportunities here,” says Flore Kengmeni, their mother, who works as a nurse. “I don’t know of another country where you can try hard, work hard and get somewhere. Where you are given the opportunity to fulfill your potential.” “This country is built on immigrants,” Francois de Paul Silatchom, their father, a professor of economics at SUNY, starts to say, before his middle daughter, Ella, a sophomore at Yale, interjects: “Our experience as a family is what America is.” That experience is marked by hard work, optimism, resilience and a persistent sense of gratitude even to have the opportunity.

"MEXICO CITY — Guatemala will move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, its president announced on Sunday, becoming the first nation to follow President Trump’s lead in ordering the change, which has been widely criticized around the world.

Mr. Trump upended decades of American policy with his decision on Jerusalem, aggravating an emotional issue that has festered since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when the Israelis occupied the entire city.

"The Israeli intelligence service asked the great psychologist Daniel Kahneman for help in the 1970s, and Kahneman came back with a suggestion: Get rid of the classic intelligence report. It allows leaders to justify any conclusion they want, Kahneman said. In its place, he suggested giving the leaders estimated probabilities of events. The intelligence service did so, and an early report concluded that one scenario would increase the chance of full-scale war with Syria by 10 percent. Seeing the number, a top official was relieved. “Ten percent increase?” he said. “That is a small difference.” Kahneman was horrified (as Michael Lewis recounts in his book “The Undoing Project”). A 10 percent increase in the chance of catastrophic war was serious. Yet the official decided that 10 wasn’t so different from zero. Looking back years later, Kahneman said: “No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” His change of heart is good way to introduce my ritual self-criticism. There is a burgeoning tradition in which columnists devote a year-end column to the errors of our ways. The journalist Dave Weigel calls it “pundit accountability.” I’ll start with some back story: Like the pre-1970s Israeli Army, the news business of old didn’t have much use for probabilities, outside of the weather report.

"WARSAW — It is 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday and the sun is already setting over Warsaw. The hours of daylight here are dictated by the tilt of the Earth, Poland’s position in the Northern Hemisphere and the time of year. But the early time of the sunset is the result of something else. Poland’s fierce desire to be part of Europe after breaking through the Soviet Iron Curtain. For decades, the Soviet Union was on permanent daylight saving time, its clock constantly racing ahead of the sun. The Poles did not want to be told by the Russians when the day would end. Even if it meant putting up with darkness in the afternoon, they would rather be on European time because it meant being part of the European Union. But last week, Poland challenged the very notion of what it means to be part of the bloc when the country pushed ahead with controversial measures to overhaul its judicial system and essentially put the courts under the control of the governing party. The action set off unprecedented censure from the European Union. For the first time, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, used the most powerful threat in its arsenal to try to stop the measure, invoking Article 7 of the European Union treaty, which could strip Poland of its voting rights. It accused the government of trying to undermine core democratic values. President Andrzej Duda signed the measures into law anyway. This is still a nation, however, that wants to stand with the West.

"Many of us came into 2017 expecting the worst. And in many ways, the worst is what we got. Donald Trump has been every bit as horrible as one might have expected; he continues, day after day, to prove himself utterly unfit for office, morally and intellectually. And the Republican Party — including so-called moderates — turns out, if anything, to be even worse than one might have expected. At this point it’s evidently composed entirely of cynical apparatchiks, willing to sell out every principle — and every shred of their own dignity — as long as their donors get big tax cuts. Meanwhile, conservative media have given up even the pretense of doing real reporting, and become blatant organs of ruling-party propaganda. Yet I’m ending this year with a feeling of hope, because tens of millions of Americans have risen to the occasion. The U.S. may yet become another Turkey or Hungary — a state that preserves the forms of democracy but has become an authoritarian regime in practice. But it won’t happen as easily or as quickly as many of us had feared. Early this year the commentator David Frum warned that the slide into authoritarianism would be unstoppable “if people retreat into private life, if critics grow quieter, if cynicism becomes endemic.” But so far that hasn’t happened. What we’ve seen instead is the emergence of a highly energized resistance. That resistance made itself visible literally the day after Trump took office, with the huge women’s marches that took place on Jan. 21, dwarfing the thin crowds at the inauguration. If American democracy survives this terrible episode, I vote that we make pink pussy hats the symbol of our delivery from evil. The resistance continued with the town hall crowds that confronted Republican legislators as they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And in case anyone wondered whether the vocal anti-Trump crowds and Trump’s hugely negative polling would translate into political action, a string of special elections — capped by a giant Democratic wave in Virginia and a stunning upset in Alabama — has put such doubts to rest.

"On Tuesday night CBS will air the Kennedy Center Honors, and President Trump will not be on the screen, because he declined to attend the event when it was held on Dec. 3 in Washington. What does it mean that Mr. Trump didn’t have the nerve, for a single night, to be in a room with artists who have criticized him? The president’s team claimed that he did not attend so that the artists could celebrate in peace rather than having a political distraction. But the president votes, as we all do, with his feet. Though the arts have never been neutral politically, the honoring of artists is a bipartisan ritual. The Kennedy Center was a place where the left and the right could agree that the arts occupy a central place in our culture, worthy of our attention and respect. Artists chosen for the Kennedy Center awards generally have fans on the left and the right and everywhere in between. The checkbooks of art patrons are not marked with their party affiliations. I came of age in the culture wars of the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan planned to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, and, instead, ended up whittling down its budget by a small percentage. Still, in 1984, before putting medals on Arthur Miller and Lena Horne among other luminaries, he reflected on the way Americans had developed “a culture that was as fertile as this new land” and had continued to innovate in arts and entertainment. “And today our nation has crowned her greatness with grace, and we gather this evening to honor five artists who have helped her to do so,” he said. I never thought I would be quoting Ronald Reagan to make an argument for the centrality of the arts in American life — but his phrase struck me, during the bizarre cultural moment we are living through: “Our nation has crowned her greatness with grace.” Mr. Trump wants “to make America great again” without dissent and without the arts; but can one truly have greatness without grace?

"President Trump called it proof of the need to build a wall; Senator Ted Cruz said it was a “stark reminder” of insecurity along the border. To everyone, it seemed like a horrendous example of the dangers that border patrol officers face as they cover vast, remote and unforgiving territories. But a month after a middle-of-the-night incident in which one border patrol agent was killed and another, who is said to have no memory of what happened, was severely injured, no one seems to know how the men came into harm’s way off an interstate in West Texas. It was initially thought to be an attack, perhaps by migrants or drug smugglers. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation says it also was possible the men were hurt accidentally. The Culberson County Sheriff, Oscar Carrillo, who is helping with the investigation, seemed to favor that theory when he told The Dallas Morning News that the men could have been hit by a truck driving along the interstate next to where they were found. “If this was an assault, believe me, as sheriff, I’d be the first one out there emphasizing safety in our community and with our deputies, pairing them up,” he told the newspaper. “But from what I know and see, that was not the case here.” That hypothesis has angered the border agents’ union, The National Border Patrol Council, whose leadership fiercely insists that the men were attacked. Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the organization, went as far as to call Sheriff Carrillo a “dingbat” on his weekly podcast.

"In the months leading to the November election, the Working Families Party spent thousands of dollars aiding left-leaning Democratic candidates in dozens of races across the state, often with relatively small amounts in contests for obscure offices. There was the $663 spent on a race for trustee in the Westchester County village of Croton-on-Hudson, or the $1,549 for a candidate running for Monroe County legislator. In taking a hyper-local view of politics, the party, which considers itself to be the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, is trying to lay the groundwork for bigger things. Party officials are focusing on small local races in the hopes of grooming politicians for more high-profile offices, like state legislator or a seat in Congress, while at the same time pushing the Democratic Party to the left. They might take inspiration from the recent house of delegates election in Virginia where a Democratic candidate, Shelly Simonds, gained headlines when she appeared to have won in a recount by a single vote; ultimately, a court declared the race a tie, which will have to be decided by drawing lots. Ms. Simonds’s previous elected position? She is a member of a local school board. Closer to home, Laura Curran, a Democrat who was elected the Nassau County executive in November, in part with support from the Working Families Party, was a county legislator and before that a school board member. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has often worked with the party, also started out as a school board member in Brooklyn. “If you want to build a progressive pipeline of candidates you’ve got to give people some steppingstones,” said Bill Lipton, the party’s New York State director. “They have to learn how to govern. They have to develop a track record.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/nyregion/working-families-party-new-york.html?searchResultPosition=93
"Jimmy Kimmel’s heartfelt monologue about health care; Louis C.K.’s apology for sexual misconduct; Kathy Griffin’s faint at the end of a two-hour-plus set after describing how a Trump joke gone awry put her on the no-fly list. The most memorable moments of the year in comedy were not funny, which is only one of the seeming paradoxes of 2017. Comedians loomed large in popular culture, the tip of the spear in the daily response to the first year of a new presidency, and yet there were strong signs that the boom is on the verge of busting. Netflix reinvigorated the stand-up special, but I’m skeptical that the streaming service’s output produced more classics than in previous years. It’s been a contradictory and uneasy 12 months, and this pointedly idiosyncratic list covers a few of the highlights. BEST COMEBACK SPECIAL This is the year Netflix threw so much money around that star comedians who hadn’t released a special in ages returned. Jerry Seinfeld released his first in 19 years. Dave Chappelle put out two new hours after a 13 year-hiatus, and he unveils two more on New Year’s Eve — that’s four specials in a single year. But no one was funnier than Norm Macdonald, whose verbally dexterous “Hitler’s Dog, Gossip & Trickery,” his first special in six years, cemented his reputation as one of the best stand-ups alive. BEST LIVE SET As soon as Leslie Jones stormed onstage at the Comedy Cellar in July, the room shrunk, her raucous energy and ferocious crowd work making you aware of the low ceilings and echoing acoustics. She ranted about sex, dished about her “Saturday Night Live” co-stars and insulted the patrons in the front row, staring them down during long dramatic pauses, ramping up the tension only to explode it with punch lines. She told some good jokes, but the best parts of this roughly 10-minute set were the riffing and the swagger that make live stand-up the most exciting art in the city. MOST HEARTBREAKING COMEDY For the last four seasons, “Nathan for You” has essentially been an inspired prank show with a mild-mannered consultant giving terrible advice to small businesses. Its star, Nathan Fielder, displayed hints of melancholy, but nothing prepared fans for his wrenching season finale, “Finding Frances.” It centered on a character from an earlier season, a Bill Gates impersonator named Bill Heath, whose lost love from childhood provides the central mystery. What went wrong? Could he get a second chance? Mr. Fielder traveled with Mr. Heath to Arkansas to track her down, while a parallel story involving Mr. Fielder and an escort he falls for, becomes an unlikely romance. The documentarian Errol Morris called it “my new favorite love story.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/arts/television/leslie-jones-marc-maron-comedy-best-2017.html?searchResultPosition=94
"ROME — Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day address on Monday to make clear his concern that serenity is sorely lacking at a time when the “winds of war” and an “outdated model of development” are taking a toll on humanity, society and the environment. Addressing a crowd from a balcony at St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City, the pope delivered his Urbi et Orbi — Latin for “to the city and the world” — benediction, which read like a litany of global conflicts and problems. But it was also an opportunity to pray for a positive turn of events, for a resuscitation of a two-state solution in the Middle East to the healing of war-torn Syria and Ukraine, for the easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula to a return to dialogue in Venezuela. In recent days, the pope said on Twitter that a true celebration of Christmas would free the holiday from consumerism and the “worldliness that has taken it hostage!” He has urged the faithful to instead focus on the “fragile simplicity of a new-born baby. That’s where God is.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/world/europe/pope-francis-christmas-message.html?searchResultPosition=95

"There is a popular narrative these days that President Trump is undermining America’s standing in the world and ceding the mantle of global leadership to China. By insisting that America should act like any other country and put its own interests first, these declinists say, Mr. Trump is demoting America to the status of any other country and straining its postwar alliances to the breaking point. Global polls show that Mr. Trump is far less trusted than President Barack Obama was and Mr. Trump’s America is viewed far less favorably than Mr. Obama’s was. A provocateur like Mr. Trump will trigger strong opinions, but opinions are flighty. A president’s character is indeed likely to affect America’s soft power — its cultural and diplomatic influence — while he is in office. It is less clear, however, that any erosion of soft power under Mr. Trump represents a permanent threat to America’s hard power, including its measurable economic and financial strength. Even before Mr. Trump, the declinists cited data showing China gaining a greater share of the global economy at America’s expense, a trend that is easy to exaggerate. America’s current 24 percent share looks much diminished compared with 30 percent in 2000 but about the same as the 26 percent share in 1980. It’s simple to cherry-pick a start date that makes American decline look bad, but the reality is that China is gaining global economic share at the expense mainly of Europe and Japan. America is a tested economic superpower, having survived 21 recessions and a Great Depression since 1900. China remains untested, having suffered not one outright recession since its modern renaissance began around 1980. It has yet to be seen just how well China will weather such a test, which is inevitable for any large economy. China’s rise has already slowed sharply. When the Chinese economy grew at a double-digit pace last decade and its currency appreciated strongly, many forecasters thought it would match the size of the American economy by now. Instead, following a significant slowdown, China is on pace to catch up to the United States by 2030 — and then only if it experiences no major disruptions or further slowdown. Both things are highly possible. At a time when finance increasingly dominates the global economy, America’s influence as a financial superpower is as great as ever. Central banks around the world are always looking for a safe place to park their money, and they usually buy United States assets, typically Treasury bills, which show up as dollars in their foreign exchange reserves. Since 1980, the dollar’s share of foreign exchange reserves has held roughly steady at around 66 percent. This is in part the world’s way of saying it not only trusts the United States to pay its debts but also trusts it more than Europe, Japan and especially China.

"As Nicki Minaj wrote recently in a since-deleted Instagram post: “It’s a great time to be a white rapper in America, huh?” The Billboard chart this week speaks to her point: Eminem, the white rapper against whom all other white rappers are judged, is at No. 1 with “Revival”; at No. 3 is G-Eazy, a West Coast variant who has seamlessly crossed over into pop with “The Beautiful & Damned.” Both debuted with six-figure sales in their first week. Eminem, a stubbornly consistent artist in the musical sense, is also something of a throwback commercially: He can still sell a lot of albums, streaming aside. “Revival” (Interscope), his eighth major-label LP, had 197,000 in traditional album sales (including physical copies and downloads) and added a robust 82 million streams in its first week for a total of 267,000 album equivalent units, according to Nielsen. The album, a self-lacerating work that also takes aim at President Trump, is Eminem’s eighth in a row to debut at No. 1, a Billboard record. G-Eazy went a route more common in hip-hop today, relying heavily on digital streams: “The Beautiful & Damned,” with its hit singles “No Limit” and “Him & I,” sold 68,000 copies and tallied 70 million streams for a total of 122,000 units by the industry’s math. Sandwiched between the rappers at No. 2 is Taylor Swift, whose new album, “Reputation,” spent three weeks at No. 1 but has been kept from landing there more by high-profile releases from U2, Luke Bryan and now Eminem. Ahead of Christmas, Ms. Swift’s album sold another 105,000 copies and had 35 million streams for an equivalent of 133,000 units. Her album remains the only one of the year to top one million copies in pure sales. Two stalwarts round out the Top 5: Ed Sheeran’s “÷” is No. 4 in its 42nd week on the chart, and Pentatonix’s “A Pentatonix Christmas,” initially released last holiday season, is No. 5.

The story is set in mid-1940, when about 400,000 Allied soldiers were trapped in the French port city from which the film takes its title. A rescue effort known as Operation Dynamo involved large numbers of civilian vessels. (For a glimpse of the bureaucratic side of this period, see “Darkest Hour,” currently in theaters.)

"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea will keep improving its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile capabilities next year to gain leverage to force Washington to make concessions, like the easing of sanctions, government and private analysts in South Korea said on Tuesday. The isolated North has made major strides this year in its nuclear weapons program but has also faced increasingly tough sanctions from the United Nations. On Sept. 3, it detonated what it called a hydrogen bomb in its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. It has also launched three intercontinental ballistic missiles this year, demonstrating rockets powerful enough to deliver warheads to all of the continental United States. After its last ICBM test, conducted Nov. 29, North Korea claimed to have completed building its nuclear force. But the country has yet to clear a key technological hurdle: proving that its warheads can survive re-entry into the atmosphere after flying through space, according to Western officials and analysts. Forecasting North Korea’s nuclear weapons program for the new year, the Unification Ministry in South Korea said on Tuesday that the North “will continue to advance its nuclear and missile capabilities” in 2018 despite its claims about completing its nuclear force. North Korea will conduct at least one more missile test to master the re-entry technology for its warheads, analysts said. But the North also was racing against time to secure full ICBM capabilities before new United Nations sanctions begin squeezing its economy, they said. “Re-entry is a question North Korea must solve to boost its negotiating leverage and for its military and technological purposes,” Shin Beom-chul, a security analyst, said in a report published over the weekend by the government-run Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. “For North Korea, there is a big difference between entering negotiations with the United States after acquiring full ICBM capabilities and starting such talks without them.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-missile-tests.html?searchResultPosition=80
"Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, reached a milestone of sorts recently. By moving to sue the Federal Communications Commission over net neutrality this month, his office took its 100th legal or administrative action against the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. His lawyers have challenged Mr. Trump’s first, second and third travel bans and sued over such diverse matters as a rollback in birth control coverage and a weakening of pollution standards. They have also unleashed a flurry of amicus briefs and formal letters, often with other Democratic attorneys general, assailing legislation they see as gutting consumer finance protections or civil rights. “We try and protect New Yorkers from those who would do them harm,” Mr. Schneiderman said during a recent interview in his Manhattan office. “The biggest threat to New Yorkers right now is the federal government, so we’re responding to it.” In Mr. Schneiderman’s seventh year as attorney general, the office has been transformed into a bulwark of resistance amid an unusually expansive level of confrontation with the federal government. Other Democratic state attorneys general are undertaking similar efforts, often in concert, like Xavier Becerra in California, where extra money was set aside in the budget for the attorney general to battle the Trump administration. How far Mr. Schneiderman is willing to go in taking on Mr. Trump could define his political career, particularly in a blue state where disapproval of the president is high. The potential of the attorney general’s office for troublemaking and generating national headlines was redefined in the early 2000s by Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Schneiderman is a less combative man who was often the target of Mr. Trump’s Twitter wrath amid a three-year civil investigation into Trump University. In the end, Mr. Schneiderman’s office extracted a $25 million settlement in the case. Nonetheless, Mr. Schneiderman is seen by some as a possible backstop should the president exercise his pardon power to help those who might become ensnared in the investigation of possible Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election being led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Federal pardons do not apply to violations of state law. In the interview, Mr. Schneiderman would say little about his potential role as a criminal prosecutor in relation to the Trump administration, except that he hoped it would not come to that. Earlier this year, Mr. Schneiderman began a criminal inquiry focused on allegations of money laundering by Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman. But his office stood down, at least temporarily, out of deference to the special counsel’s inquiry; the offices did not work together, his staff said.

"Home for the holidays after passing the eighth-largest tax cut in United States history, Republicans could be forgiven for reveling in the warm embrace of nostalgia. Who among them won’t raise a glass to Ronald Reagan, a welcome ghost of administrations past, the revered Republican president whose first State of the Union address promised the biggest tax cut ever to “expand our national prosperity, enlarge national incomes and increase opportunities for all Americans”? Speaker Paul D. Ryan might chuckle fondly at Reagan’s tale of woe from a worker in the Midwest — a precursor to Mr. Ryan’s “Cindy”— who made the everyman’s case for a tax cut by complaining, “I’m bringing home more dollars than I ever believed I could possibly earn, but I seem to be getting worse off.” For all the backslapping over a job well done, however, Republicans are proving notably more reluctant to acknowledge the true impact of the tax changes that Reagan wrought. That’s because Reagan’s cuts didn’t quite work as advertised. Gross domestic product grew quickly during his two terms, averaging about 3.5 percent a year, pretty decent compared with the current measly pace. For one in two Americans, though — those in the bottom half of the income pile — income actually shrank on Reagan’s watch. In 1980, the year he was elected, they earned $16,371 a year on average, in today’s dollars, according to the World Wealth and Income Database. By 1988, Reagan’s last year in office, they had to make do with $16,268. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/business/economy/tax-cuts-incomes.html?searchResultPosition=78
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The fires that ripped across California have produced a round of commentary about the perils that come with living in this state. It is nothing new. California has inspired a whole genre of literature and film over the years: dark and apocalyptic, with a disaster lurking behind every stunning sunset illuminating those late-afternoon winter surfers on the Pacific. “Wildfires are the price Angelenos pay to live in a city that straddles mountains, builds housing into hillsides, and threads communities through brush-filled canyons,” The Atlantic wrote this month. “We pick this poison, in place of living with tornadoes or hurricanes or winter storms where ice falls from the sky and blankets whole regions.” Over the decades, California — in films and books — has been pummeled by earthquakes, tidal waves and fires. It has been invaded by aliens. Film noir has flourished, particularly in Los Angeles, a city that seems perfect for setting dark, creepy and pessimistic films. Why are people picking on California? Well, for one thing, there is some truth here: This state is a place of wildfires, mudslides, catastrophic flooding and earthquakes. “When people come to California and they see the hills decked with poppies — everything is beautiful — they expect this is the norm,” said Mike Davis, a Southern California historian who recently wrote about the fires in a New Yorker essay. “The promotion of California as this paradise is a fundamental misrecognition of the nature of the environment that people live in.” But could there also be a whisper of East Coast resentment — or shall we say schadenfreude — from out-of-state commentators who, understandably, might be irritated by, to use a seasonal example, the cheery “Merry Christmas from the Santa Monica beach!” Instagram posts that pop up this time of year. Some people, as Mr. Davis noted, just don’t love California. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/us/california-today-dark-depictions-of-a-sunny-state.html?searchResultPosition=74
"Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas drew a swift and intense response with a provocative claim on Tuesday: President Trump, he wrote, is similar to Winston Churchill, one of history’s most iconic leaders. Mr. Huckabee had just watched “Darkest Hour,” a film about Churchill. It was, he wrote on Twitter, a reminder of “what real leadership looks like.” “Churchill was hated by his own party, opposition party, and press,” he tweeted. “Feared by King as reckless, and despised for his bluntness. But unlike Neville Chamberlain, he didn’t retreat. We had a Chamberlain for 8 yrs; in @realDonaldTrump we have a Churchill.” Likening modern leaders to Chamberlain and Churchill — something Mr. Huckabee has done before — is always a loaded proposition. Chamberlain, who preceded Churchill as prime minister of Britain, tried to appease Hitler by conceding Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland region to Nazi Germany in the 1938 Munich Agreement, and his name has come to be synonymous with weakness in the face of evil. Churchill, by contrast, was an officer in the British Army during World War I; led Britain through World War II as prime minister from 1940 to 1945; and handled several foreign policy crises in a second term as prime minister from 1951 to 1955. He was known for his skill as an orator and writer, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.

The authorities have cast him as an utterly irrelevant showboat. But on Monday the Kremlin barred him from running for president in March. Then on Tuesday, threatening legal action, it warned him against organizing a boycott of the election. In one surreal turn after another, the Russian authorities have dismissed Mr. Navalny, a charismatic and canny street politician, as a nonentity — and then have done everything in their power to make sure that is the case. The boycott warning came from Mr. Putin’s spokesman, and was issued the same day the president, who has been in power for almost 18 years, was formally nominated to seek a fourth term. In barring Mr. Navalny from running, the Central Election Commission cited his suspended prison sentence in a fraud case. The activist, backed by the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe, has denounced the prosecution as politically motivated. Mr. Navalny’s exclusion from the March election “casts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia and the prospect of democratic elections next year,” the European Union’s foreign service said in a statement on Tuesday.

"GOLDSBORO, N.C. — Among President Trump’s worrisome nominees to the judiciary, perhaps none is as alarming as Thomas Alvin Farr, a protégé of Jesse Helms, the former North Carolina senator, and a product of the modern white supremacist machine that Mr. Helms pioneered. Mr. Farr, nominated to serve on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, began his career as counsel for Mr. Helms’s Senate campaigns, where he participated in racist tactics to intimidate African-American voters. This alone is reason to reject his nomination, as is his apparent lying on the topic to the Senate Judiciary Committee. But Mr. Farr’s connections to Mr. Helms’s white supremacist causes and political network go much deeper. Having lived in North Carolina since childhood, I know Mr. Helms’s racist legacy and I hold no doubts that Mr. Farr perpetuates it. An unabashed segregationist, Mr. Helms was affiliated with the Council of Conservative Citizens, an outgrowth of the White Citizens’ Councils that promoted white supremacy. Mr. Helms, who served in the Senate for 30 years, used his honorable seat to support the apartheid regime in South Africa while opposing desegregation, civil rights legislation and the creation of the Martin Luther King’s Birthday holiday in this country. Mr. Helms also belittled Carol Moseley Braun, the only black senator at the time, by singing “Dixie” to her in the Senate elevator. Mr. Farr’s former law partner, Thomas Ellis, was Mr. Helms’s top deputy for decades. He also served as a director of the Nazi-inspired, pro-eugenics Pioneer Fund and used funding from that organization to create and bankroll a network of interlocking organizations to support Mr. Helms and other political candidates who espoused the notion of a superior white race and opposed civil rights. Together, Mr. Helms, Mr. Ellis, and their protégé Mr. Farr unleashed a huge propaganda machine that incited hostility toward African-Americans. Mr. Farr served as a lead counsel to Mr. Helms’s 1990 Senate campaign, which ran the now-infamous “White Hands” TV television ad, designed to inflame white voter anxiety over Mr. Helms’s black opponent, Harvey Gantt. It showed a pair of white hands balling up a rejection letter while a voice said: “You needed that job and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota.” The same campaign also sent more than 100,000 intimidating postcards to North Carolinians, most of whom were blacks eligible to vote, wrongly suggesting they were ineligible and warning that they could be prosecuted for fraud if they tried to cast ballots.

"WASHINGTON — The Affordable Care Act was conceived as a mix of publicly funded health care and privately purchased insurance, but Republican attacks, culminating this month in the death of a mandate that most Americans have insurance, are shifting the balance, giving the government a larger role than Democrats ever anticipated. And while President Trump insisted again on Tuesday that the health law was “essentially” being repealed, what remains of it appears relatively stable and increasingly government-funded. In short, President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement is becoming more like what conservatives despise — government-run health care — thanks in part to Republican efforts that are raising premiums for people without government assistance and allowing them to skirt coverage. By ending the tax penalty for people who do not have coverage, beginning in 2019, Republicans may hasten the flight of customers who now pay the full cost of their insurance. Among those left behind under the umbrella of the Affordable Care Act would be people of modest means who qualify for Medicaid or receive sizable subsidies for private insurance. “Republicans have inadvertently strengthened the hand of Democrats like me who prefer richer subsidies to a mandate and welcome the expanded federal role that will come with those subsidies,” said Joel S. Ario, a former insurance commissioner from Pennsylvania who worked in the Obama administration. In days, the Trump administration is expected to carry out an executive order with proposed rules that would allow people to buy less expensive — and less comprehensive — coverage, through either business and professional associations or short-term private policies.

"To travel the liberal byways of social media over recent weeks was to learn that Donald Trump was on the precipice of axing Robert Mueller and was likely to use the days just before Christmas, when we were distracted by eggnog and mistletoe, to lower the blade. Christmas has come. Christmas has gone. Mueller has not. To listen to Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, the tax overhaul that Trump just signed into law is no mere plutocratic folly. It’s “Armageddon” (Pelosi’s actual word). Their opposition is righteous, but how will millions of voters who notice smaller withholdings from their paychecks and more money in their pockets square that seemingly good fortune with such prophecies of doom on a biblical scale? Some of these Americans may decide that the prophets aren’t to be trusted — and that the president isn’t quite the pestilence they make him out to be. I’m not minimizing Trump’s capriciousness or cupidity. He could yet fire Mueller, the special counsel. Some conservatives’ intensifying attacks on the counsel and the F.B.I. are clearly grist for that. And the tax bill is indeed a messy, fiscally reckless means for Republican lawmakers to please their donors and crow that they are getting big things done. But the end of the world? Come on. That’s not par-for-the-course hyperbole. It’s peculiar-to-Trump hyperventilation, an understandable response to such an indecent president but quite possibly a tactical mistake. It could weaken the odds of hobbling him next fall, in the midterm elections, and of putting him far behind us in November 2020. And that’s where I, for one, want him: in the rearview mirror, growing tinier and tinier as we zoom, pedal to the metal, toward a saner, more dignified horizon.

On the road, in yet another hotel room where my hand can’t locate by instinct the light switch, I imagine that sound sometimes. It makes me smile. Home is little things, the clunk of the door closing on your world. There’s a lot going on out my window: joggers on the promenade, barges plowing the East River, choppers landing on the prow of Manhattan, planes nosing down into Newark Airport, cars on the first traffic-free stretch of F.D.R.

The result was the loss of his job, social ostracism and penury. Fest, who died in 2006, captured his father’s struggles to preserve the family’s moral integrity and political decency in the face of a regime determined to strip it of both. At one point, in 1936, Fest’s mother pleads with Johannes to join the Nazi Party, despite his hatred of it, just to save her and their children from further hardship. Characterizing his mother’s argument, Fest writes, ‘Untruth has always been the weapon of the little people against the powerful.’ Johannes’s unforgettable rejoinder: ‘We are not little people.

"ABOARD A P-3 ORION, over the Pacific Ocean — The Department of Homeland Security is increasingly going global. An estimated 2,000 Homeland Security employees — from Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents to Transportation Security Administration officials — now are deployed to more than 70 countries around the world. Hundreds more are either at sea for weeks at a time aboard Coast Guard ships, or patrolling the skies in surveillance planes above the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The expansion has created tensions with some European countries who say that the United States is trying to export its immigration laws to their territory. But other allies agree with the United States’ argument that its longer reach strengthens international security while preventing a terrorist attack, drug shipment, or human smuggling ring from reaching American soil. “Many threats to the homeland begin overseas, and that’s where we need to be,” said James Nealon, the department’s assistant secretary for international engagement. A surveillance mission earlier this month with Homeland Security agents in drug transit zones near South America highlights the department’s efforts to push out the border. Just after takeoff from a Costa Rican airfield, a crew of agents aboard a Customs and Border Protection surveillance plane began tracking a low-flying aircraft that appeared to be headed south toward Ecuador.

"It was supposed to be a tax cut for manufacturers. Then it got out of control. World Wrestling Entertainment took it for producing wrestling videos. Regional gas stations claimed it because they mix ethanol with base fuel. Grocery stores asked for it because they spray their fruit so that it ripens. Pharmacies could take it because they have booths that print photos. Republicans in Congress passed that deduction more than a decade ago, and they repealed it in the tax bill signed on Friday by President Trump. It is a lesson in the abundant creativity of American business in interpreting the tax code. The latest overhaul could play out the same way. Already, lawyers and accountants are eyeing several provisions that investors and companies could potentially exploit. The bill, for example, lowers the taxes on so-called pass-through income, which is earned by partnerships and other types of businesses. Congress sold the provision as a way to help smaller companies. But lawmakers added language that allowed big real estate developers to benefit. The result could be a tax break for any company that buys and operates a building for its business. The new law is also supposed to encourage companies to make investments in the United States. But the rules were written in such a way that they could give businesses an incentive to keep their money in foreign countries and build factories abroad. The wildly popular manufacturing break, passed in 2004, is a case study in the unforeseen consequences of changing the tax code — how companies take advantage of gaping holes and force the government to play catch-up.

"In a jab at President Trump’s promises to crack down on illegal immigration, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday pardoned 18 immigrants in an effort to free them from the threat of deportation or other immigration-related issues. The pardons targeted those who had committed low-level offenses and had demonstrated significant rehabilitation since their convictions, Alphonso David, the governor’s chief counsel, said in an interview. “New York is a state of immigrants,” Mr. David said. “And most of these individuals made mistakes decades ago, and have been contributing members to our society.” With the new slate of pardons, Mr. Cuomo nearly tripled the number he had issued explicitly to stave off deportations, his office said. Before Wednesday, the governor had pardoned seven people for that purpose. This is the second time that the governor has wielded clemency as a direct rebuke to Mr. Trump’s immigration policies. The president has directed immigration officials to prioritize the deportation of any undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes, even low-level ones. In June, Mr. Cuomo pardoned Carlos Cardona, an immigrant from Colombia who had volunteered with Sept. 11 recovery efforts and who had been detained by immigration officials since February. Mr. Cardona had spent 45 days in jail after pleading guilty to selling a small amount of cocaine to an undercover officer.

"For much of Silicon Valley, 2017 felt like a nonstop parade of scandal and sin. There was the decline of Uber, which blew itself up with missteps that included reports of rampant sexual harassment and executive misbehavior. There were troubles at Facebook, which became a lightning rod for failing to keep its platform safe from Russian propagandists and global extremists, and at Twitter and YouTube, which spent much of the year fighting to cleanse themselves of neo-Nazis, child exploiters and other undesirables. But tech wasn’t all bad this year. As many of Silicon Valley’s largest companies were wreaking havoc, numerous people and organizations used technology to advance important causes and address large-scale problems. These projects do not always make headlines, but they show what’s possible when technologists use their powers for good.

But that’s changing, thanks to start-ups like eSight and Aira, two companies that are taking advantage of recent advances in mobile and imaging technology to help visually impaired people navigate the world. Aira, a start-up in San Diego, provides “visual interpreters” through an on-demand subscription service. Users wear camera-equipped glasses that shares what they see over a built-in wireless connection with a sighted person who then describes the surroundings or guides them through complicated tasks in real time. The company raised $12 million in a funding round earlier this year, and recently struck a partnership with Lyft to improve the ride-hailing service’s accessibility. ESight, a company in Toronto, is building technology for legally blind people, who have impaired sight but have not fully lost their vision.

"The Internal Revenue Service has a message for the homeowners rushing to prepay their property taxes before new rules take effect on New Year’s Day: Not so fast. The tax bill that President Trump signed into law last week sharply limited the itemized deductions for state and local taxes while raising the standard deduction for individuals and couples. Those rules do not take effect until 2018, however. That has led some homeowners, particularly in high-tax, affluent areas, to try to prepay their 2018 property taxes before the deduction disappears. In an advisory notice posted to its website on Wednesday, the I.R.S. said that maneuver could work, but only under limited circumstances. To qualify for the deduction, property taxes not only need to be paid in 2017, they must also be assessed in 2017 — meaning that homeowners who prepaid their taxes based on estimated assessments, or who tried to pay several years’ worth of taxes at once, will probably be out of luck. “Those individuals now are not getting the benefits of those prepayments,” Nicole Kaeding, an economist at the Tax Foundation, said of people who paid taxes that had not yet been assessed. “All that you’ve done is provided an interest-free loan to your municipal government.” It is not clear how many people have tried to prepay their taxes. In Fairfax, Va., hundreds of people lined up to prepay taxes on Tuesday, according to local media reports, and communities in New York, New Jersey and other states have likewise reported a rush of prepayments. Some states have encouraged residents to try to skirt the new cap on state and local tax deductions. Last week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed an executive order paving the way for residents to prepay their property taxes.

"When Mayor Bill de Blasio is sworn in for a second term on Monday, the oath will be administered by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont — a choice that perhaps reflects the shifting political winds in the Democratic Party. Four years ago, the former president Bill Clinton administered the oath, with Hillary Clinton looking on. At the time, Mrs. Clinton was the smart-money pick to become the next president. That didn’t work out. Along the way, Mr. de Blasio was late to endorse Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, as other progressive Democrats were flocking to Mr. Sanders. After Mrs. Clinton lost to Donald J. Trump last November, Mr. de Blasio consummated his embrace of Mr. Sanders and the Democratic Party’s left wing. Mr. Sanders’s presence may further speculation that Mr. de Blasio has his gaze on goals beyond New York City. Despite criticism, Mr. de Blasio has persisted in seeking a national political role for himself. He has made himself a liberal foil for President Trump, taking him on over issues like immigration and tax policy. Earlier this month Mr. de Blasio traveled to Iowa, where he spoke before Progress Iowa, a group that, like the mayor, wants to steer Democratic politics to the left. He has denied that he plans to run for president, but paying visits to Iowa — the state that traditionally holds the first presidential nominating contest — is a common gambit for presidential hopefuls. “Senator Sanders’ progressive leadership has helped reshape the American political debate in favor of men and women long left out of our city and nation’s prosperity,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement released on Wednesday.

"At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Pat Buchanan famously declared that American politics had become a “cultural war.” In the years since, social issues and identities have become more important in dividing Democrats from Republicans. Traditionally, the two parties fought mostly over economics. But now cultural issues like abortion and gun control divide Americans more sharply along regional lines than economic policies. One impact of the rise of the culture war in the 1990s was to reorder the popular coalitions of the parties — for example, by attracting evangelical Protestants to the Republicans while propelling secular voters toward the Democrats. This also redefined their geographic constituencies. But while it has been fueled by widening divisions over social issues within the American electorate, this regional realignment has left a much larger imprint on the direction of federal economic policy than on the nation’s prevailing cultural zeitgeist. You might say that the winner of the culture wars is neither Democrats nor Republicans. In legislative terms, American corporations have claimed the biggest victories so far. The growing sectional divide — the coasts and a handful of Midwestern and Mountain West states vote blue, while voters in the culturally conservative heartland of the South and interior West largely vote red — is magnified by winner-take-all electoral rules that concentrate representation in the hands of local partisan majorities. The Alabama Senate race was an exception, but this largely produces a stable arrangement of “red” and “blue” states and districts that seldom deviate from their normal partisan alignments regardless of the individual candidates seeking office. On balance, the trend of rising geographic polarization has worked to the advantage of Republicans in both houses of Congress. The Republican Party has captured more seats in culturally conservative red America than it has relinquished in culturally liberal blue America, allowing it to control at least one legislative chamber in all but four years since 1994 after six decades of near-permanent minority status.

"WASHINGTON — Over the past year, the United States has faced immense challenges in its dealings with North Korea, China and Russia, and in its efforts to defeat international terrorism. But Americans should be encouraged by the progress the State Department and United States Agency for International Development have made in pushing for global peace and stability. When President Trump took office, he identified North Korea as the United States’ greatest security threat. He abandoned the failed policy of strategic patience. In its place we carried out a policy of pressure through diplomatic and economic sanctions. This year, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted three of the strongest sanctions resolutions in history, including bans on a wide array of North Korean exports such as coal, iron, seafood and textiles. The United States has asked allies and partners to exert unilateral pressure against North Korea in order to force the regime to change its behavior. Many have responded with positive steps like shutting down trade, severing diplomatic ties and expelling North Korean laborers. Our peaceful pressure campaign has cut off roughly 90 percent of North Korea’s export revenue, much of which is used to fund illegal weapons development. We hope that this international isolation will pressure the regime into serious negotiations on the abandonment of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. A door to dialogue remains open, but we have made it clear that the regime must earn its way back to the negotiating table. Until denuclearization occurs, the pressure will continue. A central component of our North Korea strategy is persuading China to exert its decisive economic leverage on Pyongyang. China has applied certain import bans and sanctions, but it could and should do more. We will also continue to pursue American interests in other areas of our relationship, including trade imbalances, intellectual property theft and China’s troubling military activities in the South China Sea and elsewhere. China’s rise as an economic and military power requires Washington and Beijing to consider carefully how to manage our relationship for the next 50 years. Defeating terrorism remains one of the president’s highest priorities. The administration’s aggressive strategy to counter the Islamic State delegates greater authority to American military commanders on the battlefield, giving our forces more freedom and speed to do what they do best, in partnership with indigenous fighting forces. As a result, the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS has accelerated operations and has recaptured virtually all of previously held Islamic State territory in Iraq and Syria. While our military was helping clear Iraq and Syria of Islamic State forces, our diplomats were following up with humanitarian aid and assistance, such as clearing land mines, restoring water and power, and getting children back in school.

The writer decided to stay a few extra days. “Martha Stewart’s jaw dropped,” Mr. Wayne said. “She said, ‘Why are you staying? Are you kidding me?’” She had a point. Violence erupted in Moscow after Boris Yeltsin, the president, sought to disband the Russian parliament and seize control. “I turned on CNN after having the best sex with this Russian boxer and there is a coup taking place in the country,” Mr. Wayne said.

"PARAMUS, N.J. — On a back wall in Gurbir Grewal’s office, three portraits of Japanese-Americans detained at the Manzanar internment camp in California hang above his desk, a reminder for Mr. Grewal of when the power of domestic law went horribly awry. Though the portraits are from decades ago, Mr. Grewal sees alarming parallels to the current political environment, where patriotism is sometimes measured by race, faith or political affiliation. The notion to combat this type of injustice has helped inspire Mr. Grewal, a Sikh, throughout his career, an arc that has seen him rise through the ranks of the federal justice system and now has him poised to become New Jersey’s top law enforcement official. If, as expected, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature approves his appointment by the governor-elect, Philip D.

Mr. Grewal made his mark in criminal justice with significant federal convictions in financial and cybersecurity crimes, including a case involving two Russian hackers named Drinkman and Smilianets, who oversaw a network that stole more than 160 million credit card numbers. But in today’s political climate, attorneys general in Democratic states are increasingly being viewed as checks on Trump administration policies.

"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to revise its nearly 17-year-old standard for dangerous levels of lead in paint and dust within one year, a rare legal move that amounts to a sharp rebuff of President Trump and Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator. The decision also called attention to the persistent threat of lead paint to children in millions of American homes, four decades after the federal government banned it from households. “This is going to protect the brains of thousands of children across the country,” said Eve C. Gartner, a staff attorney for Earthjustice who helped argue the case on behalf of groups pushing for tougher standards. “It’s going to mean that children that otherwise would have developed very elevated blood lead levels will be protected from the damage associated with that, assuming E.P.A. follows the court order,” she said. The 2-to-1 decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, means the E.P.A. must propose a new rule within 90 days, instead of the six years the Trump administration had requested to reconsider what levels of lead exposure are acceptable for children. That request was on top of a six-year delay under former President Barack Obama, a holdup the court said was unreasonable, particularly in the face of new research on the hazards of lead paint. “Indeed E.P.A. itself has acknowledged that ‘lead poisoning is the number one environmental health threat in the U.S. for children ages 6 and younger,’ and that the current standards are insufficient,” the ruling said, adding, “The children exposed to lead poisoning due to the failure of E.P.A. to act are severely prejudiced by E.P.A.’s delay.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/us/epa-lead-paint.html?searchResultPosition=33
"JERUSALEM — In the uneasy days after President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, some Israelis who cheered the move paid homage — and taunted outraged Palestinians — by posting doctored photos of the Dome of the Rock with the president’s surname plastered across it, as if one of Islam’s holiest shrines had been reduced to the latest gold-plated Trump property. Now, a powerful Israeli cabinet minister is offering to express his gratitude by putting Mr. Trump’s name on a proposed new train station in the Old City, one that would bring thousands of tourists directly into the Jewish Quarter just a few hundred yards from the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. The minister, Yisrael Katz, who has responsibility for both transportation and intelligence, has built a can-do reputation for seeing through a wide range of infrastructure projects; he also has designs on the prime minister’s office. Although he has been promoting the idea of a railroad stop in the Old City for over a year, he said on Wednesday that it was now a priority, calling it the “most important national project being advanced today at the ministry of transport.” Mr. Katz said he planned to name it for Mr. Trump “for his courageous and historic decision” and his “contribution in the strengthening of the status of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people and the state of Israel.” But the plan, which would require digging beneath some of the most sensitive acreage on earth, is sure to invite more international criticism, not to mention further antagonize Palestinians. Despite Mr. Trump’s change in United States policy, announced this month, most of the world does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Old City, which Israel captured along with the rest of East Jerusalem in 1967. The United Nations General Assembly voted 128 to 9 last week to condemn Mr. Trump’s decision. Ahmad Tibi, a leading Arab member of the Knesset, called Mr. Katz’s proposal “part of the chain reaction to the Trump speech,” which he said had set off “a competition among ministers over who will be more extreme regarding the matter of Jerusalem.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/world/middleeast/israeli-yisrael-katz-trump-station.html?searchResultPosition=44

"To the Editor: “An Honor For Artists, Trump-Free,” by Sarah Ruhl (Op-Ed, Dec. 26), about this year’s Kennedy Center honors (sans Potus), struck me as particularly poignant. Few things represent the best of America, or are as well loved internationally, as our artists. Even during the divisive years of the Reagan and Bush II administrations, politics could be laid aside to celebrate the best of our creative geniuses. As I enjoy the peacefulness that a rare Christmas snowfall has brought to the Pacific Northwest lowlands, I think about the state of our country and how the current occupant of the White House cannot even bring himself to lay down partisanship for an evening to celebrate these exemplars of America’s greatness.

"Like many Jewish journalists who reported on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, I spent the 2016 election being harassed by a motley crew of internet racists who coalesced around the future president. They sent me threats, photoshopped me into gas chambers and hurled an uncreative array of anti-Semitic slurs my way. A study by the Anti-Defamation League found that I’d received the second-most abuse of any Jewish journalist on Twitter during the campaign cycle. My parents didn’t raise me to be No. 2; fortunately, there’s always 2020. As a result, I’ve become something of an unintentional expert on alt-right trolls and their tactics. For the most part, these characters are largely laughable — sad, angry men hiding behind images of cartoon frogs, deathly afraid that their employers will uncover their online antics. But there are also more insidious individuals, whose digital skulduggery can be more consequential than the occasional bigoted bromide. And so last November, in the wake of Trump’s victory, I decided to turn the tables on them. My target? Impersonator trolls. You probably haven’t heard of these trolls, but that is precisely why they are so pernicious. These bigots are not content to harass Jews and other minorities on Twitter; they seek to assume their identities and then defame them. The con goes like this: The impersonator lifts an online photo of a Jew, Muslim, African-American or other minority — typically one with clear identifying markers, like a yarmulke-clad Hasid or a woman in hijab. Using that picture as a Twitter avatar, the bigot then adds ethnic and progressive descriptors to the bio: “Jewish,” “Zionist,” “Muslim,” “enemy of the alt-right.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/opinion/digital-nazi-hunter-trump.html?searchResultPosition=47
"To the Editor: Re “The Looting of America’s Public Lands” (editorial, Dec. 10): To the shockingly long list of assaults on public lands and the environment by President Trump and his administration, add the effort by Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, to repeal and replace the Clean Water Rule. The rule protects small streams and wetlands, which contribute to the drinking water supply of one in three Americans. In the past, efforts to undermine protection of the environment have been rejected by the American public. Exploitation of public lands in the late 19th century helped usher in the Progressive conservation era of Theodore Roosevelt. Americans rejected the extremism of Interior Secretary James Watt and the E.P.A. administrator, Anne Gorsuch, in the Reagan administration. The Trump administration poses an even graver threat. Once again, Americans must rise to defend our rivers, our cherished public lands and the environmental heritage we owe our children and grandchildren. WM.

"Hurry, you have just a few more days to ensure a spot for your tweets in the collections of the Library of Congress. After archiving every single public message posted on Twitter since the social media platform was introduced in March 2006, the institution will soon scale back its approach to collecting them. Starting on Jan. 1, 2018, the library will apply the same selective discretion to tweets that it uses for other documents, collecting and archiving material around themes or events of consequence. The move, announced in a Tuesday blog post, brings to an end an ambitious effort, which began in 2010 when Twitter donated its full archive of public tweets to the library. “The Twitter Archive may prove to be one of this generation’s most significant legacies,” the library said in a document detailing the decision. “Future generations will learn much about this rich period in our history, the information flows, and social and political forces that help define the current generation.” Twitter has come a long way since one of its founders, Jack Dorsey, posted the first tweet on March 21, 2006. Today, many organizations, celebrities and politicians, including President Trump, view it as a crucial tool for reaching their audiences. The service has also shrunk the distance between the anonymous and the famous, the frivolous and the serious. The most-liked tweet of 2017 was a quotation about unity posted by former President Obama in the wake of the white supremacist violence this summer in Charlottesville, Va. And the most retweeted message was a plea from a teenager on a quest for a year’s worth of free chicken nuggets. Make of that what you will. The library’s decision, the result of a continuing evaluation of its practices, was driven by a number of factors, from the difficulty of maintaining the collection to the waning need for a comprehensive archive, the library said. Now that it has nearly 12 years’ worth of tweets in the collection, the library suggested that it had largely fulfilled its original goal of documenting the rise and evolution of Twitter. “With social media now established, the Library is bringing its collecting practice more in line with its collection policies,” it said in the document. The move was also driven by practical concerns, including both the difficulty in archiving the huge amount of data on Twitter and the fact that the library has only ever collected the text of tweets even as they have become increasingly visual. Twitter has also grown exponentially in the years since the library started its collection. That year, 2010, about half a billion tweets were posted every two weeks. In November, that many were sent each day. The messages are now longer: The company recently doubled its limit for tweets to 280 from 140 characters. Such complications have plagued public access to the archive, too, which is limited while the library works to find a cost-effective and sustainable way to open the archive to the public.

"LONDON — It was a case of the famous interviewing the famous. The BBC aired an interview on Wednesday that was unusual in at least a couple of respects: The man answering the questions was former President Barack Obama, and the man asking them was his friend Prince Harry. The prince took the seat as a guest editor for BBC Radio 4’s flagship program, “Today,” and broadcast a long-awaited interview in which he questioned the former president about the day he left the White House, his work since leaving office and his plans for the future. Neither party mentioned President Trump by name, but Mr. Obama’s successor was never far from the conversation. The two men discussed the risks of using social media and the corrosion of civil discourse. The interview was recorded in Toronto in September, when Prince Harry and Mr. Obama met during the Invictus Games, a sporting competition for injured military members and veterans. The highlights of the interview: Since leaving office in January, Mr. Obama has more time on his hands. He gets to wake up later, spend more time with his family and take control of his day, something he says he couldn’t do as president. But the things that are important to him have not changed. Now that he no longer has the authority that came with being president, Mr. Obama said he relies on persuasion rather than legislation. “A lot of the things that still motivate me and move me continue to this day,” he added. While neither man mentioned Mr. Trump directly, they discussed the role of social media in leadership, a conversation that brought to mind Mr. Trump’s blunt, unvarnished posts on Twitter.

"The Trump administration has long applied a double standard to the violence in Yemen, the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. It fiercely condemns Iran for supporting the indigenous Houthi insurgents and allegedly supplying them with short-range ballistic missiles and other weapons. At the same time, it has nothing bad to say about (and is indeed enabling) Saudi Arabia’s savage bombing in support of Yemen’s government — an air campaign that is worsening a civilian death toll among a population already suffering from a famine and cholera. That Iran is providing the Houthis with missiles and other weapons has not been proved. If the charge is true, Iran could be in violation of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution barring it from selling or transferring certain weapons outside the country without Security Council approval. It would also deserve condemnation for escalating a crisis that could elevate what is already a proxy war between two of the region’s major powers — Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim nation, and Shiite Muslim-led Iran — into direct conflict. For the moment, however, Saudi Arabia’s bombing campaign and its blockade of Yemen’s major ports and airports are the main drivers of the crisis. The United States has provided the Saudi-led coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates and other Persian Gulf states, with precision-guided munitions, intelligence and refueling capability. At a recent press conference at a military base near Washington, Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, conspicuously ignored America’s involvement. Among the props displayed were pieces of what Pentagon officials claimed were Iranian-made Qiam missiles, including one allegedly fired by Houthi militants at an airport in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, last month. Not a word was said about Saudi-American cooperation in the war, and officials, in response to basic questions from reporters, were unable to prove their charges about the source of the missiles. The purpose of this dog-and-pony show — the Pentagon declassified the weaponry for the occasion — was to reinforce the administration’s campaign to rally international support for punishing (and perhaps, someday going to war against) Iran on grounds that Tehran is largely responsible for destabilizing activities in the region.

"The warning bell is ringing on China’s global effort to suppress Western values and undermine the freedoms enjoyed in the world’s democracies. Beijing has baited some of America’s leading corporations with offers of access to its giant consumer market. In return, the likes of Apple and LinkedIn have agreed to play by China’s rules and submit to what amounts to censorship. On American college campuses, accepting money from the Beijing-backed Confucius Institute has come at the price of academic freedom: There are mounting concerns that the language and cultural centers financed by the institute prohibit discussion on issues that place China in a critical light. Elsewhere, Beijing has been accused of pulling the strings of Western democracies. In Australia, Chinese businessmen with ties to the Chinese Communist Party have donated millions of dollars to the country’s two leading political parties in an effort to shape domestic and foreign policy. A rising political star, Sam Dastyari of the opposition Labor Party, announced his resignation from the Senate in the face of allegations that he was peddling Beijing’s positions for financial support.

"It’s hard to be out with Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen. Neither blends in. They are hugely recognizable, both appearing on television five nights a week, and when they’re spotted together, people stop in their tracks. Throughout a recent lunch at Cafe Cluny, they were approached by fans of “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen,” his talk show on Bravo; the actress Julianne Moore; and a woman thanking Mr. Cooper for a hurricane relief segment on “Anderson Cooper 360,” his CNN show. “I paid her to do that,” Mr. Cooper said. “We’ve produced this entire afternoon.” In their less famous days, a high school friend of Mr. Cooper’s tried to set them up on a blind date. It was 1995, and Mr. Cooper had recently moved from Los Angeles back to New York for a job at ABC News, and Mr. Cohen was a producer at “CBS This Morning.” The date never happened, but a friendship eventually did. Their bond has now become a commodity. Their “AC2” tour, in which they talk about whatever they like before a paying audience, continues at the Beacon Theater in New York on Jan. 26 and 27. And on New Year’s Eve, Mr. Cohen will join Mr. Cooper to host CNN’s telecast from Times Square — replacing the comedian Kathy Griffin, who was fired in May after posing for a photograph while holding a Donald Trump mask bloodied with ketchup. “I hope she gets back to doing what she does best,” Mr. Cooper said. “We wish her the best.” Over tea with milk for Mr. Cohen, 49, and scrambled eggs with toast for Mr. Cooper, 50, the pair discussed first impressions, dancing at the Roxy nightclub, lost luggage and Panda Express.

"ALTAMONT, N.Y. — For eight weeks every fall, Indian Ladder Farms, a fifth-generation family operation near Albany, kicks into peak season. The farm sells homemade apple pies, fresh cider and warm doughnuts. Schoolchildren arrive by the busload to learn about growing apples. And as customers pick fruit from trees, workers fill bins with apples, destined for the farm’s shop and grocery stores. This fall, amid the rush of commerce — the apple harvest season accounts for about half of Indian Ladder’s annual revenue — federal investigators showed up. They wanted to check the farm’s compliance with migrant labor rules and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets pay and other requirements for workers. Suddenly, the small office staff turned its focus away from making money to placating a government regulator. The investigators arrived on a Friday in late September and interviewed the farm’s management and a group of laborers from Jamaica, who have special work visas. The investigators hand delivered a notice and said they would be back the following week, when they asked to have 22 types of records available. The request included vehicle registrations, insurance documents and time sheets — reams of paper in all. Over the next several days, the Ten Eyck family, which owns the farm, along with the staff devoted about 40 hours to serving the investigators, who visited three times before closing the books.

"Of all the sequels and franchise extensions in 2017, none were as ambitious as the reboot of the culture wars starring Donald J. Trump. He swept into office with the swagger of a one-man Justice League, bent on vanquishing the liberal-leaning entertainment industrial complex and its coastal elite base, one tweet at a time. The phrase “culture war” first crashed into the national discourse in the late 1980s, as a catchall term for battles over values, ideals and national identity. The battlegrounds were college campuses, Hollywood, the bedroom — anywhere that moral relativism, secularism and the general “culture of depravity,” as dedicated warriors like Rush Limbaugh put it, held sway. Today’s culture wars, like war itself, have moved beyond the old, clearly defined fields of contention and are just as likely to rage among old allies as traditional right-left antagonists. Here’s a selective, not-so-nostalgic look back at some of the fiercest fights from a year when just about every cultural event and artifact became an arena for asking not just “Which side are you on?” but “Do you really have my back?” If there was any lingering hope that President Trump was going to cede the stage to a more restrained character, it was laid to rest at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, when Hollywood served up the making of a classic culture wars set piece.

"MOSCOW — After a sharp escalation in fighting this month between the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists, the two sides took an unusual break from shelling each other on Wednesday to carry out their biggest exchange of prisoners since the conflict began in 2014. The prisoner swap — involving 73 Ukrainians held captive by the rebels, and more than 200 separatists captured by Ukraine — was carried out without serious incident just days after the Trump administration agreed to provide weapons to Ukraine. That move, Russia says, will only escalate a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people. The prompt release of all prisoners was a key part of a 2015 peace agreement brokered by France, Germany and Russia in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. But like many other parts of the Minsk deal, it has gotten bogged down in accusations on each side that the other was not fulfilling its obligations. The two sides have swapped prisoners on numerous prior occasions, but Wednesday’s exchange was the biggest transfer of captives on a single day, Ukrainian officials said. The Ukrainian security agency, known as the S.B.U., said on Wednesday that a total of 3,215 Ukrainians captured by the rebels since 2014 had now been released and that 103 remained in captivity in rebel-held territory, with dozens more held prisoner in Russia.

"Updated, 10:32 a.m. Good morning on this frigid Wednesday. This month, we asked readers to nominate candidates for New York Today’s New Yorkers of the Year, our annual celebration of citizens who have made a difference in the city over the last 12 months. We received more than 100 submissions, and this week we are highlighting a few of our exemplary neighbors. When the elevator opened on the fourth floor, the hallway was filled with the sound of a concerto. Kelly Hall-Tompkins was in her practice studio in Washington Heights, warming up for a performance that weekend with the Westchester Philharmonic. But the closet-size room, filled with sheet music, framed inspirational quotes and James Baldwin novels, is not the only place you can find the renowned violinist rehearsing. Once a month she visits local shelters to perform the scores of Beethoven, Bach and other classical masters for homeless New Yorkers. Ms. Hall-Tompkins earned acclaim last year as the fiddler in the Broadway revival of “Fiddler on the Roof.” But more than a decade ago, well before she could have imagined landing the coveted violin soloist gig, she was playing chamber music in soup kitchens. It was 2004. Ms. Hall-Tompkins was preparing for a one-woman show but found herself struggling to focus after the death of a close friend. In need of company, she took to a shelter near Lincoln Center and began making her way through Mozart’s Violin Concerto No. 4 in D Major. Twelve people listened to the same notes she would soon play before an audience of 1,000. Some tapped their feet, laughed or smiled. Others, who told the violinist they had never heard classical music before, cried. “You can reach people in this situation on a deeper level, sometimes, than ticket-buying audiences,” Ms. Hall-Tompkins said. “Of course, the nature of my career is playing concerts for ticket-buying audiences, but there’s something more profound reaching people with these pieces at this time in their lives.” The next year, Ms. Hall-Tompkins founded Music Kitchen — Food for the Soul, a program that lifts the spirits of homeless New Yorkers through live classical music recitals. The intimate performances, which take place not on celebrated stages but in worn community rooms of shelters, have become a therapy of sorts for those who listen.

"In the first year of President Trump’s administration, the role of late-night TV comedians has changed dramatically — perhaps permanently. It’s almost impossible to watch even five minutes of a show nowadays without some mention of politics. Since February, I’ve written “Best of Late Night,” a daily column highlighting standout moments from the weeknight talk shows. In a year defined by Mr. Trump’s unorthodox presidency, each host has seemed to build a personal approach to handling him. On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert, no stranger to political satire, has tended to focus on the Russia scandal, even taping a week of shows in Russia last summer. Jimmy Kimmel, once a rather apolitical figure, cloaked himself in activist garb, pushing for — and against — legislation in a way that forebears like Johnny Carson and Jay Leno wouldn’t have imagined. Even Jimmy Fallon, whose stage persona remains sunny and easygoing, often takes on politics, mostly by emphasizing the silliness — not the severity — of what unfolds in Washington. The hosts didn’t abandon broader cultural concerns, either, confronting topics like the airline industry and the #metoo movement. Here’s your year-end “Best of Late Night,” with some of the funniest quips and most memorable moments. Mr. Colbert has tracked the Russia investigation more assiduously than any other host. When the fired F.B.I. director James Comey testified before Congress in June, Mr. Colbert gleefully pointed out that Mr. Comey had taken close notes on his conversations with Mr. Trump, for fear that the president might mischaracterize what had been said.

"It would be easy to end 2017 with the impression that, whatever its afflictions, it was at least a game-changing year for feminism. “The Female Revolution Is Here” and could “Smash Patriarchy at Its Core,” social and mainstream media headlines declared. “We are blowing the whistle on the prime directive of the master/slave relationship between women and men.” “This is the end of patriarchy” — this from Forbes! — “the male domination of humanity.” Twitter, the newsstand and the street concur: This year witnessed a transformational moment in American sexual politics. Surely the results of the #MeToo phenomenon are worthy. It’s a seriously good thing Harvey Weinstein is gone and that the potential Harvey Weinsteins will think twice or thrice or a thousand times before harassing women whose fortunes they control. But “the end of patriarchy”? Look around. This month, President Trump signed into law a tax bill that throws a bomb at women. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act systematically guts benefits that support women who need support the most: It means an end to personal and dependent exemptions (a disaster for minimum-wage workers, nearly two-thirds of whom are women). An expiration date for child-care tax credits and a denial of such credits for immigrant children without Social Security cards. An end to the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. And, barely avoided, thanks to Democrats’ objections: an enshrinement of “fetal personhood” in the form of college savings accounts for unborn children, a sly grenade lobbed at legal abortion. Not to mention that Republican congressmen plan to pay down the enormous federal deficit the bill will incur by slashing entitlements that, again, are critical to women: Medicaid (covering nearly half the births in the nation and 75 percent of family planning), Medicare (more than half of beneficiaries 65 and older — and two-thirds of those 85 and older — are women) and so on. And that’s on top of all the other Trump administration insults: reviving the global gag rule on abortion, suspending tracking of the gender wage gap, deep-sixing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order and much more.

"New York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation. Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much. There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend. The corrosive culture of money in big-time college sports — more than $8 billion a year among the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Division I sports programs — was painfully obvious recently with the indictments of college coaches and an Adidas executive charged with paying bribes to recruit basketball players and steer them to agents. It was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.” The tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.

"To the Editor: Bret Stephens (“Tax Bill Hysteria,” column, Dec. 22) argues that the Democrats won’t do well attacking the new tax bill because “in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center, 91 percent of middle-income filers will get a tax cut, averaging close to $1,100. That’s real money.” But Mr. Stephens overlooks the debit side of the bill. The money may be real, but it’s entirely inadequate to cover the losses many of those middle-income earners will incur. How much health care will $1,100 buy them when they find that, with the individual mandate repealed, the new premiums become unaffordable? How many credit hours at college will it buy their children if colleges reduce financial aid to cover the cost of endowment taxation? Just how secure will Social Security and Medicare remain as the government makes cuts to reduce the skyrocketing deficit? If Democrats clarify the high and painful costs of the new bill, I think that their attacks can be very effective indeed. GAIL POOL, SANIBEL, FLA. To the Editor: As Bret Stephens and the Republicans crow about lowering corporate tax rates to get them in line with other developed countries, they don’t mention that all of those countries have a higher personal income tax rate that helps guarantee the public a variety of benefits. These include health care, a comfortable retirement and a general sense that the individual’s health and welfare are indeed a shared responsibility administered by the government.

"To the Editor: There has been much discussion about the word of the year. I believe that word should be “diminished.” In 2017 we witnessed President Trump’s destructive comments on North Korea, on Israel, on NATO, on Nafta, on the United Nations, on the Paris climate accord, on the nuclear deal with Iran, on the very idea of immigration. In 2017 we watched as Mr. Trump filled the seat rightfully that of Judge Merrick Garland with Neil Gorsuch, and stacked the federal bench with those most willing to do his bidding. In 2017 we saw the gutting of our State Department, leaving it woefully understaffed, our diplomatic capabilities in tatters. In 2017 we recoiled as our environmental laws were overturned, and we forced each state to be the protector of our lands and the air we breathe. In 2017 we were informed that our rich are not rich enough, our poor can get still poorer and the sick ever sicker. In 2017 we learned how tenuous our hold was on the truth, how unrepentant the president is for his mountain of baldfaced lies. In 2017 we were horrified as the party in power shut its eyes and genuflected before the most pernicious, immoral excuse for a leader this country has ever witnessed. In 2017 we were outmaneuvered and outplayed by China and Russia as they watched and waited for the next inevitable opening. In 2017 we have been, in so many arenas and on so many levels, in our eyes and in the eyes of those around the world, diminished. ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM, FORT LEE, N.J.

"RICHMOND, Va. — It was the electoral nightmare Virginia never wanted to experience: being host to a high-profile mess like the 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, with officials obsessing over questionable ballots as political power hangs in the balance. So 17 years ago, the state began writing a guidebook on how to handle such situations. The latest edition includes pictographs of ballots marked in unconventional ways — names crossed out, several boxes checked, “My guy” scrawled over a candidate’s name. Despite the best intentions to avoid a Florida-style snafu, that is where Virginia now finds itself, with lawyers fighting over how to interpret one questionable ballot. And at stake is possible control of the Legislature. “This is right up there with Bush v. Gore in my opinion in terms of the unbelievable sequence of events that have led us to where we are,” said Rebecca Green, co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary School of Law in Williamsburg. Professor Green called the Virginia predicament “the son of hanging chad,” a reference to Florida’s failed punch-card ballots from 2000. The Supreme Court stopped the recounting of contested ballots, declaring George W. Bush the next White House occupant. On Tuesday, a court filing halted a previously scheduled name-drawing from a silver pitcher to break a tie between David Yancy, a Republican, and Shelly Simonds, a Democrat, in House District 94.

"KABUL, Afghanistan — At least 41 people were killed and dozens more wounded on Thursday in a bombing at a Shiite cultural center in Kabul that also houses a news agency, Afghan officials said. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack. It was the latest in a series of mass-casualty attacks against Shiite targets by the militant group’s Afghan affiliate. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan has documented more than a dozen attacks since January 2016, with hundreds of Shiites dead or wounded. One of the deadliest was in October, when suicide bombers killed at least 57 worshipers in a Shiite mosque in Kabul, the capital, and injured dozens more. “I have little doubt that this attack deliberately targeted civilians,” said Toby Lanzer, the acting head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan. “Today in Kabul we have witnessed another truly despicable crime in a year already marked by unspeakable atrocities.” In the assault on Thursday, one suicide bomber entered the Tebyan cultural center during a group discussion for the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and then detonated his explosive vest, said Sadiq Muradi, Kabul’s deputy police chief. Two improvised explosive devices placed nearby went off shortly after that, officials said. Wahidullah Majrooh, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry, said at least 41 people were killed and 84 wounded in the attack. Workers at the Istiqlal hospital appeared overwhelmed by the number of victims, some of them lying in the corridors. Many were being treated for severe burns.

"WINDFALL
How the New Energy Abundance Upends Global Politics and Strengthens American Power
By Meghan L. O’Sullivan
479 pp. Simon & Schuster. $29. Geopolitics is power played out against geographical settings. In this battle, ideas and ideologies matter. But it is often the most technical and complex factors — the ones we least understand and therefore discount, according to Columbia University’s Robert Jervis — that carry the greatest weight. There may be no factor more influential in contemporary geopolitics and yet least understood by journalists and policymakers than the energy revolution, which is less about renewables like wind and solar power than about how the oil and gas sector itself is changing. A Harvard professor and former assistant to President George W. Bush, Meghan L. O’Sullivan, has dissected the intricacies of this industry to offer a riveting and comprehensive geopolitical theory in “Windfall.” The decline in crude oil prices from $100 per barrel to around $60 and below over the past two years, along with the widespread ability to extract shale gas through hydraulic fracturing of rock, or fracking, has moved the United States from being “the world’s thirstiest consumer of overseas oil to a position of greater self-sufficiency,” O’Sullivan writes. Falling energy prices have also stabilized Europe’s economy, helped Japan manage the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, allowed China to more aggressively pursue its new Silk Road strategy across Eurasia (while reducing the pain of a decelerating economy), kept Russia from becoming an energy superpower and weakened the prospects for energy-rich sub-Saharan African countries. “On the whole,” the author says, “the new energy abundance is a boon to American power — and a bane to Russian brawn.” In fact, it was new extraction techniques in tight oil and shale gas that helped ease America out of the recession. But triumphalists beware. Though the United States is now the world’s largest energy producer, it can never be the swing producer of hydrocarbons that Saudi Arabia once was, able to determine world prices by simply deciding how much to pump. That is because the United States is not an autocracy with a national oil company, but a vast network of hundreds of small producers making their own decisions and taking their own risks. At the same time, the energy revolution has laid the basis for a more politically and economically unified North American continent. For this reason, O’Sullivan criticizes Barack Obama for alienating Canada with his delays of the Keystone XL pipeline and Donald Trump for alienating Mexico with his insults and talk of a “wall” between the two countries. O’Sullivan’s book lays out Trump’s ignorance of the whole United States-Mexico relationship. In 2015, the two countries traded “more than $1 million of goods and services every minute.” Rather than “simply trading in final products, the United States and Mexico build goods together, utilizing complex supply chains that crisscross the border,” a grid-work that includes 20 natural gas pipelines.

"THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE
Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner
By Daniel Ellsberg
420 pp. Bloomsbury. $30. Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un trading threats with words like “fire and fury”; Pakistan deploying tactical nuclear weapons to counter Indian conventional threats; Russia enunciating an Orwellian doctrine of “escalate-to-de-escalate” that calls for early use of battlefield nuclear weapons; and major nuclear-weapons states modernizing their arsenals — nukes are back. The cruel irony: This is happening after eight years of a president who won the Nobel Peace Prize largely for his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. When the Cold War ended in 1991, nuclear weapons vanished from the minds of most Americans. Together with the Soviet Union, they were supposedly consigned to the dustbin of history. But the emergence of 21st-century nuclear threats — including the fear that terrorist groups will obtain this ultimate W.M.D. — has revived discussion about these devices of destruction. Among professionals, this debate can be found in government documents like the Defense Department’s Nuclear Matters Handbook and journals like the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Popular books like Eric Schlosser’s “Command and Control” and David E. Hoffman’s “The Dead Hand” have exposed a wider audience to these topics. Daniel Ellsberg’s new memoir, “The Doomsday Machine,” is the latest in this genre. Its title reminds us of a Big Idea captured by the legendary strategist Herman Kahn in “On Thermonuclear War.” To illustrate the problem posed by nuclear arsenals that many embraced as the best way to prevent war and aggression, Kahn imagined a “doomsday machine.” This multimegaton nuclear weapon would be buried deep underground. When detonated, it would split the Earth, killing all inhabitants. But since an enemy would never believe that a rational leader would press the button to set off such a device, the weapon would be connected to a network of sensors. If these sensors detected a nuclear attack upon the United States, the machine would explode and the Earth would be destroyed. Since other states would know that any attack would be suicidal, they would assuredly be deterred. But what if the sensors malfunctioned? Could sane, responsible leaders bet the planet on weapons that could be activated by an accident, misperception or mistake? Of course not, Kahn explained, but the “mutually assured destruction” capabilities that emerged as a consequence of the United States-Soviet competition were becoming functionally equivalent to a doomsday machine. Ellsberg, best known for his role in leaking the Pentagon Papers, sounds an impassioned alarm about nuclear dangers and reminds us that the risks Kahn vivified still exist. Despite an 80 percent reduction since the Cold War, American and Russian nuclear arsenals still number in the thousands. Many remain on “hair trigger” alert, posing serious risks of an accidental launch. If all were used in a full-scale war, especially given the possibility of “nuclear winter,” life on Earth could be extinguished. There have been repeated close calls and near accidents, including as recently as 2007 when an American B-52, mistakenly armed with six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, flew across the United States. In sum, while the doomsday machine has not yet exploded, we may be living on borrowed time.

"Throughout 2017, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey seemed to go out of his way to thumb his nose at onetime friends and allies. Early this year, he described the Dutch government as “Nazi remnants,” accused German politicians of “Nazi practices” and called the entire European continent “racist, fascist and cruel.” Relations with the United States were not much better, as both countries tightened visa requirements in a crisis ignited by Turkey’s arrest of two of its citizens who worked for the State Department in Turkey. With just days left before the end of the year, however, Mr. Erdogan appears to have had a change of heart. On Thursday, his government announced an end to the visa dispute with the United States, with both the Turkish Embassy in Washington and the American Embassy in Ankara lifting visa restrictions.

"Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions retracted an Obama-era guidance to state courts that was meant to end debtors’ prisons, where people who are too poor to pay fines are sent. This practice is blatantly unconstitutional, and the guidance had helped jump-start reform around the country. Its withdrawal is the latest sign that the federal government is retreating from protecting civil rights for the most vulnerable among us. The Justice Department helped shine a light on the harms of fine and fees when it investigated Ferguson, Mo., three years ago after the killing of the teenager Michael Brown by a police officer. As one of the lawyers on that case, I saw firsthand the damage that the city had wrought on its black community. Ferguson used its criminal justice system as a for-profit enterprise, extracting millions from its poorest citizens. Internal emails revealed the head of finance directing policing strategy to maximize revenue rather than ensure public safety. Officers told us they were pressured to issue as many tickets as possible. Even the local judge was in on it, imposing penalties of $302 for jaywalking and $531 for allowing weeds to grow in one’s yard. He issued arrest warrants for residents who fell behind on payments — including a 67-year-old woman who had been fined for a trash-removal violation — without inquiring whether they even had the ability to pay the exorbitant amounts. The arrests resulted in new charges, more fees and the suspension of driver’s licenses. These burdens fell disproportionately on African-Americans. At the time of our investigation, over 16,000 people had outstanding arrest warrants from Ferguson, a city of 21,000. Untold numbers found themselves perpetually in debt to the city and periodically confined to its jail. These problems were not unique to Ferguson. A Georgia woman served eight months in custody past her sentence because she couldn’t pay a $705 fine. A veteran battling homelessness in Michigan lost his job when a judge jailed him for bringing only $25 rather than the required $50 first payment to court. A judge in Alabama told people too poor to pay that they could either give blood or go to jail.

"BEIJING — China said on Thursday that it would temporarily exempt foreign companies from paying tax on their earnings, a bid to keep American businesses from taking their profits out of China following Washington’s overhaul of the United States tax code. There is, however, a catch: To be eligible, foreign companies must invest those earnings in sectors encouraged by China’s government — including railways, mining, technology and agriculture — according to a statement from the Finance Ministry. The measure is retroactive from Jan. 1 this year, the ministry said. The move would “promote the growth of foreign investment, improve the quality of foreign investment and encourage overseas investors to continuously expand their investment in China,” the ministry said. It did not elaborate. Despite its appeal as a manufacturing hub, one where companies from around the world have set up operations to tap into a highly skilled work force and strong infrastructure, China charges high taxes. On top of a standard corporate rate of 25 percent, companies are required to make social security contributions and other payments that push their tax burden higher than it is in many other countries. The newly approved tax incentives in the United States could appeal to companies that are frustrated by China’s rising labor costs, ambitious local competitors and tangled legal systems, or those that would rather spend their money at home or elsewhere. And officials in Beijing have worried that the overhaul could prove to be a challenge to Chinese laws that aim to keep money from leaving the country’s borders. While Thursday’s announcement did not explicitly refer to the tax overhaul in the United States, analysts have said that it is almost certain that the policy was in response to it. This month, China’s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, pledged to “take proactive measures” in response to the overhaul, according to Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency. He noted that the impact of the changes overseas “cannot be overlooked.” ",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/tax-bill-china.html?searchResultPosition=22
"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama officials on Thursday unhesitatingly pushed aside a legal challenge from Roy S. Moore and certified Doug Jones as the winner of this month’s Senate election. The action, during a brief meeting at the State Capitol, was essentially the state’s final step before the seating of the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Alabama in a quarter century. It was also a swift rejection, by some of the state’s most powerful Republicans, of Mr. Moore’s complaint that he was the victim of “systematic voter fraud.” Mr. Jones’s margin of victory was 21,924 votes, with more than 1.3 million ballots cast. The certification leaves Mr. Moore, 70, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court whose campaign faltered partly because of allegations of sexual misconduct against teenage girls, with almost no avenues to derail Mr. Jones’s ascension to the Senate. The election aftermath followed a familiar pattern for Mr. Moore, who in the past has been eager to declare victories and pronounce grievances — but unwilling to concede defeats. To this day, Republicans note, Mr. Moore has not conceded his losses in the 2006 or 2010 Republican primaries for governor, and there is already speculation in Montgomery that he might run for governor or attorney general next year. “You win with class, you lose with class, and he just can’t do it,” Angi Horn Stalnaker, a Republican strategist who ran campaigns, with mixed success, against Mr. Moore, said acidly.

"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking a day after an explosion in St. Petersburg, said on Thursday that he had ordered security agents to “take no prisoners” during terrorist attacks, and authorized the police to “liquidate the bandits on the spot.” Mr. Putin has long burnished his image as tough on terrorism, and the comments were noteworthy not so much for signifying a change in policy — Russian counterterrorism forces have shot and killed dozens of terrorism suspects over the years — as for displaying the antiterrorism swagger he was known for early in his tenure. He is now running for  a fourth term as president, and analysts expected the campaign to focus on his decision to annex Crimea from Ukraine, a move that has been popular in Russia. The election is scheduled for March 18, the fourth anniversary of the annexation. But a series of attacks and thwarted plots have recently brought terrorism back into the limelight. Mr. Putin’s comments came a day after a bomb exploded in a grocery store in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, wounding about a dozen people. And earlier this month, Mr. Putin thanked President Trump after the Central Intelligence Agency passed to Russian security services information about an Islamic State plot to detonate bombs in a cathedral and other sites, also in St. Petersburg. At first, the police did not refer to the grocery store explosion as terrorism, but Mr. Putin said on Thursday that it was, in fact, a terrorist attack. The explosive device had a power equivalent to about 200 grams, or seven ounces, of TNT, the Russian authorities said, and it was laced with bolts to act as shrapnel. A man the authorities described as having a non-Slavic appearance had placed a backpack containing the bomb in a locker at the supermarket, then fled.
