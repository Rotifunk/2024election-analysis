"Ali Watkins, the New York Times reporter whose email and phone records were secretly seized by the Trump administration, will be transferred out of the newspaper’s Washington bureau and reassigned to a new beat in New York, The Times said on Tuesday. Ms. Watkins, 26, had been the subject of an internal review by The Times after revelations that she had a three-year affair with a high-ranking aide on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she covered for several news organizations before joining The Times in December. The aide, James Wolfe, 57, who handled classified material for the committee, was arrested last month as part of a leak investigation in which the Justice Department also seized Ms. Watkins’s communications, an unusually aggressive move against a journalist that prompted an outcry from press advocates. Mr. Wolfe was charged with lying to the F.B.I. but not with leaking classified information; he has pleaded not guilty. [Read more about how Ms. Watkins’s relationship with Mr. Wolfe rattled the world of Washington journalists.] Ms. Watkins, who had been covering federal law enforcement at The Times, will be assigned a mentor and moved to a new beat in New York “for a fresh start,” the paper’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, wrote in a memo to the newsroom. “We hold our journalists and their work to the highest standards,” Mr. Baquet wrote. “We are giving Ali an opportunity to show that she can live up to them. I believe she can.” He added: “I also believe that The Times must be a humane place that can allow for second chances when there are mitigating circumstances.” "
      
        
      
      
      
"LANCASTER, Pa. — Last week I wrote about why political parties across the industrial world are fracturing from the top down. Today I’m writing about the political units that are working. On this Fourth of July, if you want to be an optimist about America, stand on your head. The country looks so much better from the bottom up. I know — the current cliché is that we’re a country divided by two coasts, two coasts that are supposedly diversifying, pluralizing, modernizing and globalizing, while in flyover America everyone is high on opioids, cheering for President Trump and waiting for 1950 to return. That’s totally wrong. Our country is actually a checkerboard of cities and communities — some that are forming what I call “complex adaptive coalitions” and are thriving from the bottom up, and others that can’t build such adaptive coalitions and are rapidly deteriorating. You can find both on the coasts and both in the interior — and you can find both in just one little corner of south-central Pennsylvania. I was invited in April to give a paid book talk here in Lancaster, and I was so blown away by the societal innovation the town’s leaders had employed to rebuild their once-struggling city and county that I decided to return with my reporter’s notebook and interview them. My original host was the Hourglass, a foundation founded by community leaders in Lancaster County in 1997, when the city of Lancaster was a crime-ridden ghost town at night where people were afraid to venture and when the county’s dominant industrial employer, Armstrong World Industries, was withering. Some of the leading citizens decided that “time was running out” — hence “Hourglass” — and that no cavalry was coming to save them — not from the state’s capital or the nation’s capital. They realized that the only way they could replace Armstrong and re-energize the downtown was not with another dominant company, but by throwing partisan politics out the window and forming a complex adaptive coalition in which business leaders, educators, philanthropists, social innovators and the local government would work together to unleash entrepreneurship and forge whatever compromises were necessary to fix the city.

"WASHINGTON — The string of insults, misstatements, exaggerations and outright falsehoods emanating from the White House began just after sunrise. In the space of a few hours, President Trump on Tuesday took credit for averting a war with North Korea, charged without proof that President Barack Obama had secretly granted citizenship to thousands of Iranians as part of nuclear disarmament negotiations and appeared to suggest that customers of the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson were psychic. He called a sitting congresswoman “crazy” and “corrupt.” He branded the National Security Agency’s handling of millions of telephone call records “a disgrace” — and suggested it was connected to the special counsel investigation into whether his campaign worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 elections. “Witch Hunt!” he wrote at the end of that tweet. The posts on Twitter spanned a range of foreign and domestic issues, and seemed to hew to two clear themes: Attacks on Mr. Trump’s perceived rivals, and trumpeting of what he considers his proudest achievements in the face of public criticism. This is partly true. “Many good conversations with North Korea — it is going well!” Mr. Trump tweeted, one day after a series of reports that the North is chugging forward with nuclear testing, despite its “denuclearization” pledge. “In the meantime no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining.” Then, with Trumpian flair, he added: “If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!” Mr. Trump is at least partly right: There have been no missile or nuclear tests since November, a “freeze” that many, including some Democrats, said was a necessary first step toward removing North Korea’s nuclear weapons.

"WASHINGTON — Over the past several weeks, protesters, Democratic lawmakers and candidates, and even some federal agents have demanded an end to the government agency known as ICE, railing against President Trump’s immigration policies, which have produced heart-wrenching images of migrants being stopped at the southwestern border. But the campaign against ICE may be conflating an alphabet soup of government agencies and their various roles in immigration enforcement. ICE, for example, was not separating migrant families illegally entering the United States from Mexico. Here’s an explanation of what it is doing. ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was created in 2003, as a part of the government’s reorganization after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ICE is one of three agencies that absorbed and assumed the functions of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (which was previously housed under the Justice Department) and the United States Customs Service (which was part of the Treasury Department). The other two Homeland Security agencies that took some of those responsibilities are Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Citizenship Services. No. That’s Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency for the Border Patrol, which is responsible for patrolling, monitoring and securing the United States’ borders with Mexico and Canada.

Each time I think I have hit the nail on the head, the nail slips to one side and the hammer blow falls on my fingers. Like many others, both conservative and liberal, I did not foresee the political career of Donald Trump, nor did I imagine that such a man could occupy the highest office of state, in the name of a party that specifically makes appeal to conservative voters.

"President Trump boasted Tuesday on Twitter about his ability to write. Specifically, he defended his seemingly random use of capitalization. His method? He said he uppercases certain words for “emphasis” — not because they should, in fact, be capitalized. (His tweet, which was later deleted and reposted, also used an incorrect homophone — “pour” instead of “pore” — and contained a dangling modifier. But that’s a story for another day.) Mr. Trump’s distinctive philosophy of capitalization has brought us Witch Hunt and Fake News, a big-B Border and Crime with a capital C. But what are the actual rules of capitalization?

"THURSDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, I know you’re frustrated. Well, some of you are. Other people probably solved this puzzle as if it were nothing, and bully for them, I say. But some of us need more help than that. I tumbled to the fact that there was a trick to this theme fairly quickly, mostly because of the cursing. When one particular trick is present in a puzzle, you’ll know it because you’ll find yourself not being able to fill in many entries, hence the cursing. The trick is revealed in the Theme section below. Randolph Ross is back, and he offers us a respite from the peace and fun of a midweek day off from work, instead getting us thinking about the alleged inner workings of our government agencies.  And why not? How much fun, relaxation and not having to think about the goings-on in the world can one person take? 26A: “Wee wee?” is another way of saying “A smaller version of something small,” and the answer is the contraction LI’L. And yes, I know what the clue looks like it implies. Don’t laugh. This is my job. 30A: Usually when you see a clue like “Ain’t right?,” the puzzle is looking for a correction to the grammar (or, AIN’T the “right” way), so the answer would be ISN’T.  Today, the answer is ARE. 46A: Wordplay alert! “Chest thumper, for short?” could be an abbreviation for a braggart, but how would you do that? Instead, think about another kind of chest thumper: an emergency medical worker, or E.M.T. 58A: Bucks could be slang for money, but today “A couple of bucks?” is DEER. 61A: No, the puzzle isn’t calling you names. “Big jerk” is a funny clue for giving something a YANK. Mr. Ross goes undercover with four government agencies hidden in the puzzle as rebus elements. The rebus is the part that might be frustrating for some people, so I will repost “Yes, You Can Write More Than One Letter in a Square,” which explains what a rebus is, as well as how to enter one in the puzzle on the web and on your devices. For example, at 27A, “Outlet for the Loire” is BAY OF BISCAY, but because we have only nine squares for the answer, we squoosh F.B.I. into one square, so that the entry reads BAYO[FBI]BISCAY.  At the same time, the crossing, 4D’s DATE OF BIRTH should be written in as DATEO[FBI]IRTH. The revealer is at 40D, clued as “What the four undercover orgs. in this puzzle might do,” and the answer, according to Mr. Ross, is WIRE TAP. This is a reminder that Mr. Ross’ notes are the opinion of one person, and to let you know that the puzzle was approved without knowing the genesis of the theme. For that reason, I ask readers to keep comments civil and about the puzzle. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.

"Many Americans were shocked last week when Attorney General Jeff Sessions turned to the Bible — specifically, Paul’s epistle to the Romans — to justify President Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents. This scriptural justification for a political decision should not have surprised anyone, because Mr. Trump’s administration has consistently treated the separation of church and state as a form of heresy rather than a cherished American value. Attacks on the wall of separation established by the founders — which the religious right likes to call “a lie of the left” — are nothing new. What has changed under Mr. Trump is the disproportionate political debt he owes to extreme religious conservatives, whose views on church-state issues — ranging from the importance of secular public education to women’s and gay rights — are far removed from the American mainstream. The very meaning of the phrases “religious liberty” and “religious freedom”— traditionally understood as referring to the right of Americans to practice whatever faith they wish or no faith at all — is being altered to mean that government should foster a closer relationship with those who want to mix their Christian faith with taxpayer dollars. This usage can be found in numerous executive orders and speeches by Mr. Trump and his cabinet members. Changes in language have consequences, as the religious right’s successful substitution of “pro-life” for “anti-abortion” has long demonstrated. Religion-related issues, especially if buried in lengthy government documents, can often seem obscure, but they dominated the news at the end of June, when the Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump’s travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries and struck down a California requirement that anti-abortion, state-licensed pregnancy clinics provide notice to their clients that abortion is an option. These significant rulings were immediately overshadowed by the retirement from the court of the frequent swing voter Anthony M. Kennedy, which now gives Mr. Trump the opportunity to nominate a predictable religious conservative who would most likely support the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While it is impossible to overstate the long-term importance of the next court appointment, Mr. Sessions and many of his fellow cabinet members offer textbook examples of the everyday perils of entangling religion with politics. Mr. Sessions’s citation of the opening verse of Romans 13, which declares that every soul must be “subject to the governing authorities” and that there is “no authority except that which God has established,” inflamed an already bitter debate over immigration.

"Want the latest climate and environment news in your inbox? Sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON — Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and architect of President Trump’s aggressive effort to rewrite the government’s rule book on environmental regulations, resigned on Thursday in the face of numerous ethics investigations that doomed his tenure. Despite Mr. Pruitt’s efforts to nurture a close relationship with the president, Mr. Trump himself announced the resignation in a tweet sent from Air Force One. He thanked Mr. Pruitt for an “outstanding job” and said the agency’s deputy, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, would take over as the acting administrator on Monday. Mr. Pruitt in his resignation letter cited “unrelenting attacks on me personally” as one of the reasons for his departure. Mr. Pruitt had been hailed by conservatives for his zealous deregulation, but he could not overcome a spate of questions about his alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and cozy relationships with lobbyists. Mr. Pruitt also came under fire for enlisting aides to obtain special favors for him and his family, such as reaching out to the chief executive of Chick-fil-A, Dan T. Cathy, with the intent of helping Mr. Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn, open a franchise of the restaurant. The resignation appeared to happen quickly. On Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt attended two Fourth of July parties, one at the White House and another at the Interior Department. One attendee who spent time with him said he spent the night mingling, shaking hands, watching the fireworks and showing no indication that he planned to step down. His chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, also gave no hint of what was ahead. An individual close to Mr. Pruitt said the president acted after he found one particular story in recent days embarrassing: a report that Mr. Pruitt had asked Mr. Trump to fire Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, so that Mr. Pruitt could run the Justice Department. The idea had been discussed privately for months by the president, who occasionally asked advisers if it was a good idea, according to two people familiar with the discussions. But seeing those deliberations being aired publicly, amid a string of other damaging reports, focused Mr. Trump’s attention, a person close to the president said. Fresh allegations that Mr. Pruitt had retroactively altered his public schedule, potentially committing a federal crime, had also escalated concerns about him at the White House, according to a White House aide. On Thursday afternoon, around 1:30, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, reached out to Mr. Pruitt to tell him the time had come. Mr. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who built his career on lawsuits against the agency he would eventually lead, remained a favorite of Mr. Trump’s for the majority of his tenure at the E.P.A. He began the largest regulatory rollback in the agency’s history, undoing, delaying or blocking several Obama-era environmental rules. Among them was a suite of historic regulations aimed at mitigating global warming pollution from the United States’ vehicles and power plants. [Mr. Wheeler shares Mr. Pruitt’s zeal to dismantle climate change regulations. Read more here.] Mr. Pruitt also played a lead role in urging Mr. Trump to follow through on his campaign pledge to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, despite warnings from some of the president’s other senior advisers that the move could damage the United States’ credibility in foreign policy. Under the landmark accord, nearly every country had committed to reducing emissions of planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. In 2017, Mr. Pruitt made headlines for  questioning the established science of human-caused climate change, contradicting decades of research by scientific institutions, including his own agency. Although Mr. Pruitt was harshly criticized for the remarks, they did not affect his good standing with a president who has also mocked climate science. Mr. Trump has repeatedly told associates that Mr. Pruitt has done what he has wanted in terms of cutting regulations, so he has been reluctant to let him go. Mr. Pruitt, for his part, had made himself available to the president as a confidant. He ingratiated himself in part by offering himself as a sounding board on topics ranging from the North American Free Trade Agreement to to the Russia investigation, and he would join in as the president criticized the attorney general, Mr. Sessions. He often lunched at the White House mess in hopes of running into the president. But White House advisers, including Mr. Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, for months have implored Mr. Trump to get rid of Mr. Pruitt. Ultimately, the president grew disillusioned with Mr. Pruitt after the accusations of impropriety and ethical missteps overshadowed Mr. Pruitt’s policy achievements. In recent days, people who have spoken with Mr. Trump said he sounded exasperated with his E.P.A. administrator’s negative headlines. “It’s one thing after another with this guy,” one person close to Mr. Trump quoted the president as saying. Mr. Pruitt is the subject of at least 13 federal investigations, and a government watchdog agency concluded that he had broken the law with his purchase of a $43,000 secure telephone booth. He was also under investigation for his 2017 lease of a bedroom in a condominium linked to a Canadian energy company’s powerful Washington lobbying firm, and for accusations that he demoted or sidelined E.P.A. employees who questioned his actions. The former E.P.A. administrator had come under criticism for lavish expenditures on foreign travel, including a trip arranged for him by a lobbyist to Morocco, a country where the E.P.A. has no policy agenda. His domestic travel also came under fire after a former staff member told congressional investigators that his boss often sought to travel to Oklahoma, where Mr. Pruitt owns a home, directing his employees to “find me something to do” there so he could justify charging taxpayers for the expense. A New York Times report earlier this year detailed Mr. Pruitt’s lavish spending and questionable practices in his home state. O n Thursday The Times reported on new questions about whether aides to Mr. Pruitt had deleted sensitive information about his meetings from his public schedule, potentially in violation of the law. While Democrats have criticized Mr. Pruitt since his nomination, in recent months even conservative Republicans had taken the unusual step of criticizing and questioning his ethics. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has started an investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s actions at the E.P.A., the first such Republican-led inquiry into a Trump administration cabinet member. Joni Ernst and Charles E. Grassley, two Republican senators from Iowa, a farm state with a solid bank of Trump voters, have both publicly criticized Mr. Pruitt. Last month, the conservative National Review, which once championed his appointment, called on Mr. Pruitt to resign. On Tuesday, Laura Ingraham, the conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “Pruitt is the swamp. Drain it.” On May 2, Mr. Gowdy’s staff began conducting transcribed, behind-closed-doors interviews with Mr. Pruitt’s closest aides. Partial transcripts from one of those interviews revealed that Mr. Pruitt used one of his top aides last year essentially as a personal assistant, having her help him search for an apartment as well as try to procure a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel. In addition, Mr. Pruitt faced irritation from the White House after The Atlantic magazine reported that Mr. Pruitt’s office gave raises to two aides, even though the White House had declined to approve the raises. The E.P.A. has denied any wrongdoing on Mr. Pruitt’s behalf. As the scandals mounted through the spring, Mr. Pruitt was called to testify before several House and Senate committees. Although they were routine budget hearings, they ended up serving as forums for lawmakers to interrogate Mr. Pruitt about his management practices. Mr. Pruitt, who is deeply religious, spent considerable time in the days before the hearings in prayer, according to a person close to him. He got through the hearings battered but intact, after deflecting blame for numerous issues onto his staff, particularly his chief of staff, Mr. Jackson, whom he blamed for making controversial decisions such as the illegal purchase of the $43,000 secure telephone booth. But the tactic of blaming his employees cost him loyalty. In recent months, nearly a dozen political appointees have quit or been fired from the E.P.A. More recently, many of those staffers have been called to testify to investigators on the House Oversight Committee, which had launched a probe into Mr. Pruitt’s expenditures. The results of that investigation were expected to be the subject of a Senate hearing next month. Inside the E.P.A. on Thursday, as news of Mr. Pruitt’s departure spread, some career employees said that the mood was jubilant but quiet given that many people were out of the office around the July 4 holiday. Some employees met for early drinks at Mackey’s Public House, a bar near the E.P.A. It remains unclear how well some aspects of Mr. Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda, and his effort to undo the environmental work of his predecessors, will stand the test of time. In his haste to cripple government regulation and publicize his success, Mr. Pruitt and his officials have failed to follow important procedures, and courts have already struck down at least six of his rollback efforts. His removal will deal a blow to his political aspirations. People close to Mr. Pruitt have said that he had been using his prominence in the Trump administration to position himself for a run for state office in Oklahoma. His sights, some said, were set on a possible presidential run in 2024. Instead, Mr. Pruitt is now the latest in Mr. Trump’s purge of top administration officials.

"SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge in California on Thursday denied a request by the Trump administration to suspend California’s so-called sanctuary policies that limit cooperation between federal immigration authorities and state and local law enforcement. In a decision praised by opponents of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Judge John A. Mendez of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California ruled that the state’s decision not to assist in federal immigration enforcement was not an “obstacle.” “Standing aside does not equate to standing in the way,” the judge wrote in a 60-page ruling that was at times impassioned. Judge Mendez described the case as presenting “unique and novel” questions about the balance in the country between state and federal powers. “The Court must answer the complicated question of where the United States’ enumerated power over immigration ends and California’s reserved police power begins,” the judge said.

More than $2.5 trillion in deals were announced during the first half of the year, putting M.&.A. in 2018 on pace to surpass $5 trillion. That would be the largest yearly total on record. DealBook’s Stephen Grocer has some insights on those numbers, including: • Many of the biggest deals, particularly those in the media business, are bids to fend off competition from tech companies. • Cross-border deals totaled $1 trillion, despite trade tensions — though it could be too early for that rancor to have an effect. • The largest portion of deals are takeovers of American companies. There’s also a warning: Other recent peaks in merger activity have been followed by a recession. Potential trade wars, regulatory uncertainty and rising interest rates could mean this boom will end the same way. More M.&A. news: Deal makers’s paydays should be more closely tied to whether the transactions they put together work out in the long run, the FT’s John Gapper argues. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. President Trump and Congressional Republicans aren’t giving up on their attempts to take health insurance away from millions of Americans. Here’s a quick guide to their efforts: • A coalition of conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation and others, recently released a new repeal plan. It’s similar to last year’s Cassidy-Graham bill. It would reverse Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and end protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Various Trump administration officials — including Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services — claim the bill wouldn’t hurt people with pre-existing conditions, but those claims are simply untrue. At least 20 million people would likely lose coverage if the new Republican plan becomes law, estimate Aviva Aron-Dine and Matt Broaddus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The White House praised the plan, as Mary Ellen McIntire of CQ Now noted. If Republicans keep control of Congress in this year’s midterm election, they are likely to make a new run at passing a plan along these lines next year. Every single Republican health care plan drafted so far would deprive a large number of people of insurance coverage and raise costs for many others. The main point of the plans, in fact, is to reduce federal spending on health care — largely to reduce taxes on the affluent. Health care is very much on the ballot this year. • In the meantime, the Trump administration continues to take steps to weaken Obamacare through executive action. Its boldest attempt is its decision to stop defending the law against a lawsuit filed by some Republican state officials. That attempt seems unlikely to succeed in the long run, given that both conservative and liberal legal experts have criticized it, Aron-Dine told me. But if it did succeed, she added, it would be catastrophic. It would repeal much of the private-market part of the law, leaving only the Medicaid expansion fully in place. A second sabotage attempt is less ambitious — but more certain to do at least some damage. Last month, the Trump administration announced it would expand so-called short-term insurance plans, which aren’t subject to minimum coverage requirements. Some number of (currently) healthy people will sign up for these bare-bones plans, raising costs for everyone. And, of course, if those healthy people end up getting sick, they may regret having signed on. The administration will likely announce the details on these short-term plans in the coming weeks. The bottom line: The recent expansion of Medicaid in Virginia was a major piece of good news on health care. Thirty-three states have now expanded Medicaid as part of Obamacare, and other states, like Nebraska and Utah, may soon follow. But all of this progress is in danger if Republicans keep control of Congress. "
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) After a trip across the United States that included a stop at Skid Row in Los Angeles, a United Nations official remarked that “contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound.” Another U.N. official said after a visit, “You almost forget you are in Los Angeles.” The L.A. Times has called the explosion of homelessness in Los Angeles in recent years “a national disgrace,” and Mayor Eric Garcetti has said the issue is “the moral crisis of our time.” To give readers a visual understanding of what that looks like across the city, as extreme wealth and poverty collide in public spaces, including libraries, parks and beaches, we went on a tour across the county, and published this piece. In an age of growing economic inequality, the well-off have been able to seclude themselves away from the impoverished. But that has changed over the years in Los Angeles, as the growth in the homeless population has forced the rich and poor to interact more often. Rigo Veloso, who had been homeless in Malibu before moving into an apartment on a resident’s ranch, said that many people he encountered while living on the streets were friendly and compassionate, but many others, he said, “would judge you, and not treat you like a human being.” “It takes your dignity away,” he said. “I’ve been called a maggot.” Indeed, as local authorities grapple with how to spend millions of dollars on housing and other services for the homeless, community leaders are also trying to address the issue at the most basic human level, urging residents to say hello and make eye contact with those living on the streets. “If you talk to most homeless people they will say one of the hardest things is they felt invisible,” said John Maceri, executive director of The People Concern, a social services agency that helps homeless people. “It is dehumanizing. You don’t have to give money to say hello to people, to acknowledge them.” "
      
"In the Italian film “Life Is Beautiful,” a Jewish bookstore owner uses creative stunts to distract his child from the horrible reality of being held in a Nazi concentration camp. I was reminded of that movie recently as I found myself part of an eerily similar heartbreaking moment. As lawyers with the Texas Civil Rights Project, my team has been working around the clock to document hundreds of cases of children taken from their parents since the Trump administration started its “zero tolerance” immigration policy. Under that policy, the government charges every immigrant apprehended at the border with illegal entry, a misdemeanor offense — regardless of whether they’re fleeing violence and seeking asylum, or traveling with children. Before zero tolerance, immigration and Department of Justice officials exercised their discretion on whether to press criminal charges against some immigrants and asylum seekers, particularly those traveling with children and those with special circumstances. Each morning for the last three weeks, my colleagues and I have gone to the federal courthouse in McAllen, Tex., seven miles from the Mexican border. We arrive no later than 7:45, pass the metal detectors at the security check, and make sure to get to the eighth floor by 8. By that time, the courtroom is already nearly full. On a typical morning, some 70 to 80 men and women are brought to court and put in handcuffs with shackles around their ankles. A vast majority are first-time border crossers. A public defender asks the group whether any are traveling with children and have been separated from them. Struggling with the handcuffs, it’s not easy for them to raise their hands. Sometimes, to answer in the affirmative, they must stand up. The criminal proceeding begins at 9 a.m., and depending on how many separated parents are there each day, we have maybe five to seven minutes to speak with each parent beforehand. Hopefully, that’s enough to get the most basic information about them and the children taken from them — names, dates of birth, country of origin. They’re frightened and confused, and most don’t speak English. I tell them in Spanish that I’m a lawyer working on family separations and that I can try to help get their children back. "

"WASHINGTON — A trade war between the world’s two largest economies officially began on Friday morning as the Trump administration followed through with its threat to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese products, a significant escalation of a fight that could hurt companies and consumers in both the United States and China. The penalties, which went into effect at 12:01 a.m., prompted quick retaliation by Beijing, which said it immediately put its own similarly sized tariffs on American goods. Previously, the Chinese government had said it would tax pork, soybeans and automobiles, among other products China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that the United States “has launched the biggest trade war in economic history so far.” The escalation of the trade war from threat to reality is expected to ripple through global supply chains, raise costs for businesses and consumers and roil global stock markets, which have been volatile in anticipation of a prolonged trade fight between the United States and almost everyone else. On Thursday, President Trump showed no signs of backing down from his fight, saying aboard Air Force One that the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in goods would quickly be followed by levies on another $16 billion of Chinese products. And Mr. Trump continued to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods. For now, it is unclear how — or whether — the trade war might conclude. Mr. Trump’s threats have been met with vows from China to retaliate, a stalemate that will require one side to blink first in order to avoid a protracted fight. With no official talks scheduled between the two countries, and disagreements within the Trump administration about how best to proceed, a quick resolution seems increasingly unlikely.

"Jaroslaw Kaczynski is not a man to back down. His zealous vision of a “Fourth Republic” is an idealized Catholic Poland stripped of Communist remnants and Western social liberalism. And on his second try to achieve it, he will not be deterred — not by the European Union, not by protesters, and definitely not by the courts. That is what makes his current conflict with the Supreme Court so fateful, for Poland and for Europe. The courts are an especial bugaboo for Mr. Kaczynski. When Law and Justice, the party he founded with his identical twin, Lech Kaczynski, first held power between 2005 and 2007, the courts blocked parts of their nationalist agenda. After the party was defeated in parliamentary elections — and after his brother, then president, was killed in a plane crash in Russia (which he insists was Russia’s doing) — Jaroslaw Kaczynski honed his tactics and his zeal. He did not seek office when Law and Justice retook Parliament in 2015, pushing more acceptable candidates to the fore. But he is the real power behind the government and its assault on the courts, first seizing control of the Constitutional Court, which is supposed to ensure that laws do not violate the Constitution, and then going after the Supreme Court, the country’s highest court. The tactic was to lower the retirement age for judges to 65 and then to stack the high court with party loyalists. Tens of thousands of Poles, including Lech Walesa, went into the streets on Tuesday, chanting “Solidarnosc” as they once did against the Communists; the European Union, which has already formally threatened Poland with sanctions, including a suspension of its voting rights over its assault on judiciary independence, opened a new “infringement procedure” that could lead to a suit against Poland in the European Union Court of Justice.
