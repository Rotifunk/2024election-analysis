"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers sent Facebook a harsh message this  week over how Russian agents used the social network to spread division in the 2016 election. On Wednesday, Facebook’s top executives — including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg — spread a different message: one of profit. Around the time that Facebook wrapped up its attendance at hearings on Capitol Hill over Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election on Wednesday, the company reported another set of blockbuster financial results. Facebook said its revenue rose 47 percent to $10.3 billion in the third quarter from a year ago, with profit surging 79 percent to $4.7 billion, handily beating Wall Street expectations. The results showcased Facebook’s moneymaking strength in online advertising, which is precisely what the Silicon Valley company has been under fire for in Washington this week. Lawmakers questioned Facebook — as well as Google and Twitter — about how Russians may have misused online ads and other parts of their platforms to sow discord and inflame tensions in the American electorate. Some lawmakers were particularly irked by the no shows of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg at the hearings, as well as the lack of attendance by top executives from Google and Twitter. Facebook tapped Colin Stretch, its general counsel, to answer questions; Google and Twitter also sent their top lawyers. “I’m disappointed that you’re here, and not your C.E.O.s,” Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said during a hearing on Wednesday morning.

"To the Editor: Re “Mile-Long Manhattan Truck Attack Kills 8” (front page, Nov. 1): The carnage aimed for by a well-structured terror plan, painstakingly formulated to factor in method, timing and contingencies, can now be realized with breathtaking simplicity: possession of an ignition key. That and an utter disregard for the sanctity of human life are all that are needed to wreak havoc on the innocent. ROBERT WAGNER, NEW YORK To the Editor: Re “Trump Blames Schumer and Immigration Policies Hours After New York Terrorist Attack” (news article, nytimes.com, Nov. 1): I was born in Manhattan. I was in Manhattan when the towers fell. I was in Manhattan on Tuesday. I know the grit and goodness of New Yorkers. The day after the Las Vegas massacre, eager to avoid an honest discussion of this nation’s gun control policy, President Trump argued that it was not the time for politics. Yet not 24 hours after the horror in his hometown, Mr. Trump essentially blamed this attack on Senator Chuck Schumer, who supported the diversity visa program under which the suspect entered the United States from Uzbekistan. Now we know the president’s heart. A childhood in Queens and a career in Manhattan do not a New Yorker make. From behind double-paned glass, from the plush remove of a Fifth Avenue aerie, and from the gold-plated confines of his private plane, this president failed to pick up on what makes us us. We’re in this together. We look out for one another. This morning, I ache for a president who reflects those values. DAVID D. TURNER, NEW YORK To the Editor: None of President Trump’s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant policies would have prevented this tragedy: not the wall, not the travel ban, which did not include Uzbekistan, not extreme vetting. Instead, Mr. Trump is threatening to cut antiterrorism funds. "
"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers released scores of political ads on Wednesday purchased by Russian agents on Facebook and Twitter that showed the extent of the Kremlin’s attempts to polarize the American voting public on issues like race, police abuse and religion. Russia-linked actors created accounts with names like Blacktivists and Back the Badge aimed at voters concerned about police relations with their communities, and other accounts that called for secure borders that were aimed at immigration hard-liners. One account, Army of Jesus, published an illustration of an arm-wrestling match between Christ and the devil. “Satan: If I win, Clinton wins!” the headline read. The sampling of ads, some of which had been made public earlier, came during a second day of hearings with the top lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google and were intended to show the executives how pervasively Russia used their platforms to further its campaign of misinformation. Lawmakers of both parties expressed frustration with answers that fell short of what they had hoped and insisted that the companies, long the darlings of American technology, do better. “I must say, I don’t think you get it,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at the first hearing a day earlier. “I went home last night with profound disappointment. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.” Facebook, Google and Twitter said their general counsels were best equipped to dive into policy and legal questions. But counsels’ appearances on Capitol Hill also allowed the companies’ chief executives to escape high-profile scrutiny. “I’m disappointed that you’re here, and not your C.E.O.s,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine.

"They made for a wildly varied slide show, designed by Russia to exploit divisions in American society and to tip the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald J. Trump and against Hillary Clinton. The House Intelligence Committee provided on Wednesday the biggest public platform to date for a sample of the Facebook ads and pages that were linked by a trail of ruble payments to a Russian company with Kremlin ties. “America, we have a problem,” said Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who sits on the House committee. “We basically have the brightest minds of our tech community here and Russia was able to weaponize your platforms to divide us, to dupe us and to discredit democracy.” Among the ads the committee made public at Wednesday’s hearing were a Bernie Sanders superhero promoting gay rights ... ... and a shot of Mr. Trump giving a thumbs up and promoting rallies in Florida. An image of Jesus arm-wrestling Satan (who, the ad said, was backing Mrs. Clinton) ... ... and an endorsement of the Black Panthers as fighters against the Ku Klux Klan. There was a Confederate flag and a call for the South to rise again ... ... and a yellow “No Invaders Allowed” sign posted at the United States border. While many descriptions of Russia’s stealth influence campaign have stressed the focus on issues rather than candidates, many of the Facebook posts did both, often attacking Mrs. Clinton (sometimes via Mr. Sanders): But at least one ad attacked Mr. Trump: And although some of the Facebook pages fell on the liberal or multicultural side of the political divide, with names like Woke Blacks ... ... most leaned strongly to the right, including Back the Badge... ... and Stop All Invaders. In some cases, the Russian groups took opposite stands on painful issues, such as police shootings of black people. A page called Don’t Shoot took aim at police brutality... ... while Being Patriotic suggested that Black Lives Matter activists were killing police officers. While the ads being made public by Congress were just a sampling of the large Russian influence operation, independent researchers in recent weeks have identified and made public a far greater volume of such pages. Facebook, Twitter and other platforms have shut down the suspect accounts, but it is still possible to retrieve many of the posts and images because they were widely shared across the internet. Perhaps the biggest collection, put together by two American researchers who asked not to be identified to avoid online harassment, is posted at a page on Medium. The researchers based their searches largely on the pages and accounts named in a Russian media account based on interviews with former employees of the Russian company with Kremlin ties, the Internet Research Agency, accused of much of the fakery.

"The terrorist attack in New York quickly turned into a debate over immigration policy after President  Trump revealed Wednesday that Sayfullo Saipov, the man accused of killing eight people, had benefited from an obscure program known as the diversity visa lottery. Mr. Trump’s comment — and his attack on Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who was instrumental in creating the program in 1990 — threw a spotlight on the lottery, a small part of the overall immigration system that nonetheless has been criticized by members of both parties. Mr. Schumer, in fact, was among senators proposing to end it several years ago. The lottery offers one of the fastest paths to legal permanent residency, often in less than two years. Some one million people have been awarded green cards through the program. Unlike other immigrants who gain admission, winners of the lottery do not need to have a close relative living in the United States, or any special skill. It is indeed a little like hitting a lottery. Some years, the program has attracted nearly 15 million applications, but no more than 50,000 visas may be awarded. During the monthlong application period each fall, which is currently in full swing, the lottery creates a craze in countries where it is regarded as a ticket out of poverty and to the American dream.

ustralia’s absolute refusal to resettle migrants who approach the country by boat sets it apart worldwide, and debate over that policy flared yet again this week as the government tried to shutter its Manus Island detention center even as more than 600 asylum seekers refused to relocate. The men, refugees from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries, said they had no food, no electricity and barely any water, but because they feared they would be attacked anywhere else on the island, they plan to hold out as long as they can. “If we have to move it will be against our will,” Imran Mohmammad, 23, a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar, told me in an interview. It’s still not clear how the standoff will end (and we’ll do our best to keep covering it) but as I read and watched the news reports here in Australia, I started to think about how disconnected the discussion in Australia has become from the larger global context. The migrants on Manus are but a ripple in a much wider sea. All over the globe, displacement is spreading, migration is increasing and dozens of countries are grappling with changing ideas of national identity. "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s bipartisan commission on the opioid crisis made dozens of final recommendations on Wednesday to combat a deadly addiction epidemic, ranging from creating more drug courts to vastly expanding access to medications that treat addiction, including in jails. The commissioners did not specify how much money should be spent to carry out their suggestions, but they pressed Congress to “appropriate sufficient funds” in response to Mr. Trump’s declaration last week of a public health emergency. The 56 recommendations — which covered opioid prescribing practices, prevention, treatment, law enforcement tactics and funding mechanisms — did not so much advocate a new approach as expanding strategies already being used. Reaction from treatment advocates was mixed, with many expressing frustration that the commission had not called for a specific level of funding. Chuck Ingoglia, a senior vice president at the National Council for Behavioral Health, which represents treatment providers, said that his group agreed with many of the recommendations, but that the report “starves the country for the real resources it needs to save American lives.” Although the commission did not put a dollar amount on its recommendations, it had specific ideas for how federal money should be funneled to states. Its top recommendation was to streamline “fragmented” federal funds for addiction prevention and treatment into block grants that would require each state to file only a single application instead of seeking grants from dozens of programs scattered across various agencies. The commission also appealed to the Trump administration to track more carefully the huge array of interdiction, prevention and treatment programs it is funding and to make sure they are working. “We are operating blindly today,” its report said.

"Many Americans projected their own feelings of disgust as they watched the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, seem to grimace while President Trump spoke in August of the “very fine people” on both sides of white nationalist demonstrations to preserve Confederate monuments, in which a counterdemonstrator was murdered. It seemed to be an example of how Mr. Kelly, the man brought in as “the adult” to calm the White House chaos, felt pained when he could not prevent the president from saying or tweeting something divisive, hateful or threatening. At least there was hope that he would speak up, either publicly or privately. Well, Mr. Kelly has now begun to speak up, and, in doing so, has provided sickening clarification of what this presidency stands for. When asked in an interview broadcast on Monday about plans by a Virginia church to remove plaques honoring George Washington and Robert E. Lee, he said it showed “a lack of appreciation of history.” “Robert E. Lee was an honorable man,” he added. He said that in the Civil War “men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.” With those remarks, Mr. Kelly revealed that it’s he, like the president, who lacks an appreciation of history — that he has chosen instead to embrace the mythology that white racists methodically created to hide the truth about the causes and course of the Civil War. The truth is, white Southerners went to war to destroy the United States in order to continue enslaving nearly 40 percent of the people in the region. "
"We may shortly be facing a national crisis. President Trump’s base is egging him on to undertake his own “Saturday Night Massacre” and fire Robert Mueller for committing … for committing … uh, well, for working too hard as a prosecutor. On Fox News, the host Jeanine Pirro proposed firing Mueller, blaming the Democrats, and imprisoning Hillary Clinton. Speaking of the Mueller investigation, Pirro said, “It’s time to shut it down, turn the tables, and lock her up.” Wow. I’ve reported from tin-pot countries where public figures talk blithely of shutting down prosecutors and imprisoning rivals. I never thought I’d live in one. Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network denounced Mueller’s “gross overreach,” and the pro-Trump site Gateway Pundit excoriated “deep state crooked cop Robert Mueller.” Across the right wing, ideological snipers are taking potshots at Mueller, and even The Wall Street Journal has suggested in an editorial that Mueller resign. All this amounts to a perilous pirouette. After all, Mueller was last known to be a registered Republican and was appointed F.B.I. director by a Republican president, George W. Bush. Newt Gingrich reflected the G.O.P. consensus when he wrote in a May tweet: “Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.” Yet these days, Gingrich describes Mueller as an “out-of-control prosecutor” guilty of “grotesque abuse.” "
"President Trump said on Wednesday that he was considering sending the terrorism suspect in the truck attack in New York to the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, an unprecedented step that would raise novel legal questions and likely set off a protest by veteran national security law enforcement officials. Mr. Trump made his comments at the start of a cabinet meeting a day after an immigrant from Uzbekistan, Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a pickup truck along a crowded Manhattan bicycle path, prosecutors say, killing eight people. Mr. Saipov had expressed support for the Islamic State, the authorities said. Asked by reporters whether he would send the suspect to Guantánamo, Mr. Trump said, “I would certainly consider that.” He added: “Send him to Gitmo — I would certainly consider that, yes.” The government last sent a detainee to Guantánamo in 2008, and it has never transferred someone arrested on American soil there. During the Bush administration, two terrorism suspects who were arrested inside the United States and initially charged in civilian court were transferred to military custody, but the Supreme Court has never resolved whether that was lawful. President Barack Obama refused to use the military to handle terrorism suspects who were arrested on domestic soil. But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would be “fine” with sending Americans to Guantánamo for military prosecution. The case of Mr. Saipov, a lawful permanent resident, presents a test of how Mr. Trump will handle such a situation now that he has the power and responsibility of governing. Doing so would infuriate career national security professionals and disrupt a carefully-honed approach to handling terrorism suspects, said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former Justice Department attorney. That includes the F.B.I.’s policy of delaying terror suspects’ Miranda warning rights to remain silent and have a defense lawyer during initial interrogations, he said. "
"Everybody’s talking about taxes this week. Big Republican bill is coming out of the oven. Attention must be paid. Feel free to ask questions. Is it true that Donald Trump Jr. stole his kid’s Halloween candy? Don Jr. tweeted that he was going to take half of his daughter Chloe’s candy and give it to “some kid who sat at home. It’s never to early to teach her about socialism.” The most important thing about that tweet is that Junior misspelled “too.” His dad does that a lot. However, he also seemed to be talking about redistribution of wealth, so I guess it’s fair game for a tax conversation. Except that this is not the right moment to pick on Junior. His mother, Ivana, published a memoir recently that makes it clear this guy had one of the worst childhoods this side of Oliver Twist. His father didn’t want him named Donald Jr. in case he turned into a “loser.” He had to call Ivana in Florida to report he’d found his nanny unconscious in the basement. While he was in school, his father was having a torrid affair that was headlined in the tabloids every single day. So leave Donald Jr. alone. He had a weird upbringing. And maybe 20 years from now, we’ll offer the same sort of amnesty to Chloe. Meantime, about the taxes … Does Donald Trump think tax cuts will be his big first-year moment? For a president, every day is a new challenge to rise to the occasion. If, for instance, a terrorist assault hits an American city, he will want to quickly bring the people together by attacking the city’s U.S. senator and claiming the nation’s system of justice is “a joke.” So while taxes are of course a big presidential priority, it isn’t everything. Whoa, you’re sounding a little bitter there. "
"NEW BRITAIN, Conn. — While Paul Manafort, St. Thomas Aquinas High School class of 1967, was becoming a power-suited political consultant and lobbyist in Washington and around the world, his old Catholic school was bleeding students. Eventually, almost two decades ago, the red brick shell of the school on this scuffed postindustrial city’s east side was abandoned. Adorned only with a few graffiti scrawls and a sign advertising long-discontinued games of Sunday evening bingo, it sat empty until it was sold to a developer last year for $80,000. But it acquired a certain interest for a wider audience than the local graffiti artists when Mr. Manafort was indicted on charges that he had laundered more than $18 million through overseas shell companies during a decades-long career as a lobbyist. For years, it seemed as if the fortunes of Mr. Manafort and New Britain — once famous as the Hardware City, home to corporations like Stanley Tools; now best known in some quarters as the residence of Daym Drops, a prominent YouTube food reviewer — were on permanently divergent paths. Search for New Britain on Google, and “the first name that comes up is Paul Manafort,” said Ed McKeon, a filmmaker who grew up in New Britain and now lives nearby in Middletown. “It’s kind of depressing, you know.” “We didn’t have anything to do with it,” protested John Whalen, a New Britain resident who works at an aerospace company.

"THURSDAY PUZZLE — Running is an extremely dangerous sport, primarily because it takes place outdoors and involves leaving the safety and comfort of my couch. And yet I do it. Well, what I do could better be described as “loping,” and only by people a lot more optimistic than me. But I am determined to be a runner, despite the dangers and despite the fact that I wheeze even more than I do when I go curling. Running is addictive and it’s supposedly good for you, providing you only do it to the point where you remain clinically not dead. This is frankly why I’m so worried about Peter Sagal. On Sunday, November 5, Mr. Sagal (whose day job is host of NPR’s “Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me”) will be running in the New York Marathon — a proper marathon, the full 26.2 miles, not some poncey run like I do — to which I say “Best of luck” and “Swift running to you,” not to mention “Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ...” That is an absurdly hard thing to put one’s body through, and this particular marathon has runners putting their bodies through it in all five boroughs of New York City, if they run the whole thing. My point is, Mr. Sagal is a brave man for at least two reasons: He is laying his life on the line to run in the New York Marathon, he is doing it as a guide for a blind runner (see his notes below), and he has constructed his first crossword, in collaboration with game designer and constructor Mike Selinker. This is a lovely Thursday offering and I learned more about the marathon that I may never run today, so thanks for that, Mr. Sagal and Mr. Selinker. The theme stayed very cleverly hidden until the end for me, and I can’t ask for more than that. Except for maybe some hydration gel. I spoke with Mr. Sagal and Mr. Selinker about their puzzle, about the marathon, and why you should never listen to anything Mr. Sagal says during a race. "
"Barely two hours after the deadly truck attack struck Lower Manhattan on Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio convened a news conference at Police Headquarters, where police and elected officials were to address the cameras that rolled for viewers around the world. Mr. de Blasio, speaking a week before a mayoral election that he is widely expected to win, presented himself as the head of the nation’s largest city at a time of pain. He responded with resolve, calling the attack terrorism in his first public remarks, and he vowed, as his predecessors had done in other moments of crisis, not to let the actions of those bent on terrorism alter the life of the city. Almost immediately afterward, the mayor and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo made a series of appearances — at the site of the attack, at a news conference and at the annual Halloween parade Tuesday night — and put aside, for the moment at least, the destructive political rivalry that plagued much of the mayor’s first term. “Everyone is here in common cause,” the mayor said in remarks at Police Headquarters on Wednesday, flanked by Mr. Cuomo, the city’s police commissioner and an array of grim-faced city, state and federal law enforcement officials. “This was an attack on our values,” Mr. de Blasio said, donning the mantle of leader for all city residents. “We will not change. We will not be cowed.” Sixteen years earlier, the Sept. 11 terror attacks had a profound effect across the United States, but nowhere more than in New York, where the World Trade Center was lost and the majority of the 2,977 victims from that day were killed. "
"President Trump projected an air of calm on Wednesday after charges against his former campaign chief and a foreign policy aide roiled Washington, insisting to The New York Times that he was not “angry at anybody” and that investigations into his campaign’s links to Russia had not come near him personally. “I’m not under investigation, as you know,” Mr. Trump said in a brief telephone call late Wednesday afternoon. Pointing to the indictment of his former campaign chief, Paul Manafort, the president said, “And even if you look at that, there’s not even a mention of Trump in there.” “It has nothing to do with us,” Mr. Trump said. He also pushed back against a report published Monday night by The Washington Post, which the president said described him as “angry at everybody.” “I’m actually not angry at anybody,” Mr. Trump told The Times. The phone call seemed intended to dispel the impression of a president and a White House under siege. The indictment of Mr. Manafort and his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, on Monday came as little surprise to Mr. Trump or his team, and they were relieved that the charges were not directly related to last year’s campaign. Instead, both were indicted on charges including money laundering, tax evasion and failing to properly disclose lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. But the president’s advisers were surprised when another former aide, George Papadopoulos, who was on the president’s hastily assembled foreign policy team, pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his repeated efforts to connect the campaign with Russians who might provide “dirt” on Hillary Clinton drawn from “thousands of emails.” Most unnerving was the discovery that Mr. Papadopoulos had been secretly cooperating with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for three months. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has acknowledged that the investigation has taken its toll on the president. “It is very distracting to the president, as it would be to any citizen, to be investigated for something, while at the same time trying to carry the weight of what being president of the United States means on his shoulder,” Mr. Kelly told Fox News this week.

"Something seemed amiss with the brownstone at 377 Union Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. After it sold for nearly $3 million in cash in 2012, the gorgeous four-story townhouse in one of Brooklyn’s prettiest neighborhoods proceeded to become an eyesore and a nuisance. Renovations dragged on for several years, then stopped. I-beams and cinder blocks cluttered the yard. Windows broke. Neighbors complained that the construction caused their basements to flood. The security alarm would go off in the middle of the night for an hour at a time. “The speed of the transaction was strange, and then the length of the renovation was strange,” said William Jeanes, a retired city worker who lives a few doors down. The absentee owners broke a cardinal rule of brownstone Brooklyn: There is a ginkgo tree near the house, and in the fall, ginkgos drop fleshy, rotten-scented fruits. The owners were the only ones on their block who did not sweep their ginkgo fruit off the sidewalk. On Monday, federal prosecutors linked the house to something more than a local annoyance: It was, they charged, a mechanism through which Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, laundered millions in unreported income from lobbying work on behalf of pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort’s ownership of the property was first brought to the public’s attention in February by a blogger, Katia Kelly, who runs a neighborhood news site called Pardon Me for Asking. One springlike day, she went out to take pictures for a post about a controversial public school expansion. A passer-by saw her with her camera and offered a scoop. “She said, ‘Guess who lives on my block?’” Ms. Kelly recalled on Tuesday. “With all the celebrities moving into the neighborhood, my first thought was Jay-Z or Beyoncé, or Gwyneth Paltrow – my mind was going gossipy Hollywood instead of swampy Washington.” "

"President Trump, his motley crew of White House and cabinet ideologues, and many other Republicans claim to have a better understanding of American values, traditions and history than the rest of us. They are the “real Americans,” as the historically illiterate Sarah Palin loved to say many times a day. But a great many of their notions about America are deeply puzzling at best and, at worst, truly scary ideas infused with racism and intolerance of dissent. The list defies comprehensive accounting. (Time magazine has to keep updating a handy guide to the world according to Trump that it started after his first 100 days in office.) But here are some of my favorites. The Civil War: Back in August, after racists marched in Charlottesville to defend monuments to those who fought to preserve slavery, Trump’s lawyer, John Dowd, forwarded around an email saying that there was “literally no difference” between George Washington and Robert E. Lee. More recently, John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, told Laura Ingraham on Fox News that the “lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War.” What possible compromise could there have been over slavery? But it’s also false history. There were plenty of “compromises.” All of them enshrined the evil institution of slavery and made the civil war more likely, not less. "
"Murderous attacks by a brooding “lone wolf” attacker or full-blooded “terrorist” have become, alas, a blight of our times, an eruption of random killing that can strike a cafe, a crowded promenade, a country music festival or a bike path in New York. Each new attack is met by anguished questions: Why? Could not the police have prevented the attack? Sayfullo Saipov, in custody now after the attack in Manhattan on Tuesday that left eight people dead, is said to have been planning his death spree for weeks and had links to people who were the focus of terrorism investigations. Was there really no sign that he — or the shooter in Las Vegas, or the killers in Barcelona, Nice, Berlin, London, Stockholm or Paris, all places where innocent people have been killed by hate-filled fools — was about to commit an atrocity? The federal and local authorities in the United States and Europe have made considerable progress in the struggle with terrorism, and there have been many reports of foiled attacks. A lot of study has gone into the motivations and roots of Islamist violence and hatred. The fact that Mr. Saipov has survived should enable investigators to learn more about what leads a young man to carnage. But the hard fact is that it is not possible, and never will be, to anticipate every attack, to make cities teeming with life immune to the desperate acts of men seething with resentments, especially when final preparations are as banal as renting a truck. And as for the tiresome calls for draconian border controls, could immigration authorities really have foreseen in 2010 that a 22-year-old arrival from Uzbekistan — which is not on the list of countries on the Trump administration’s travel ban — would be radicalized and evolve into a killer? Mr. Saipov’s cries of “Allahu akbar” and other evidence speak to an affinity for the Islamic State, but it does not require a long apprenticeship in a terrorist network to rent a Home Depot truck and drive onto a bicycle path.

"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday and signaled another rate increase is very likely to come in mid-December. But hanging over the meeting was the anticipation of a much bigger change: The nomination of Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman. The Fed’s current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is expected to remain in that post until her term expires in February. On Wednesday, President Trump called Ms. Yellen “excellent.” Nevertheless, he is expected to nominate Mr. Powell, a current board member, for the Fed chairmanship at a Rose Garden event on Thursday, according to people familiar with the decision. Mr. Powell, a Republican who joined the Fed in 2012, has steadily supported Ms. Yellen’s approach to monetary policy and is expected to follow a similar trajectory if confirmed to lead the central bank. Mr. Powell has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, including its four interest rate increases and the gradual unwinding of the Fed’s stimulus campaign. The meeting Wednesday was the first since the Fed began reducing its vast portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which it acquired in an effort to stimulate the economy during and after the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed is approaching the process cautiously, and so far investors appear unfazed. The central bank is paring its $4.2 trillion in bond holdings by just $10 billion per month through the end of this year, then gradually increasing the pace until it reaches a monthly rate of $50 billion. At the conclusion of its two-day gathering in Washington, the Fed announced that it would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1 and 1.25 percent, after lifting it twice so far this year. The vote was unanimous, and the central bank did not alter any of the careful wording in its statement about its expected rate of future increases — a sign that it is not trying to quell widely held expectations of a rate increase of a quarter point in December.

"Allahu akbar. It’s Arabic for “God is greatest.” Muslims, an eccentric tribe with over a billion members, say it several times in our five daily prayers. The phrase is also a convenient way to express just the right kind of gratitude in any situation. I say “Allahu akbar” out loud more than 100 times a day. Yesterday, I uttered it several times during my late-evening Isha prayer. Earlier, during dinner, I said it with my mouth full after biting into my succulent halal chicken kebab. In the afternoon, I dropped it in a conference room at the State Department, where I’d been invited to address a packed room of government employees about the power of storytelling. Specifically, I expressed my continuing gratitude for the election of Barack Obama, whom, in a joking nod to the Islamophobic paranoia that surrounded him, I called “our first Muslim American president,” adding “Allahu akbar!” People in the crowd laughed and applauded, the world continued to spin, no one had an aneurysm, and only a few people seemed to wonder with arched, Sarah Sanders-like eyebrows, “Wait, is he ...?” I even confess to saying “Allahu akbar” two days ago in a restroom after losing the battle, but ultimately winning the war, against a nasty stomach virus. I’m 37 years old. In all those years, I, like an overwhelming majority of Muslims, have never uttered “Allahu akbar” before or after committing a violent act. Unfortunately, terrorists like ISIS and Al Qaeda and their sympathizers, who represent a tiny fraction of Muslims, have. In the public imagination, this has given the phrase meaning that’s impossible to square with what it represents in my daily life. “Allahu akbar” is in the headlines again because the 29-year-old man who plowed a rental truck along a bicycle path killing eight people and injuring a dozen in Manhattan on Tuesday is reported to have said it after the attack. My heart sank as I heard the live news coverage, dotted with pieces of information meant to help us make sense of a tragedy: the suspect’s physical description, the kind of vehicle he drove, the stunned eyewitness accounts emphatically saying that it didn’t look at all accidental. And the two words the police say he shouted when the unthinkable act was over: Allahu akbar. "
"To the Editor: Re “Trump’s Legacy: Damaged Brains,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, Oct. 29): Pediatricians are alarmed by the Environmental Protection Agency’s recent decision to allow the continued use of chlorpyrifos, a toxic pesticide. Mr. Kristof explains in compelling detail the special interests that influenced the E.P.A.’s decision and why it should concern us all. Extensive epidemiologic studies associate pesticide exposure with adverse birth and developmental outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital abnormalities, pediatric cancers, neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits, and asthma. The evidence is especially strong linking certain pesticide exposure with pediatric cancers and permanent neurological damage. The agency’s own calculations suggest that babies, children and pregnant women all eat much more chlorpyrifos than is safe. In fact, the E.P.A. has estimated that “typical” exposures for babies are probably five times greater than its proposed “safe” intake, and 11 to 15 times higher for toddlers and older children. This chemical is unambiguously dangerous and should be banned from use. We urge the E.P.A. to reverse its decision and protect child health.

"We heard what sounded like a crash and what might have been a gunshot, but it didn’t register at first. Lower Manhattan is loud at every hour with traffic and construction, and my wife and I have grown used to ignoring the ambient noise. Even when one police siren follows another. Even when it is followed by dozens more. Two of our three children had been out shopping for Halloween. Then our 12-year-old son came home. He told us he had seen a truck smashed on our corner; that there had been a shooting; that he’d seen what looked like blood on the windshield. He said the police were swarming the neighborhood and helicopters were flying overhead and our building was locked down. He was composed as he told us all of this. He must have missed the attack by a few minutes at most. Where was our teenager? We experienced a moment of parental panic until she answered her phone and came home. I checked the news and saw something about bodies strewn along the bike path along the Hudson. I must have said “terrorism.” Our 8-year-old started to cry. “We’re safe up here,” my wife assured her. “No, we’re not,” she replied, not unreasonably. I went downstairs to try to see things for myself, just as I had when I lived in Jerusalem during the second intifada and similar events were an almost weekly occurrence. The day was clear and crisp. There were fire trucks and gurneys outside Stuyvesant High School, the elite public school that anchors the northern end of our neighborhood. I tried to get to the bike path, but stern-looking police officers waved me off at every corner. A woman pushing an infant in a stroller was sobbing; I heard her say that she had been outside when the crash took place. I stopped a paramedic to ask what he knew about the number of casualties. “A lot,” he said. It was clear that terrorism had returned to Manhattan, barely a year after a bomb went off on 23rd Street and injured more than 30 people. Within an hour it became clear that it was the act of another jihadist, most likely a self-starter inspired by what he had seen on TV of similar attacks in Barcelona and Nice. Ted Cruz and other right-wing populists sometimes deride Manhattan as a liberal La-La Land of privileged people living far from the real world. But on Tuesday there was only the stark reality of multiple homicides outside our home and grim-faced emergency medical workers racing to the scene. Disasters that strike close to home inevitably affect us differently from those we observe at a distance. I cross the bike path near the spot where the terrorist crashed his truck every day. My kids learned to ride their bikes on the same path that became Tuesday’s scene of carnage. We celebrated our older daughter’s bat mitzvah at a restaurant just off that path. My son went to soccer camp at Pier 40, where the rampage began. “There but for the grace of God go I” may be the world’s most shopworn phrase, but it’s one you feel keenly after an event like this.

"While allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful men in recent weeks have drawn wide public support and prompted quick response, women who came forward during the presidential race with accusations against Donald J. Trump said they spent the past year feeling dismissed and forgotten. “With Trump, it was all brushed under the rug,” said Temple Taggart, who claimed Mr. Trump kissed her on the mouth when she was competing in his Miss USA pageant in 1997. But that could change if a defamation lawsuit brought by a woman who accused Mr. Trump of unwanted sexual advances is allowed to proceed in New York State Supreme Court, a legal ruling that could come before the end of the year. Lawyers in the suit sought a subpoena seeking all Trump campaign records related to his female accusers. If the case advances, the accusers could be deposed, going up against Mr. Trump yet again. The plaintiff in the lawsuit — Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Mr. Trump’s show “The Apprentice” — is represented by the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has helped bring cases against Bill Cosby and other high-profile defendants. They claimed that Mr. Trump defamed Ms. Zervos during the campaign when he repeatedly described her and other accusers’ accounts as “lies” and “nonsense” and said the women either were being put forward by his opponent Hillary Clinton’s campaign or were motivated to come forward by getting “10 minutes of fame,” according to the complaint. Mr. Trump has sought to dismiss or stay the case, claiming that a sitting president cannot be sued in state court and that his comments amount to political speech, arguments that were reaffirmed by his legal team in a brief filed on Tuesday. But lawyers for Ms. Zervos point to the United States Supreme Court ruling that allowed Paula Jones to bring a sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton while he was in office, and several law professors have filed briefs supporting the legal grounds for such a suit. "
"Against a backdrop of renewed fears of terrorism, Mayor Bill de Blasio and two of his main challengers clashed on Wednesday in their final pre-election debate that, after a solemn start, descended into frequent cross-talk and pointed attacks. The timing of the debate, a day after a man who immigrated from Uzbekistan rammed a pickup truck through a crowded Lower Manhattan bike path, killing eight and wounding a dozen, presented political difficulties for Mr. de Blasio’s opponents, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican candidate, and Bo Dietl, a former police detective running as an independent. The first three questions were related to terrorism: how to conduct police surveillance without violating civil liberties of Muslim New Yorkers; building bollards to better secure pedestrian and cycling areas; and reacting to President Trump’s comments on further restrictions to immigration. Neither challenger criticized the mayor on his handling of the attack; each started by praising the Police Department and the resolve of the people of the city. All three liked the idea of more bollards. But Mr. Dietl defended the surveillance of Muslims within minutes of the start. “As far as this profiling thing, worrying about it, just look at this terrorist,” Mr. Dietl said. “What did he look like? Did he look like the terrorist, if you looked at a dictionary, with that beard the way he had.” He added, “Political correctness cannot be there all the time.” The stage afforded a ready-made opportunity for viewers to imagine how the relatively unknown Ms. Malliotakis, who stood to the mayor’s left, and the bellicose Mr. Dietl, who stood to his right, might have reacted to a similar act of terrorism, six days before the vote on Nov. 7. "
"New Yorkers on Wednesday were mourning the eight dead from a terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan and wondering how vulnerable they and their families might be, even as they picked themselves up, as New Yorkers do, and went on with life. Some of them inevitably thought back to another beautiful fall day in Lower Manhattan, on Sept. 11, 2001. After that day, they remembered, they and their nation were led in mourning, and toward unity, by a president who shared their sorrow and understood his own role. The current American president reacted rather differently. “A Chuck Schumer beauty,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday, blaming an immigrant visa program, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush and supported by Senator Schumer, for the fact that the terrorism suspect, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, was in this country as a legal resident. Mr. Trump might instead have rallied the nation. But he could not resist resorting to his campaign fantasy that closing the nation’s borders to those whom he selectively targets is the all-purpose solution to terrorist violence. Overnight, he and the nativist media seized on the title of the program — the Diversity Visa Lottery — to portray it as a “politically correct” indulgence undermining the country, rather than affirming its core values. “Sounds nice,” Mr. Trump said of the program, which is open to about 50,000 applicants a year from nations that traditionally send few emigrants here. But “it’s not nice,” he insisted. He called on Congress to end it. "
"The Democratic Party has learned to stop worrying and love “big government” liberalism. The party’s top presidential prospects are advertising their ardor for socialized medicine, free public college, universal child care and paid family leave. Even the party’s moderate senators are now pushing for the same kind of public health insurance option that their centrist predecessors killed in the early Obama years. And the party’s 2018 platform — the consensus agenda that ostensibly unites all Democrats, from Joe Manchin of West Virginia to Bernie Sanders — calls for vigorous antitrust enforcement to prevent mega-corporations from rigging the economy against working people. The party’s resident “sensible centrists” are horrified: “Has the entire Democratic Party forgotten the words ‘George McGovern’?” they cry. In column after column, they have been imploring their co-partisans to remember a fundamental fact: America is a center-right nation, where nearly 70 percent of voters are moderate or conservative, and just 25 percent are liberal. Over the past eight years, Democrats lost sight of this inconvenient truth — and lost control of more than 1,000 state legislative seats, the House, the Senate and the presidency. This argument may sound coolheaded and pragmatic. But its core premises — that American voters are hostile to progressive economics and have punished the (increasingly left-wing) Democratic Party accordingly — actually rest on ideological conviction, not empirical evidence. In truth, the Republican Party’s dominance has little to do with the American electorate’s “center-right” ideology. We know this for two simple reasons: First, the vast majority of that electorate has no ideology, whatsoever. And second, when polled on discrete policy questions, Americans consistently express majoritarian support for a left-of-center economic agenda. The political scientist Philip Converse first brought the first reality to national attention in 1964. In his classic essay “The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics,” Mr. Converse demonstrated that only 17 percent of American voters could both correctly assign the terms “liberal” and “conservative” to the nation’s two major political parties and offer a sensible description of what those terms meant. The rest of the electorate did not understand politics as a fight over abstract theories of good government but rather a conflict between interest groups. Ordinary voters did not select the party that most faithfully represented their political philosophy — they picked the one that appeared to best represent their people, a group they might define with reference to class, region, religion, race or partisanship itself.

"In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start “a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.” But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful. Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, “This is your brain on drugs.” A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin. Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects — as in the “Just Say No” campaign — appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s. Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns. Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging. The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows. At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use. A study of over 20,000 youths 9 to 18 found that those who had been exposed to more antidrug ads expressed weaker intentions to avoid marijuana and more doubts that marijuana was harmful. Why was the original campaign such a failure? In part it suffered from perverse incentives. Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress. But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents. In some cases, this kind of approach may make drugs more attractive as a sign of rebellion. Other reasons that campaigns backfire is that they make adolescents aware of a drug that they might not have heard of, sparking curiosity in some to try it. Campaigns against drugs can also create a false sense that drug use is more common than it is, making those who don’t use drugs feel socially abnormal. "
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Eight people were killed and 11 were injured in what Mayor Bill de Blasio called an “act of terror,” after a man drove a pickup truck down a crowded bike path in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday. Here’s what we know and don’t know about the attack, the deadliest terrorist event in New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. The suspect, a 29-year old man from Uzbekistan, was taken into custody after being shot by the police. A bystander’s video appears to show him after the attack. Law enforcement officials found notes that indicated an allegiance to the Islamic State, but they said they were treating the case as one of an “inspired” attacker. Among the victims were five tourists from Argentina who were celebrating a 30-year high school reunion. • “I approached to see if I could help and they did not need help — they appeared to be dead,” one man said. We spoke to other witnesses, and our map follows the roughly mile-long crime scene. "

"The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over its detention of a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who was stopped by Border Patrol agents in Texas last week on her way to surgery. The girl, Rosa Maria Hernandez, had been living in Laredo, Tex., with her parents, where she was brought illegally from Mexico when she was 3 months old. Her case became a new flash point in a national debate over the administration’s hard-line immigration policies, eliciting outcries from members of Congress as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics, an advocacy group. The A.C.L.U. argues in its suit that Border Patrol agents illegally and erroneously detained Rosa Maria, who was traveling to a hospital in Corpus Christi to have gallbladder surgery, under the pretext that she is an “unaccompanied minor.” The lawsuit, filed in a United States District Court in San Antonio, further argues that the government violated Rosa Maria’s constitutional rights by separating her from her parents without due process. The A.C.L.U. asked the court for a temporary restraining order against the government to allow her immediate release. “This case is shocking,” Michael Tan, an A.C.L.U. lawyer working on Rosa Maria’s case, said in a phone interview on Tuesday evening. “And all of us who do immigration work are concerned that this is the new normal.” "
"WASHINGTON — President Trump touched off a sharply partisan debate over some of the most divisive issues in American life on Wednesday as he cited this week’s terrorist attack in New York to advance his agenda on immigration and national security while assailing Democrats for endangering the country. A day after an immigrant from Uzbekistan was arrested on suspicion of plowing a pickup truck along a crowded bicycle path in Manhattan, killing eight people, Mr. Trump denounced the American criminal justice system as “a joke” and “a laughingstock,” adding that he was open to sending “this animal” instead to the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Shortly before midnight, the president took it a step further, posting a message on Twitter declaring that the suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, should be executed. “NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room,” he wrote, referring to the driver’s reported interest in the Islamic State extremist group. “He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!” Presidents are typically advised never to weigh in on pending criminal cases because such comments can be used by defense lawyers to argue that their clients cannot get a fair trial — especially when the head of the executive branch that will prosecute the charges advocates the ultimate punishment before a judge has heard a single shred of evidence at trial. But Mr. Trump has disregarded such advice in other instances, as well. The president’s vocal response to the attack framed the emerging politics of the case. While the White House deemed it unseemly to have a policy debate on gun control immediately after the massacre in Las Vegas last month, Mr. Trump was eager on Wednesday to have a policy debate on immigration. He pressed Congress to cancel a visa lottery program that allowed the driver into the country, attributing it to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and called Democrats “obstructionists” who “don’t want to do what’s right for our country.” “We have to get much tougher,” the president told reporters. “We have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct. We’re so politically correct that we’re afraid to do anything.” "
"It was an irony lost perhaps only on the White House that, almost nine months after he entered office, President Trump’s official photographic portrait was finally released … on Halloween. After all, it presented a very different image of the president than had most of his previous snaps. It is unlike the portrait that had often been used in the past few months on Mr. Trump’s Twitter profile, showing the president with a fearsome “You’re fired!” look on his face, and unlike the one on his White House Twitter account, in which his hands are clasped and he has a look of deep concern. The portrait, taken by the White House photographer Shealah Craighead, is also unlike the highly airbrushed official portrait of Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, which was released in April and features a Sphinx-like first lady, albeit with a soft focus. It does not include his trademark red tie (like the one he wore at his inauguration), nor a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. It does not remotely resemble the famous portrait of Winston Churchill — you know, the one taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, in which the former prime minister of Britain is scowling, with one hand on hip — who, The New York Times reported in March, was Mr. Trump’s model of choice. Instead, it depicts Mr. Trump in front of the de rigueur American flag, in a navy suit with flag pin, white shirt, patterned blue tie — and big grin. The orange glow has been toned down, but it is the smile that really sticks out. It almost looks as if he’s being tickled. The word chortle comes to mind. That the president and his team chose this image of benign cheer to adorn government offices across the country and to represent his administration is pretty striking, not simply because it seems to suggest “Hey, I’m enjoying this gig” or because it is counter to so much of Mr. Trump’s usual threatening, fight-picking, wall-building posturing. It is also something of an anomaly in the presidential portrait continuum, where the exhibition of restrained gravitas often seems to be the overriding imperative. "

First, if you read only one thing about John Kelly’s embrace of white nationalism and the Civil War myth, I recommend a string of tweets by Ta-Nehisi Coates yesterday. It’s “shocking that someone charged with defending their country, in some profound way, does not comprehend the country they claim to defend,” Coates wrote. He also walked through some of the copious historical evidence that the Civil War was indeed about slavery and that Robert E. Lee was a slavery true-believer and a torturer. (To read the full string, go to Coates’s Twitter page, scroll down to the tweet that starts with “Regarding John Kelly’s creationist theorizing...” and read upward.) On the same subject, and from the political right, Noah Rothman writes in Commentary magazine about Kelly’s “disastrous interview.” In The Times, Kashana Cauley explains how “compromise” — which Kelly said could have prevented the Civil War — allowed slavery to thrive. The dossier that won’t die. “Check the DEMS!” President Trump tweeted yesterday. “We now have evidence that Democrats literally paid money for Russian intelligence,” Fox News’s Tucker Carlson claimed on his show. “The Democrat-Fusion-Russia story requires as full an investigation as the question of Trump-Russia collusion,” The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote.

"BEIJING — For more than a year, China has railed against South Korea, calling for boycotts of its products over Seoul’s decision to let the United States deploy an antimissile system, which Beijing fears threatens its own security. On Tuesday, however, China abruptly changed course, essentially saying “never mind,” as the two countries agreed to end their dispute even though South Korea is keeping the system in place. China’s unexpected move to settle the rancorous dispute could scramble President Trump’s calculations about how to deal with allies and North Korea on the eve of his first trip to Asia. The decision, by the newly empowered Chinese president, Xi Jinping, appeared to reflect a judgment that China’s continued opposition to the deployment of the American missile defense system was not succeeding in fraying the South Korean government’s alliance with Washington. But it could also pose a fresh challenge to Mr. Trump, as he attempts to build support in the region to put greater pressure on North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs. South Korea’s liberal president, Moon Jae-in, is more receptive to diplomacy with the North Koreans than either Mr. Trump or Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Drawing Mr. Moon closer to Beijing, analysts said, could create a new alignment on how to deal with the North, with China and South Korea facing off against Japan and the United States. "
"The first indictments in Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 American presidential elections have made it very clear that “Russia-gate” will be a critical factor in American domestic politics in the months to come. But no matter how deep Mr. Mueller digs and what he finds, it seems unlikely that he is going to get to the bottom of a series of bigger questions about the Kremlin’s decision to interfere in America’s politics in the first place. Was this a desperate attempt to install a Russia-friendly president in the White House? Or was the main objective to discredit the American political system at a moment when the Kremlin has lost any hope for normalizing relations with Washington? Was it a major strategic move or just a “fun operation” meant more to hurt than to influence? And there are important questions not just about what happened but also about the future: How have Moscow’s recent experiences in America and Europe influenced Russia’s willingness to interfere in Western democracies’ politics? Does the Kremlin consider its meddling in American elections and the chaos that followed a success? If so, was its inability to sway France’s presidential election this spring a failure? Mr. Mueller’s indictments will not answer these questions. The Kremlin’s official position — that Russia never messed with the American politics — means that hardly anyone on the Russian side is willing to discuss the issue, either. And those who actually do know what Russia did and why are extraordinarily few in number — and none are particularly talkative. So if we want to figure out why the Russians did what they did, we need to leave the terrain of spy games and move to the realm of foreign policy. "
"WASHINGTON — There is a math problem at the heart of the Republican Party’s protracted introduction of a sprawling tax bill, and it grows, in part, from President Trump’s two nonnegotiable demands. Mr. Trump has insisted on “massive” tax cuts, including reducing the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and delivering a tax cut for the middle class. Both of those goals have proved difficult for the Republicans putting together the House version of the tax bill. They are running into political challenges as they try to offset lost revenue to stay within the confines of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that lawmakers have voted to allow. The tax rewrite is pitting businesses against individuals, as lawmakers look for ways to offset trillions of dollars of personal and corporate income tax cuts by limiting popular individual tax breaks, including preferential treatment for 401(k) plans and the state and local tax deduction. Business groups, meanwhile, say lawmakers run the risk of putting the United States at a global disadvantage if it does not reduce the corporate tax rate to a level commensurate with other industrialized nations. The bill, which had been scheduled for release on Wednesday, is now expected to be unveiled Thursday, despite continuing struggles to reach agreement on how to pay for everything lawmakers want to include. Some industry groups familiar with the negotiations said the remaining shortfall was in the hundreds of billions of dollars. On Wednesday, lawmakers were discussing a potential bandage solution to buy themselves time to figure out the hard math. That solution would call for phasing in some rate cuts over a period of years, and making some cuts temporary, which would lessen the short- and long-term revenue hit. Industry groups familiar with the discussions said such a move was not meant to be the actual legislative solution, but rather a place holder that would allow Republican leaders to work out the details of a new set of revenue-raisers that would be inserted in the bill before the full House votes on it. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that the intention was to make the corporate tax cut permanent, but that it might not appear that way immediately.

"Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed charges accusing the driver in the Manhattan truck attack of carrying out a long-planned plot, spurred by Islamic State propaganda videos, to kill people celebrating Halloween. The charges, filed just over 24 hours after the deadliest terror attack on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001, placed the case in the civilian courts even as President Trump denounced the American criminal justice system as “a joke” and “a laughingstock.” The charges describe the driver, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, as a voracious consumer and meticulous student of ISIS propaganda, and detail how he said he was spurred to attack by an ISIS video questioning the killing of Muslims in Iraq. They say he began planning the attack about a year ago and, after taking a test run in a Home Depot rental truck last week, chose Halloween to carry it out because more people would be on the streets. The charges were filed in civilian court, and not the military system set up for foreign terrorists, a decision that flew in the face of Mr. Trump’s broadsides against the criminal justice system. Mr. Trump said he was open to trying Mr. Saipov instead in military court at the American prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Saipov, accused of killing eight people and injuring 12 in the attack, was pushed into a Manhattan federal courtroom in a wheelchair just after 6 p.m. on Wednesday. He sat slightly hunched, his rail-thin body dressed in a gray shirt and gray pants. His hair stuck up slightly in the back. His hands and feet were chained. Five guards stood behind him. "
"Did you hear the bugs are disappearing? Amateur entomologists tracking insect populations in Western Europe discovered that, at a number of survey sites, the biomass of flying insects caught in their traps fell by almost 80 percent between 1989 and 2014. For whatever reason, in a media landscape thick with catastrophe, this was the story that cut through for me in this moment. Flying insects pollinate our plants, including crops. They are food for birds and bats and frogs and things. If the almost-80 percent decline proves true, and bears out globally, and continues unabated, we may all starve to death long before Donald Trump has the chance to vaporize us in a nuclear holocaust. Other stories that flashed in and out (always out! Bye!) of my news feed this week: Orca whales may be extinct within the next 100 years, on a beach in Wales dozens of octopuses walked out of the sea and died, greenhouse gases are spiking to an unprecedented record, an endangered lemur in Madagascar is hanging on by a thread because of climate change, and something about the Great Barrier Reef that I couldn’t bear to click on. In non-environmental doom, Facebook is apparently helping to enable horrific violence in Myanmar, the president’s supposedly moderating minder John Kelly said in an interview that “the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,” and Mother Jones reports that artificial intelligence will render all human workers obsolete in the relatively near future and the desperate, idle populace will devolve into mass chaos while a few quintillionaire industrialists gaze chortling across their automaton armies. But at least Paul Manafort had a bad day, right? Yeah. Actually, that is something. The part that knocked the wind out of me about the bug thing wasn’t really the story itself, it was the crystallization of how desperately, comically far we are from taking it, or anything, seriously as a planet. Instead of leaping into global collective action to mitigate the collapse of the biosphere and potential human extinction, America’s ruling party is currently squabbling about whether they should punitively investigate Hillary Clinton over a routine committee decision from 2010 or for somehow rigging the election she lost. Why do we tolerate this from our elected employees? How is our basic animal survival instinct not sending us into open revolt? Even if we’d elected that bat from “FernGully” last year instead of a gaseous, smoke-belching coal baron who seems to feel personally wronged by fresh air, pulling the planet back from disaster would still be a nail-biting scramble at this point. I speak as a seasoned, professional procrastinator: It would still be the second-to-last day of the semester, and we have not remotely started the reading. Instead, we’re out in the woods burning our textbooks for warmth while we argue about whose job it is to chop down a tree to build a desk so we can start our kindergarten homework, and we don’t even know how to build a desk. This week’s indictments are satisfying, of course, and I feel faintly hopeful in a concrete way that I thought I’d lost. But I’m struggling to truly relish them. The efficacy of the Mueller investigation depends on so many unknowns, most pressingly whether the rule of law will hold after a year of President Trump’s assaults on it — and whether Americans across the political spectrum can find our way back to some common truth.

"Hours after a truck plowed along a Manhattan bike path on Tuesday, Americans returned to a debate that has become a vessel for some of the most contentious questions dividing an increasingly polarized society: When is an attack terrorism? A month ago, when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas, killing dozens and wounding hundreds, the attack was not broadly branded an act of terrorism. But that label was immediately attached to the attack on Tuesday that killed eight people, setting off another round of a fierce national debate. On the surface, this could be considered a straightforward question of motive. Terrorism is defined as an attack on civilians meant to frighten a larger community for political purposes. But the new generation of Islamist terrorism, conducted by individuals citing far-off inspiration, has blurred the distinctions between terrorist and disturbed loner. So have recent mass shooters who show signs of both mental illness and an attachment to vague ideological causes. As a result, terrorism is often in the eye of the beholder, determined as much by the attacker as by the community that is targeted, which must decide whether the attack represents a broader threat requiring a response. Each attack, then, quickly sets off a zero-sum debate over the related issues of gun control, immigration or religious tolerance — some of the most divisive issues in the country — litigated in a moment of national duress.

"UNITED NATIONS — The United States on Wednesday revived its objection to an annual United Nations General Assembly resolution deploring the American trade embargo on Cuba, a year after having abstained from the vote for the first time. The reversal, which left the United States nearly isolated on the issue at the United Nations, reflected the toughened attitude toward Cuba by President Trump, who has distanced his administration from the historic thaw in relations begun by his predecessor, Barack Obama. The vote on the resolution in the 193-member General Assembly was 191 to 2. The United States and Israel, which often acts in concert with its American ally, were the lone dissenters. The State Department had signaled on Tuesday that the United States intended to vote against the resolution, which calls for a repeal of the embargo imposed in 1962 after the break in relations with Cuba. “The United States does not fear isolation in this chamber or anywhere else,” Mr. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, said in a statement to fellow diplomats before the vote. In remarks that evoked the Cold War-era language aimed at the Castro government, Ms. Haley said the United States opposed the resolution to demonstrate “continued solidarity with the Cuban people and in the hope that they will one day be free to choose their own destiny.” Under Mr. Obama, the United States restored diplomatic relations with Cuba, easing five decades of enmity with the island nation of 11 million. But the trade embargo, which can be rescinded only by Congress, has remained in force. The annual vote on the resolution condemning the embargo has become something of a theatrical ritual at the United Nations and a venue for critics of American policy to vent their anger. Cuba’s foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez, who also spoke before the vote, denounced the United States and Ms. Haley for what he described as her disrespectful remarks, and said the Trump administration lacked “the slightest moral authority to criticize Cuba.” The atmosphere was in sharp contrast to the vote in 2016, when Mr. Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, abstained, breaking with precedent and receiving sustained applause. Ms. Power said the abstention did not mean the United States condoned the political and economic restrictions in Cuba. But the abstention reflected the Obama White House’s view that decades of American efforts to ostracize Cuba had not worked. The General Assembly vote came against the backdrop of other tensions between the Trump administration and Cuba, tied partly to mysterious illnesses that have afflicted American diplomats in Havana. Last month, Mr. Trump blamed Cuba for the illnesses, which led to the abrupt withdrawal of American Embassy personnel. He also expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington. Cuban officials have denied responsibility for the illnesses and suggested that the Trump administration had concocted an excuse to downgrade ties. "
"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • The man who sped a rental truck down a riverfront bike path in New York on Tuesday had been planning the attack for a year and “appears to have followed almost to a T the instructions that ISIS has put out,” a city police official said. A second man was being sought. Witnesses described the rampage as gruesome, grisly and surreal. The suspect was identified as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old native of Uzbekistan, which is considered a militant breeding ground. He was living legally in the U.S., but some close to him saw signs of trouble. President Trump said that he would consider sending Mr. Saipov to the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to cancel the immigration program that granted him entry. _____ "
"Robert Mercer, a billionaire investor and top financial backer of conservative causes, is stepping down as co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, as the giant hedge fund faces a backlash from some clients who resent Mr. Mercer’s embrace of polarizing political figures. Discomfort with Mr. Mercer’s political activism — including protests aimed at university endowments, foundations and pension funds with money invested in Renaissance — has showed signs of taking a small but growing toll. The retirement fund for Baltimore’s police and firefighters, for example, last week asked that all of the $33 million it had invested in Renaissance be refunded, said David A. Randall, the retirement fund’s deputy executive director. The Baltimore fund had been contacted by a local reporter about whether the pension was bothered by Mr. Mercer’s political activities. Seeking to avoid bad publicity, the pension’s directors convened an emergency conference call and decided to pull their money. That $33 million withdrawal was a rounding error for Renaissance, which has more than $50 billion in assets. But it signaled a growing unease, inside and outside the firm, about Mr. Mercer’s backing of Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser. Renaissance’s founder, James Simons, is a prominent Democratic booster who supported Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. In letters to investors and to Renaissance staff on Thursday morning, Mr. Mercer said he would step down as co-chief executive and as a board member on Jan. 1. He said he would remain involved with the research arm of Renaissance, which uses complex mathematical equations to create trading strategies. Mr. Mercer, 71, sought in his letter to employees to distance himself from Mr. Bannon, who has gone back to running Breitbart News, the divisive media outlet and hub for nationalist and far-right activism. He said he was selling his investment in Breitbart to his daughters, who also are active in conservative politics. "

"WASHINGTON — President Trump nominated Jerome H. Powell to chair the Federal Reserve on Thursday, bypassing Janet L. Yellen for a second term but turning to a replacement who is expected to stay the course on monetary policy if the economy continues its steady growth. “He’s strong, he’s committed, he’s smart,” Mr. Trump said in the White House Rose Garden, where he introduced Mr. Powell as his choice. Using Mr. Powell’s nickname, the president said, “I am confident that with Jay as a wise steward of the Federal Reserve, it will have the leadership it needs in the years to come.” Less certain is where Mr. Powell would lead the Fed if the economy falters. Mr. Powell, a member of the Fed’s board of governors since 2012, has consistently voted with Ms. Yellen to slowly raise interest rates and sell off assets that the Fed bought up in the wake of the severe recession of 2008 and 2009. Colleagues consider him a centrist and pragmatist. But he lacks the deep background in economics of some of his predecessors, and he has expressed skepticism in the past about the unconventional measures that the Fed took after the recession. Mr. Powell could also depart from the Fed’s current trajectory when it comes to regulating banks and other financial institutions — rules Mr. Trump has said should be loosened. The nominee offered little hint of his thinking during brief remarks in the Rose Garden. He said the nation’s economy has made “substantial progress toward full recovery” since the financial crisis and that banks are in far better shape. “I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks,” he said.

"WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers unveiled a sweeping rewrite of the tax code on Thursday, outlining a $1.5 trillion plan that will deliver a significant tax cut for corporations and more modest savings for middle-class families while tilting the United States closer, but not entirely, toward the kind of tax system long championed by businesses. The House plan, released after weeks of internal debate, conflict and delay, immediately ignited a legislative and lobbying fight as business groups, special interests and Democrats began tearing into the text ahead of a Republican sprint to get the legislation passed and to President Trump’s desk by Christmas. Lawmakers appeared unfazed by the blowback and scheduled the first official “markup” of the bill for Monday. “With this plan, we are making pro-growth reforms, so that yes, America can compete with the rest of the world,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin. The bill is heavily weighted toward business, which would receive about $1 trillion in net cuts, or two-thirds of the total, according to calculations by the Joint Committee on Taxation. At its center is a proposal to permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent — a change that is estimated to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over the next decade alone. For individuals, the plan establishes three tax brackets — 12, 25 and 35 percent — instead of the seven that exist now and maintains a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires. The bill would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which is expected to hit 4.5 million families in 2017, and would roughly double the standard deduction for middle-class families. It would not, as many had feared, make any changes to the pretax treatment of 401(k) plans. Americans will still be able to make “both traditional, pretax contributions and ‘Roth’ contributions in the way that works best for them,” Republican lawmakers said in their talking points. "
"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox. First, there is a simple reason that congressional Republicans have had so much trouble coming up with a tax bill: Their top priorities are cutting taxes for the wealthy and for corporations — and neither idea is popular. CBS News released a new poll yesterday, consistent with other recent polls, that showed a majority of Americans wants taxes on the rich and on big companies to rise. Yet congressional leaders are trying to write a bill that cuts those taxes enormously. So they’ve got a political problem, especially because they also plan to raise some taxes on the middle class and poor to hold down the bill’s price tag. Nonetheless, top Republicans have vowed to release a bill today. Once they do, look for them and President Trump to start selling it, less than honestly, as a middle-class tax cut. In truth, it is built around deeply cutting corporate taxes and repealing the estate tax. Bring on the robots. Human beings generally like to be in control or to hand over control to a trained professional, as I wrote last week in a column about driverless cars. We often prefer human control to computer control even when human control leads to worse outcomes. The past week has brought an especially stark example: the World Series. If you’re not a sports fan, please stick with me for a moment anyway. As Richard Thaler, the latest Nobel laureate in economics, likes to say, sports offers an unusually good window on human behavior, because it lets us watch decisions and outcomes as they happen. "
"Good Thursday morning from Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London. We’re watching the widening fallout from sexual misconduct accusations and V.C.s spending less money in trying to find the next Uber. More on those in a minute. (And congrats to the Houston Astros for finally winning the World Series.)

A reminder: DealBook’s sixth annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, takes place on Nov. 9. Want to join us? Apply to participate here. Today, we’re supposed to finally see House Republicans’ vision of what a tax code change would look like (even if it is unlikely to bear the name President Trump is said to prefer, the “Cut Cut Cut Act”). The bill will include a permanent cut of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent and a phased-in repeal of the estate tax, according to Axios. But the question of how the bill would be financed remains unanswered. “Some industry groups familiar with the negotiations said the remaining shortfall was in the hundreds of billions of dollars,” according to The NYT. Among the groups that are expected to pay more, according to Politico: private colleges, charities, companies that provide meals to employees and insurers. "
"Spoiler alerts would be superfluous in a review of “11/8/16”: You already know the ending, and you’ve lived through the events. Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night. The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere. We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect. When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic. Many of these voters’ decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities. Some of their outlooks are naïve, others inspiring. Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated “11/4/08,” an examination of that Election Day. The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen. Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from “11/8/16.” But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled. Judging by most people here, that won’t be soon. "
"OTTAWA — Why is President Trump picking on Canada? Canada has long been the United States’ best customer, buying more American-made goods and services than any other country — more than China, Japan or Britain. American trade with Canada totaled $627.8 billion in 2016; the United States had a $12.5 billion trade surplus. But trade relations have nose-dived since Mr. Trump took office. The president is throwing red meat to his base — much of which feels left behind by the modern economy — by attacking Canada and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada is an easy target. In the spring, the Trump administration imposed tariffs costing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars on Canadian softwood-lumber imports, escalating a decades-long dispute between American and Canadian lumber companies. This fall, following a complaint by Boeing, the Commerce Department announced it would recommend a 300 percent punitive tariff on Canadian-made Bombardier CSeries passenger aircraft, even though Boeing makes no equivalent product and receives indirect subsidies from the United States government. Mr. Trump also prompted renegotiations of Nafta, which he criticized relentlessly during his campaign as “the worst trade deal ever signed.” Started in August and scheduled to run until March, the Nafta talks have been shocking to many Canadians as the United States has issued a series of unreasonable demands that no Canadian or Mexican government could accept. The Trump administration is reportedly asking that Nafta be renegotiated every five years, which would create a state of perpetual uncertainty for business and deter investment. Washington also wants to eliminate Nafta’s binational dispute-settlement panels, a red line for Canada because Canadian businesses would have to rely on United States courts, which they don’t necessarily trust. Further, Washington is apparently insisting on “rules of origin” that would require Canadian and Mexican vehicles to contain no less than 50 percent American parts and services for duty-free entry into the United States, an onerous demand benefiting American producers. Washington is also asking that such vehicles contain at least 85 percent of parts and services from the three Nafta countries. The existing 62.5 percent has allowed for the use of cheaper supplies outside the trading group. "

"HANOI, Vietnam — A Vietnamese businessman named Trinh Xuan Thanh disappeared off the streets of Berlin in July, one day before he had an appointment with German officials to seek political asylum. Germany blamed his country’s government, saying Mr. Thanh had been abducted by agents linked to Vietnam and demanding an apology for an episode it called “wholly unacceptable.” None came, at least in public. And today, Mr. Thanh’s continued detention is complicating the prospects of a smooth completion to a long-awaited free-trade deal between Vietnam and the European Union. Vietnamese business leaders and experts believe the two sides will reach a face-saving deal over Mr. Thanh, who is accused by Vietnamese officials of enriching himself while running a state construction firm. But the episode illustrates Vietnam’s quandary. It’s a rising Southeast Asian power under growing pressure to seek new alliances as China’s rise and America’s shifting politics reshape the global trade order. But Vietnam’s secretive, authoritarian government, and its checkered history with human rights and worker protections, can make striking those alliances tricky. Vietnam could lose more than a beneficial free-trade agreement if it does not improve ties with Germany, said Doan Xuan Loc, a research fellow at the Global Policy Institute in London who studies the European Union’s relations with Southeast Asian countries.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Sayfullo Saipov, 29, started planning a year ago for the attack that killed eight and injured 12 others, choosing to carry it out on Halloween because more people would be on the streets, federal prosecutors said. Mr. Saipov, who came to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010, led a rootless life that eventually turned to radical Islam. “He did not learn religion properly,” one imam said. Although the charges Mr. Saipov faces describe him as a student of Islamic State propaganda, the militant group has not claimed responsibility for the rampage. Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS for The Times, explains why. • Our video shows how quickly Tuesday's attack unfolded, and a map traces the truck’s path. • President Trump declared late Wednesday that the suspect in the New York attack should be executed. The comment could hurt the prosecution of Sayfullo Saipov, as it can be used by defense lawyers to argue that their client cannot get a fair trial. "

Seth Meyers was amused to find out that President Trump is hoping to title the new tax plan “The Cut Cut Cut Act.” House Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly has been working to persuade the president to change his mind. In the wake of this week’s terrorist attack in New York City, the president called for the termination of the so-called diversity visa lottery. Trevor Noah criticized conservative commentators and politicians who, he said, are quick to push their political agenda after an attack by a Muslim man, but who insist that liberals shouldn’t “politicize” mass shootings by white gunmen in service of gun control.

That inspired some ridicule from Stephen Colbert — and then a complex lesson in socialism, derived from Halloween candy names. "
"MANASSAS, Va. — The voting for Virginia governor on Tuesday, traditionally a referendum on the party in the White House one year into a new administration, is the big political show of 2017. But the real weather vane for the country may be many rungs down the ballot in obscure races for the House of Delegates. Amid the turbulence of the Trump presidency, and under a shadow of indictments of former Trump campaign officials, voters heading to the polls in Virginia’s 100 House races represent the purest test of grass-roots anger at the president, election analysts said. That is because the candidates are little known to voters, largely absent from TV ads, and the races approximate a generic partisan ballot. If the past is a guide, they may also prefigure nationwide congressional voting in 2018. “These House of Delegate districts are mini versions of congressional districts around the country,” said Quentin Kidd, the director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. “I would expect Democrats to pick up four to six seats,” said Mr. Kidd, echoing other nonpartisan analysts. “If it went to 10, I’d say it sends a loud message across the country about the energy within the grass-roots Democratic base and the lack of energy in the Trump base.” The 40 members of the upper chamber, the State Senate, are not on the ballot.

"When the discussion warms up in Andrea Cote-Botero’s graduate seminar, English and Spanish flow freely, just as they do amid the afternoon foot traffic across the nearby Ciudad Juárez border. In the country’s only bilingual M.F.A. creative writing program, at the University of Texas at El Paso, students on this day are comparing how F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gabriel García Márquez depict West Egg and Macondo, the respective settings of their classic novels. Many of the students around the table comment in Spanish, sometimes switching languages to highlight a point for the native English speakers. Ms. Cote-Botero hangs back, periodically interjecting in either language. A student from Mexico City consults another from Las Vegas on a passage in Fitzgerald’s “Great Gatsby,” occasionally glancing at Google Translate on a laptop. El Paso’s Masters of Fine Arts program, started in 2006, draws mostly local residents from both sides of the border. A dozen of the 20 students are native Spanish speakers, and all speak at least some English and Spanish. They are motivated by the desire to write and read in another tongue, and to study with professors versed in other cultures. One student, a Texan of Palestinian descent, hopes the program will help her better express herself in Arabic. While El Paso’s program is a unique educational experience, creative writing programs across the country are developing Spanish-based curriculums — a growth reflecting the nation’s changing demographics: Spanish is the primary language of more than 40 million people in the United States, up from 32 million in 2005, according to Census Bureau estimates. Among the emerging programs, California State University in Los Angeles will offer its own bilingual M.F.A. next year. Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., will start a Spanish-language creative writing degree in 2018, similar to one already in place at New York University. Students in the Spanish-language program and its English counterpart at the University of Iowa are now being encouraged to take each other’s classes. And while recovering from Hurricane Harvey this semester, the University of Houston started a Ph.D. with a Spanish-language concentration that emphasizes literary scholarship as much as writing (students must include a theoretical analysis with their creative writing dissertation).

"In discussing the Manhattan truck attack with his cabinet on Wednesday, President Trump denounced the American criminal justice system as “a laughingstock” and “a joke” that is too weak to deter terrorism and too slow to mete out punishment. Experts, however, said the United States is tougher on terrorism than most other nations, and they called Mr. Trump’s claim that extremists who launch attacks on American soil “go through court for years” an exaggeration. But the president barreled ahead in a Twitter post minutes before midnight Wednesday, already assuming the guilt of the suspect in the Manhattan attack, Sayfullo Saipov, and advocating his execution. Earlier in the day, as he sat across the table from Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said he would “certainly consider” transferring Mr. Saipov to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to face a harsher trial than going through civilian courts. “We also have to come up with punishment that’s far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now. They’ll go through court for years,” Mr. Trump said. “We need quick justice, and we need strong justice, much quicker and much stronger than we have right now. Because what we have right now is a joke and it’s a laughingstock. And no wonder so much of this stuff takes place.” "
"Just about every other person you might meet in New York City has come from somewhere else. On the Lower Manhattan street where the truck attack ended Tuesday afternoon, 5,400 students born in other countries attend the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and 600 go to Stuyvesant High School. They are from more than 100 countries. Also there, of course, were people born and raised in the city. One of those natives is a woman who had been a high school sophomore in Stuyvesant on 9/11, fleeing with her classmates from chemistry class as people fell from the burning towers down the block. She was in the school on Tuesday, this time as a teacher, gazing through another window at yet more people felled by fanaticism, comforting students who come from any number of countries. For those who call the city home, there is practically no such person as a foreigner. Even with that sprawl of humanity, New York can be lived as a small town, familiar and compact. Take, for instance, the bicycle path used as a death chute. It runs nearly the full length of Manhattan Island, but is just about 13 miles long. Still, it is said to be the busiest such path in the United States. With so many of us from somewhere else, a group of old friends from Argentina and a family from Belgium were bound to be on it Tuesday, in the autumn sunshine, riding alongside the Hudson River as it flowed to the ocean. “That path is the best thing to happen to New York City in the last 50 years,” said Adrian Benepe, a native of the city. “It’s possibly New York’s happiest place.” "

"Almost immediately after the Manhattan terrorist attack on Tuesday, President Trump faulted the “diversity lottery” visa program under which the Uzbek immigrant suspected in the attack entered this country, and laid the blame for the program’s existence on Senator Charles Schumer and other Democrats. As is often the case, he is wrong on his facts — here, about political responsibility for the program, which has been supported by both parties for over 25 years (though Mr. Schumer has backed getting rid of it). But Mr. Trump is right that these visas are bad policy and that the program should be canceled. Better still, they should be used for other, wiser purposes. First, the facts. Of the roughly one million permanent resident visas — commonly known as green cards — issued each year, 50,000 are awarded through a lottery process with few preconditions other than that applicants come from countries with little immigration to the United States during the previous five years. Congress made this program permanent in 1990 after several years of experimentation. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, both Democrats, invoked a “diversity” rationale in noting that the program would help the many Irish in the United States who had overstayed their temporary visas. Despite the numerous people of Irish background already in the country from earlier waves of migration, Ireland was an eligible country under the program because, at the time, its economy was doing well and few people were emigrating. So much for actual diversity. Today, lottery winners with little education, job skills, English fluency and work experience can hit the jackpot and promptly come (or stay) here permanently, while millions of American citizens and legal residents must wait years for their family members to be allowed to join them, dividing families and motivating illegal immigration. (Even citizens must now wait for sometimes 20 years for their unmarried children to get a visa.) The same challenge faces would-be immigrants who have skills needed here but can’t qualify for an employer-sponsored visa. Even the State Department, which runs the lottery program, acknowledges that it is rife with fraud. "
"It would be hard to find a better example of the “corrupt Washington establishment” that President Trump calls “the swamp” than Ed Gillespie. The Republican nominee in Virginia’s gubernatorial election, Gillespie is an insider’s insider, a founder of Quinn Gillespie and Associates, one of the most successful lobbying firms in Washington. He has been moving in and out of government service for 35 years. Gillespie is not, of course, presenting himself to Virginians as a swamp creature. Instead, with the election just five days away, Gillespie is showing two different faces to voters. In the first of these, he appears to be the politician that he is at heart: a traditional, Main Street, “big tent” Republican — a consistent proponent of racial reconciliation and a supporter, as recently as 2013, of granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants. Gillespie’s other face, however, shows him as a hard-line campaigner in the Trump mold, warning that Democrats will coddle immigrant gangs and restore voting and Second Amendment rights to sex offenders. In 2002, his firm, Quinn Gillespie, boasted on its website that Notably, Gillespie’s campaign bio does not use the word “lobby.” During the early 2000s, Gillespie served on the de facto executive committee of the K Street Project, a major initiative designed to force Washington lobbying firms to hire Republican staffers, to donate to Republicans, and to work hand in glove with the Republican House and Senate leadership in order to win passage of highly partisan legislation. When it comes to money and politics, Gillespie is a player at the highest level. Together with Karl Rove, Gillespie capitalized on the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision to form the second-largest super PAC of 2012, American Crossroads, and the largest “dark money” 501(c)4 organization, Crossroads GPS.

"MOSCOW — In December 2011, demonstrators took to the streets of Moscow to protest President Vladimir Putin and his corrupt parliamentary election. At one of these rallies, a crowd listened to several speakers — activists, writers, prominent government critics — castigate the Putin government for its authoritarianism. Then Ksenia Sobchak, a socialite and TV personality, took to the podium. The crowd whistled in disapproval. But Ms. Sobchak, who was known for appearing in films like “The Blonde in Chocolate” (which bestowed her a nickname) and “Thieves and Prostitutes,” persisted. “I am Ksenia Sobchak, and I have something to lose,” I remember her saying, as she insisted on being heard. She said that she did not want revolution, but she demanded political changes — and this position coincided with the opinion of the majority of the protesters. What was Ms. Sobchak doing at this rally, talking about subjects that had little to do with her best-selling book “How to Marry a Millionaire” or the reality TV show she hosted, “House-2”? She was there because I was one of the organizers of the protest and I had invited her. We needed celebrities who would appeal to people who mistrusted politicians, and I felt that Ms. Sobchak, who had a strong following among teenagers thanks to “House-2,” would attract her fans to the protest. I put considerable effort into recruiting her. At the time, I didn’t know that for her this protest would be more than a passing episode. It would start her on a completely new path. That path reached a major turn on Oct. 18, when Ms. Sobchak declared her intention to run for president against Mr. Putin in the election next March. She has committed herself to the opposition now. Sort of. "
"Donald Trump is a new kind of old-school American man. In some ways, he’s a throwback to days when authority and power were exclusively white and male by definition, when displays of masculine entitlement were overt and unapologetic. But he’s also a thoroughly modern man-child, the kind of overgrown adolescent you expect to find on internet forums dedicated to video games or anti-feminism: a tweeter of juvenile threats, a crass name-caller, an id unrestrained. Trump-style masculinity, in other words, is less John Wayne and more Tucker Max — and a revealing insight into American male anxiety. American manhood is reshaping itself in two opposing directions, and both archetypes are ones we’ve never seen before. If Barack Obama embodied the new ideal of the progressive man — a hands-on dad and a self-identified feminist married to a high-achieving woman who was once his boss, who is also well mannered and protective of his family — then Mr. Trump is his antithesis, an old-school chauvinist embracing a new code of adolescent anarchy. He is a paradigm of feckless male entitlement, embracing male power while abnegating the traditional masculine requirements of chivalry, courtesy and responsibility. Almost a year ago, he won the presidential election by presenting this version of aggrieved manhood in opposition to Hillary Clinton’s hand-raising Hermione Granger feminism. White American men loved it. This happened while, in homes across America, the Obama model of manhood had increasingly taken root. Yes, powerful men do abuse their positions to extract sexual services from women or to remind us that no matter how mighty and successful we are, we can be reduced to simple objects of predatory male sexuality. The past few weeks have been a stark reminder that these abuses don’t fall along partisan lines, with the Harvey Weinstein revelations and stories across industries and continents still unfolding in their wake. Most men also continue to fall short when it comes to household responsibilities, and men still tend to out-earn women. But, in much of America, men’s and women’s lives look more similar than they ever have: Women do more work for pay, and men do more care work than they previously have done. Feminists have insisted that women and men alike can and should embody the characteristics we positively associate with both masculinity (power, respect, dependability, providing) and femininity (caregiving, devotion, compassion), and many of our lives have crept closer to this ideal. To Mr. Trump and many of his increasingly nihilistic supporters, this is a threat to their fantasy of masculinity. We could have guessed that men who believe in gender equality would do more housework than men with conservative views, and it is not news that white conservative men overwhelmingly vote Republican. What is different from generations before is that many of the men making up Mr. Trump’s base are less attached to the institutions that offered respect and required responsibility — unions, church, marriage, school, even independent living. In the face of women’s success, many of them have fallen behind on adult obligations and fallen back on misogyny. "
"Silicon Valley, once a force for good, is now a threat to democracy. At least that’s the impression you’d get from the flood of news and commentary about social media’s role in the presidential election. This week, representatives of Twitter and Facebook, along with Google, testified before Congress about how Russia exploited their platforms to interfere with the election. But while Russian meddling is a serious problem, the current sentiment toward Silicon Valley borders on scapegoating. Facebook and Twitter are just a mirror, reflecting us. They reveal a society that is painfully divided, gullible to misinformation, dazzled by sensationalism, and willing to spread lies and promote hate. We don’t like this reflection, so we blame the mirror, painting ourselves as victims of Silicon Valley manipulation. At the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, squarely blamed the tech companies for Russian interference. “You bear this responsibility,” she said. “You’ve created these platforms.” But we, the users, are not innocent. Some of the Russian propaganda on social media was cribbed from content that was posted by Americans. Yes, social media helps propaganda spread farther and faster. But Facebook and Twitter didn’t force users to share misinformation. Are Americans so easily duped? Or more alarming, did they simply believe what they wanted to believe? In the last few months of the presidential campaign, a BuzzFeed News analysis concluded, fake news stories got more Facebook engagement than the most widely read stories from major news outlets. The Russians didn’t single-handedly create this situation; they just jumped into the fray. The real crisis is Americans’ inability or unwillingness to sift fact from fiction, a problem that is worsened by the mainstream media’s loss of credibility when it comes to setting the record straight. Some blame social media for Donald Trump’s rise to power. The election “shook Silicon Valley’s belief that the internet always fosters societal good,” Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed essay, “Trump used the tools of technology to win.” Twitter remains the perfect vehicle for Mr. Trump’s nuance-free missives. But it’s not Twitter that is making Mr. Trump go viral; it’s Twitter’s users. They include all the citizens and journalists who follow, retweet and reply to Mr. Trump — even when we do so out of shock or outrage or because his statements have news value. If it weren’t for all of us, the president would be shouting into a void. "
"Conservative lawmakers have long touted the idea that cutting corporate tax rates spurs economic growth. Proponents point to many mechanisms; a central one is that lower tax rates attract investment that might otherwise go to other countries. President Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, recently highlighted this goal when discussing the Republican plan to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, below the world average of 22.5 percent. This idea seems like a simple way to attract investment: If the tax rate is lower in the United States, corporations might prefer to invest here. But it turns out the situation is not so straightforward. By using game theory — the science of strategic interaction — we can see that America may be contributing to a problem that ultimately harms us economically. This is because the United States is not the only country seeking to attract investment by lowering corporate taxes. This rivalry among countries is known as tax competition. Tax competition occurs when nations compete to attract investment by imposing ever lower tax burdens on corporations. Mechanisms such as lower corporate income taxes, favorable tax-base definitions and tax holidays encourage multinational corporations to repatriate assets held overseas. This competition is an example of what game theorists call a collective action problem. These problems no doubt are familiar to many of us: In joint projects at work, every member of a team stands to benefit if the project is completed on time. But if individuals think they can avoid their share of the work, they will, leaving others to pick up the slack. Without some mechanism like good management to enforce shared norms, everyone on the team will shirk their responsibilities and the team will fail. This is the core feature of a collective action problem: All members of a group would do better if everyone chose to work together, but each member has an incentive to abandon the cooperative approach and pursue its own interests. These problems occur throughout our economic and political lives, in situations as diverse as arms control treaties and the management of fisheries. Absent some kind of extra incentive to cooperate, collective action problems typically lead to outcomes that are worse for all. Globally, corporate taxation is ripe for collective action problems. If nations didn’t have to compete with one another, they would all benefit from imposing higher corporate taxes. But they do have to compete, so each individual country has a self-interested reason to lower its corporate tax rate, undercutting other countries to attract investment. Even if all other states agree to coordinate (or “harmonize”) to maintain higher rates of taxation, individual countries will still face an incentive to lower their tax rates to attract greater investment.

"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s leader, visited Rakhine State for the first time since the country’s military unleashed a campaign of violence against Rohingya Muslims two months ago, driving hundreds of thousands into Bangladesh. She showed little sign of acknowledging ethnic cleansing, as critics have urged. “I hope everything will go fine as local villagers handle the rebuilding process,” she said in one village. “We all have to try our best to live peacefully.” _____ • Conditions are deteriorating for more than 600 men barricaded inside Australia’s now-closed Manus Island detention center in Papua New Guinea. The U.N. warned of an “unfolding humanitarian emergency.” Here’s an explainer on the crisis. "
"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will promote coal, natural gas and nuclear energy as an answer to climate change at a presentation during a United Nations global warming conference this month, the White House confirmed Thursday. The program is billed as a discussion of how American energy resources, particularly fossil fuels, can help poor countries meet electricity needs and drive down greenhouse gas emissions. Entitled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” it will feature speakers from Peabody Energy, a coal company; NuScale Power, a nuclear engineering firm; and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter. “As the world seeks to reduce emissions while promoting economic prosperity, fossil fuels will continue to play a central role in the energy mix,” a preview of the Nov. 13 presentation says. The program is likely to provoke strong reactions at the United Nations conference gathering in Bonn, Germany, beginning on Monday for two weeks of negotiations on ways to keep rising global temperatures from reaching catastrophic levels. Most climate experts contend that the world must shift from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives to meet emissions targets. Nuclear power, which does not produce earth-warming emissions, is viewed with skepticism by many environmental activists, who say its dangers outweigh its benefits. No major funding announcements are expected during the event. Delegates from 195 countries will gather in Bonn from Nov. 6-17 to work on a “rule book” for implementation of the Paris agreement. "
"Unless the pollsters have all taken leave of their senses, Bill de Blasio is about to win re-election as New York’s mayor, probably by a wide margin. So it is not too soon for New Yorkers to focus on what they expect for his second term, the last one he is allowed under the city’s term-limits law. While they’re at it, they may want to think hard about their own commitment to civic life. Democracy functions only if its citizens make it work. They do that by showing up on Election Day. But far too many of the city’s nearly 4.5 million registered voters are AWOL. Only 26 percent of them went to the polls in the 2013 mayoral election, and that turnout was spectacular compared with the dismal 14 percent in this year’s primaries. Even allowing that this campaign has hardly been rousing, the apathy is troublesome. We supported Mr. de Blasio for the Democratic nomination in the September primaries because the city in the main has been well run on his watch. Nothing on that score has changed. Obviously, serious problems remain, with unrelenting homelessness and tottering mass transit high on the list. But, over all, Mr. de Blasio has been an able mayor who can point to an impressively low crime rate, sound municipal finances and progress on revivifying schools and on creating reasonably priced apartments. And so we give him our endorsement in the general election on Tuesday. His principal opponent is Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican who represents slices of Staten Island and Brooklyn. An unfamiliar figure in wide swaths of the five boroughs, Ms. Malliotakis has run a spirited campaign and deserves credit for it. But her ambition seems to outpace her vision for the city. And her resolute conservatism puts her out of sync with most New Yorkers — and us — on pivotal matters like raising the state minimum wage (she opposed it), legalizing same-sex marriage (she voted no on that, too, though she later expressed regret) and immigration policy (she is tepid on the “sanctuary city” concept). Catching up to the mayor is not Ms. Malliotakis’s only Election Day concern. Bo Dietl, the showboating former police detective who’s running as an independent, could take center-right votes from her. Sal Albanese, a respected former city councilman who has the Reform Party line, lives on Staten Island and might cut into her support there. "
"Stocks on Wall Street closed mainly unchanged on Thursday as the financial markets digested new details of an ambitious Republican plan to cut taxes. Major stock indexes initially plunged as lawmakers circulated a set of talking points covering the House’s highly anticipated $1.51 trillion package on Thursday morning. Although the markets recovered by midday, investors reacted to proposed caps on the popular mortgage-interest deduction by sending shares in home-building companies lower. Lennar ended the day 3.3 percent lower, and PulteGroup lost 1.1 percent. The tax plan would crunch the number of individual tax brackets to three from seven and slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Homeowners are now able to deduct mortgage interest on loans up to $1 million. Under the proposal announced on Thursday, that cap would drop to $500,000 for new mortgages. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which fell as much as 0.5 percent when the tax details were first released, ended the session unchanged, at 2,579.85. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.4 percent, at 23,516.26. The Nasdaq composite was flat, at 6,714.94. Under their tax plan, House Republicans also want to end a program that offers buyers of electric-powered vehicles a tax credit of up to $7,500. Shares of the electric-car maker Tesla, which tumbled in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company announced a larger loss than expected for the third quarter, fell further after details of the tax plan were released on Thursday. Tesla shares closed 6.8 percent lower. Shares of General Motors, which recently announced plans for 20 new all-electric models by 2023, dipped 1.2 percent. But shares of Ford, which has said it plans to add 13 electric vehicles in the near future, increased 0.6 percent. “A lot of what’s in this plan are bargaining positions; we have to see how the final bill morphs as time goes forward,” Steven Blitz, chief United States economist with TS Lombard, said. “There’s a lot of horse trading to come, so an overreaction doesn’t make a lot of sense.” The prospect of business-friendly tax cuts have helped pushed stocks up in recent weeks as the tax bill took shape amid delays and intense debate. Republicans hope to deliver a finished plan to President Trump by Christmas, but will first have to contend with objections from Democrats and special interests. The 10-year Treasury yield was trading at 2.35 percent. Wall Street is also waiting for Mr. Trump to officially nominate Jerome H. Powell as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, an announcement that was scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Mr. Powell, a current Fed governor, would succeed Janet L. Yellen once her term ends in February. In other notable market developments, Newell Brands stock tumbled 27 percent after the company, which owns Rubbermaid, slashed its annual forecasts following a shaky third quarter, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the largest generic drugmaker in the world, lowered its financial outlook for the year on Thursday, sending shares down 20 percent.

"To the Editor: Re “White House Chief’s Remarks on the Civil War Elicit an Angry Response” (news article, Nov. 1): I have taught American history for 27 years at a university, and I open every class with a standard lecture that focuses on the three kinds of history: what actually happened, what we are told happened and what we come to believe happened. This is important because we live in a world in which what people believe happened is all that matters, and trying to get to the facts sadly appears less relevant. John F. Kelly’s assertion that the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War baffled me, and I found myself having to tell my students that it’s this kind of opinion-based knowledge that is reckless, and why we must strive for fact-based knowledge. The facts reveal that much of our early federal history was about political conflict and compromise. The Civil War came about not for lack of an ability to compromise, but rather precisely because of compromise, and those who grew tired of it. STEPHEN D. ENGLE

"FORT BRAGG, N.C. — Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s day of reckoning is fast approaching. A military judge will soon decide his punishment for desertion and endangering the troops who searched for him after he walked off his base in Afghanistan in June 2009. Sergeant Bergdahl pleaded guilty to both charges, and prosecutors have asked the judge to sentence him to 14 years in prison, along with a punitive discharge and reduction in rank. Now that both sides have finished presenting evidence at the sergeant’s two-week sentencing hearing, here are the main takeaways. While he was running for office last year, Mr. Trump called Sergeant Bergdahl a traitor who should be executed, a view he appeared to endorse again on Oct. 16, saying: “I think people have heard my comments in the past.” But Mr. Trump’s apparent disgust and hatred for Sergeant Berdaghl — and his seeming inability to resist talking about him even after Army officials warned the administration, as documents suggest, that doing so could foul up the case — may now work to Sergeant Bergdahl’s advantage. After the president’s latest comments, the sergeant’s lawyers asked the judge to dismiss the case or limit his potential punishment, arguing that Mr. Trump’s statements had prejudiced the case because everyone in the military justice system ultimately reports to the president as commander in chief. The judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, denied that request. But he said he would consider the president’s comments as a mitigating factor when deciding on the sergeant’s sentence. That means Colonel Nance will weigh them along with other evidence presented by both sides at the sentencing hearing, though how much weight he assigns them is anyone’s guess. "
"Last week the venerable Hudson Institute, a think tank founded in the early 1960s by the nuclear game theorist Herman Kahn, invited three speakers to discuss foreign policy. Leon Panetta and David Petraeus, both former C.I.A. directors, fit comfortably in the establishment mold in which Hudson has long operated. Not so the third speaker, Stephen K. Bannon. Donald Trump’s former chief strategist has proudly declared “war” on the Republican Party establishment. And yet that very establishment had laid down the welcome mat to this self-described “Leninist.” The event offers a snapshot of the dilemma facing conservative think tanks in the era of Trump: How much should they engage not just with this administration, but with the increasingly powerful Bannon wing of the Republican Party? Think tanks are chiefly supposed to provide independent expertise to policymakers. But they also seek to be politically relevant. To be relevant, you need access. And, of course, they also must answer to well-heeled donors, like the Mercer family, whose political loyalties are sometimes vehemently pro-Trump. This reality leaves these institutions with an uncomfortable choice: fellow-travel with Mr. Trump or let the Trump train pass your station and risk diminishing influence in a Washington where he is boss. In the past two weeks, I spoke to more than a dozen employees and former employees of the most well-respected think tanks on the center-right: the Manhattan Institute, known for its expertise on local and state policies; the Hudson Institute, the home of foreign-policy heavyweights like David Satter and Walter Russell Mead; the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where researchers are largely focused on Iran, North Korea and terrorism; and the American Enterprise Institute, which defends classical liberalism and free markets.

"WASHINGTON — Democrats from the House Oversight Committee, stonewalled by the Trump administration and fuming at their Republican colleagues, sued the General Services Administration on Thursday to try to force the release of documents relating to its lease with the Trump International Hotel here. The suit, which has little legal precedent, is likely to be a key test of Democrats’ ability to force oversight of the Trump administration without control of committees or subpoena power in either chamber of Congress. They have accused Republicans who control both of neglecting their responsibility to hold the administration to account. A victory in court would grant the lawmakers immediate access to government documents related to the hotel’s operations and lease that they say would shed light on its finances, possible foreign payments to the hotel and the G.S.A.’s ruling that the hotel did not violate the terms of its lease when President Trump took office. A favorable ruling would also open a fruitful avenue for Oversight Committee Democrats to use on other issues. “The lawsuit is not just about a hotel in Washington, D.C.,” Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said at a news conference on Thursday. “This is about the president defying a federal statute and denying our ability as members of Congress to fulfill our constitutional duty to serve as a check on the executive branch.” Mr. Cummings was joined in the suit, filed in United States District Court here, by 16 other Democrats on the committee. A spokeswoman for the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, said he had no immediate comment. A spokeswoman for the G.S.A. said the agency did not comment on pending litigation. "
"A day after President Trump threatened to send the suspect in the Manhattan truck attack to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday said the administration would “use all lawful tools at our disposal,” including the federal courts and military system, to prosecute terrorism suspects. He also touted the Justice Department’s recent terrorism prosecutions, remarks that may not have been notable if Mr. Trump had not, a day earlier, denounced the American criminal justice system as “a joke” and “a laughingstock.” Mr. Sessions’s remarks on Guantánamo Bay reiterated a long-held position in favor of continuing to detain terrorism suspects without trial there and to prosecute some before a military commission. He said earlier this year that he would advise Mr. Trump to send newly captured terrorism suspects to the wartime prison, which he called a “very fine place,” rather than to bring them to civilian court for prosecution by the Justice Department he runs. But his comments took on new urgency when Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he was open to transferring the Manhattan truck attack suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, 29, from civilian courts into the military system set up for foreign terrorists. A short time later, just more than 24 hours after the attack, federal prosecutors filed charges accusing Mr. Saipov of being inspired by Islamic State propaganda videos to carry out the plot and of timing it to inflict maximum damage. By Thursday morning, the president backed off his threat to send Mr. Saipov to the military prison. He once again called for Mr. Saipov to be executed, a public intervention that could make it more difficult for prosecutors to secure a capital punishment in any future trial. “Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantánamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!” "
"THE SEQUOIA DRESS from the New York-based independent fashion label Creatures of Comfort is not the kind of garment one might refer to as “sexy.” Dun-colored, ankle-lengthed, high-necked and voluminous-sleeved, this seemingly innocuous $450 number became an unlikely lightning rod this summer, when the writer and editor Doree Shafrir shared a screenshot of it on Twitter, writing: “Bless everyone who is pretty enough, skinny enough and rich enough to wear this dress.” This rapidly summoned a number of droll, liked-in-the-thousands responses from other women. “Adding this to my Amazon Amishlist,” one wrote; “It’s a party dress! A Donner party dress,” another tweeted; “The sister wives and I all decided to go with turd brown,” added a third. Considering our current moment’s heart-poundingly swift, frequently terrifying news cycle, the Sequoia affair hardly made for the most momentous or enduring story. And yet it touched on a puzzling phenomenon: the significant turn in fashion over the past couple of years toward almost aggressively non-provocative dressing, and the complicated feelings women have about it. To judge from Shafrir’s tweet — and those that came after it — many women would appear to be skeptical of the current vogue for conservative, covered-up fashions. Only those blessed with the privileges money and slim good looks bring, these women seemed to suggest, could get away with wearing a dress that evokes virginal drabness at best and cult-style patriarchal oppression at worst; a dress which, with its sacklike silhouette, looks like a cross between a 1880s homesteading smock and the so-called bankruptcy barrel archetypically worn by old-timey hobos. And still, the look persists, even thrives. This past spring, The New York Times’s chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, declared modest fashion a defining trend of the 2010s, with brands as varied as Céline, with its enveloping, cocoon-like garments, Erdem, with its long-sleeved, high-collared Victoriana dresses, and Vetements, with its almost comically outsize getups, all promoting the look. As Friedman argued, in a vulnerable, volatile time — perhaps one particularly so for women — figure-obscuring clothing serves as a kind of armor, as well as a retort to a reality-TV-inured culture apparently intent on exposing any private moment, any intimate body part, for public consumption. Once we’ve seen it all — from Emily Ratajkowski’s fabulous breasts to Kim Kardashian’s monumental butt — it now seems as if the most radical gesture could only involve donning a baggy jumpsuit or a generously cut midi-skirt. This is a look not seen only on the runways. It’s there in the television adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian but all-too-timely “The Handmaid’s Tale,” where the long red gowns and severe white bonnets worn by the show’s subjugated women serve as visual markers of oppression, while also managing to appear suddenly, disconcertingly fashion. (Indeed, the young American label Vaquera produced a special collection early this summer, inspired by the show’s costumes, which Katy Perry called “very retro pilgrim” in her MTV Video Music Awards opening monologue this August.) It’s in the recent movie “Ingrid Goes West,” where the height of contemporary California style is embodied by Instagram influencer Taylor Sloane (played by Elizabeth Olsen), with her figure-blurring linen shifts and long, rich-hippie skirts; it’s in many of Solange’s recent outfits (the Thom Browne puffer coat the singer wore to the 2017 Met gala, or the long-sleeved turtleneck and high-waisted pleated pants she performed in at Glastonbury this year); and it’s in the prairie-chic togs found in any collection from, say, Rachel Comey (the independent New York label whose patrons, as a fashion-forward friend of mine tweeted recently, could very easily be mistaken for worshipers emerging from a “cool church”). Modest fashion might come across as a humblebrag: You have to be a pretty stylish, pretty good-looking woman to claim ownership of such radical dowdiness. (The style seems especially popular among women in their 20s and 30s — trumping the received wisdom that one should flaunt one’s body before it is marked by the supposed scourges of childbearing or menopause.) It can also sometimes seem like an elitist project of sociocultural self-positioning: By embracing the covered-up look, you declare yourself part of a particular psychographic tribe, one whose members don’t just dress for other women, but for a particular subset of other women — those who get it, who are sophisticated enough to understand that opting out of conventional beauty standards makes for its own kind of conceptual, better-than-thou fashion. It also, however, has the feel of a real dare. Observing this version of feminist signaling, which conflates the rebel, haphazard spirit of a Bloomsbury Group-like smockishness with traces of early ’90s grunge and a dash of post-bellum Sunday best, we might begin to ask ourselves: What happens when women start dressing in ways that are less than conventionally flattering? Why are they doing it? And what does it look like when fashion choices that might have been linked to female oppression perform in the service of liberation? "
"Perhaps not surprisingly, President Trump seemed to treat the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve — arguably the most important personnel decision he has faced — a bit like a season of “The Bachelor,” dangling tantalizing hints before handing the rose to Jerome H. Powell. In doing so, Mr. Trump, more surprisingly, picked by far the better suited of his two semipublic finalists. That’s because Mr. Powell, a current member of the Federal Reserve Board, resides firmly in the camp of supporters of the Fed’s policy of maintaining its low interest policy as long as inflation stays muted and wage increases remain stubbornly small. The other candidate — the economist John B. Taylor, the reported choice of Vice President Mike Pence and other hard-line conservatives — is openly hawkish, having warned for years that the central bank’s easy money policy was stoking future inflation. Most prominently, in November 2010, Mr. Taylor was among 24 signatories to an open letter to Ben Bernanke, then the chairman, attacking a signature aspect of the Fed’s efforts to stimulate a sluggish economy, its “quantitative easing” program of purchasing debt in the market to keep interest rates low. These purchases “risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed’s objective of promoting employment,” the group wrote. "
"WASHINGTON — A former Trump campaign aide dropped out of the running on Thursday for a senior position at the Department of Agriculture three days after his name was tied to a former campaign foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. over his contacts with Russia. The campaign aide, Sam Clovis, told President Trump that he decided to withdraw from consideration to be the chief scientist at the Department of Agriculture, the White House said. “The political climate inside Washington has made it impossible for me to receive balanced and fair consideration for this position,” Mr. Clovis wrote in a letter on Wednesday to Mr. Trump. Mr. Clovis’s qualifications to be the chief scientist at the department have been questioned, as he is not a scientist himself. “The relentless assaults on you and your team seem to be a blood sport that only increases in intensity each day.” Mr. Clovis’s request to drop out of consideration is the latest blow to the Trump administration that for months has been dogged by the special counsel investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Clovis, an early campaign adviser, has met with the special counsel’s team. On Monday, it was disclosed that Mr. Clovis discussed the Trump campaign’s priorities for relations with Russia with the foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last month to lying to the F.B.I. about his communications with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to interviews and court papers. Mr. Clovis was among the Trump campaign officials who knew that Mr. Papadopoulos was developing contacts in Moscow and trying to to arrange a meeting for Mr. Trump in Russia. "
"Jerome H. Powell will come to the chairman’s job at the Federal Reserve with a wide-ranging résumé. He has worked in investment banking, in law and in government as an under secretary in the Treasury Department. He would also be one of the wealthiest individuals to lead the Fed, thanks to his years in private equity. One thing he’s missing: He would be the first Fed chief in more than four decades who did not have an economics degree. Mr. Powell, 64, was born in Washington, the son of a lawyer, and studied politics at Princeton University. He earned a law degree from Georgetown University, where he was editor in chief of the Georgetown Law Journal. After working a few years as a lawyer, he embarked in 1984 on a career in investment banking, starting at Dillon, Read and Company in New York. A year later, he married Elissa Leonard, a filmmaker. They have three children. In 1990, during first President George Bush’s term, he moved back to Washington to become the Treasury Department’s under secretary for finance. The Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, had been chairman of Dillon Read. Mr. Powell was responsible for policy on financial institutions and the Treasury debt market. After Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Mr. Powell joined Bankers Trust, but decided to leave a couple of years later after several clients suffered large losses as a result of derivative deals they did with the bank.

"GREENWICH, Conn. — In a stately home set back on one of this town’s wandering roads lined with mansions and shaded by a canopy of trees, the women formed a circle around a dining room table and introduced themselves to their neighbors as political newcomers, asking for their vote. There was a stay-at-home mom, a media and technology consultant and a businesswoman whose career included manufacturing men’s swimsuits designed to prevent chafing, all describing their involvement in town politics as a relatively recent development. A retired public-school teacher said, simply, “I just can’t be a bystander anymore.” The women are part of a sudden surge in interest in seats on the council that handles town business, having collected the 25 signatures needed to join the ballot. The swell of candidates, most of whom are women, has created competition in a race where there is often none and stirred controversy in a process that has a reputation for being staid. A so-called Trump effect has drawn some of them in, with disappointment over the presidential election fueling a desire to become more civically engaged. For others, it has been issues closer to home that ignited their interest — public education and concern over town spending, among them. But the unusual infusion of political neophytes has set off a tempest, stoking fears of a bitter partisan debate on national issues infiltrating the business of running the town and provoking some incendiary reactions. One well-known blogger in town who describes himself as a “pot stirrer” published a widely shared post in which he labeled some of the newcomers as “angry women, all suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.” “It’s a very unusual thing,” Lucy B. Krasnor, a longtime member of the council, known as the Representative Town Meeting, said of the campaign. “But we’re living in very unusual times.” "
"When it comes to dinner parties, the conversation is one thing that can’t be set up in advance. But that doesn’t mean you can’t be prepared. With the holiday season imminent, we asked Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download,” for some dos and don’ts on how to spark memorable conversation during your dinner party. These tips are part of the magazine’s latest food issue all about the art of the dinner party. Check it out for more inspiration and recipes to help you host your own dinner parties this season. Small talk gives guests a chance to get to know one another, and to take one another’s measure, before the conversation turns to weightier matters — e.g., sex, the lonely meaninglessness of existence and Trump’s latest tweet. It’s like stretching before a jog. Don’t leave some guests nodding their heads and pretending they know what’s going on. Often, clarification is required. If a guest is mumbling, restate a phrase for people who couldn’t hear what was said. If a guest makes an inside joke, go ahead and laugh — and then put it in context for everyone. The sad truth is, no one cares what you have to say; they care about what they have to say. Deep down, people want to feel they’ve been heard. They will if you let them talk. "
"Republicans’ botched pitch for tax cuts could cost them dearly. Their revised plan, disclosed on Thursday, deals only partly with earlier criticism that it benefits the rich. And the chief lieutenants responsible for selling it to the public for the White House, Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, have fumbled their way through their own script. G.O.P. House leaders have, at least, ditched the idea of scrapping the top rate of tax of nearly 40 percent, for the highest earners. But they’re cutting to 25 percent the rate for so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships. Many wealthy people, including President Trump and some members of his cabinet, have made liberal use of these. And they’re doubling the estate tax exemption and then repealing the tax over the next six years. In September, Mr. Trump claimed this so-called death tax would “protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer.” Yet it affects only about 0.2 percent of the population — ultra-wealthy families, in other words. Its repeal would save Trump’s family and the offspring of rich cabinet members billions of dollars, Democrats argue. Comments made by Trump administration officials are not helping. Mr. Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, claimed in September that the typical American family earns $100,000 a year. He’s vastly overstating it: The median annual American household income in 2016 was about $59,000. The Pew Research Center tallies an annual middle-class income as low as $40,000, depending on where you live. Mr. Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, listed at least $250 million in assets in his financial disclosure. Mr. Mnuchin, another Goldman alumnus, has also garbled his tax message. After saying for months that the wealthy would not get a tax cut, he recently changed his tune. He told the website Politico that it was difficult to avoid giving a break to the rich because “the top 20 percent pay 95 percent of the taxes.” It’s actually more like the top 50 percent of earners. His own wealth presents a conflict of interest, too: He reported about $500 million in assets in financial disclosures. Such abysmal marketing is already falling flat with voters: Only 25 percent of Americans like the plan and just 14 percent believe they will get a tax cut, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll. If that translates into problems pushing the cuts through Congress, it will put the Trump administration’s goals of sustained 3 percent economic growth and rising wages in jeopardy. That would be a dismal failure going into an election year. "
"WASHINGTON — The House Republican tax bill is a clear windfall for corporate America and a roll of the dice for the middle-class families that President Trump promised would be the centerpiece of his economic agenda. Early projections suggest the bill would cut taxes for an average middle-class family. But the typical cut could be relatively modest, compared with the benefits for businesses and high earners. More important, the myriad changes in the code would actually raise taxes on nearly 13 million tax filers who earn $100,000 a year or less, according to preliminary calculations using the open-source economic modeling software TaxBrain. Those changes also include limits on, or the elimination of, what might be called tax breaks for middle-class aspirers. The bill would no longer allow Americans to deduct interest on student loans they took out to attend college. It would limit mortgage interest deductions to $500,000 on newly purchased homes, a provision that would hit middle-class teachers or office workers looking to buy starter houses in high-priced, economically vibrant areas such as New York City and Silicon Valley. One of the bill’s biggest lifts to working families would vanish after five years — though Republicans would certainly push to extend it — and another would be diluted by the bill’s changes to how the tax code calculates inflation. It is difficult to see those provisions as the unambiguous gift to American workers — the “major, major tax cut,” in the words of Mr. Trump — that Republicans promised. Instead, the bill effectively asks those workers to put their faith in a sort of bank-shot theory of income growth, where corporate tax cuts turn into profits that are passed on to workers in the form of higher wages. If those benefits do not accrue, many workers could face higher taxes while companies keep their savings or pass them on to shareholders in the form of higher dividends. "
"When I tell people that I was born in Uzbekistan, they usually say I am the first Uzbek-American they have ever met. Just as often, they admit they can’t even name a single Uzbek. I worry that the horrific terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday by Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek native, has changed that for the worse. President Trump placed blame for the attack on the State Department’s “diversity lottery” visa program, through which Mr. Saipov entered this country, and he called for its end. The lottery has few preconditions, but applicants must come from countries with little immigration to America. It would be a shame to eliminate it. The program has allowed my family and countless other immigrants to thrive. Moreover, such a craven move would mean America loses a chance to fight extremism across the world by defining its values on its own terms rather than letting its enemies do so. I was only 2 years old when my family started a new life in an Atlanta suburb. Our household was quintessentially American, reflecting a hodgepodge of cultures. Like many other boys, I loved nothing more than playing in Saturday afternoon baseball games at our local park and waking up early on Sundays for extra batting practice with my dad. But kids also belittled and taunted me, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks, because of my Muslim-sounding name. I kept this to myself, which nearly two-thirds of children who are bullied also do. I had always wanted to be a college baseball player and was thrilled when recruiters from Oberlin College in Ohio came knocking. I was a student-athlete there and achieved the most coveted prize among immigrants: an American college education. Through hard work and more than a little bit of luck, I was awarded the Rhodes Scholarship and I’m in my last year of graduate study at the University of Oxford. My parents laid the foundation for my success. They have dedicated their lives to public service, spending a vast majority of their careers, absent a few years when they were learning English, working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2015, they even traveled to Sierra Leone, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, to help slow the spread of the virus. "
"Within hours after the American public found out that his most senior campaign official was under an indictment that described him as a secret agent of Russian interests, President Trump declared on Twitter: “There is NO COLLUSION!” A forceful statement if there ever was one. But what exactly was he denying so categorically? We have no idea. For one reason or another, “collusion” has become the term of choice for discussing what the Trump campaign may or may not have done with Russians. Those in the Trump camp use it regularly: “I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,” Jared Kushner told Congress this summer. “I did not collude with any foreign government,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “I deeply resent any allegation that I would collude with the oppressive Russian state,” the Republican strategist Roger Stone harrumphed. It isn’t just those in the Trump camp, though, who have settled on using this word. Among the first to refer to collusion was John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, who raised the specter on “Meet the Press”: “I would argue that there’s very, it’s very much unknown whether there was collusion.” In that same week, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said of Trump campaign connections to WikiLeaks, “So there is collusion there, clearly.” The term has been a touchstone ever since. Mr. Trump and his inner circle have benefited enormously from this coalescing around the word “collusion” — a term with a legalistic feel but with close to “no legal meaning whatsoever” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and now a defense lawyer who has written a dissection of every public statement that a Trump associate has made to congressional investigators. If we care about the law — and about holding public figures accountable for their false denials — the impassioned disavowals of collusion by members of the Trump circle mean nothing. Donald Trump Jr.’s utterances to Congress, for example, were “not denying that he committed a crime,” Mr. Mariotti said. “Whether his denial is broader or more narrow than that depends on what exactly is meant by ‘collude’ in this statement — which we don’t know.” What might the term “collusion” actually mean? Mr. Mariotti and I may disagree on a small technicality; it does have some legal meaning. It is found in one place in the federal code, in the area of antitrust law, concerning practices such as price-fixing. But that’s no help. To transpose the antitrust framework onto issues of election interference would require metaphor gymnastics. "
"WASHINGTON — Standing before reporters in February, President Trump said unequivocally that he knew of nobody from his campaign who was in contact with Russians during the election. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has told the Senate the same thing. Court documents unsealed this week cast doubt on both statements and raised the possibility that Mr. Sessions could be called back to Congress for further questioning. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, unsealed his first charges Monday in a wide-ranging investigation into Russian attempts to disrupt the presidential election and whether anyone close to Mr. Trump was involved. Records in that case show that George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser, had frequent discussions with Russians in 2016 and trumpeted his connections in front of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions. For months, journalists have revealed evidence that associates of Mr. Trump met with Russians during the campaign and the presidential transition. But the court documents represent the first concrete evidence that Mr. Trump was personally told about ties between a campaign adviser and Russian officials. At a March 31, 2016, meeting between Mr. Trump and his foreign policy team, Mr. Papadopoulos introduced himself and said “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin,” according to court records. “He went into the pitch right away,” said J. D. Gordon, a campaign adviser who attended the meeting. “He said he had a friend in London, the Russian ambassador, who could help set up a meeting with Putin.” "

"To the Editor: Re “After Terrorism, Presidential Posturing” (editorial, Nov. 2): The editorial board rightly condemned President Trump’s use of the tragic terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan as an opportunity to launch a baseless assault on the American criminal justice system and a sitting senator. Against the backdrop of Russian efforts to influence our electoral process and further fracture our country along cultural and political fault lines, and attacks by terrorists seeking to shake the American psyche and undermine confidence in our government, one has to ask: Why does Mr. Trump launch unfounded attacks that aid our enemies in their efforts to sow dissension and discord? More important, when will the American people come together and say enough is enough? The greatest long-term threat to this country is not a physical attack on our people but an internal assault on our institutions that undermines our system of governance. MICHAEL CURRY, AUSTIN, TEX. To the Editor: It is infuriating to hear about yet another terrorist attack claiming the lives of innocent people. My deepest condolences go to the victims and their families. As a Muslim, I find it very demoralizing to see these types of attacks being associated with my faith. I find it utterly disgusting that a terrorist organization has succeeded in influencing so many individuals to commit such atrocities. As an Ahmadi Muslim, I will continue to categorically condemn these attacks. And it is important that other Muslim communities around the world also collectively speak out against toxic ideologies that shed the blood of the innocent. FASIH MALIK, CALGARY, ALBERTA To the Editor: Sayfullo Saipov came to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010. Like most immigrants he sought a better life. Did our immigration policy fail us, as President Trump asserts? Did we admit a sleeper agent, calmly preparing to wreak havoc some seven years later? "
"SAN FRANCISCO — After years of trying unsuccessfully to build a social network to rival Facebook, Google finally got something out of all of its failures: cover. Members of Congress grilled the executives of Google, Facebook and Twitter this week in a trio of hearings focused on the role that social media played in advancing a Russian disinformation campaign before the 2016 election. Google’s representative at two of the hearings, Kent Walker, the company’s general counsel, made a point of distinguishing the search giant from its internet brethren. Repeatedly and unequivocally, he answered questions at the hearings by saying, “We’re not a social network.” Tech companies have taken a pounding in the court of public opinion in recent months. In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week’s congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry’s growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling. “Without sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,” said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. “The people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they’ve designed.” Not surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry’s biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don’t blame us. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company’s technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them.

"Update, Feb. 2018: This lesson plan was created to accompany a student challenge we ran in 2017 that invited teenagers to explore their relationships with news. The results of that challenge have now been published, and can be found here: 10 Things We Learned About Teenagers and the News: The Results of Our Student ‘News Diet’ Challenge . _________ A May 2017 Times article, “Trying Not to Drown in a Flood of Major Breaking News,” begins: That was six months ago, and the pace this fall has been even more relentless: Political news vied for the front page with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the earthquake in Mexico, nuclear threats from North Korea, the Las Vegas shootings, the attack in Manhattan and more. Add to that the problem of “fake news,” and we certainly understand why anyone might simply want to ignore current events entirely. But in a connected world, information comes at us constantly, whether we choose it or not, and we must each figure out a way to navigate it. Not for a school assignment, but for our real lives. So we’ve proposed an experiment. We’re running a challenge that invites students to think deeply about their own relationships with news, and devise personal “news diets” that work for them. It runs from Nov. 2 to Dec. 22, 2017, and any teenager anywhere in the world can participate. The challenge has three steps: 1. Do a personal “news audit” to observe the role of news in their lives right now. 2. Experiment with their “news diets” in some way to find new sources that address any lacks they found. 3. Write a short essay or produce a short video that reflects on the process and what they learned. What did they discover about their news habits before and after they did the challenge — and what can they say about the role of news in their lives in general? "
"WASHINGTON — Veterans of previous efforts to rewrite the tax code warn that overhauling the tax code is hard because it creates winners and losers — and the losers fight harder than the winners to make sure the legislation fails. The tax plan released by House Republicans on Thursday did not disappoint, cutting taxes and erasing popular deductions in ways that would reorient big chunks of the American economy. The bill loses revenue in some areas and raises it in others, and those are where the battle lines will be drawn in the coming weeks, as members of Congress scramble pass a law that President Trump wants to sign by Christmas. Slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would be a boon to firms that for years have complained of being shackled by high taxes. It remains to be seen if the benefits of this lower rate would be felt more by shareholders or workers. In selling the plan, Republicans have said that employees of companies would see their salaries rise because of a lower corporate tax rate. “Anything that brings down corporate tax rates in the right way here in the United States would be helpful,” Kevin P. Clark, chief executive of Delphi Automotive, said on the company’s third quarter earnings call. American multinational companies fare well under the plan, which calls for shifting toward a more territorial tax system, albeit with caveats. The plan levies a 10 percent global minimum tax on overseas earnings, but that’s still far below the current 35 percent they need to pay on income that’s returned home. In theory, the new system will reduce the “lockout” effect that encourages firms to stash cash abroad. "

"A week ago, reporters and editors in the combined newsroom of DNAinfo and Gothamist, two of New York City’s leading digital purveyors of local news, celebrated victory in their vote to join a union. On Thursday, they lost their jobs, as Joe Ricketts, the billionaire founder of TD Ameritrade who owned the sites, shut them down. At 5 p.m., a post by Mr. Ricketts went up on the sites announcing the decision. He praised them for reporting “tens of thousands of stories that have informed, impacted and inspired millions of people.” But he added, “DNAinfo is, at the end of the day, a business, and businesses need to be economically successful if they are to endure.” All other articles promptly vanished from the sites; an official at DNAinfo said they would be archived online. Mr. Ricketts wrote that he founded DNAinfo in 2009 “because I believe people care deeply about the things that happen where they live and work,” and he thought he could build “a large and loyal audience that advertisers would want to reach.” DNAinfo and Gothamist, which Mr. Ricketts bought in the spring, attracted more than 9 million readers a month, in New York and other cities where they operate satellite sites, DNAinfo said. But in the financially daunting era of digital journalism, there has been no tougher nut to crack than making local news profitable, a lesson Mr. Ricketts, who lost money every month of DNAinfo’s existence, is just the latest to learn. In New York City, the nation’s biggest media market, established organizations such as The Village Voice, The Wall Street Journal and The Daily News have slashed staff or withdrawn from street-level reporting.

"At the Waldorf Astoria, she caught glimpses of Donald J. Trump, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. That’s to name just a few of the politicians Regina Gatewood spotted in her 16 years as a banquet waitress at the Waldorf, on Park Avenue in Manhattan. One time, Phillip C. McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, asked her for directions to the restroom. “I feel like I know you,” she recalled telling him. “And he said, ‘You do know me.’” Ms. Gatewood has come far since her mid-30s, when she entered New York City’s shelter system with her two sons after their father left. She worked long hours as a waitress and in temporary jobs until she could afford public housing, and eventually her own home on Staten Island. She started at the Waldorf in 2000 and worked her way up, becoming a full-time employee in 2010. “I never thought about retiring,” Ms. Gatewood, 62, said. “I thought I would die in the Jade Room.” But when the luxury hotel closed its doors on March 1 for years of renovations, Ms. Gatewood found herself without a job, along with more than 1,200 unionized hotel employees. Although they had known the closing was coming, Ms. Gatewood said, there was still an atmosphere of disbelief. Her work at the Waldorf was highly specialized — waiters served in pairs and did not use a computer-ordering system — and Ms. Gatewood worried such specialization would make it difficult for her to find employment elsewhere.

"Q: You mentioned that having the state fully fund its share of school spending is your main way to address property tax relief, but that’s a $9 billion commitment. How do you get to that? A: Well It’s nine billion dollars cumulatively over eight years, so it’s a six to seven hundred million dollars we’re going to come up with. Q. Where will that money come from? A. It’s a combination of three things. One is looking at the priorities of the $35 billion that we’re already spending. You know, Christie miraculously came up with 200 million bucks to fund this opioid thing. He’s not saying from where, but he’s taken from Peter to pay Paul. And I’m not saying that’s necessarily a bad thing, but the fact of the matter is, you can make decisions within the budget already. Secondly, the very wealthiest, the big corporations have had loopholes, hedge funds have loopholes, they’ve had a really good ride. We’re going to tighten up, to do some good housekeeping. By the way, we’re hardly George Washington on this. I think 28 or 30 states have done it. The carried interest loophole is the most egregious loophole on the tax books, and if they’re not going to close it federally, we’re going to close it. Closing the out-of-network health care loophole. You add a bunch of those things up, it gets to $1.3 billion. And then we’ve got to grow again. We haven’t grown.

"With their new bill that would slash taxes on the wealthy and blow up the federal budget deficit, House Republicans and President Trump are making it absolutely clear whom they are working for — the top 1 percent — and whom they consider dispensable. Well, that’s pretty much everybody else. The bill, which House leaders unveiled on Thursday after weeks of back-room negotiations that only Republicans were privy to, contained multibillion-dollar gifts for corporations, Wall Street titans and rich families. While there are a few peanuts thrown at lower-income and middle-class families, many people of modest means who take advantage of deductions and credits for things like housing, state and local taxes, medical expenses and education costs could end up paying more in taxes. At the same time, the bill would add $1.51 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade. In coming years, Republicans will surely point to that inflated debt to argue that it is imperative that Congress slash spending on infrastructure, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Where to begin? The primary goal of this bill is to slash taxes on corporate profits to 20 percent, from 35 percent. Mr. Trump’s minions in the White House and Congress are mouthing the same old stale arguments: that businesses will take the money saved on taxes and hire more people and hand it over to employees in raises and bonuses. If only. Credible economists believe the benefits of the cuts would accrue nearly exclusively to shareholders and executives. In fact, about $70 billion a year, or 35 percent of the benefits, would flow to foreign investors who own shares in American companies, according to Steven Rosenthal at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The bill would also lavish benefits on real estate partnerships, hedge funds and other pass-through businesses, which send their profits directly to their owners without taxes being withheld. Republicans want those business owners to pay taxes of just 25 percent on that income, rather than ordinary rates, which go up to 39.6 percent. Republicans argue that this will benefit small businesses. In fact, a large majority of small-business owners already have personal tax rates below 25 percent. This provision would aid a small group of developers, investors and other tycoons who work in professions or industries where it is relatively easy to set up pass-through businesses. Like, yes, Mr. Trump and his family, who make their money from one such industry: real estate. Let’s not forget that Mr. Trump has not released his tax returns, something every other major-party presidential nominee has done for nearly 40 years. "
